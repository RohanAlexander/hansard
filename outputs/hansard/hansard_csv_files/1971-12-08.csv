Aid to Pakistani Refugees ition: To the Honourable the Speaker and. Members of bled. The humble peiition of cilizens of Australia respectfidly showeth: 1. It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the welfare of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India. Also they are equally concerned about the desperate plight of millions of displaced persons in East Pakistan, many of whom are worse off than the refugees, as they are not even receiving relief supplies. The involvement of education the Australian is evidenced by their willingness lo contribute substantial funds to voluntary agencies, to assist their work in these countries. 2. As some twenty million refugees and displaced persons are today facing acute problems of hunger and privation-nutritio n and child family problems-ultimat e famine and death on an unprecedented scale-the Commonwealth Government must plan to come to their assistance in a more sacrificial way. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that in tackling these great human problems in Bengal, by far Ihe greatest this century, the House of Represeniiatves in Parliament assembled, will request that a special meeting of Cabinet be called to provide $10m for relief purposes in India and East Pakistan, and a further $50m over three years lo help rehabilitale the refugees in East Pakistan.

That the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2603 XXIV A (December 1969) declares that the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which Australia has ratified, prohibits the use in international armed conflict of any chemical agents of warfare-chemica l substances whether gaseous, liquid or solidemployed for their direct toxic effects on man, animals or plants: 2. That the World Health Organisation Report (January 1970) confirms the above definition of chemical agents of warfare; 3. That the Austrahan Government does not accept this definition, but holds that the Geneva Protocol does not prevent the use in war of certain toxic chemical substances in the form of herbicides, defoliants and 'riot control' agents. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray1. That the Parliament take note of the consensus of international political, sciendfic and humanitarian opinion; and 2. That honourable members urge upon the Government the desirability of revising its interpretation of the Geneva Protocol, and declaring that it regards all chemical substances employed for their toxic effects on man, animals or plants as being included in the prohibitions laid down, by that Protocol.

I think it is easier to ask a simple question if I make this preface. ing to get questions and answers shorter than statements.

I have not personally seen a copy of the telegram. I understand from my departmental head that a copy has been delivered to the Department and that it is a long telegram. I have asked my departmental officers whether there is anything in the telegram which would indicate to them that there was anything incorrect in what I said yesterday in answer to the honourable member for Lang. I have been assured by my Department that everything I said in my answer yesterday is correct. I am interested to have a look at the telegram but, as I say, I have not seen it at this point. tion been drawn to a recommendation by the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce that there should be a meeting of top businessmen and union leaders with the Government not only to study a prices-incomes policy but also to explore other alternatives to boost the economy? If so, would he indicate to the House his reaction to this ter for Repatriation: Why has the allowance recommendation? this particular suggestion. The honourable member made 3 points in his question. The first, related to an income-prices policy; the second concerned providing a boost to the economy; and the third was directed to a suggested meeting between the Government, unions and industry. 1 should like to deal with these points successively. A prices-income policy, of course, is not something that boosts an economy. On the contrary it is seen as something which is an addition to the armoury for fighting inflation. As to whether it is an effective and the best means of doing it is a matter for debate. RecentlyI made a quite longish address which dealt quite exhaustively with the 3 elements of an incomes-prices policy -firstly , the period for which it would operate, secondly, the matters it would thirdly, the method of enforcement, as to whether it was voluntary or compulsory or in the ground in between. Those are the matters which should be studied by those who advocate an incomes-prices policy. I was at pains to point out all the ramifications and difficulties associated with such a policy, and I will make a copy of my remarks available to the honourable gentleman. The second point was the question of providing a boost to the economy. Our attitudes on that matter were made very clear in the debate on the Opposition's censure motion last week, and at question time. I will not expand upon them. The third point concerned a meeting between the Government, unions and industry. I do not favour a meeting because the Government has the responsibility for managing the economy and it cannot abrogate that responsibility to any other body. On the other hand, we are anxious and willing and in fact do receive all sorts of representations from industry, unions and commerce generally, and I will be glad to continue to receive them and to give them consideration. payable to incapacitated ex-servicemen",20,Taxation Gift Duty

If this is part of the Government's economy drive, does the iMinister recognise that car operation costs have increased during that period and have not reduced, and that the action taken is imposing hardship on incapacitated ex-servicemen who have already suffered for this country? Has the economy been reached by cutting out the provision for registration, insurance and depreciation and confining it only to running costs? Does the Minister expect these incapacitated exscrvicemen to travel in unregistered vehicles uninsured vehicles or vehicles which are so old that they have no further depreciation value? I know that thc Minister is well aware of this matter since I have seen copies of his correspondence withmember is now giving information. of this year incapacitated ex-servicemen who had to travel to repatriation institutions or other centres for treatment and who were not able to use public transport were paid at thc rate which the honourable gentleman has mentioned. This rate was equivalent to the rate paid to public servants who used their cars practically full time or full time in their occupations. A review of the situation was made and it was decided that it would be more equitable to pay these ex-servicemen at the rate which was received by members of the Public Service who only occasionally used their cars for departmental purposes. It was felt that as eligible ex-servicemen used their cars now tending to turn back to wool. Perhaps only intermittently for departmental treatment purposes, the costs of insurance, regismarket itself is showing some slight tration and general depreciation should not be fully covered, or that an attempt should not be made to cover them fully, as is the case with public servants who receive the higher rate to which the honourable gentleman refers. So it was decided, as a matter of judgement, that it would be fair and equitable to recompense ex-servicemen at the lower rate which is paid to public servants who use their cars only intermittently for departmental purposes. WOGL Mr O'KEEFE-The Minister for Primary Industry no doubt will be aware of Ihe results of yesterday's wool sales which indicated a reduction in the amount of wool being purchased by she Australian Wool Commission. Does the Minister feel that this upturn in price is indicative of a general trend towards increased world wide demand for wool? does not make a summer so the first good sale does not necessarily end the problems of the woo! industry. Bus fortunately it is true that yesterday the Australian Wool Commission bought less wool and the trade bought more wool than has heen so to date throughout this wooi selling reason. There are trends overseas, too. which give one some hope for optimism although there is a long way to go before one can look at the prospects for the wool industry with any measure of equanimity. Ceriainly in Japan and in Europe there are very good signs that the quality of wool which has always ensured, its pre-cniineul place amongst textile fibres still ensures that there is an increased demand. On the o:hcr hand, in Britain and in the United Siates of America, where there have been marked depressive tendencies largely as a result of the introduction of the double knit fabrics, quite a slackening in demand has occurred. It is this as much as anything that is the real depressant in the market al the present time. However, I understand that the fact that the double knits are noi as comfortable or as warm as wool and tend to snag is causing some problems amongst those who arc taking the purchasing decisions at the retail end. Consequently, the wool mills, the top makers and others are this might be part of the reason why the increase in demand. 1 think, however, that the problems are such that wool growers themselves would be foolish were they to be complacent in the prospect that the trend demonstraled yesterday is one which will see wool again restored to the place which it once enjoyed as a major fibre commanding a market at whatever price it could attract and at a level far higher than other fibres.

Is the Minister aware that heavy expenses are being incurred by many people who are required to undergo treatment by a registered physiotherapist on the direction of orthopaedic surgeons and other doctors? Is he aware that the heavy cost of this treatment by registered physiotherapists is not covered by the Government's health scheme, thereby causing considerable nnanciai hardship to a large number of people? Finally, what possible reason could there be for not including in the Commonwealth health scheme as a Commonwealth benefit treatment by registered physiotherapists on the direction of a registered medical practitioner? Dr FORBESI am aware that physiotherapy, like treatment by other paramedical professions, is not included in the medical benefits scheme. As to the substance of the question, I will be glad to refer it to my colleague in another place and ask him to supply the honourable gentleman with an answer. ing that Papua New Guinea is moving towards independence more rapidly than most people imagine and the fact that this will increase the importance of localisation in all possible areas of responsibility, I ask the Minister for the Army: To what extent is the Army of Papua New Guinea localised? I refer, of course to the officers and other ranks. Is he concerned that the Pacific Islands Regiment may develop into an elite in Papua New Guinea particularly in any post-independence situation? part of the question, I can assure the honourable member that the Army is earnestly pursuing a policy of localisation in the Pacific Islands Regiment. I think 1 can give the figures to the House from memory. About 98 per cent of the non-commissioned officer positions in the establishment and 85 per cent of the other rank positions the PIR is being swelled through not only the ranks of the Military Cadet School at Lae-throug h the in-service, commissioning scheme which commenced last year-bu t also through those who have attended the Officer Cadet School at Portsea. Indeed, a further 6 Pacific Islanders will graduate at the end of this week, bringing the number of officers in the PIR who are Pacific Islanders io 34, and a further 11 will attend at Portsea next year. In relation to the second part of the honourable member's question, which perhaps has a more important long term bearing, I would say that, broadly speaking, the Army's attitude in regard to the PIR is twofold. It is, firstly, to develop an efficient Army capable of playing a vital role in the defence of the Territory and, secondly, to provide for the future a well balanced, disciplined and reliable force completely loyal to the Government and the Administration of the Territory. As a consequence, it is necessary that the PIR should not receive purely military training in isolation for we well know the experience of newly emergent countries in other areas of the world. Extensive training and education programmes are required. We are cognisant, in fulfilling our duty in this regard, of the need to ensure that there is liaison with members of the House of Assembly, with the Administration and with villagers in the carrying out of civil affairs projects and the like in an endeavour to ensure potential neutralism. addressed to the appropriate Minister.

Will he also give consideration to the issue of travel warrants to persons seeking employment who live long distances from potential employment? some difficulty in hearing the honourable member's question, which related to a very important issue. Rather than ask the honourable member to repeat it, I will get the context of his question from Hansard and give him a detailed reply. Dr SOLOMON My question is directed to the Minister for Education and Science. Is the Minister aware of the view being put daily to this House fhat scholarships should be awarded on the basis of need rather than academic ability? Does he agree that, whatever its humanitarian motivation, it is a misconception which is anathema to those who believe that ability is society's greatest asset and which, if put into effect, could strike at the very roots of national progress? of the points of view that have been put to this House in recent times. I have been told that a campaign has in fact been organised. I think that it has become the official policy of the National Union of Australian University Students. The Union wants to have a major and substantial change in the basis of assisting students at tertiary institutions, make an announcement about it, and it speaking I think specifically of universities. Of course it would be a very major departure. As I have always understood it, there has been general agreement in the House that scholarships should be awarded in tertiary institutions primarily on the basis of make an announcement about the national merit. Because of tbe greater living allowance for those who have to live away from home and the means test attached to the living allowance an element of need has been taken into account to try to assist the more needy able students. On the other hand the main and primary basis of granting scholarships has been academic ability and I think there would be very real difficulty in a departure from that principle in awarding financial support for those who are seeking entrance to universities or colleges of advanced education. People who have some doubts about whether or not there is a difficulty in this area, need to recall the prime basis of entry into a university and into a college of advanced education must be academic ability. Those with academic ability must be the people who receive support from governments. Hitherto there has been general support, as I have understood it, from the Opposition and thc Government of these particular aspects of the scholarship scheme. It is true that the Opposition always says that each increase in the number of scholarships we provide is not large enough, and the Opposition will also always say that the living allowance provided is not large enough. That is the traditional role of this Opposition at least, and it is understood. But if the Opposition is to come to an acceptance of a quite radical departure in the basis of support for students at universities and colleges, that is something I would have thought would need very serious consideration. Education and Science a question. It is 12 weeks since he gave me a written answer stating that consultations would soon be concluded on a national graduate school of business management and that the Commonwealth would then be in a position to is 9 weeks since he assured me that the remaining State governments intended to table their sectors of the nation-wide survey on educational needs prepared in May last year. I therefore ask him when he will graduate school of business management and when New South Wales and Victoria, the only 2 States still in default, will table their school surveys. I also ask him how many schools fall within the scope of the Commonwealth Secondary Schools Libraries Committee and the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Standards for Science Facilities, and what are the annual administrative costs of these 2 committees.",23,Unemployment Benefit

Speaker, nothing demonstrates the incompetence of this Government to run the country more than the way it handles this House. Privilege takes precedence over everything else. The notice paper carries on the front page 'Privilege to take precedence . Standing order 96 states lhat a 1 matter of privilege at any time arising shall, until disposed of, take precedence. This report has been hanging around for some time. We came into the House today with the understanding that this was a matter to be dealt wilh early today so as to get it out of the road. This matter concerns not only the House but also, of course, the people who have been under consideraiion. I believe that it demonstrates exactly the incompetence of this Government in the way that it handles everything, that we are going to defer the only matter in which, I think, the Parliament takes precedence over the Government. You might say: 'Well, it is only for a few hours'. We do not know how many hours, because day after day the order of the Parliament is continually confused by chance statements from the Government, by the way it handles them, by not having legislation ready, and so on. I just lodge my objection to treating parliamentary matters in this way. Anything that has to do with the Parliament is deferred. Anything that has to do with the pottering of the Government gets thrown into the ring in some ad hoc fashion. Question resolved in the affirmative.

(3.4)-In speaking in support of this motion 1 once again commend the Government for its planning in this area which the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr National Biological Standards Laboratory. Hurtford) has referred to as an undeveloped area. I might add that yesterday 1 noticed a report that Alice Springs is to get a second power station. The Public Works Committee, which is an all-Party Committee, will journey to Darwin before Christmas to look at 2 or 3 more projects. I commend the Chairman and members of that Committee for going up there at this lime and also for the reference to the antipollution measures which will be taken into consideration in the construction of the extensions. The power house is situated on the south-east side of the town and during the winter period the prevailing winds come from the south-cast.

I note that the proposal is for the construction of the first stage of a permanent building complex for the As honourable members well know, brucellosis is a disease which is common in Australia and very common in most parts of Australia which run cattle. The disease is caused by the genus brucella. The3 main types that are known-brucell a abortus, brucella melitensis and brucella suis-affec t cattle, goats, pigs and humans. The one which is most common, brucella abortus, or contagious abortion in animals, has caused tremendous losses in Australia over the years. It is quite right that the national Government should endorse any campaign which will eradicate brucella abortus from the Australian beef and dairy herds as well as the other genes of brucella in pigs, goats and in other animals. One also must support the proposal beings. I can speak as one who has contracted brucella melitensis or multi-fever as it is often called.

84,Mr Calder (Northern Territory),,29,Approval Of Works Publi C Works Committee Act
85,Mr Chipp (Hotham,"Minister for CusCanberra people had the misfortune actuallyin America and Australia. The most common treatment of this disease is by the use of strain 19 vaccine. There have been other treatments developed. This is analogous to a process such as immunisation against small pox. The brucella abortus is apparently the most common of the genus brucella in Australia and it spreads rapidly throughout the herds. It is also important that great care be taken in the selection of colonies for growth and new seed cultures because these must be selected continuously and must be viable. I think one of the things that would have been told to the Committee is that a tremendous waste of money could occur if the culture itself were not viable because the animals would be vaccinated with a dead vaccine. This could cause a loss of money. I assume that one of the major jobs of this laboratory will be to make certain that the organisms of, say, strain 19 vaccine are viable at all times. Any cattleman well knows that this is essential if strain 19 is to be effective against brucella abortus. It is a living virus and because of this, it must be handled with extreme care. AlthoughI have not read the report I assume that it follows exactly the same practices as applies in the United States where there are buffer zones of 1, 2 or 3 walls-whateve r it might be-aroun d the buildings in order that the virus does not get out of those walls because, as I said, the virus affects human beings as well as cattle and other livestock. The Opposition support this proposal as being a positive and a good move for the benefit of the Australian cattle industry and the health of the Australian people in general. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 November (vide page 3422) on motion by Mr Chipp: That the Bill be now read a second time. That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'this House is of opinion that the BiU should be withdrawn and redrafted to deal comprehensively with (a) drug trafficking, drug pushing and This gives an indication of the essential the provision of penalties severe enough to deter these offences and (b) drug abuse and the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts based on the humanitarian approach recommended by. the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse'. It is quite clear from what 1 have already said that the Opposition holds no truck with the traffickers and pedlars of drugs who are out to obtain profit. Where those people are non-addicted and where they are trafficking in drugs which are destructive to people's minds and bodies. My personal opinion, but one which is fairly widespread, is that those traffickers should be locked away for a very long time. However, what concerns the Opposition is the lack of any attention given to the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts anywhere in the proposal before the House. The Opposition criticises this Bill for its exclusive concentration on the punitive aspects. Nowhere do we see any opportunity taken to follow the advice of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse that treatment and rehabilitation of addicts based on humanitarian approaches should be developed in this legislation which the Government is introducing to affect an area of drug trafficking and drug offences in the community. The Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) may well argue that this is not the province of the Department of Customs and Excise or of the Customs Act. However, one could put it to the Government that, given the nature of this problem and the broadness with which it occurs within the community-no t in a narrow area related only to the Customs Department-and given the legislative authority which the Federal Government undoubtedly has, one would have expected a comprehensive approach by the Government. These are points that I want to make as I go along. I stress that a pedlar with a habit-to use the argot of the drug scene-shoul d be seen as a health case rather than as a penal subject. I quote exsuperintendent Milte of the Commonwealth Police Force who gave evidence before the Senate Committee of inquiry on this subject: There are very few instances recorded where traffickers are themselves non-drug users. nature of the problem before us, a nature which has been scarcely touched at all by",29,Approval Of Works Publi C Works Committee Act
86,Mr Hayden (Oxley) (3.12),"I move:the approach of the Minister in the presentation of this Bill. The United States gaols are full of pedlars with a habit and the number is increasing, but there are no "" Mr in the imposition of penalties on pedlars Bigs', or very few ' Mr Bigs' in those prisons and quite clearly the penal approach is a flop. The question I ask is: Is this a proper subject for police and prisons or is it a proper subject for medical authorities and health services? In my opinion it is a proper subject for both but mostly it is a subject for the latter-that is. for medical authorities and health services. I draw a contrast between the situation in the United Kingdom and the situation in the United States of America where the 2 different approaches are in operation, ln thc United Kingdom, the problem is seen essentially as a health one and in the United States it is seen essentially as a criminal one. Using figures in an article by Richard L. Worswop entitled 'Heroin Addiction' produced in May 19 0-thes e are the only figures I can obtain from any source, Libraiy-on e can make a rough calculation that the incidence of drug addiction in the United Kingdom, where this problem is treated as a health one, is about one addict to every 18,500 of population. In the United States, where there is a tremendous armoury of repression behind the legislative powers provided in an effort to control this problem, the incidence is one addict in about 700 to 1,000 of population. On this evidence, it would seem quite clearly that the repressive legislative or penal approach has been a failure in comparison to the more enlightened health approach adopted by the United Kingdom. Here a drug addict is registered and his drug regulated. I suggest that the Minister and his Government have failed badly in not fully adopting the recommendations of the Senate Committee which are contained in page 6 of its report as to penalties, because they go much further than just imposing penalties in a legislative process. The text of the Committee's follows: In ihe terms of the Committee's definitions of trafficker, pusher and pedlar: (i) penalties should be sufficiently severe to deter the drug trafficker and drug pusher; This is a proposition we put to the House. The recommendations continue: (ii) discretion should be granted to the Courts depending upon the degree of their own drug dependence and the profit made by them from peddling; This power may be within the ambit of the Bill but it certainly in no way is expressed by the statements of the Minister, and if one is to take literally his statements outside this House the proposition of the Committee would be contrary to his own views. Quite clearly, one would expect from his comments in the Press that he wants severe penalties imposed rather arbitrarily on all sorts of offenders. The Committee's recommendations continue: (iii) the drug abuser who is a first offender, particularly the young offender, should by bond and probation conditions be given every encouragement to avoid repetition of the offence; This is not dealt with in the Bill. Thc recommendations continue: (iv) (iv) the first offender, successfully completincluding the Parliamentary ing the conditions of bond and probation, should be discharged without an offence being recorded; This also is not dealt with in the Bill. They continue: and (v) the futility of imprisoning the truly drug dependent person should be recognised and that every facility for his medical rehabilitation be afforded; only in extreme cases should a measure of compulsory treatment be enforced . . . On practically all of those scores the proposal before the House is gravely deficient. 1 repeat that the Commonwealth Government does have power to legislate comprehensively on this proposal. It has power because of Australia's signature to the International Single Convention on Narcotic intake officially and carefully Drugs. Provisions within that Convention place an obligation on this country and therefore give power under the Constitution of Auslralia to the Federal Government to legislate comprehensively on the matter of drug offences. In any event it would appear lhat the Government has considerable powers to legislate comprehensively under its trade and commerce powers within the Constitution. My main recommendations is as criticism of the MinisterI think it is probably unfortunate, having spoken to him and gleaned something of his personal feelings on the subject-is that his attitude towards this problem comes out as though he is set on a mission of indiscriminate over-kill. Mostly what one reads in the PressI would go beyond saying 'mostly' and say 'almost exclusively' what one reads in the Press-of his views on this subject reveals that they are fairly sensational; they are roaring, thundering declamations on this problem. speak? heard the Minister speak, but like most members of the public I rely on what is printed in the. Press. He will recollect that I said, having spoken to him, I think that this is probably unfair towards him. But one gets these sorts of sensational statements: Mr Chipp said that once a person is hooked on heroin, they have about 2 years to live. And the last 12 months is indescribable agony. Once the mainline arteries break down, the addict injects the drug into the tongue or eyeball jusl to go on living. That is fairly sensational and on the basis of evidence from overseas it is more damaging than it is helpful. For instance, at page 230 of the report of the Le Dain Commission in Canada it is stated: We have been advised, particularly by the young, that education about drugs will be ineffective unless moralising and patronising attitudes are changed. The facts, we have been told, must be presented with a proper sense of proportion and perspective so that the overall impression conveyed is truthful and realistic. Witnesses have complained that the overall impression is sometimes n distorted or misleading one in which alleged dangers are either overdrawn or understated. It goes on to say: In particular, they have saidReferring to young peoplethat thc attempts to use 'scare tactics' have 'back-fired' and destroyed the credibility of sound information. 1 refer to an address which was given by Health Minister Munro of Canada in Montreal on 22nd May 1969 and in which he refers to statements made by Mr John Ingersoll, the Director of the United States Justice Department's Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to the Committee on Drug Dependence of the National Academy of Science. According to Mr Munro, Mr Ingersoll said: Scare tactics, scare no-one, they merely place government in the position of the boy who cried wolf and therefore could get no-one to believe him when the wolf really came. Canadian Health Minister Munro also added: We in Canada hare been no less guilty than our American counterparts of the indiscriminate overkill which has been effective only in reducing our own credibility,. While the Minister for Customs and Excise is rushing about the country showering these sorts of thundering scare tactics, we find that there are grave deficiencies in the services available to people who have a I have not serious drug problem and who in fact need some sort of service to help them to overcome their problem. They need some sort of treatment centre or rehabilitation centre. It would be more appropriate to pour money into these things, as the Government has the power to do. After all it controls 83 per cent of the public finance raised in this country. Judge Clegg of the Quarter Sessions Appeals Court is on record, in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 7th February 1970. as saying this about drug addicts: Judge Clegg said Barnes He was an addicthad written from gaol to every recognised psychiatric clinic in thc Stale, asking for treatment, but was refused in every case. 'I have some of their replies befoie me and for a variety of reasons they say they cannot help him,' the Judge said. He is reported to have gone on to say: 'I am not prepared to treat him, at the age of 28, as a piece of useless human rubbish to be thrown into the rubbish bin. 'Any treatment in gaol, if given, is useless and a waste of time. From my reading, since then New South Wales has moved to improve the facilities available to treat drug addicts, but that would have been the appropriate timeand now is still the appropriate time-to pour a damn lot more money into the State governments' coffers so that they can clo something constructive in this area. Overwhelmingly the facilities available for the treatment of people who have drug problems are gravely deficient in the States. What has the Minister set about doing in recent months following the report of the Senate Select Committee which dealt with a wide range of propositions, scarcely any of which have been attacked relatively? What he has set about doing is to undertake an education programme. But I wonder how successful relatively education",30,Customs Bill No 2 1971

88,Mr Hayden,"No,programmes are. They have not been too successful, for instance, in the case of the drug nicotine. Money could have been more effectively spent in research, for instance, to establish the ways in which drugs work on the central nervous system, why they work and how they work in order to establish whether neurophysiological activity is accompanied by mental activity. A considerable amount of work is being done overseas to establish whether in fact there are identifiable reward centres in the brain so that people get gratification in a very physical sense, which comes from a definite identifiable area in the brain. If this is established, overseas authorities believe that considerable progress can be made in combating this drug problem. Certainly, it is speculative as to whether they will make this progress, but at least it is worth trying. In this comparative situation of education versus research, I give higher priority to the latter. In this comparative situation we find that $500,000 was set aside for education about drugs in 1970-71, the results of which may be dubious, given the outcome of the campaigns against cigarette smoking. But the Federal Government's expenditure on research in the 5-year period 1967-71-that is an inclusive period-wa s only $26,000. In this area in which we are interested in this debate today, 6 projects have been carried out in 5 years. That represents approximately $5,000 a year or about $4,000 a project. If we are genuinely concerned about these unfortunate people, this is the area in which we should spend money. Last year when I was in Washington f took some time to meet people who were involved in the methadone experiment, and the point they were making is that, because the problem is so enormous, practically all of the money that is being made available has to be quickly absorbed in hotchpotch, hit or miss sorts of programmes and that there is little money left for real basic, speculative and investigatory research. Yet unless substantial money is made available in this area these people gravely fear that without a stroke of outstanding luck they will never really make a worthwhile inroad into this problem. So this is my criticism: In short, the problem concerning drugs in this country is approached haphazardly and sensationally and the priorities seem to be out of line. But I am getting ahead of myself. The question is: What is the problem in Australia? The real problem concerns the frustrated housewife and the jaded husband syndrome rather than the conventionally conceived hard drug junkie. I refer to the housewife who needs an amphetamine to get going in the morning and a barbiturate to put her to sleep in the evening, and in between times probably has slimming drugs and perhaps something to soothe her when she becomes jaded in the course of the day. The husband is probably on a binge on most nights of the week, drinking a quantity of liquor which is regarded as indicating that he has a drink problem. If we can take the research work currently being conducted by Professor Ensell, and other sociologists, we find that anyone who drinks more than 4 beers every night of the week, week in and week out, is a person with a drink problem. On this basis, 50 per cent of males and about 30 per cent of females in Australia have a drink problem. If one is not prepared to accept those levels-and they seem a bit harsh although, perhaps, we are used to a fairly heavy drinking pattern in this community-ther e is the well established pattern, which has been verified by Professor Basil Hetzel, who is in charge of the social and preventive medicine department at the Monash University, in a survey which was carried out at Prahan in Victoria, which shows that on the basis of his parameters, 1 per cent of females and 5 per cent of males in fact have a drink problem. These are areas in which a real drink problem exists. figure higher; he puts it at 258,000 in Australia. area in which a really serious drug problem exists in Australia, and I do not think the Minister would disagree with me. The report of the Senate Select Committee identifies the general problem in Western society as follows: The order of magnitude which could be expected to be found in Western civilisation is 'that for each one person who is affected by opiates there are probably about 10 who are adversely affected by the barbiturates or central nervous system stimulants and about 100 with alcohol'.",32,Customs Bill No 2 1971
89,Mr Chipp,D r Santamaria puts ihe,33,Customs Bill No 2 1971
90,Mr Hayden,"In any case, this is anBut those are the conventional sorts of drugs. We turn a blind eye to them, riot realising how damaging they are in our community and not appreciating, in respect of the damage to the community, the tremendous expense, direct and indirect. For instance, in 1964-65, the cost of alcoholism in Australia was estimated to exceed $740m. 1 am not trying to underplay the serious nature of the narcotic drug problem. There is a developing problem in the community in this respect. AH I am trying to put to the House in the first instance is the need for some type of balanced approach to and some type of rational appreciation of the distribution of this problem in the community. The next point I put to the House is the seeming impossibility of legislating effectively to control this type of drug problem fhat falls outside the area of conventional and accepted drugs. Recently, a Toronto psychopharmacologist was able to identify 583 botanical substances with hallucinogenic action similar to LSD. How can we possibly effectively legislate against this sort of thing? Mr Munro, the Canadian Minister for Health, to whom I referred earlier, said in his speech in reference to thc point that I am now making: Clearly we have passed the point where the ance with respect to the Minister for Custraditional response 'legislate against the subtoms and Excise whom I criticised earlier stance' works. How can we legislate against mushrooms, aeroplane glue, gasolene, nutmeg, for what seemed to be his thunderous cough syrup and the hundreds of other such declamations on this subject. I have seen substances of everyday use? To be effective our him also once or twice-and he is on concern cannot be with x substances but with record in this respect-dealin g with exactly usages and with the motivational factors which influence usage. SoI come to the point of a more constructive approach: What is our aim? The first thing I feel is that when we are talking about this area of drug takingthat is, the non-conventional drugs or the unacceptable ones-w e must identify whom we are talking about. General attitudes in the community would indicate that most people think that we are talking about long-haired hippies who come from universities and who are in their late teens or early 20s. But if we go through the statistics which are provided by the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau in its third task report of March 1971 we get a somewhat different picture from that of the university-type student. We find that 90 per cent are under 30 years of age; 67 per cent are semi-skilled or unskilled; and only 7 per cent are students. The average age is 22.8 years while the average Australian age, [ would guess, is between 31 years and 32 years. AgainI remind the House of the statement which Superintendent Milte made and which I mentioned before: Most of these people who are caught trafficking in fact are people who already have a drug habit. Mostly, I guess from what I have read, it is true that they are people with previous personality predispositions that lead them into these drug problems. They are under-achievers, intelligent people, who are not turned on by the sort of reality which we claim to be the right reality in society. I am saying not that they do not see reality but that they see a different sort of reality to the one that we hold up. They do not accept the type of mores that we try to impose on them, especially our system of material incentives for dull, unexacting, uninteresting labour. They are largely the alienated in our society. In many cases, they see through the sort of sham hypocrisy and phoniness for which we oldies are responsible. I have already quoted the case of our conventional drugs-alcoho l and nicotine. At this point I wish to redress the balthis point. I think that his reference was to the 'lichen spread of the suburbs and the inability of people to communicate with one another in the family group'. If the Minister does mind a little bit of helpful advice from the 'candid friend', I think that he would be more influential with young people if he gave greater emphasis to this side of the drug problem and indicated his Government's views. Party prejudices, Party philosophies or Party commitments should not divide people on this sort of problem because I beheve that in this sort of problem sound grounds exist for a bipartisan approach providing we will accept this comprehensive approach I am urging on behalf of the Opposition to the drug problem in the community. I feel that if he does do this sort of thing he will achieve much more influence with these people. One of the reasons why a number of people have become hooked on the hard drugs-thi s view is put forward quite seriously by a number of authorities-is that they have been told lies about drugs or because they have been misled about drugs by older people, often people who are pretty poorly informed on this subject, but who make claim to some sort of authority on the subject. The report of the Le Dain Commission in Canada, to which I referred a few minutes ago, stressed this point of mistrust among the generations. In several works being carried out in the TJnited States of America, it has been stated explicitly that one of the reasons for the development of this mistrust is that young people find that we are overkilling in our claims on the subject of marihuana. Now, I make it clear that I have although, on the basis of all of the evidence that I have seen, including the report of the Senate Select Committee, marihuana is a less harmful drug than either nicotine or alcohol. But I still have reservations because at this point we do not know enough about marihuana. For instance, a mistake was made many centuries ago when tobacco became fashionable. A serious mistake was made by the people of many countries in the middle of the last century when morphine was so easily available. It could be bought at any drug store without any type of control at all, especially in the United States where a serious problem developed. In the early post-war period, we were told that pethedene did not have the sort of habit forming qualities that morphine had. This was wrong in the case of each of these substances, a serious mistake was made. We could easily make another of those mistakes. I would like to see much more money spent on research to establish one way or the other the qualities of marihuana. But, at this point, much of the overkill which is going on about marihuana is demonstrably wrong. On this basis, many of the younger people feel that we cannot be relied upon. To pick up the thread that I started to develop earlier, I point out that it is being failed. I have supported my argument by argued quite pressingly in the United States today by qualified professionals and not by speoial pleaders that because young people find us so dishonest to this extent 23144/71-Jl-II53 J on marihuana, they are encouraged to believe, especially when they have sociogenic pressures from peer groups, that we are probably telling lies about other drugs. Given the types of problems of young, immature people with their peer group setting and these types of sociogenic pressures, it is quite easy to understand how they are even encouraged and probably challenged through a number of ways into trying harder drugs. Not only we people in this Parliament but also people in the Press and the community generally have to be responsible in the way in which we discuss this problem. In any event, no matter how people progress to these drugs or commence taking them, once they become hooked they are hooked on an expensive habit. reservations about marihuana Sydney 1970 prices suggest that the addict is paying $20 a day for morphine. Probably the price will reach $150, $170 or $180 a week before the end of next year, if one can go on the figures that one sees available. Incidentally, Sydney must be one of the cheapest centres for this drug. I remind thc House that the source of my information is an official one. My figures come from Commonwealth crime statistics. These charges for the drug are reached because the drug is illegal. The whole approach to the drug problem is one of penalisation. An upsurge in serious crime occurs because of people who are trying to feed an expensive habit. Organised crime fattens off the distribution of this drug. Organised crime at the highest level is rarely penetrated because of the difficulties of enforcing law in a democratic and free society. As an example, I quote the situation in New York in 1969. Serious crimes associated with the problems of drug addicts trying to feed their habit-the cost of feeding the habit was an estimated S850m that year-increase d to the extent that theft of property to meet that cost of $850m exceeded $2.6 billion. That is because the fences demand a pretty high commission rate for anything they handle for these unfortunate people. My argument is that criminalising has quoting comparative figures for the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom situation is not a perfect one. Many problems exist tbere too. But one finds oneself in a situation of competing inadequacies between these situations. On the face of the evidence available, the penalising approach of the United States is a dismal failure compared to the approach of the United Kingdom where the problem is treated as a health one and where one does not feel that one is an outcast from society, which by definition is one's position when the problem is treated as a criminal offence. A sick person can still identify with the society in which he lives 1 am not saying that we should dogmatically adopt the United Kingdom approach; I am saying that the need to explore this area and see what can be done to adapt the United Kingdom approach to thc problems in this country and so avoid the problems of organised crime and street crime which have arisen and are worsening in the United States of America, a country which adopts precisely the kind of approaches that we are seeking to introduce through this sort of legislation. We could also look at the possibility of using which are available on the . penalties methadone hydrochloride treatment for imposed at the moment in this field. I do drug addicts. had not realised that. Mr ChippA clinic in Sydney has just $800 fine was imposed for fhe possession started to do that. Minister for Customs and Excise that trafficking.

In the final result there is no easy scale importations of other drugs. Another answer to the hard drug problem, and this chap was released on a bond for drug is probably the most worrying aspect. So trafficking. Another one was fined $200 for one must seek to determine which way of importing. treating it is likely to be the most beneficial, accepting that at this point none indeed compared with the rewards which is the ideal situation. On the evidence I can be gained from drug trafficking.

Bill relates to a very important subject. I listened with interest to the remarks of the den). Unfortunately I was quite at loss at one stage of his speech to understand what he meant regarding the penalties outlined in this Bill. I believe that one of the most positive ways in which to destroy a country is to undermine the mental and physical health of its youth. One could classify drug taking as a declaration of war on a country and I believe that the only way to fight such a problem is to declare, war against it I was interested in reading the statistics not know whether the honourable member for Oxley has seen these statistics.

97,Mr Bonnett (Herbert) (3.44),"Thisoverseas at a cost of $10. If it were imported here it would retail at $1,000. A dose unit of LSD which is manufactured for 20c and sold wholesale for SOc retails at from $8 to $12. I repeat that the original cost of a dose unit is 20c. A pound of heroin which is purchased for $3,000 overseas would sell wholesale in Australia for $20,000. By adding milk, sugar and caffeine to it one can double the quantity and get 2 lb of heroin. That2 lb of heroin could be sold in doses at a net profit of approximately $100,000. Thefinesimposed matter nothing because the offenders merely laugh at them and put their hands in their pockets and pay thosefinesbefore they leave the court. I believe that the people who do traffic in these drugs deserve a much harsher penalty than that prescribed for at the moment. I draw a definite distinction between the pedlars and the users. I wholeheartedly agree with the statement of the honourable member for Oxley that the users definitely need medical rehabilitation. But there is no problem as fhe Government recognises this fact. However, I would draw a definite line of distinction between a user and a pedlar or a user-pedlar. The honourable member for Oxley mentioned alcohol and tobacco. There js a difference between addiction to alcohol and tobacco and addiction to drugs. The difference is that the alcoholic or the heavy user of tobacco does not try to induce other people to join him. One will often find the alcoholic on his own in a corner. 1 am talking about the real alcoholic-the cove who is really gone. You will find that that fellow is a loner. Of course, the heavy smoker does not run around trying to induce other people to start smoking simply because he smokes. A drug pedlar is always on the job of inducing others to use the particular drug he peddles and so become dependent, which means another customer for him and consequently more money in his pocket. I believe that there is a distinct difference between the user of alcohol and tobacco and the drug pedlar in this respect. I know that the Minister and his Department have a tremendous problem with the detection of drugs. Our open coastline makes smuggling or the importation of drugs a lot easier than perhaps in other countries; it is comparatively easy. Therefore to my mind we must make the penalties harsher for the offenders we catch. I forget the percentage of possible drug imports that are detected. IfI remember rightly it is about IS per cent. That is not good. We must deter people from illegally importing drugs. They are making huge profits by trying to get this stuff into Australia, and we must try to catch them somewhere along the line. The honourable member for Oxley placed emphasis on research. This is ideal, but I tbink there is a definite and comparative need for education and detection as well as research. IfI remember rightly, the honourable member for Oxley placed research first in order of priority, but I claim there is a comparative need for detection and education as well. I will not disagree with the honourable member's statement that the narcotic problem is developing. My word, it is developing. It is developing to a stage where we have to watch it very closely. He mentioned the problem in America and in England and how the authorities in those countries treat the people involved differently. The drug problem is developing to the stage where because of Australia's open coastline, the comparative ease of smuggling drags into Australia and the huge profits that can be made on this stuff, people from all walks of life are being attracted to dealing in drugs. New aud devious techniques arc being devised for distributing the stuff, and consequently this problem will develop further. It is OK to have the accent on researchI am all for it-bu t as I say, there is a comparative need for detection and education to offset the development of this problem. I feel also that there is a constant need for the people who arc engaged in the detection, of drugs to co-operate with other countries which have similar problems and at intervals during a year, say, to visit these other countries and study their technique or, vice versa, have other people come to us. But I feel there should be complete co-operation between other countries and ourselves on the detection of drugs. The honourable member for Oxley stated that he had reservations about marihuana. So have I. I have read that for many years countries such as England have been studying this problem to find out whether there are any ill effects from marihuana and whether it is addictive, but nobody has yet come up with anything positive. I take notice of the people from the World Health Organisation who are engaged in this research and who have said that they too are not sure. If they are not sure of the effects of marihuana-thi s drug, if it be a drugI too have reservations about it. Until something definite about the effects of marihuana comes up and is published I too, as does the honourable member for Oxley, have reservations about its use. 1 read about 12 months ago in the 'Australian' newspaper, I think it was, that the 5 medical members on the Opposition side had openly stated that there were no ill effects from marihuana and that they would legalise the use of it if they had their choice. penalties in the Bill and as outlined by Having not read about definite results of any research that has been done into this weed, I was amazed that they could be so definite. Again1 read in the Press recently that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) said that he had used marihuana and that he knows doctors who have used it. I do not know where the honourable member gets the marihuana from-whethe r he grows it himself, whether he purchases it or whether he has it given to him. But it is still illegal to use marihuana. I would like to ask him later where he gets it. I cannot see how these members of the Opposition can be so definite when the research that has been going on for many years in the countries 1 mentioned has not produced anything definite. SoI will reserve my judgment on marihuana until something definite is published. The honourable member for Oxley stated also that the approach of penalising people for drug offences has failed in America. FranklyI do not know how he can be so definite about that when we do not know the results of what would have happened had they not been penalised. I have no argument with him when he says that the user needs medical treatment and medical rehabilitation. He has stated that the penalising has failed. I do not see how he can be so definite. As I said, a lot of money is being made by people in all walks of life from drugs. It is interesting to read the statistics of court cases over the last 5 years, that basically his attitude is incorrect. I to see what these people do for a normal occupation and to see the increase in the incidence of drug offences. Unlike the honourable member for Oxley, who has moved this amendment, I want harsher penalties. A study of the seizures of drugs that have been made over the last 5 years indicates that these are necessary. There has been a marked decrease of the seizure of opium in the last 5 years but there has been a marked increase in the seizure of heroin and a tremendous increase in the seizure of cannabis. Thousands and thousands of pounds have been seized. There has been a tremendous increase in the seizure of LSD and other drugs such as morphine and cocaine over the last 5 years. 1 feel that the the Minister in his second reading speech are definitely not harsh enough. While I agree with the Opposition statement that the users need treatment, I cannot vote for the amendment because, as I have stated, the penalties as 1 read them in the Bill are still not harsh enough for these characters who would undermine the health, both physical and mental, of the youth of our country. Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (3.58)1 support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), which asks that the Bill be withdrawn because it does not deal adequately with either drug trafficking or drug abuse and the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. I would like firstly to deal with the second part of the amendment. To sum up my attitude to this amending legislation I would like to say that it is a completely ridiculous piece of legislation following the report of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. For any Minister to introduce this sort of legislation after months and months of hearings by the Senate Select Committee and the publication of a report by the Senate Committee seems to me to be quite ridiculous. Generally speaking, I defend the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) on his attitude on drugs. I think that while he does go overboard, as many of us tend lo do when we get the opportunity to get our point of view into the media, I do not think think that the media is to blame to a large extent for picking very carefully the sensational parts of the Minister's statements. Broadly speaking, as far as I can see, this legislation is intended to be only empire building for the Department of Customs and Excise. There have been all kinds of allegations in the New South Wales newspapers and in the New South Wales Parliament. They have concerned officers of the special services branch of the Department of Customs and Excise and officers of the New South Wales police force. There have been allegations of bribery, of false stateadopted by people who completely ignore ments and of fights between those 2 bodies. This legislation represents an attempt by the question in relation to the proportion of Department of Customs and Excise to invade what normally would be the preserve of the State police departments and as the Department would put it, I suppose, to deal with the problem. Others would sayI ara not necessarily one of them-that it wants to get in for its cut. When the Parliament is dealing with an extremely important problem-ho w to deal with drug abuse-w e should not be influenced by side issues such as the interests of other Ministers or, more importantly, significant people in the approdo not relate to any particular drug or drugs and priate department. As I read the report of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse, there is no suggestion for the introduction of this type of legislation. As I continue my remarks, I hope to bring this out in more detail. Let me first deal with the question of drug abuse programmes are not designed to discourage in general, and of treatment and rehabilitathe use of those substances. What does the tion. What is this Department dealing with? I suppose that the Department of Customs and Excise derives 90 per cent of its income I have not checked this in detail-fro m 2 major drugs. It derives the income from the excises on alcohol and cigarettes. It lives on that. I suppose that it helps the Government and the Commonwealth of Australia to live on that. Then, it becomes pretentious about avoiding the spread of drugs in the community. Parties are held by the Department of Customs and Excise, at which plenty of alcohol is served, to launch drug education programmes. What a ridiculous proposition. Honourable members heard the proposition advanced by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett) who was speaking a few moments ago. He suggested that one of the nice ways of dealing with .the drug squanders problem would be for pepple to have getproductivity declines, and his family may bo together parties such as those recently held in Canberra where we can all have drinks together and talk about the problems connected with drugs. What a ridiculous proposition. I notice that the honourable member for Herbert is now occupying the chair as the Deputy Speaker. I did not notice that when 1 was attacking him. I am sorry that he is not now in a position to interject. But I deplore this sort of attitude certain drugs. Late last year I asked a the Budget spent on the programmes directed to discourage the use of certain drugs. I asked the Minister: What proportion of the $500,000 budget for drug education programmes is devoted to discourage the use of (a) alcohol, (b) tobacco (c) opium derivatives (d) cannabis, (e) sedative drugs and (f) stimulant drugs. On 31st March this year, the Minister replied: The $500,000 allocated by the Government for drug education is being used for programmes approved by the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence. These programmes are, where possible, integrated within existing health education activities in the various States. This is the important part of the answer: These programmes are not designed to discourage the use of alcohol or tobacco. I repeat that the. Minister said that these Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse say in the appendix to its report at page 105? It states: The harm to the individual resulting from dependence on alcohol can be quantitatively greater than that caused by any other type of drug dependence. Alcohol impairs efficiency of thinking and psychomotor co-ordination, leading to deterioration in work performance and to accidents. Judgment deteriorates, leading to all sorts of errors in business and to disturbances of relations with other people. Conscious controls of behaviour are 'dissolved', with resulting exhibitionism, aggressiveness and assaultiveness. In addition, dependence on alcohol predisposes to and causes serious physical disease. The physical damage may be indirect, due to neglect of hygiene or to inaequate dietary intake and utilisation, with resultant deficiencies, for example, in vitamins, minerals and proteins. The most common serious complication of protracted alcoholism is fatty portal cirrhosis. Alcoholics are frequently injured because of impaired co-ordination and judgment. Damage to society is great. The alcoholic his resources to obtain his beverage, his neglected to the extent that it has to be supported become the religion of the young radical by society. Alcoholics are frequently involved in accidents, wilh property damage and injury to others. The economic burden of dependence on alcohol is enormous; even more important is the tremendous amount of human suffering endured by the. alcoholic and all who are close to him. What does the Minister say in reply to my question on drug education. He states that the programmes are not designed to discourage the use of alcohol. What a lovely proposition. Cannabis or marihuana is frequently introduced into discussion on the question of drug abuse. As1 see it, it is not one of the most important drugs. I will not get into an argument with the honourable member for Herbert or anybody else on the question of the safety or otherwise of marihuana. I oppose the use of marihuana even though 1 accept the scientific evidence, which I feel the honourable member for Herbert has not looked at, from royal commisisons in Great Britain and Canada and from reports in the United States of America which show quite clearly that it is not as objectionable a drug from the medical point of view as are other drugs. The way to fight its use, to my mind, is surely through argument and education. It should be exposed by those who, like myself, see it as a lethal enemy of the intellectual community as well as those who, apparently like the honourable member for Herbert, have a more apocalyptic approach and see it as the lethal enemy of life itself. Whichever way the problem is looked at, I tbink it is an objectionable type of drug and I deplore it. Unlike Dr Ribusch of the Queensland Department of Health, who during the last few days has received some publicity for his comments on the question of marihuana because of a letter in the Medical Journal of Australia, 1 do not know of any doctors who use marihuana. But I join with the honourable member for. Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) who sits next to me in deploring its use. To my mind, it is important to emphasise that it is like alcohol in the sense that it destroys people's drives. There is evidence that with marihuana and other cannabis derivatives, many young intelligent people with worthwhile criticisms to make of society and the ability to do something about them contract out of society and get happy on marihuana. To paraphrase Marx, in some case hallucinogents including marihuana intellectual. I deplore this as a way of wasting the psychic energies of such people. Dealing with drugs in generalI am not now dealing with marihuana specificallyI do not think that treatment should be punishment. I think that all honourable members who have spoken so far have agreed on this. To some extent, I deplore the Minister's. attacks on the courts in this regard. I noticed that he has provided the honourable member for Herbert, who preceded me in this debate, with information along the same lines as his statement. It seems to be a sort of rehash of the statement. The Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse reported on this at page 77 of its report. It stated: After considering the evidence placed before it, the Committee believes that the approach to tbe drug taker should be one with emphasis on treating an illness rather than imposing a penalty for a wrong doing. Tbe person who becomes dependent on drugs can be cured only by medical treatment and must be encouraged to seek it. The Committee quotes approvingly a witness who said: lf one is trying to encourage people to seek help when they feel tbey are becoming over dependent on drugs, then the answer is hardly to threaten them with prosecution if they seek to make themselves known. That will only drive them to be more careful and hide from law enforcement agencies and so also hide from treatment agencies. Without the threat of prosecution, it would be much easier for family or friends to coax drug dependent individuals to seek treatment. I strongly support this because .the present proposition of a legal sanction of 2 years imprisonment is not really the answer. The Committee went further and I think the passage I shall read is important as it is a reply to the Minister. I repeat that this Select Committee, with a majority of members from the Government side of the Senate, having listened to the evidence, said: The Committee has been encouraged, both by the evidence directly submitted to it and by an examination of court records, to see that there appears to be a more humanitarian approach to the treatment of the young drug abuser appearing before the court. While quite obviously die law as it stands must be observed by the judiciary there are available discretionary powers such as the imposition of a bond as a deterrent to repetition of tbe offence. Further, the desirable trend in some courts is to encourage treatment or impose otber probation conditions rather than prison sentences or fines. To the Committee this has two advantages tbe first being that the aim is treatment rather than penalties and secondly for the young experimenter the imposition of a bond does not have the serious repercussions on careers that a recorded conviction could have, lt seems to the Committee that a young person who succumbs to the pressure of peer groups or simply experiments perhaps for the first time and is caught, faces a double penalty when a conviction is recorded. A conviction can close certain professions and can quite seriously affect his prospects in many areas of employment for which he may be well qualified. I urge the honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Kennedy follow me in this debate and will no doubt give forth in his usual eloquent manner about his knowledge of drugs and pornography, having studied them at first hand in the United States whilst allegedly attending the United Nations as an observer from this country-to contact some of their Senate colleagues who sat on this Committee such as Senator Marriott, Senator Branson, Senator Buttfield, Senator Cavanagh, Senator Georges, Senator McManus, Senator Maunsell and Senator Wheeldon and who made these recommendadons. On thc question of penalties, the Committee said that penalties should be sufficiently severe to deter the drug trafficker and drug pusher. I will get on to this in a moment. The school girl.

I think that part (a) of our amendment dealing with inadequate provisions on drug trafficking is just as important. I propose to move an amendment on this point later during the Committee stage, but I would like to deal with it very quickly now. We have a new definition of a traffickable quantity. This does not deal with pushers. The traffickable quantity as set out in the proposed Schedule means, as I see it, that basically if a person has between 20 and 25 doses in most cases he automatically becomes designated as a pusher or a trafficker unless he can prove the opposite, that he has not been dealing with it. This may be justifiable. I do not think it is. But surely even the Minister or other honourable members opposite cannot justify the opposite conclusion. What will happen now is that if a person is caught redhanded and admits to having sold 10 Pethedine tablets to a small child, a young school girl or. to to make it even more harrowing, a young pregnant school girl Mr KatterA young, blind, pregnant Dr KLUGMANI thank the honourable the futility of imprisoning the truly drug member for Kennedy.

99,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (4.19),"I haveMinister in the House of Representatives is worth 20 senators. Maybe this is a correct assessment, but it is not for me to say. But it is the Minister's business to know what is going on in regard to drug trafficking every day of the week and every week of the year. He knows precisely what is happening. Such a man of the world as he is has a profound understanding of these matters. So he is my second authority. Let me refer to a document I have before me which gives the effects of marihuana. It says: In a recent issue of the 'American Journal of Psychiatry', a small group of pot smokers were reported on. All were of superior intelligence. They were or had been university students. I like the use of the words 'had been' ence in this chamber at about one o'clock because unfortunately one of the effects of in the morning. He continues: drug taking is that there are so many dropouts at the universities. The document fear of dying. continues: None was a delinquent. None had ever been arrested. All but two came from middle class backgrounds. These are some of the difiiculties which were experienced: One felt panic and fear. One had a feeling that he was outside himself and had lost his identity. One suffered complete confusion and hallucination. Two experienced deep depression. Four had a paranoid reaction-feelin g someone or something was out to hurt them. Two had major changes of behaviour and style of life after using thc drug. Four had a split personality. . . . I think that this in itself is a very profound indictment of the irresponsible people who wo.:!d constantly create in the minds of young people the impression that drug taking is a pretty normal thing to do. Pressure is put upon a young person, when he or she leaves high school and goes to university and feels that he or she has to conform to standards that are being dragged down by people who create this impression. 1 like the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) but I do not like a lot of the things he stands for. He spoke about moralising as though 'moralising' was a dirty word. According to him, you do not create moral standards any more. 1 say that you most certainly do create moral standards untJ yo-j hMd vp in the mind' of : our young people that they do have a code by which they should live, and it is a code that does not include the smoking of marihuana. Why should they smoke marihuana? You may say they drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes. Let us go a little further into this in case those minor reactions may not have been impressive enough. What are the dangers of marihuana? Dr Sharoff says: . To marihuana critics, the pot user retorts that it increases artistic talent. What is artistic talent? I should not start talking about artistic talent or the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) will refer to my alleged attendance at the United Nations organisation. Dr Sharoff says: Most scientific opinion does not support his claims. It even makes some serious counterclaims. The user may 'feel good' while the drug lasts, but afterwards he may experience a 'down' and become, gloomy. I suppose that is something that we experiSome users show signs of panic and even express This is what Dr Sharoff had to say: fn company, thc user may be very talkative, even if he is naturally shy. He sounds self confident even on matters about which he knows very little. He loses his inhibitions. 1 suppose we all do that at timesHowever, if a negative idea shows up. he may become unsure, irritated and anxious. He then retreats to glum silence. This creates a pretty realistic picture. In case honourable members have not been impressed by those generalities let me now refer to the report of an incident which comes from no less a person than the Commissioner of Narcotics himself. This is not fiction. It is documented fact. I suppose honourable members opposite will say: There they go again. The Minister is rushing around the place getting emotional and creating colourful pictures.' That is all very well, but it gives the impression that anyone who wants to create a barrier between these ugly things that are happening in some sort of square, to use the old word for it. Now honourable members will say I am getting emotional and wanting lo get up in the clouds. But listen to this: The Commissioner reported that an entire family was murdered by a youthful marihuana addict in Florida. When officers arrived at the home they found the youth staggering about in a human slaughterhouse. With an axe he had killed his father, mother, two brothers ancl a sister. .He seemed to dislike his family. He seemed to be in a daze. He had no recollections of having committed a multiple crime. The interesting point is that the officers knew him ordinarily as a sane, rather quiet young man. Now he was pitifully crazed. They sought the reason. The boy said that he had been in the habit of smoking something which youthful friends called muggles, a childish name for marihuana. I would say that while the slightest possibility of anything even approaching that result exists, everyone in this House-afte r all, we are the leaders of thc nation-shoul d stand four-square against marihuana. I want to refer to some comments I made when a rcpoiLcr from the 'Australian' newspaper rang inc in Queensland recently. I am not using this as a coward's castle. I want to refer to the comments made by Dr Ribush in an article that he wrote for the 'Australian Medical Journal*. The honourable member for Prospect mentioned this a little while ago. Dr Ribush made the statement that he knew of 20 or 30 doctors who were smoking pot, or marihuana. I do not know what bas happened about this in the Queensland Parliament. It was to have blown up in the last few days. I do not know whether any action has been taken. 1 say with respect to the Minister that the first thing that sbould happen is that Dr Ribush should be interviewed perhaps by some officers of the Department of Customs and Excise. The next thing that should happen is that be should notify the police. He is condoning crime. On the question of whether or not it is a crime to smoke marihuana, I do not care what anyone says because according to the law of the land it is a crime. Here is a man of statusDr Ribush, a young man of 30-wh o claims that he knows of 20 or 30 doctors who are smoking marihuana. The last thing that should happen is that the Australian Medical Association should immediately open an inquiry into this whole question. With all due respect to the medical men and associated professional men in the ranks of the Opposition, why should they have some particular form of protection? Tbey should not bave this protection. Dr Ribush, as I have stated outside this House, should give his full co-operation to have this whole matter investigated, firstly by the Department of Customs and Excise, secondly by the Queensland police or the police in whichever State these people ara smoking this stuff, and thirdly by his own Medical Association. I. hope that the Association is interesting itself to the extent of holding a full scale inquiry. the rack on him? ment that we get from honourable members opposite. They try to ridicule decent standards that most Australians stand by. This is why these poor people on the other side will never get into power, because people who have not had political experience like some of their older and more experienced colleagues make that sort of comment, and I have taken it up because I want it to go into Hansard. I want the people of Australia to understand that this is their standard. The last matter 1 want to deal with is the matter of punishment. Behind all these operations affecting drugs is Mr Big, the fellow who sits in tbe background and issues his instructions only through a telephone. He would not even soil himself by coming in contact with the pushers. This would be beyond bim. I do not know whether this is correct or not but on the very best authority I bave been told that some of the people behind the wholesale distribution of drugs are some of the allegedly most respectable business tycoons in this land and it would be very surprising if Mr Big were to be suddenly revealed to the people of Australia. I know what I am saying. I have not taken any pot. Let us get this clear because 1 do not want any misunderstandings. The person behind the scene is pulling in fhe pronts such as is indicated in this report which 1 have. Let us have a quick look at tbem. One pound of marihuana can be purchased in most south east Asian countries such as India and Pakistan, and in South Africa, for $10. Landed in Australia, taking into consideration all costs such as couriers, etc., 1 lb will sell for $150. Placed on the wholesale market in Sydney it than sells for $400 to $500, depending on quality. At this point 1 Ib is divided into 1 oz lots and sold for $40 per oz. The report goes on -honourabl e members have beard my colleague the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett), who will be here for a long time to come, refer to this-to deal with",42,Customs Bill No 2 1971

101,Mr Katter,"That is the sort of stateLSD and heroin and the end result of this is that 2 lb of material nets almost §100,000. The fellow who sits back, who would not even soil himself and who would never reveal his identity, is the man who should be subjected to capital punishment, because he is responsible for the slow destruction of the lives of so many young people. I say that, the criminals are the people who will instil in the minds of young people the idea thai this is an ordinary every day sort of operation, that they should get in with the kids and smoke pot. Let me refer very briefly to the findings of the American Medical Association in this matter. I will admit that these findings are not completely conclusive but while there is the slightest possibility of what I am saying being correct anyone who condones this is almost as much a criminal as is the pusher. It is alleged that the constant smoking of marihuana will create in young men impotency, and if anything this should frighten them off. In young women it is alleged that tbere can be difficulties with childbirth and that there can be malformations and other side effects. Last but not least-thi s is the one that I want to refer to particularly-is the person who graduates. They say it is not habit forming to the same extent as other drugs but the sort of person who would want to smoke marihuana has this inherent weakness. He or she frequently comes from some privileged family and has never known bad times. The trouble these daysI have heard people say this so often-is with the young privileged wealthy kids in the cities who have never known adversity and who bave all the money they want. If only someone would give them a kick in the pants and send them out to the back blocks and let them feel the mud between their toes and get down to the earthy sort of things, they would not be looking for these kicks. But the point is that they are looking for kicks and frequently they graduate from marihuana to the heavier drugs. I repeat that Mr Big, the man who sits in the background and who reaps tbe profits, should be subject to capital punishment or if the maximum penalty is life imprisonment he should be put away for life. It is quite obvious from my point of view that the penalties now being applied for drug offences are infinitesimal. Honourable members on bolh sides of this House, this national Parliament, have to accept this responsibility. 1 am sure that the great majority if not all the people on the other side are misled. They come in, these extreme radicals, and they think that somehow or another they have to push these odd things, but I will not go into detail at the moment. the honourable member is a pusher. They feel that they have to push these extreme radical things. 1 am sure that in their heart of hearts they would agree with me that the whole of the energies of this Housewe owe it to this nation to do' all in our power in this direction-shoul d be directed towards applying the severest penalty not against those who are taking the drugs but against those who are wrecking the lives of so many young and older people in this nation. Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) (4.37)I feel inclined to reply to the personal comments and a number of remarks made both inside and outside this House which seemingly have been directed towards the group of doctors on this side of the House and certainly a few more against myself. For a start let me register the observation that of the 5 doctors on this side of the House4 do not smoke cigarettes. Three, I think, do not drink alcohol at all. One drinks very moderately. I have not asked the other about his consumption of alcohol but I believe it is very very moderate. They are hardly users of the popular sorts of drugs which are widely accepted within our community and used by lots of people. The next point I would like to make, from a personal point of view, is that about 2 years ago at the beginning of the Senate select committee inquiry into the drug problem my view on marihuana was the same as the view of most people in the community. I had never read anything about it. I accepted the accounts in the newspapers. SoI assumed that it was the sort of dangerous drug that we have been hearing about this afternoon. However, I was asked what were its medical effects and I had to confess that I did not know. The questioner, who had",44,Customs Bill No 2 1971
102,Dr Kingman,We are never pushing you.,45,Customs Bill No 2 1971
103,Mr Katter1 Am Not Suggesting That,"some interest in the Senate inquiry, persisted with his question and said: 'Why thc blazes do you not go and read it up and tell me because I would not understand the medical literature'. SoI decided 1 would read up on this matter. I proceeded to do so and in a very short time and only as a result of my reading of medical literature and of national reports did 1 come to the conclusions to which I have come about marihuana. We have heard this afternoon some quotations from some of the medical reports. There are many reports which cite examples of a mad youth on marihuana slaughtering people here and raping someone else there and so on. 1 concede that that is the popular view but unfortunately when you read reports by national inquiries such as the report published in 1968 by the British committee into the drug problem, headed by Baroness Wootton, you find fairly convincing and firm statements that most of the claims against marihuana are not substantiated by facts. In the report to the Canadian Government by a committee chaired. I think, by Le Dain, which was published in 1970, the same conclusion was reached. Having culled all the evidence, including the sorts of example quoted this afternoon, wbich I admit probably would be in the majority of the published articles and most of them would be hair .raising, a balanced committee-becaus e it wascame to the conclusion that marihuana is not dangerous in the sense in which it is popularly painted. I will grant that none of these committees is prepared to say that marihuana is completely safe. I will come to that. The committee reports usually deny many of the claims of its acute dangerous effects but they all say they cannot be certain that there are not chronic effects, and I am prepared to grant that point as well. But that does not mean that there are chronic effects. None of the reports confirmed proof that there is a long range chronic effect. The American Health, Education and Welfare Committee, which published its report early this year, reached the same sort of conclusions. Our own Senate select committee, again reviewing all the Uterature league, it was led by a radical senator, Senator Marriott who is a Government supporter. If honourable members read and digested the report of this committee, they would find that it came to the same sort of conclusion, namely, that the story against marihuana is inaccurate. The last speaker mentioned the specific case of the effects on the unborn child. I got into hot water over that one. When a report on this aspect first appeared in the Press, a newspaper correspondent telephoned me to tpll me about it and he asked me: 'What dp you think about it?' I said: 'Well, I suppose I had better shut my mouth' and there appeared in the Press a big headline stating: 'Cass must shut his mouth'. WhatI said was: ' I had better keep quite' and I did shut my mouth until 1 saw the reporter, because I am not a bigot. I am not closed to persuasion on this question. If this report were a genuine one-if it were scientific and if it appeared to state the case accuratelyI certainly would accept its findings. However, subsequently I got thc truth. In fact, according to the newspapers, the report was from the Presidentelect of the American Medical Association. I shall read it because I subsequently received an official statement from the President-elect, Wesley W. Hall. It reads as follows: In a recent Press conference I made comments with regard to the work of the AMA Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse which were widely misinterpreted. 1 am making this statement to clear the air and to restate our AMA position on this important subject. The AMA knows of no evidence to substantiate the statement that marihuana use leads to birth defects and sexual impotence. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) has left the chamber but so much for that particular article he quoted because thc very man who was reported to have made the claim-the President-elect of the American Medical Association-ha s quite specifically repudiated it. He also said: What is probably the most current and authoritative body of information is the report of the Secretary of Health. Education and Welfare issued on January 31 1971, titled 'Marihuana and Health'. This is the report I have in my hand and in the report is the evidence on which he based his repudiation of the initial report",45,Customs Bill No 2 1971

107,Dr Cass,"As I am assured by my colQuite frankly, 1 regret the waste of time spent discussing marihuana; as far as I am concerned it is not terribly important. The problem of drugs goes far beyond that. As far as I am concerned it includes cigarettes and alcohol although honourable members are very careful never to mention those 2 subjects or at least not significantly. We pay lip service to tbe fact that it is a bit of a problem. However, in real termsfigures were given this afternoon on a couple of occasions-for every one drug addict there are 100 people suffering from alcohol problems. are drug addicts? addicts but I am referring to hard drugs such as narcotics and marihuana as compared to alcohol. I should now like to turn to the problem of the Bill before the House. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) said: . . . cypress my disappointment at the kind of penalties being awarded by thc courts. In the past 2 years, of 157 cases involving significant quantities of drugs, 69 were merely fined, 61 received gaol sentences, the average gaol sentence fun. They also smoke pot because it is being 17 months. . . . The Minister is breaking his heart over this because it seems deplorable to him. I suggest to him that the reason is simple: It is not that the judges are idiots; it is not that the judges-the judiciary-ar e insensitive to the problem, nor are they unsympathetic to what the Minister is trying to do. 1 shall now link this with the first part of our amendment. I agree with the view that if the authorities catch ' Mr Big' they can do what they like with him; I shall not protest. The point is that the sort of people mentioned by the first speaker from the Government side today are the people who receive negligible sentences. The authorities are not catching ' Mr Big'; they are catching people who may well peddle drugs because they need to do so to get a drug supply for themselves. They are addicts. We hear a lot of talk about how much money there is in this for them. None of them is rich. When they are caught they are found to be penniless. They have very little funds. In fact, they are hooked and are spending all result. the money they can get. Tf they can sell drugs lo help get some more drugs for Probably 60 per cent or 70 per cent of all themselves, that is what they do. That is fatalities in road accidents are associated the person who stands before the judge to receive sentence. The judges in this community, thank goodness, do have hearts. They do understand humanity and so they mete out what are in the Minister's mind inadequate sentences but which are, in my view, perfectly correct ones. In fact, in some quite unofficial discussions I have had with one of these judges it was revealed that if the judges could be sure and they could send these people to a clinic, such as the British are beginning to set up, where they could be treated, that is the only punishment they would inflict. They would neither fine these people nor convict them of a criminal offence. They would simply refer them for treatment and that, in my opinion, is the only sane way to deal with the problem. In all this heated talk about the dreadful problem of drug addiction and so on, we never ask ourselves why the problem exists. What is it about? Why do people take drugs? One would get the feeling that it is done just for fun. I concede that to a certain extent that is true in the same way as many people take to drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes because it is good good fun; I grant that. I believe that with most people it stays that way. It remains a minor side activity with them. But this is not what we are talking about. This is not the sort of person who pushes it on to other people and who leads people to indulge in the crime about which we are worried. They are not the sort of people we find dying with syringe injection sights in their arms and so on. The question we have to answer is: Why do people get lo that stage? I would suggest-al l these reports discuss this aspect-that drug taking, including alcohol and tobacco, is caused by excess, to the extent that people sometimes die of cancer, chronic bronchitis or emphysema as the result of excessive smoking and people due of acute alcoholic poisoning and chronic effects such as cirrhosis of tbe liver and many other manifestations of excessive consumption of alcohol, including, for instance",46,Customs Bill No 2 1971

111,Dr Cass,"Precisely , road accidents.with the excessive consumption of alcohol, but we never want to recognise 'these things. The point is: Why do these people do these things? Why do they proceed along the path of self destruction, because that is what it is? Drug taking, whether it be pot, heroin, alcohol, cigarettes or amphetamines-an y of them-is not a cause; it is simply a symptom of their own breakdown, their own inability to cope with their own life situation and life problems. I think this is the key point. Time is short so I shall not try to find the quotes on this question, but there are plenty of them. If honourable members do not want to believe me, they can find the quotes in the Canadian reports, the American reports and the report of ithe Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. They will also find them in recent issues of journals on psychiatry. I am following up this question and these sorts of things are continuing to come out. The problem is a medical one. In 'Harper's Magazine' of this year there is an article headed 'Drugs Without Crime; A report on the British success with heroin addiction'. The writer of this article observes that there are fewer than 3,000 narcotic addicts in England while in America there are probably from 100,000 to 250,000--1 0 to 20 times as many on a population basis. In Britain in 1968 almost 1,000 new heroin addicts were counted, but in 1969 there were only 99 additional heroin addicts. Why are the British succeeding where the Americans are failing? The answer to me is because the British are recognising the fact that drug addicts are not criminals; they ar; sick individuals. The Americans complain that up to 80 per cent of serious property crime is probably due to drug users. In Britain different investigators have found that addicts are likely to commit fewer crimes after they are hooked than before. Why is this? In America to get one's supply of drugs it may cost from $300 to $500 a week, but io Britain it costs, at most, $2.16 a week because the drugs can be obtained under the national health scheme. The writer of this article states: . . . that they were talking about medicine. The 'addict', said the distinguished panel which urged the addicts said. The interviews repeat again and the clinic approach, 'should be regarded as a sick again their personal and pragmatic assessments. person, he should be treated as such and not as a criminal, provided that he does not resort to criminal acts'. It is interesting to note, when one considers the British approach in establishing clinics, the efforts in 1965 of the New York Academy of Medicine which urged that another attempt should be made to establish clinics which were established in America after the First World War to cope with the drug problem and suggested that the earlier efforts were stopped not because they had failed but because they ran against 'the prevailing philosophy of a punitive approach'. We see the shades of prohibition and the alcohol problem. The only thing which succeeded in doing was vastly to increase the criminality associated with drinking. There have been some suggestions that we cannot be too sure that there may not be other differences between the British and American approaches to the drug problem-that , after all, there may be something in the British character which is different from the American characterto explain this seemingly, odd drug behaviour. A social psychologist managed to make a comparative study of 25 Canadian addicts. He was able to trace their activities while they were in Canada, and after they had migrated to England he was able to follow their activities there. This is what he found: At home the Canadians spent 25 per cent of their addicted years in jail; in England, less than 2 per cenl. At home this meant a combined total of 141 years and 2 months in prison; in England, 2 years and 5 months. At home they compiled 182 offences; in England, 27. At home, in the high addict crime category of theft, which also included robbery and burglary, they committed 88; in England, 8. He also found that in Canada few of them were able to work or to cope with jobs, but that in England most of them were able to get work. He found that in England 13 worked full-time and 4 worked part time; 6 held the same job for at least 3 years; 7 had semi-skilled or skilled manual jobs, and so on. The article in 'Harper's Magazine', referring to the study carried the British never lost sight of the fact out by this psychologist, continued: 'For once we could work and live like humans', There is less trouble from the police . . we don't constantly have to be paranoid . .' . there is less pressure to steal.' How many American addicts today would find 'no need to steal' and 'could work and live like human beings if they had a choice? To me the Minister's proposed answer to slightly.

112,Mr Donald Cameron (Griffith) In 1969 Directed That A Conference To Dis,"because of the attitudes of some of the magistrates and judges wlio have handled various drug cases in the past. I wonder whether or not various State governmentsperhaps some members of the Parliament may be able to give a run down on exactly what the State governments have done in this field-look at this as a matter which does not hold many votes and therefore they let the ball pass through to the keeper. They will wait until the day when there are so many addicts around and a great public outcry arises for the establishment of certain hospitals and centres at wbich these people can be cared for and, if possible, restored to health. I do make an earnest plea to the various State governments. I may be accused of being a centralist but they should give more consideration to the treatment aspect and make more opportunities available to those who are seeking help. I imagine that IS years ago the number of drug addicts or people who were accustomed to taking drugs in Australia was but a handful. Unfortunately today the world is becoming smaller because of faster transport. Australia is becoming more exposed to worldly attitudes. The drug problem is growing faster and faster. It is high time that we introduced legislation to counter those people who have been able to slip through the net because of the weakness of our legislation. The House is aware that I have expressed great and constant opposition to the extension of the rights of police forces, etc.. to tap telephones on all but the most important occasions. I have no hesitation in stating that when it comes to the apprehension of drug traffickers and the elusive Mr Big, who was mentioned by the honourable member for Kennedy, 1 would be prepared to yield my stand on telephone tapping. I qualify that statement by saying that permission to eavesdrop on telephone conversations should be granted only by the Attorney-General, the Comptroller-General of Customs and Excise or the Minister for Customs and Excise. I regard drug trafficking as a serious enough subject to cause me to yield on that point. No doubt exists that there are people in this world who are growing fat and rich because they are taking advantage of this weakness of certain sections of the population. I believe that any US. drug supply is grown in the fields of opportunity to catch and to imprison these people should be availed of. The honourable member for Kennedy proposed that they should be put to death. Some people may regard that as being too kind. Perhaps life imprisonment might be a better proposition. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that in 1965 in the United States of America the Johnson Administration amended the Drug Abuse Control Amendments. A section was inserted which provided that the sale, barter, exchange, giving away or transfer of any narcotic drug cr marihuana to a person under 18 years of age would attract a penalty of imprisonment of not less than 10 years and not more than 40 years, and in addition a fine of not more than $20,000 might be imposed. This legislation talks in terms of a penalty of $2,000 and $4,000 depending on the seriousness as related to the quantities of drugs carried at the time of apprehension. I wonder wonder whether we in this enlightened age are going as far as we could. I do not think that too much can be done to stop those people who are using the weaknesses of other people to fill their pockets. There is the addict who is caught on the drug and there is the other person who is out to make addicts and to build up his business so that he grows wealthier. The latter has no concern for individuals. His only concern is for himself. T do not believe that we can do too much to apprehend a person of this type. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) made some comparisons earlier which showed that in the United Kingdom there was one addict to every 18,500 persons while in the United States there was one addict to every 700 to 1,000 persons. Surely no-one can jump to the conclusion that, because the United States has harsh laws, this level of addiction is the direct result. T think that it is unfair or impractical to compare that situation to that in Australia. The situation in the United States is entirely different from that in the United Kingdom. I hold the attitude of society in Australia to be more akin to that of society in the United States than of society in the United Kingdom. We are doing the right thing in nipping this problem in the bud. So much of the Mexico and is smuggled into the United States. Australia has been fortunate in the past. But I am worried because the Minister for Customs and Excise stated that only 15 per cent of all drugs actually smuggled into Australia are confiscated by his Departis a diplomat nobody touches him. I apprement. Even if the world average confiscation of drugs is 10 per cent, I think that Australia should be doing better. IfI belonged to any force, be it a customs or a police force, I do not think that I would be overly proud if the level of success was that only 15 per cent of all drugs smuggled into Australia were confiscated. If the Minister considers this problem to be of such grave consequence as he has suggestedI am sure that he doess-and ff it is as serious as members on this side of the House in particular believe it to be, it is time we realised that it does not matter how much we spend on building up and training our customs staff if we do not adopt sterner measures to confiscate drugs. I say to the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn), who is at the table, that it is about time we woke up to ourselves in relation to our slipshod handling of overseas visitors to Australia. I have been in and out of this country on a number of occasions. I bave watched the way in which customs officers operate. It is a wonder that 15 per cent of smuggled drugs are confiscated when we consider the way in which our customs men handle people. The policies that we have adopted mean that tourists from some overseas countries suffered 2 minutes inconvenience at the customs gate before they are passed through customs. A selective system is applied under which, one in, say, every 6 is checked. I recall very clearly an incident which occurred while I was travelling from Acapulco to San Antonio. It was known that T was a member of the Australian Parliament. I had the green passport. The person who checked me said: ' I am sorry, sir, but it happens to everyone'. T said: 'That is fair enough'. A very careful examination was made of my possessions. The point I am making is that every person who came in before or after me was subjected to the same very close scrutiny. It is about time we took off the gloves at the gates to Australia. It is about time we started taking this problem seriously. Not too long ago we had the case of a diplomat from an African country being given his marching orders from this country because he was guilty of bringing in a great swag of a particular drug. Because a person ciate that diplomats are closely screened in the early days but, as tbey are no different to anybody else, why should they receive preferential treatment? They are no different to members of Parliament and they are no different to the ordinary John Citizen. They are people the same as everyone else. Just as some people have a weakness to succumb to thc opportunity to make easy money, so do certain diplomats. I am not saying that diplomats are responsible for the importation of all the illegal drugs which are coming into this country, but I do not believe that anyone should ba exempted from scrutiny because of the position which he holds. Drug addiction is tbe most vile form of human misery which can be inflicted upon any person. I have read articles recently about heroin being mixed in with marihuana in order to hook tha user of marihuana on heroin without them knowing that they are on heroin. I despise this practice. 1 remind the House that the Opposition has not appeared in good light in recent months as a political party. While I was in the United States of AmericaI heard people of far greater authority than any member of the Opposition expressing their uncertainty as to the long term effects of marihuana. It is unfortunate that in the last couple of years we have seen a division in the attitude of the Opposition and tha Government in this Parliament to the drug problem. The Australian Labor Party has been presenting itself as the enlightened political party and the party that knows all the answers to questions about drugs while the Government Parties have been ultraconservative in their approach. ing to alcohol? honourable member is on another trip. We are told that the ultra-conservatives sit on this side of the chamber and the radicals sit on the other side of fhe chamber.

114,Mr Donald Cameron,"Thathe available information, but I do not think that some of the comments which have been made by members of the Opposition make it any easier for parents to bring up their children to believe that certain things are good while others are not. 1 conclude by saying to the Opposition that if it ever wants to govern this country it will have to change a lot of its ideas because information, namely, the tar content of the the way in which it behaves in opposition at present does not give the Australian electorate great hope as to how it will behave and how responsible it will be in government. Dr EVERINGHAM (Capricornia) (5.13) I thank the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) for curtailing bis speech to allow this debate to continue and give more speakers an opportunity to participate in it. I hope to follow his example. The point whicb has been made in the amendment moved by tbe honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) is that thc measure before tbe House aims to increase penalties without being specific, without being selective and without being discriminatory, as to what is the cause of the drug problem in this country or in any other country. I support entirely the remarks which have been made by honourable members on this side of the House and a great deal of what has been said by bonourable members on the other side of tbe House, but I must take issue with some of tbe remarks which have been made by honourable members on the other side of the House. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) confined almost the whole of bis speech to a recital of the alleged, suspected or known effects of marihuana. Marihuana is not responsible in any country in the world for problems insofar as crime, disruption of families or increases that I was advocating the putting of an in the road toll are concerned of the magniexcise on them to make money. A public tude caused by alcohol or heavy drugs. In fact, the use of marihuana has not created any of the major drug problems which are associated with tbe use of alcohol or of heavy drugs. However, I want to point out that I do not advocate the use of marihuana. I have never advocated the use of it nor of any otber drug, including tobacco. tried tobacco either; has the Minister? Dr EVERINGHAM1 should point out that 1 have been engaged in a campaign in ParUament House of daubing one of the cigarette machines with a little bit of factual cigarettes contained therein and whether certain brands of cigarettes are made in South Africa. Somebody who is equally as diligent as I have been has been removing these signs. I have got to the tenth one so far. I have also placed questions on the notice paper about what the Government is going to do about the erosion of morale in this country and about making alcohol and cigarettes fashionable and glamorous. Honourable members will be aware of the types of slogans that are used in tbe advertising of these products.. For example, it is said that it is a man's drink or cigarette; it. is international; and it is sophisticated. These products are associated witb all kinds of fast cars, beautiful and luxurious surroundings, and young and attractive companions. A reply was given to me in writing by the Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme) that it is not thought possible to restrict this type of advertising on television because it would embarrass the commercial television stations and because they could not be able to keep going without the finance derived from cigarette advertising. 1 took up this matter in the House and said that if this sort of back to front logic is to be adopted with regard to advertising then perhaps we sbould impose a kind of excise on marihuana and even heavy drugs like heroin. Of course, the Press took up my comments and said that I was advertising the legalisation of illegal drugs. It was said apology has been printed and more will be printed when a particular court case comes to its conclusion. The point I want to make about marihuana is that every one of the effects quoted by the honourable meniber for Kennedy to prove how much worse it is than alcohol and tobacco are also the effects of alcohol and that suspected effects referred to were specifically repudiated, as the bonourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) has fold us, by tbe same",51,Customs Bill No 2 1971

The same authority as was quoted as having said that marihuana is suspected of causing deformities has denied that there is any medical evidence of this. I am not saying that marihuana is harmless; I am saying that it is harmful. I advise everybody not to touch it. I say the same of alcohol. I have been guilty of paying for alcoholic drinks for people. ourable member's chance. 1 have bought drinks for people. I bave served in my own home drinks that people have taken by choice. But if I lived in one of the parts of India in which there is prohibition I would not do so. I would not offer anybody in Australia a reefer because it is illegal to do so. But if I went to a country where it is the accustomed thing I do not know whether I would do so and I do not know whether some of the people who I must stress that this official is not from have been ranting about marihuana would the Department of Customs and Excise but do so. As the honourable member for. Prospect psychologist with the Department of (Dr Klugman) said, this Bill is a means of Health, who spoke to the National Council empire building by certain people in the of Women on tbe drug problem in percustoms field.

HoweverI point out that into print, as it was in the Canberra 'News' this is not the appropriate way to deal with on 10th September. The report continues: the problem. This is what speakers on this side have been saying: If you want to had been caught experimenting with drugs by his reduce drug addiction you do not do it by increasing penalties. It may be that the penalties in this new Bill are too mild, and but I am not going to say that they should not upstairs and took a tranquilliser because she was be heavier. I am not arguing for a reduction upset by the argument. of the penalties. I am saying that this is not That is the point that we are making. Tha the way to reduce addiction and that somereport continues: thing more widespread, something broader, is called for. The civil servants employed by tha Government are not remiss in their approach to this problem. In fact I have here a number of pamphlets from the National Drug Information Centre. It is a pity that more people did not know about this centre. People can get these pamphlets quite easily from the Australian Capital Territory Health Services in Darwin Place, Canberra. They bear such titles as 'Smoking Drinking and Drug Abuse', 'Motivations for Student Drug Use', 'Talking About Drugs', 'Leading a Discussion', ""The Way We Live Now', 'The Needs of Young People', 'The Committed and Uncommitted', 'Drugs and Their Effect', 'Communication With Youth', ""The Drug Dilemma: A Partial Solution' and 'Communicating About Drugs'. And there is a book from the New. South Wales Health Department entitled 'The Use and Abuse of Drugs'. I want to quote from one of the officials. from the Department of Health, as are tha pamphlets. 1 refer to Mrs Jean Nolan, a She said while emphasis In recent years has heen She quoted a story about a 16-year-old boy who father.

119,Dr Evebingham,"No w is the honThis Bill is more a drug Bill than a people Bill, and that is the thing we are objecting to. We are asking the Government to face this problem as a people problem and not a drug problem. Alcohol is the drug that I am mainly concerned with at the moment. An article in the Sydney 'Sun' of Friday, tOth September last. It states: Alcoholism should be suspected in young p -ilienis suffering from peptic ulcers, hypertension Which is just high blood pressure, in case people do not knowand car accident injuries, according to a report ward by the honourable member for released today. The report was from a University of Melwith this reassurance that alcohol, of course, bourne research team investigating physical is not nearly as dangerous as marihuana illness in alcoholics. It said that these sympbecause it confuses us and we become toms frequently occurred within the first 5 muddled whereas there is a dangerous years of heavy drinking. The team took clarity which accompanies the hallucinations case histories of 1,000 alcoholic patents at that come with marihuana. He then goes a hospital alcoholism clinic in Melbourne forth to quote one of the experts. He quoted and it analysed data in regard to factors thc sorts of reactions that people have to such as age, sex and occupation. It found prove that marihuana is a dangerous drug. that heart and chest diseases were more People can get panicky; they can have a common among men but that women were loss of identity; they can have confusion much more prone to chronic liver disease and hallucinations. Here be is contradictand brain damage. This is only scratching ing the very point he made before to disthe surface of the kind of illness that we tinguish it from alcohol. People get conknow and have known for many years is fused with hallucinations, just as confused associated with heavy drinking. We have heard evidence in this debate Then he quoted to us a very detailed and that half of all Australian males are heavy dramatic story of a young lad who had drinkers if we define a heavy drinker as a killed his parents, sister and a couple of person who has 4 drinks or more a day brothers. He quoted the police officer who on average. What is heavy drinking? To found this lad as saying that this lad, who relate it to this disease we would have to was normally a quiet sort of chap, was take out extensive statistics. All my quesvisibly crazed; he did not seem to have any tions over the years to successive Ministers appreciation of what he had done. If that for Health have failed to elicit any attempt is being in a clear mind I do not know to discover any kind of statistics relating what clarity of mind is. If that lad had alcohol to disease. However leading officials clarity of mind he had an appreciation of in this country, notably I think the Chief what he had done. In other words he was Government Medical Officer in Victoria just as confused as the alcoholic who goes and in Western Australia, have given a home drunk and murders his family with figure of about 50 per cent as the percentage a hatchet. He was just as drunk on of cases in wbich alcohol played a part in marihuana. fatal traffic accidents. In recent years Queensland has made it mandatory that all post mortems by government medical harmful in individual cases; 1 am saying officers must include alcohol analysis of that the marihuana problem has not reached the blood, and no doubt this will be one area where we will have some statistics in time. But the point is that alcohol is a lethal substance let loose on the community without medical prescription. A person does not even have to sign a drug register as he does when he buys rat poison, yet alcohol is killing people at an increasing rate each year because alcoholism is increasing, traffic accidents are increasing, and liver disease and the other diseases to which I have referred in this debate are increasing. Getting back to marihuana, there are several consistencies in the data put forKennedy. First of all he lulls us to sleep as the alcoholic and people who are suffering from various other kinds of disorders. I am not saying that marihuana is less the diamensions of the alcohol problem, and it does not look like becoming of those dimensions, because the biggest sector of alcoholism that causes trouble is the alcohol addicts. We have heard in this debate that 5 per cent of males and one per cent of females are addicted to alcohol. We have a problem with alcohol that we are most unlikely to have-perhap s may never have-wit h marihuana. We will never get to the stage where we have addicts with the chronic effects of alcohol. Certainly, there will be people who will keep on resorting to it. Maybe there will be long range effects about which we do not know yet. At this point, I thank the House for sparing me this time and according to my undertaking, I resume my seat. (5.32)-The matter that I want to put before the House is a project that was carried out by the Langton Clinic in Sj'dney. I am a member of the executive of that clinic. The project related to drug addiction. While much has been said on this problem, a Senate report has been issued, ancl much investigation has taken place, I do not know whether anybody has looked at it in the detail involved in this project. It involved some 105 cases, 63 of whom were compulsory patients who had been committed because of drug addiction. The remaining 42 cases were voluntary patients. The whole analysis of that experiment showed that they fell into a pattern in society. All of the unfortunate 105 were under the age of 25 years. Most of them were of superior intelligence. Most of them were involved in group activity. All of them used more than one drug, and most of them, unfortunately, kept lapsing back into drug addiction. The. saviour rate is very small indeed. That brings me to the next matter: Does this legislation meet the particular problem? I submit it does not. To that extent, f agree with the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. At the present time, if a person were to. be found in possession of drugs in New South Wales, he would be dealt with under New South Wales laws. The penalties would be much more harsh than they are here. Of course, if a person were found to be trafficking in a film called 'No Roses for Michael', it was drugs he would be committed to gaol for, an exact example of a youngster who was perhaps, 10 years. How can the problem be solved? In my electorate I have the largest penetentiary in New South Wales. There is more drug abuse and drug addiction within the walls of the penitentiary than outside it. The problem that was mentioned before arises: Does the Parliament do the right thing by society in passing laws which have punitive action if it does not look at the problem and introduce corrective action? If we talk to the police in charge of drug addiction in New South Wales-the y are very valuable personnel-the y can tell us that the crime rate in relation to drug addiction is increasing out of all proportion. They can tell us that not everybody using drugs is an addict. Many such people are peddlers, but behind the whole activity is a syndicate. They refer to what is termed thc 'golden triangle', and the people who are bringing in drugs from the Asian countries. The police bring under notice only some 10 per cent of those who are involved. Honourable members may ask: What is the remedy? I want to emphasise again to the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp), who is absent from the chamber.at the moment, that one of the best methods of preventing any crime is to look at where the money from such crime is going, who is interested in it, and to look at the secret commissions. IfI were to read the latest report of the Commissioner of Taxation for understated incomes, I could point out a large number of criminals who perhaps have never been brought to light. Sb the first onus on a government, particularly when it controls the resources of taxation collection investigation, is to realise that it can identify what might be termed the 'high class criminal element' of Sydney which is well known to the police and which would be known to the Commissioner of Taxation. If that element is deriving its source of income from abuses such as this, why should not that be disclosed to the nation? Why should such people not be brought under control? They are destroying people. They are killing young people Honourable members might recall seeing",53,Customs Bill No 2 1971
120,Mr Lionel Bowen (Kingsford,"Smith)a patient at the Langton Clinic complex. He was found dead at the age of 19 because he was involved in this narcotic problem. I agree with those who say that marihuana is a real problem. 1 must admit that there is a medical view that states that it does not necessarily create medical complications. From the point of view of the Langton Clinic, let me put the position this way: Every addict has used marihuana; not everybody who uses marihuana is an addict. That is a distinction without' much difference, nevertheless it is there. What we should be looking at is the treatment of people who become involved with drugs. This project showed that drug addicts addicted and cannot be got out of it. He never live alone. They are always involved needs to be put in a proper institutionwith a group activity. They have a problem a hospital institution for drug addicts in the sense that thcy are becoming a where he is under complete surveillance problem in society. They feel that by being and is weaned off drugs. It requires a fair involved in a group they can sustain thembit of effort, and the success rate is very, selves and sustain a group psychology that small. In Sydney it would be costing $5,000 they are better than society. This is the a week to run the Langton Clinic. That is biggest basic problem of addicts. Theyhave all taxpayers' money. Of the 105 persons to be taken away from the group before who were the subject of this test, very few any endeavour is made at treatment. Nevermade the grade. Most of them lapsed back theless, of the 105 cases involved in this into Iheir old habits. I ask: Is it not experiment only 40 were what might be appropriate then that the Commonwealth termed 'pushers'. They had been introduced which has all the resources of money to the drug by at least another 50 people available to it should start to deal with the who were not ever brought under notice. problem of drug addiction as it should This is what this legislation should be deal with any other form of addictionaimed at. If we are to help the police of alcohol included?

They which are working with a lot of undershould be told that they will not be allowed cover men and a lot of money. The police out until such time as they show they are have very little resources and not enough interested in improving themselves. It is a personnel. They do not have enough opporwaste of time to say here that this tunities to trap the highly intelligent master legislation will correct drug trafficking. mind criminal. That, for example, applies in Sydney. They get plenty of unfortunates who are addicted. They can bring them prove statistics in relation to the correction under notice. But they say themselves: of crime is to go immediately to the sources 'What is the point in sending them to of money. The statement of the Commission prison? It only makes it worse.' When the of Taxation on assets and liabilities would Parliament reassembles in the new year be one of the best guides as to what is figures will be available from the State happening in society. If it is known that penitentiary to show lhat there is probably a person suddenly has a lot of money availmore drug addiction within the walls of able in bank accounts or cannot explain that penitentiary than anywhere else. This where other assets came from, he should is so only because we have the wrong system of treating criminals, whether they be drug addicts or other types of criminals. Of course, a number of drug addicts are guilty of other crimes. They have to be because they need money and become involved in crimes of theft, breaking and entering and all these other crimes that are problems lo society. 1 come to the point of the amendment: It is no good stating that a 310,000 fine will be imposed and that there will be a 4-year term of imprisonment. This achieves nothing. A person can be placed in an environment where he becomes completely My submission is that the way to imbe brought under notice. If such a person is involved in a racket, it should be publicised in the Parliament. If it involves narThe most offensive people, of course, would cotics, we could send such a person to gaol because he would be no loss to the country. It is no good the Minister saying: ' I am introducing a Bill which has all these penalties which will teach a lesson'. The result in Sydney is a complete contradiction of this. The New South Wales Government introduced similar legislation which contained much harsher penalties last year. It was introduced over 12 months ago. The crime rate in relation to drug addiction, drug peddling and all problems associated with narcotics has increased since then. It is becoming beyond the capacity of the State Government to control this problem -particularl y in relation to LSD-wit h its methods of detection. The police teU me (hat they can find certain members of a syndicate but they cannot find the master minds behind it, because even the members of the syndicate do not know who they are. This is thc information that should be placed before the national Parliament. We bave all the resources of the nation. It is not good enough for officers of the Department of Customs and Excise to say they have caught somebody with a drug and that they will deal with him. Certainly, we should deal with such people. But we can deal with them under the Stale Act, a much more effective Act from the point of view of penalty, but not effective from the point of view of treatment. We ought to ask the Commissioner of Taxation to let the Parliament look at this information to which I have referred. show that at the present time the young Whether it be done by a select committee or otherwise we should see whether large sums of money are going to certain people in society, whether they be criminals or not. We should evolve some method of bringing this information to light. It is no good the Commissioner of Taxation hiding behind a particular section of the Act and saying: i do not have to disclose this because once tbe person has disclosed it to me I have carried out my duty"". As I have emphasised here, we are dealat the Langton Clinic'. It would be found ing with life and death from the point of that not one of them is married. They all view of the people involved and we cannot save them unless we prevent this racket. be the major criminal element. There is no doubt about that because the racket is so lucrative. Yet, as 1 say, we are here discussing whether we are introducing legislation which will be worthwhile. On the question of marihuana, I just want to say from the point of view of the Langton Clinic that we do not favour its use being encouraged in any way, shape or form for the simple reason that the statistics show that every one of the people involved in this experiement had used it and had not limited their experimentation to that particular drug. While I know that there is some excellent medical opinion leaning towards its use there is also some excellent medical opinion to the contrary although there is a difference of opinion as to whether it may or may not be harmful, it is certainly likely to be harmful if a person has any psychotic imbalance. In other words, if a person is likely to be a schizophrenic at 45 he is likely to be one at 25 if he becomes addicted. It is important to show that addiction brings out the weaknesses in a person. We have found in tests of 105 patients in Sydney that some 75 per cent of them had psychiatric disabilities-the y were of that emotional strain. By the same token, most of them were highly intelligent. Very few of them had remained at school long enough to complete their secondary courses. This will show honourable members the insidious nature of this problem. It is a problem introduced to the very young. Statistics females in our society are the group in the most danger, lf one talks to the parents of a child who has been destroyed by being introduced to drug addiction one finds that they would virtually destroy any person who they found endeavouring to peddle drugs to young people. Yet unfortunately the danger for those people is increasing because of the criminal element. So the only reasonable submission to make to the Parliament is to say: 'Have a look at the tests that were made on the 105 people bc.ong to the young age group and I think this is one of the instances where society ought to have a look at how it can save youth. I understand that we are able to deal with thc alcohol problem on the basis that people suffering from alcoholism are u ually in an older age group.

I announced the terms dent and Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the of reference of the inquiry and announced the appointment of Mr Justice Kerr, a Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and of the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to conduct it. Mr Justice Kerr has now presented his report and the Government has considered what action should be taken as a consequence of his recommendations. Before indicating the nature of the legislation I am now presenting, let me say something about Judge Kerr's report and the recommendations he has made. 1 want first to say that we are greatly in debt to Judge Kerr for a report which covers the area of his terms of reference fully and which presents logically and persuasively his conclusions and his recommendations. An increase in the basic salary for member of Parliament from $9,500 to $13,000 is recommended. The recommended salary is linked to the proposal thai there should be regular reviews of parliamentary salaries in future -hel d in the 12 months after each general election. Increases in electorate expenses from 1 $2,750 to $3,200 for senators and members representing city electorates and from $3,350 lo $4,100 for members representing country electorates. No change in the definition of city and country electorates but the opinion probably now go into the urban category.

An increase in the ""Canberra allowance' moderate. There are other considerations paid to members and some office holders mentioned by Judge Kerr in paragraph 104. for sittings of the Parliament in Canberra. He said: Members whose homes are in Canberra receive in future only half the 'Canberra allowance'. Sitting fees for parliamentary committees otherwise do, so lhat Parliamentarians may stand to be discontinued but thc chairmen of some as committees-if not already in receipt of a the example and mitigate their own salary claims salary of office-to receive an annual salary. in the future. I can readily understand the antuA salary for Assistant Whips. '"" New rates of travelling allowance. Specific stamp allowances discontinued but certain oflice holders and Opposition Leaders to receive stamps as required. Judge Kerr was asked in his terms of reference to examine and report upon methods by which parliamentary salaries and allowances may be determined in future. He has canvassed this subject in detail in his report and he has recommended that an independent tribunal be established to report regularly to the Parliament and make recommendations. He has not proposed that any system of automatic adjustments be instituted but that the Parliament should, after the receipt of each report, determine its own course of action. I now come to the Government's consideration of Mr Justice Kerr's recommendations. In the Government's view, the recommendations are eminently fair. They are in no way excessive. Let me quote relevant parts of paragraph 103 of Judge Kerr's report. He said: 1 feci, however, that I can and should go no further in this inquiry than 1 have gone . . . I should say quite simply and directly that equity salaries and salaries of other office holders. and fairness require that thc salary I recommend be paid. It already incorporates within it, as it has always done, an element of monetary concession in the interest-! of preserving the true representational character of Parliament. The percentage salary increases recommended by Judge Kerr compares unfavourably with those received by senior officers of the Commonwealth Public Service over the same period. There are also other comparisons made at various places in the report which show that on salary comparisons and tests the recommendations arc It has been strongly urged by very many members of the public that I should, in these inflationary times, recommend less than I would an example to Ihe community, presumably in the hope that others in the community will follow ment thus presented but it is, as I see it, not sound and would not produce a proper outcome. My task is to fix and recommend a fair and reasonable salary on the lines I have indicated. Members have already made a monetary concession in holding back, though they had the power in their own hands to do otherwise, their entitlement to salary increases while salaries in the community have been rapidly rising. Thcy are among the few in the community who have had no salary increases whatsoever over the last three years. Whatf am recommending, if . adopted, will come to them as part of, and at the end of, a round of salary increases which almost everyone else in the community has already received. These statements are correct. However, we are undoubtedly in a period in which general wage and salary restraint is of critical importance. In these circumstances, it is incumbent on the Government to act with moderation and restraint and by doing so to give leadership. As I have said, Mr Justice Kerr's recommendation is that the basic salary for members of Parliament should move from $9,500 to $13,000-a n increase of $3,500. The Government has decided that it would be appropriate io reduce by $1,000 the amount of the new salary recommended by Judge Kerr. This will mean that the increase which Judge Kerr proposes will be reduced by 28.6 per cent. The Government will also reduce in the same proportion, that is 28.6 per cent, the increases recommended in ministerial I ask for the leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the changes proposed. being no objection, leave is granted.

I recognise that for some members of the Parliament the Government's decision to forgo altogether $1,000 in the recommended increase will mean continued difficulty in meeting financial commitments.

The Tribunal will report on the salaries and the salaries and annual allowances of allowances of Members and Ministers and permanent heads of departments of State matters which are significantly related to these. It will report to the Prime Minister within the 12 months after the assembly of Parliament been varied since 1st December 1968. By following each general election, and the contrast, there have since then been many reports will be tabled in Parliament. There is provision for the Government to ask wealth officials. For example, Second the Tribunal to report at any time on matters Division officers of the Commonwealth falling within the Tribunal's functions. Finally, the Tribunal will make recommendations in September 1969 and November 1971 but will not have authority to make determinations as to salaries and allowances. No and, unlike permanent heads, they also system of automatic adjustment is envisaged.

128,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Prime Minister)Since the current permanent head salaries were approved in 1968, there have been substantial increases in the salaries of heads set up to investigate the abuse of narcotics. of departments in all of the State Public Services. Available data indicates that there have also been significant increases in the salaries of executives in the private sector. It is proposed that the salaries of §19,500 and $22,750 applicable to the majority of officers in this group be increased to $25,000 and $29,250 respectively, with increases of a similar order for related salaries. It is also proposed that the annual expenses of office allowances introduced in 1968 for these officers be increased trom $1,000 to $1,500 to $1,200 and $1,750 respectively. The provisions of the Bill refer to those statutory office holders whose salaries are currently laid down in legislation or whose salaries are now to be included in legislation. As to other statutory office holders, the Government indicated in another place on 25th November 1971 that a compichensive review of legislation provisions for determination of salaries and allowances of statutory office holders is in train, with a view to implementing the general principle that a salary or allowance payable on an annual basis should be specified by Act df Parliament. As this comprehensive review will not be completed until next year, on this occasion it is proposed that adjustments will be made, where appropriate, under existing provisions, as indicated in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. Honourable members are, I am sure, well aware of the heavy demands placed upon the permanent heads of departments of State and comparable statutory office holders, and of the very significant contribution they make to effective public administration. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion Cameron) adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.57 to 8 p.m. Debate resumed (vide page 4310).

The present penalties are adequate from the point of view of any State tribunal and would be enforced by them rather than by any Commonwealth tribunal. It is important for the Commonwealth to make an urgent grant to the States to provide medical facilities for the treatment of drug addicts. These facilities would have to be in certain approved institutions which at the present time virtually do not exist. It is also vital that the Commonwealth grant to the States sufficient financial resources to enable them to back up their police forces in the detection and effective supervision of criminal activities associated with the peddling of drugs. On that note I conclude my remarks. Supply) (8.2)-The Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) has asked me to reply briefly in this debate as he is unavoidably absent. As honourable members will realise, he is very disappointed at not being able to reply to this debate on a matter in which be is particularly interested. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr tion surely to be answered is this: Why Hayden) and other honourable members opposite bave made this afternoon much mention of tbe cause of drug abuse and have suggested that increased penalties are not the final remedy. We have heard similar statements by the Minister for Customs and Excise but we must keep things in perspective. There are probably some 4 avenues by which the problem can be attacked. As I mention these avenues I am sure that honourable members will recognise the importance and place of each. They are: firstly, law enforcement; secondly, treatment; thirdly, education; fourthly, the environment itself. The law enforcement role is to prevent the illicit traffic in drugs. The police and Male Female customs officers have co-ordinated their efforts. Because this avenue is the concern 7 1 of this BillI shall return to it a little later 4 1 on. But let me say now that it is hoped 9 6 that it is one of the short term actions to .. .. .. 10 6 safeguard the community until a more .. .. .. 11 5 14 3 effective long term objective can be 9 3 achieved. The need for treatment facilities .. .. 15 1 is not ignored but one would hope that .. .. 79 26 this will also be a relatively short term necessity. Despite whatever treatment facilities exist we must try to stop the illicit supply of drugs and the creation of new addicts. Of course it is desirable that addicts be treated rather than punished but honourable members must realise that the addict must be willing to be treated. One must remember that the addict selling drugs, the so-called pusher, has to sustain his own habit and thus poses a tremendous threat to society. While recognising the desirability of rehabilitating addicts at the end of the day the question of treatment or penalty must be left to the wisdom of the courts. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) specifically referred to this. Certainly this Bill does not take away from the bench its normal powers. But the longer term avenues for attacking the problem are, of course, education at all levels of society and the environment. I am sure that most honourable members would accept that proposition. . I was a little surprised to hear some comments concerning education. However, I do accept the importance of research. Quite a deal was said about alcohol and tobacco but no argument was advanced about the dangers of these and the quesshould we as a society foster or tolerate a further hazard? On the question of cannabis, certainly there are some doubts about the danger of its use. You can quote from all kinds of publications on this subject but on which one of these authorities or sources do you rely? The Government relies on the World Health Organisation and the United Nations. These bodies say that that drug is dangerous.

132,Mr Garland (Curtin,"Minister forLSD tomorrow. His only interest is in the dollar that he earns from it. Why should such a person be tolerated, as has been submitted? Let me say that it is primarily against these persons that this Bill is directed. The Bill, following consultation between Commonwealth and State experts, has put forward a formula for identifying prima facie a trafficker. He does not deserve to have the sympathy of anyone. He deserves the full rigours of the law and thus the Commonwealth Government has the responsibility to introduce the penalties as agreed with the various State authorities. In conclusion, while 1 accept the good intentions of many arguments put by honourable members opposite and the honourable member for Oxley in particular, I believe the Bill should proceed without delay or amendment fo afford the community the kind of protection that it deserves.

133,( Mr Speaker,"Hon. Sir William Aston)become pointless. Honourable members wiil note that, in effect, what will happen if the amendment is carried is that it will eliminate or omit cannabinoids, cannabis and cannabis resin from Schedule VI and a Schedule VII will be inserted which will be tit ed 'other drug substances' in which : these 3 substances will appear. So, the only effect of the change will be to separate 3 substances from Schedule VI, insert them in a new Schedule VII and add them to the legislation. I think it is important for me to emphasise this. A report last Friday in the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph'-the paper you can trust -by one Alan Reid, who I assume will be dealt, with later in this session, made the point that there was some attempt to remove cannabinoids, cannabis resin from the substances which will be dealt with in this Bill. It is important to point out that, of course, this would not happen. The people who would or could be prosecuted would still be liable to prosecution. The fines or the penalties which can be imposed would be exactly the same as if the substance remained in Schedule VI. The only reason for this amendment is to follow the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse, which presented its report earlier this year. That Committee had a majority of Government members and its chairman was Senator Marriott from Tasmania. Recommendation No. 12, which appears on page 86 of the Committee's report, states: 12. The existing controls classifying cannabis and heroin in tiie same schedule of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs is unfortunate in that a widespread impression has been gained that they are classed as being of equal danger to users, lf controls over cannabis were separated from those applicable to narcotic drugs (particularly heroin) further controversy may be avoided. Recommendation No. 13 referred to the fact that a more lenient approach should be adopted in the case of first offenders. Finally, recommendation No. 14 states: Therefore, the Committee believes that scientific the amendment, but I indicate at the outset evidence is not yet sufficiently conclusive to warrant, with safety to the public, the removal of existing restrictions on the use of any of the canbelieve that the title of tbe Bill, which nabis derivatives. Of course, the Opposition accepts this proposition. It is not prepared to remove restrictions on the use of cannabis and its derivatives. But what it does propose is that at meetings of the World Health Organisation Australia should advocate that a more reasonable proposition should be accepted, as far as the classification of drugs is concerned. I hope that honourable members opposite realise thai we are not in any way attempting to alter the penalties associated with the use of cannabis. I do not want honourable members opposite to get up and say that we are trying to remove the penalties. The penalties will remain exactly the same. The only change we propose is that there should be 2 Schedules in Ihe Bill-on e dealing with narcotic substance and the other one dealing with other drug substances. I personally believe that that is cannabis and in accordance wilh the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee. In fact, if the people with medical knowledge in the Department of Customs and Excise look at the proposed Schedule in the Bill entitled 'Narcotic Substances' they will no doubt see that many of the substances in that Schedule are not strictly narcotic substances. No doubt at some stage they will have to remove some of the substances into a second Schedule, because it is ridiculous to declare something to be something when it is not really that. It is like saying: 'You have been a chicken but you are now a fish', if in fact one is dealing with both the chicken and the fish in exactly the same way. I suggest to honourable members that it is reasonable to implement the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. I do not know whether it is possible, but I would suggest to the Committee that amendments Nos (1), (3) and (4) could be dealt with simultaneously because they follow one another. If amendment No. (1) were accepted, amendments Nos (3) and (4) would have to be accepted also. If, on the other hand, amendment No. (1) were defeated, there would be no point in pursuing amendments Nos (3) and (4). MT JACOBI (Hawker) (8.23)I second that I do not believe it goes far enough. I refers to 'narcotic substances', is totally inadequate, it is inaccurate and, because of those things I believe that it ought to be amended, and I ask the Minister to give consideration to this question. The title of the Bill should be amended so that it reads a Bill for an Act 'To amend tbe Customs Act 1901-1971 in relation to Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances'. I should have thought that it would have been evident to the Government, and above all to the Minister, that one of the arguments which have developed over the last 12 months in relation to the legalisation of marihuana related to the question as to whether it is in fact scientifically a narcotic. The fact that the abuse of these substances can be as socially damaging as the abuse of true narcotics does not convince young people particularly. They reason scientifically. But it is valid to call cannabis, LSD, DMT, cocaine, amphetamines, etc, psychotropic substances. This is one of the reasons why the Act in South Australia has been renamed in order to provide for the clear distinction between opiates-that js narcotics -and other drugs of abuse. It is now clearly known as the Narcotic and Psychotropic Drug Act. The Governor in that State has the power to proclaim any substance that comes within the purview of that Act. The other reason why the name of the Act in South Australia has been changed is that the United Nations is promoting an International Agreement on Psychotropic Substances. This now means, in effect, that the Act in South Australia more clearly becomes a general instrument applicable validly to all drugs of abuse, and the previous apparent pharmacological inaccuracy in the possible grouping of LSD, say, with opium, cocaine and cannabis is avoided. It seems to me that this Government is tending to perpetuate the old inaccuracy by proclaiming even mushroom extractsLSD, scientifically they clearly are not, although they can be equally as dangerous. There is a failure to make this clear distinction, which is clearly acknowledged and defined in the recent report of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse, which states: Tbe Single Convention as its name implies covers only the so called narcotic drugs and in the recognition that there are other drugs of dependence the member nations met during 1970 and 1971 and drew up a further Convention to impose controls on psychotropic substances such as hallucinogens, amphetamines, other central nervous system stimulants, barbiturates, tranquillisers Commission on Narcotic Drugs which was and certain other sedatives. Tbe Committee fully supports Australian participation in this Convention whicb is now available for signature. It suggests that tbe Connnonwealth Government and State Governments take the necessary steps so that Australia can ratify the new Convention as soon as possible. In making this suggestion the Committee is aware of the 5 year delay which occurred between Australia's signature and ratification of the 1961 Convention. A similar delay would be intolerable, in the Committee's view. The failure to make this clear distinction, in my view, discredits this whole piece of legislation in the eyes of many people, particularly those in the Government in South Australia wbo are fully conscious of other Acts and of the fact that there is an international acceptance of the distinction which is clearly made between narcotic and psychotropic substances. If the law is going to use a technical term such as narcotic, it needs to apply it only to drugs which actually are narcotic, and the law, to be technically and legally sound, must use another technical term for drugs of abuse which are not narcotic, and the international term for those drugs is psychotropic substances. This question must be made clear to people so that they recognise what is a scientific and indeed a legally adopted fact-that the law recognises differences in drug actions and is not trying to use a blanket term which is inaccurate. Of course, in addition the law also recognises the social dangers of these drugs as being parallel. In my view the blatant use of such inaccurate and incorrect title, terms or definitions in such an important piece of legislation leaves much to be desired, and the Minister, I am convinced, is fully conscious of the situation. What will flow from this situation are the arguments which will etc -to he narcotics when be conjured up by a great majority of the people-and on this aspect they will be totally justified-wil h the sole aim of discrediting and evading the law. In effect, the law becomes an instrument which will largely defeat the very aims which this Government seeks to achieve, that is, that the penalties for the use and possession of heroin should be the same as for marihuana. These people believe that there should be different penalties for different drugs. In order to substantiate my pointthe Minister and the Government ought to be aware of itI refer to thc report of the presented to the First Special Session of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in January 1970. Clause2 (e) under the heading 'The Revised Draft Protocol on Psychotropic Substances' states: 'Psychotropic substance' means any substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural material listed in ScheduleI , IT, III or IV. The Schedules clearly set out what are narcotic drugs and what are psychotropic substances. I now refer to the report of the International Narcotics Control Board on its work in 1970. At page 19 it states: There is mounting and widespread concern over thc increasing misuse of drugs such as stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, which affect the central nervous system. This feature of the general problem has engaged the close interest of the Board since the early sixties and in 196S it gave warning of the dangers which such misuse represents to public health. In the intervening 5 years the abuse of these substances has grown both in extent and complexity. It concludes by stating: It is clear that this sector of trade in dangerous (1), (3) and (4) on the list of amendments substances is not amenable to the same pattern of control measures as were found appropriate in circulated by the honourable meniber for respect of narcotic substances. The provisions of Oxley( Mr Hayden). Honourable gentlethe draft protocol have been framed in the light men who have spoken feel that cannabis, of this realisation. In other words, the Bill both in title and in narcotics should be described or listed definition ought to provide for 2 distinct differently from narcotics such as heroin. areas, one with respect to narcotics and the While the amendment may place cannahis, other relating to psychotropic substances. I conclude on ihis point: The same problem arises here as arose with cannabinoids. The position in South Australia was exactly the same as the position that will exist under this Bill. Unless the Bill in fact provides scientifically and legally what we say thc Bill should state-namely , 2 descriptions, narcotics and psychotropic drugs-it will not be possible in a prosecution before a court to obtain a reasonable judgment. I am very much afraid lhat this Bill for that prupose is totally inadequate. That was the situation in South Australia over the last 4 or 5 years. In that State to separate not only cannabis, cannabis what is now internationally accepted has resin and cannabinoids but also other been adopted. While the ratification of the drugs listed in Schedule VI which also are convention has proceeded, at least Sou'.h not narcotics in the true sense, sucb as Australia has looked ahead to see what has LSD and cocaine. While the terms 'narcotic been the internationally accepted situation goods' and 'narcotic substance' might and it is that which, in my view, ought to not be ideal, fhe u^e of terms such as be incorporated in this Bill. Summing up, 3 factors are involved with these 2 descriptive terms. Indeed, drugs respect to this amendment. The States such as cannabis and cocaine have for a through their enactments to my knowledge long time been commonly referred to as have now adopted the 2 terms used internationally in the convention which Australia will ratify. We will find that we will need to make an alteration to the Bill in this respect. Finally, I refer to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. I am convinced now that the Government has not given any consideration to that report or has failed to peruse the document. Supply) (8.32) As I said earlier, the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) is very sorry that he is not able to be .here to take part in this debate tonight. Honourable members are aware of his interest in this matter. The Government is unable lo accept this amendment at this time, although the Minister certainly will examine Hansard closely to see the various suggestions which have been made and the arguments that have been put. In my remarks now, I will refer to amendments cannabis resin and cannabinoids not being cannabis resin and cannabinoids in a separate schedule, in fact by definition these remain narcotic substances. As the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) mentioned, this does not affect the penalty provisions in any way. I appreciate the motives which prompt this part of the amendment, but I would assure honourable members that the terms 'narcotic substance' and 'narcotic goods' are purely descriptive. They merely describe the various drugs. To be consistent it would be necessary 'drugs of abuse' could be equally debatable. There is nothing sinister in the use of",67,Pairs

In our opinion a more appropriate descriptive term than it imposes a quite unreasonable burden of 'narcotic'. It is believed that no good purresponsibility on an accused which is pose is served by providing a separate contrary to the general principles of schedule for cannabis, cannabis resin and British justice.

139,Mr Hayden (Oxley) (8.37),"Th eand commerce section. It is said that the Government derives power there. Certainly from my understanding of the law, confirmed by many people, we would gain the power by the authority that we derive under the Constitution from international agreements and through our signing of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, an international convention. Under Article 35 of that Convention there is an obligation on signatory countries to take appropriate action against illicit drug traffic. Article 35 able, and the defendant must be acquitted. Subject is a fairly wide-sweeping power which I believe would give the Commonwealth Government the sort of authority to legislate completely in the area at which it is aiming here and this would remove any doubt. I find it hard to accept the argument that the Department of Customs and Excise should, having exhausted all reasonable grounds of suspicion-to use the wording here-hav e to hand a person suspected of possessing a prohibited import over to the State police for them to go through the same procedure again. That is to me a completely cumbersome and unjustifiable system of justice. Apart from anything else, it seems to be quite unfair and unreasonable to subject a suspect to that sort of thing. In any event, those are not the crucial already covered under the preceding subfeatures about which we are arguing. What section of the principal Act. I move: we are arguing about in regard to this clause is that it throws the onus of responsibility for disproving a prosecution allegation on to a suspect. As I understand it, to oppose the amendment. I am concerned the general principle has been that the more that the Australian Labor Party should serious the offence the greater should be really lend its name to an amendment of the onus of proof on the prosecution. Under this nature. I believe it to be a thoroughly section 233B (1.) (a) of the principal Act ill considered amendment. I say that with the degree of proof required is defined in due respect to the honourable member for this way: It is not necessary for the proseOxley( Mr Hayden), who proposed it.

I contravention of the Act. The imhave never known of any Labor governportant ingredient is that it is not necessary ment in any State or in the Commonwealth for the prosecution to prove that the goods sphere asking for those provisions to be in his possession had been imported into repealed. When one comes to consider it, the country, which conflicts with the printhe clause whicb the Australian Labor ciple enunciated in the case of Kenny versus Party, through its spokesman, proposes to O'Sullivan-reporte d in 1953 in the South Australian State Law Reports 45-befor e the Full Supreme Court of South Australia. Mr Justice Abbot expressed this view in relation to a prosecution which rested on suspicion only: Tlie facts in the prosecutor's case from which the suspicion is engendered must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, otherwise the suspicion cannot be a reasonable one. If, at (he conclusion of the whole case, a doubt is raised as to the truth of these facts, the suspicion ceases to be reasonto that, if a reasonable suspicion of the guilt of the defendant has been aroused in the mind of the magistrate or justices tbe defendant must be convicted, unless further facts are elicited which either entirely remove that suspicion or at least persuade the special magistrate or justices that such suspicion as he or they still has or have is something less than a reasonable suspicion and therefore too fanciful to warrant a conviction. ln other words, the obligation under the Customs Act is a much more demanding one on the accused. In the case of suspicion only, as enunciated in the South Australian case to which I have referred, the responsibility was on the prosecution. The Opposition believes that that is where the responsibility always should rest. It is for this reason that it has decided to pose the proposition which has been circulated. One final thing I would like to say insofar as imports and exports are concerned is that they are Omit paragraph (b).",71,Pairs
140,Mr Hughes (Berowra) (8.45),"I riseomit from this very important piece of legislation is in the same vein as the type of section to which I have referred. But the clause which the Labor Party seeks to omit from this legislation is a clause which, if passed by the Parliament, would operate in an enormously significant field-significant because this legislation is fraught with grave consequences for good in protecting the Australian community, particularly young people, against the abuses that can arise from narcotics. An examination of the clause that the Opposition wants taken out of this Bill shows that it is a completely reasonable provision. If this clause stands the Crown in a prosecution will need to prove that narcotic substances found in the possession of a suspected person are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia in contravention of the Act. I emphasise the word 'reasonably'. The use of that word is to import a completely objective as opposed to subjective standard. It is not the standard of a policeman who thinks he might be reasonable; h is tbe standard of the tribunal. The tribunal bas to be satisfied in its own mind, whether it be judge or jury, that the suspicion is reasonable, fs there anything wrong with that when one is dealing not witb tbe relatively unimportant subject of goods suspected of having been stolen but with some of the most dangerous substances known to mankind? I think the Opposition would do very well to reconsider its position and, hopefully, withdraw the amendment. It would redound to its credit if it did. I come now to my next step. The Crown having had to discharge the onus of showing that there is an objectively reasonable suspicion that these drugs have been imported into Australia could have its case destroyed by the accused, who happens to be in the happy position of knowing himself all the relevant facts-fro m the very nature of the offence he would know all tbe relevant facts-provin g that he had reasonable excuse for the possession of these narcotics.

The Narcotic Drugs Act includes reference to the fact that the Commonwealth has ratified this Single Convention, and one of the clauses of that Convention-claus e 30, from memory-provide s for total control of all the drugs listed in schedule 1 of that Convention. In turn schedule 1 includes a very wide range of drugs, most of which are parallel to the drugs in the present Bill. It includes, for example, cannabis, although questions have been raised as to whether that is really a narcotic, and includes all the obvious narcotics, heroin in particular. Virtually the only drugs which the schedule in the Single Convention does not include and which are to be found in the present Bill are the psychotropic drugs such as LSD. The foreign affairs power of the Comas to the manner and extent to which there monwealth allows conventions to be ratified has been a short fall in that co-operation? and acted upon and in that way to expand the power of the Commonwealth.

153,Mr Hayden (Oxley) (9.4),"I was interattitudes on anything that the Labor Party had put forward. I am awfully pleased that he has changed. He mentioned the subject of centralism and tried to turn the edge against members of the Labor Party by arguing that we were taking a decentralist line. But the honourable member missed the essential point I was making to him. 1 made it with great respect and considerable deference, which is uncharacteristic, but nonetheless appropriate because of his learned background. Now that he has returned to the chamber he might be kind enough fo deliberate on the question I asked him because he has been rather volatile in his speech. No doubt a great deal Offences Act in that State for possession of of the energy that he picked up from a chemical charge during the dinner break enabled htm to do this. I suggest to the honourable member for Oxley that he stick to the subject matter before the Committee. tility is still present, would the honourable meniber mind discussing the point that I mentioned and which has been taken up again by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Berinson)? That is the sort of power and authority that the Federal Government derives as a result of its signing the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. I ask him to consider this Convention in conjunction with the authority in relation to external affairs under section 51, placitum (xxix) of the Constitution and relate this specifically to article 33, possession of drugs, which stales that the parties shall not permit the possession of drugs except under legal authority. Taking that with other provisions of. this Convention, it would seem all of these things together give considerable power to the Federal Government. Why does the Government therefore waste time with this cumbersome, sloppy way of legislating which states that there must be a reasonable suspicion of drugs having been imported when it could make a clear charge that a person has a drug in his possession. At least, this is the interpretation which one takes from all of these sources which I have quoted. I speak as a layman, but I do so with some confidence. The honourable member for Berowra will never believe this, but there are other opinions regarded at least as equally eminent as his in the community and which conform with this attitude I am conveying. It will be even more surprising to him that at least equally as eminent opinions in some cases rest in .the ranks of his own Party. No doubt, this would be a point that he would contest with great vigour, but these people would assert the opposite view just as vigorously. There are 2 other points 1 take with him: Whether he likes it or not, there is considerable feeling amongst at least some sections of the legal fraternity in Queensland-.the y are not small in number by any means-that somewhat similar provision under the Vagrants, Gaming and other property reasonably suspected of being stolen have, in fact, been abused in certain cases by the prosecution. We do not want to see this sort of thing happen here. That is the first point. The second point is this: Why, in any event, have this sloppy, cumbersome way of drafting this Bill when it seems that the Federal Government has authority to clearly define offences for possession of a drug? When the Government has this authority, wh;does it not take it up and make sure there are no evasive opportunities which can be exploited by offenders-the Labor Party has no truck with them-who , as I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate, are trafficking for profit to the grave detriment and the personal physical and mental destruction of other people? I invite the honourable member to advise us whether the Federal Government has this power. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 8.

For a change, it is not a proposition advanced on the question of civil liberties with which they are not usually concerned. But it is the sort of proposition that ought to be acceptable to such honourable members as the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) who claims to feel strongly about drug pushers. As. I asked earlier this afternoon: What do we get in this proposed legislation? We ,jet a schedule of narcotic substances with a trafficable quantity. As the explanatory memorandum from the Minister states, we have 2 types of penalties, one not exceeding a fine of $4,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, and another of a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for 2 years, the intention being that the lower penalty will be for users and the higher penalty for pushers. But the question of defining pushers is not gone into properly by this legislation. The Bill proposes that the higher levei of penalty-that is 10 years imprisonment and a $4,000 fine-will be applicable only in respect of an offence which involves a quantity of a narcotic substance whicb, by reference to the proposed Schedule in clause 9 of the Bill, is a trafficable quantity. So we come to the position that unless a person is caught with a quantity equal to or in excess of a trafficable quantity he can be penalised only up to the point provided in what would be section 235 (1.) (d), whicb is a fine of $2,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years. I put to the House this afternoon, with the help of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr offence was committeda fine not exceeding Katter), that if a person is caught redhanded and admits to having pushed 10 Pethedine tablets, this being a quantity less than the quantity provided as a trafficable quantity, and having sold that quantity to honourable member for Kennedy likes to refer so frequently in his speeches crippled. pregnant school girl. But I think we should be serious about this, just the same. We are dealing here with a pedlar. Let us be quite clear about this. A person is tablets to a young person. If we regard this as the worse type of crime as far as pushing is concerned, and I think most of us would probably agree on that general proposition, under the proposed legislation that person can be penalised by imprisonment for 2 years only under section 235 (1.) (d), yet if another person is in possession of 25 Preludin tabletsI referred this afternoon to Preludin tablets, the type which the honourable member for Kennedy takes but takes infrequently to decrease his appetite and this is only a sufficient quantity for him for a fortnight-h e could be prosecuted and unless he could show reasonable cause, and I accept that proposition, he could be sent to gaol for 10 years. I think he and everybody else would agree that this is a significant omission from this Bill. 1 am sure the people who drafted the Bill did not intend that a person who is a pusher of narcotic substancesany of the substances mentioned-bu t who at any one time has in his possession less than that trafficable quantity, should be subject only to tbe maximum penalty for using. If he is an intelligent pusher from now on he will carry with him just less than the trafficable quantity. I will be interested to hear the Minister's explanauon for this. But the proposition I am putting to honourable members is that after paragraph (c) of the proposed sub-section (1.) we insert a paragraph; (ca) which will read: . . . where the narcotic goods in relation to which the offence was committed consists of a quantity of narcotic substance . . . and where the court is satisfied that the offence was committed by the person charged for any purpose related to the sale of, or other commercial dealing in, the narcotic goods in relation to which the Four thousand dollars or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years . ..

Supply) (9.15)I accept the motives of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and I understand the force of the proposition which he is putting. However, the provisions of clause 8 derive from the agreement which has been reached between the Commonwealth and State governments and therefore we could not accept this amendment at this time. In any event, there would be a need to consider more carefuUy the drafting of such an amendment if it were proposed. The only suggestion I can make is that the Commonwealth and State governments would have to consider this proposition jointly in the future. If it was agreed fo we would consider a draft which, with respect to the honourable member, would need to be somewhat more tightly drawn than the amendment is. With those few remarks, I say again that the Government opposes this amendment.

He cannot see the difference in ridiculous, 1 agree. Let us not pretend that quantities. I partially agree that 'once a this Bill will help the Government treat pedlar, always a pedlar'. It would not matter drug addicts. Surely the real purpose of this whether a person was peddling one gram Bill is to catch Mr Big, to catch the people or 100 grams, but the facts of life arc that there are different penalties for different types of crimes. I conclude by saying that I believe that the honourable member's speech was nothing but another attempt to ridicule the entire Bill. Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) (9.17)I am sorry 1 must rise to answer the suggestion made by the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron). The essential thing that worries one about the drug problem is the fact that one individual tries to persuade other people to use the stuff. That is what worries us. If1 had a ton of morphine on me and I used the lot for myself and finally expired, that is my problem. 1 have committed suicide, which is not an uncommon occurrence unfortunately. But if as has been indicated by my colleague, I make sure that 1 do not have enough on me to be nicked and then line up outside the school gate when the kids come out after school and sell them nice lollies, if I am caught all I can be charged with-becaus e of the definition of the quantity-is having a drug for my own use and not peddling.

It fits into the very first part of the amendment we have proposed to the Bill, which amendment is concerned with the problem of people pushing drugs onto other people.

Jenkins, H . A. I do not intend to go into a long, involved Johnson, Keith argument about this. The simple point I Johnson, Les wish to make is that the schedule at the moment is headed 'Narcotic Substances' but Kennedy, A. D. it contains a number of substances which Keogh, L. J. are not narcotics at all. In addition, there Kirwan, F. McL. has been a specific recommendation from Luchetti, A. S. our own Senate Select Committee on Drug Martin, V. J. Trafficking and Drug Abuse which ties up Patterson, R. A. with recent suggestions from the World Scholes, G. G. D. Health Organisation that is, that cannabis, Sherry, R. H . cannabinoids and cannabis resin should not Stewart, F. E. be included with narcotics for the same reasons that amphetamines, and some of the Webb, C. H . other drugs already in this list, should not be included. Other drugs in the list are Tellers: LSD and preludin. I could continue but James, A. W. there is no point in going through these technical things. If we omit the words 'narcotic substances' from the heading of the Schedule it will still do all that the Government intended it to do. It will not change anything at all. It will simply remove an anomaly in terminology.

Honourable members and members of the community in general are aware of the desperate situation in Pakistan and the miserable efforts made by this Government towards the alleviation of that situation. We have done very little indeed in a situation such as the world has been confronted with on very few occasions. Some 10 million people are refugees on the borders of India and Pakistan. Those 10 million people are deprived of the barest necessities of life. All that we have been able to offer over the last few months, and in a very dilatory and haphazard fashion, is a small amount of money, some aid, and lately some blankets.

We were told by a senior member of the Australian diplomatic service a few weeks ago lhat what the people needed most was blankets. This is logical enough. In the Press statedirecting my attention to Division 250, ment issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs we were informed that it was urgent that we get blankets to them, so we sent off a couple of Boeings loaded with blankets. We sent off about 35,000 blankets to ameliorate the misery of some 10 million people. What is the situation in Australia? Over the last few months we have spent millions acquiring wool. We have some of the best wool in the world. On the general standard of production the Australian spinning, knitting and weaving industry produces about the world's best blankets. This induspolicy of the Government. These matters try can produce them by the thousands. We have 700,000 or more bales of wool in store. We have paid for all that wool, as far as I can tell. The experts have told me that we use about 6 Ib of greasy wool to a blanket. I have no way of checking on this, but that is a rough estimate. So every bale of wool could produce perhaps 50 or 60 blankets. We could use 200,000 bales just for the manufacture of blankets for the people of Pakistan. I place this before tbe House as a matter spoken about 30 of them on the question of to which we ought to turn our attention. It is not just a question of solving one problem for ourselves. It is a question of showing the kind of initiative in the world that is needed, and I only use that as the barest example. WhatI am concerned about is the total diplomatic inactivity of the Australian Government, its foreign affairs and its diplomatic service in tbe present situation. The situation has changed dramatically for the worse. In a few weeks time it may well be that a new nation will be born-Bangl a Desh. It has been born already but it has not been recognised by Australia. I bave no doubt that if that country had been taken over by the most Fascist, reactionary group of colonels this side of the North Pole Australia would have recognised it within 30 seconds flat, as we did tbe Greek Government. However, within a few months time it is likely to be recognised by a number of nations and it will be the beginning of a new nation. 1 point out to the honourable member for Wills that the recognition of Bangla Desh is a political factor and that matter is noi under discussion. Administrative, No. 5, International Development and Relief-Emergency Relief for Pakistani Refugees. able member for Wills was talking about the recognit.on of Bangla Desh which has no relationship to the expenditure for the past year. The honourable member for Wills was mentioning relief to the refugees and various other factors associated with it, but the honourable member then extended his comment to the political situation and the recognition of Bangla Desh and relating this to the foreign affairs have nothing lo do with the expenditure under discussion. Chairman, you, of course, have the advantage of me and I will bow to your greater wisdom. I will wait until you are the honourable member for Lyne. I will be speaking for 10 minutes. I speak at somewhere between 150 and 180 words a minute. I will use, in the course of this debate, more than 1,500 words. I have Bangla Desh which is incidental to this because the new community is going to have some of the greatest human problems of all time. Over the last 8 months it has been stricken with a tidal wave disaster which cost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of lives; it has been stricken with famine, with civil war and now with war.

There will be greater incapacity than ever on the part of the Governments of India and of whatever one calls it-Bengal, Bangla Desh or East Pakistan-to handle the situation. Yet, the Australian Government shows no sensitivity whatsoever and this document shows a sum of only $200,000. 1 do not know what that involves. Perhaps it means the charter of one Boeing aircraft to take a load of blankets or something else there. 1 believe that it is important that Australia turns its attention to this problem. The situation has changed dramatically. The world situation is changing dramatically. The international situation is changing in such a way that it will only be by the diplomatic initiative of countries such as Australia that these problems will be solved. Therefore, I hope that the Government and the Committee will take note of this and that we will have some supplementary action to ensure lhat the emergency relief for Pakistan does not remain at this miserable low level.

Ministerial Statement the Army)-by leave-Earlie r in the session I indicated my intention of making a statement to the House on the Citizen Military Forces, its role, its place in the community, its problems and, hopefully, some solutions to these problems. It is not my purpose here to enlarge upon the strategic situation and the basis of defence planning, but I feel that by way of background to my remarks on the CMF and its importance to our overall defence structure, I should attempt to sketch in, very briefly, the situation in which we find ourselves in what is fast becoming the post-Vietnam era. The withdrawal of Britain as a key power in the South East Asian area, together with the implications of the Nixon Doctrine, have important consequences for Australia. It is clear that we as a small but highly developed nation, must accept an increasing share of responsibility in defence arrangements with our friends and allies in the region-and for our own defence. The basic function of the Army remains the same-the conduct of operations on land for the defence of Australia and Australia's interests. Manpower and economic limitations mean we cannot expect to be able to maintain, in times of peace, the regular forces likely to be required to meet every situation with which we might be confronted. We now have to provide for a great variety of politico-military situations, including subversion, insurgency, revolutionary warfare and other types of low intensity conflict. There is an obvious need for a strong and viable CMF to augment the Regular Army in time of defence emergency or war and, with the Regular Army, to provide the basis for expansion of the whole Army upon general mobilisation. Let me make it quite clear that the very essence of the CMF's role and value is that its members are liable for call-up for service overseas in a period of defence emergency. It is a vital part of our defences; those who serve in it, whether as a conseor not. are playing their part in accordance with the Government's intentions. Historically, citizen soldiers have taken a leading part in providing the military forces for the defence of Australia. Indeed, until after the Second World War our field forces in peacetime were almost entirely those of the CMF. This traditon of voluntary military service was seen at its finest during the First and Second World Wars, and it has been carried on by the CMF since it was reformed in 1948. The Regular Army, with a field force component, was raised in 1948 and the role of the CMF then became fhat of providing the initial supplementary forces which would be needed in a major war. Since that time, as the Regular Army developed its capability, and particularly since the regular force has achieved something approaching a divisional structure of 9 infantry battalions, it would seem there is now a school of thought that believes Australia no longer needs her citizen soldiers. This is not so. Australia is a vast and sparsely populated country bordering an area of possible political instability. It is a nation faced witb exciting and exacting development problems",81,Advance To The Treasurer
174,Mr Peacock (Kooyong,"Minister forthat will place great demands on all our resources-includin g that most scarce and valuable resource, manpower. The needs of defence must be weighed against the needs of other high priority tasks. It is against this background that the Government has fostered the development of Regular forces, which are within the capability of Australia to maintain. However, the Government accepts that the Regular Force, by its very nature and because of manpower limitations in peace time, can provide only the first element necessary to meet a major defence emergency. To meet such a situation, it is essenproblem of obtaining and retaining the tial for the Army to have both Citizen Forces and Reserves to augment the Regular element, particularly in providing trained to which I will refer. On balance, a high leaders and specialists. Full realisation of our proposals for the CMF must be dependent on the Government's ability to provide the necessaryfinancefor the purpose. The Citizen Military Forces, trained in and capable of playing their part in a defence emergency or war, are an essential element in our defence planning. 1 stress this point not only because I wish to place the importance of the CMF iu proper perspective for honourable members and the public generally, but also because I wish to get the message through to the 'hard core' of officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers, whose dedication through the years, often in the face of adverse criticism and morale destroying cynicism, has sustained the flame of the old volunteer spirit and held the CMF together as a viable institution. We owe them a great deal and they will need our continued support for their efforts in the future. HereI wish to mention one important concept which could improve the CMF's capability of contributing quickly in response to any situation of defence emergency. There is a proposal, which in one form or another has come from a number of sources, to establish within the CMF a force which would be brought to a higher degree of readiness than is possible with the CMF as a whole. Such a force would receive a higher priority for training facilities and equipment and be the first element of the CMF to be deployed in an emergency. Considerable thought has been given to the practicability of setting up a higher priority force of some kind, and feasibility studies have recently been conducted within the CMF aimed at developing a viable proposition. It appears that such a force, capable of deployment on relatively short notice, would necessarily have to be made up of sub-units drawn from a number of parent units throughout Australia. There are obvious problems, such as the difficulty of effective training with geographically dispersed sub-units; the possible need for longer training periods to maintain operational efficiency, which might not be supported by some employers; and the basic necessary numbers, which is, of course, part of the general CMF manpower problem, priority formation would have a great deal to commend it, not the least of which, as I have said, would be the CMF's ability to contribute rapidly and effectively to any operational tasks which might be required of it. Provided there is careful planningand, of course, the enthusiastic support and co-operation of the CMF members themselves-mos t of the problems can be overcome; I believe the merits of the proposal are such as to outweigh any residual difiiculties. As a consequence, I am pleased to be able to announce that approval has been given for the establishment of a higher priority force within the CMF to be known as the Ready Reaction Force, and detailed planning to give practical effect to this decision is proceeding as rapidly as possible. Much remains to be done; and at this stage of development I am unable to give precise details of the shape and size this force will finally take. It will be an evolutionary process, beginning in a small way and expanding progressively as experience dictates and in accordance with the response received from all concerned. I firmly believe that the scheme, if it receives the support it undoubtedly deserves, will not only be of benefit to the motivation and morale of CMF members, but will also be a milestone in the development of the CMF. I would now like to refer to the decline in CMF strength, mentioned in the recent Defence Report, whicb has been the subject of study over the past months. CMF officers from formations and units, as well as regular officers from all Australian commands were consulted; and the views of leading academics, employers' organisations, and many private citizens and organisations were obtained. During this period the 2nd and 3rd CMF Divisions each conducted conferences, which I attended, at which the shortfall in CMF enlistments and retention rates, and the likely under-lying motivating factors, were discussed at length by a cross-section of experienced CMF officers. It is clear that wastage is traditionally high in respect of the volunteer element and over the past 10 years discharges have averaged around 10,000 per year. The main reason behind such a consistently high wastage rate is believed to be that the CMF members' tenure of service has become more generally sensitive to factors related to their personal affairs, such as marriage, increased family responsibilities, business or educational commitments and transfers in civil employment. In the next 6 months, jt is anticipated that further wastage will occur as a result of the cut from 6 to 5 years in the length of service required as an alternative to national service. In addition, recruiting figures, which were relatively stable in the years 1960 to 1967, have fallen from a peak of 13,800 in 1965-66 to 7,060 in 1970-71. As might be expected, the reasons advanced for the decline in recruiting, some of which have their effect on retention, cover a wide spectrum embracing 2 broad categories-thos e of external and general community origin and those internal to the Army itself. It would not be practicable or appropriate here to try to cover all these aspects in detail, and I will confine my remarks in this respect to outlining some of the more important points. On the internal side, if we are going to be realistic, we must first of all accept the fact that if the CMF is to attract and hold young men, it must be seen to be modern in its outlook. This outward promise must also be fulfilled when the new recruit actually arrives. Contrary to the cherished beliefs, perhaps, of some old soldiers of earlier wars and earlier times, the Australian Army does change, and has been at some pains to ensure that its procedures and man management methods are both modern and enlightened. The key point is to ensure that in the process of modernisation, discipline and individual efficiency are maintained at the level necessary to ensure operational efficiency in the event of war and to prevent the lives of Australian soldiers being endangered unnecessarily. In my discussions with CMF commanders it was clear they considered it most important to keep to a minimum the sort of minor irritations that can arise in part-time Service life. In this I have given them every encouragement. Another aspect interna] to the Army, on which a great deal of emphasis has been placed, is the quality of the training a CMF member receives. Imaginative, effectively organised and executed training is a most important factor in maintaining high morale and individual interest, as well as achieving operational efficiency. The preparation for training exercises of this calibre often tends to fall quite heavily on the shoulders of CMF officers and NCO's and is not always compatible in terms of time with their career responsibilities and their inevitable social obligations. Greater efforts will be made to improve the strength, calibre iind effectiveness of the Australian Regular Army cadre supporting staffs in CMF units, so as to relieve the units of as much routine administration as possible and also enable thc cadre staffs to contribute more fully to training preparation. To gain maximum benefits from these cadre staffs, their appointments should be of sufficient duration for the unit to gain from their experience and they should attend a special familiarisation course before taking up their appointments. Neither of these requirements has been implemented previously because of the Vietnam commitment, but the situation should ease from now on. We should also be able to increase gradually the seniority and experience level of the Regular Army members involved. For the past 12 months or so, an Army organisation and methods team has been reviewing CMF administrative procedures and another team has been similarly reviewing unit accounting procedures, with the object of reducing the administrative load on units to a minimum. The Vietnam commitment also reduced the number of vacancies available to the CMF at Army schools. Attendance at these schools is important for CMF members to enable them to keep pace witb current doctrine and techniques. With the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam, this situation is now being corrected and more vacancies are being made available to CMF members. We have also been looking closely at what additional training assistance Regular Army units can give to the CMF and this is being further examined in the light of the implications of the reduction of national service to 18 months. A major step forward has been the production of CMF officers at centralised officer training units and in university regitraining for which facilities do not exist in ments. This has proved extremely successful and demonstrated its advantages over the old unit system. The main advantage is that uniform standards are achieved. Centralisation also allows students to concentrate on their officer training without being interrupted by the routine tasks inherent in regimental duties. In a recent survey within the CMF. all those interviewed were quite adamant that the young CMF officer being produced by the officer training units is a far better product than his fellow in the past. Regular Army officers support this appraisal and are satisfied with the professional standards which have been reached by CMF officers who are required to pass the same promotion exams as their regular counterparts. The training of CMF soldiers in remote areas has also been improved with the success of the units popularly known as the Bushman's Rifles. Normal short camps and night parades were replaced in these units by centralised and continuous training at longer camps with resulting economies in time and effort and higher standards of training and morale. It appears that similar advantages might also apply to a centralised system of producing CMF NCO's, and a feasibility study of establishing such a system is now under way. One proposal also being studied is to establish a special wing of command training groups to conduct courses designed to train and qualify potential NCO's in leadership, instructional techniques and sub-unit administration at the level required for first promotion. The centralisation of recruit training into larger points that 1 believe should be made. groups, now the practice in most capital and provincial cities, has also produced benefits in increased efficiency in training procedures and in boosting morale in the important first few months of the new member's service. There have been various schemes for improving the operational efficiency of the CMF, which may not be generally known. For. example, 600 CMF officers have visited Vietnam since 1967 to spend 10 to 12 days as observers with Regular troops; annually since 1968, selected CMF officers have visited the mainland of New Guinea to familiarise themselves with the terrain and to help plan their tropical warfare training programmes; additionally, interstate training facilities may be arranged where it is necessary for particular types of the unit's home State. The benefit to the CMF from the flow-on of the experience gained under these schemes, particularly from Vietnam, has been felt already and will have a continuing effect. Other elements in the improvement of training, attracting and retaining recruits, are greater availability of modern equipment, improved training depots and better facilities for CMF units. These are of course bound up with monetary allocations and the inevitable priorities, which in some cases have had to be given in other directions, notably to tbe Vietnam operations and associated requirements. These are complex matters and, at this stage, I can only say that every effort has been and wilt continue to be made to equip and house CMF units to the best of our ability in the light of resources, having increasing regard to such changes in priorities to the benefit of CMF units that may become possible as the Vietnam withdrawal proceeds. Some notable improvements in the CMF equipment fields include the provision of the M l 13 family of light armoured fighting vehicles to Armoured Corps CMF units; the issue of modern radio sets; and the issue of combat jackets to infantry, armoured, artillery and signal units, and university regiments and officer cadet training units will also receive the latest pattern web equipment, and adequate stocks of lightweight sleeping equipment are now becoming available. Before concluding my remarks on the internal Army side, there are two other Firstly, it must be borne in mind that the Government's 'one Array' policy means that the CMF cannot be looked at in isolation from the rest of the Army. The Regular, Citizen and Reserve forces are complementary parts of the whole Army, each with their assigned role. In examining the feasibility of proposals involving changes, regard must be had for the problems facing the Army generally. I mention this matter merely to give some idea of the scope and complexity of the problems with which we are coping, in what might be called the preliminary stages of thc postVietnam era, and to counsel a little patience on the part of those who might be anticipating rather more rapid and, perhaps, spectacular action in the CMF field than at present may be feasible. However. I can give an assurance that the matters mentioned in my remarks today, and many others besides, will be pursued vigorously. The second point 1 wish to make concerns another important part of our reserve forces, the Regular Army Reserve, and its significance in regard to our security. The CMF would benefit here from better As a preliminary, I should mention that the decline in CMF strengths has not been right across the rank structure. There has, in fact, been a small but steady increase in oflicers, which is expected to continue. Senior NCO's have declined very little. The main deficiency has been in the rank and file although even in this category there have been increases in Darwin, North Queensland and Papua New Guinea. In other words, the decline has not seriously affected the CMF's vital task of producing officers and NCO's, nor is it expected to do so unless, of course, in spite of our efforts, the decline becomes more pronounced. With the advent of national service, the Regular Army Reserve, which normally holds national servicemen for 3± years following their full-time period of service-and ex-regular soldiers as well-ha s been steadily building up and now totals some 28,000 ail of whom have been trained to operational standards and have had at least 2 years full-time service in the Regular Army. Beyond this, there will be within a few years, an additional pool of some 40,000, mostly still under 30 and who would require only limited refresher training should their services be required. Thus we will have a trained reserve in excess of 60,000 ex-Regular Army personnel and the CMF is producing through its training programmes the officers and NCO's to lead them. To turn to problems external to the advising tbem when members of their staff Army, there can be no question that tbe join the CMF, and outlining for them in CMF, like other voluntary organisations in the community, is competing for its members with a great number of alternatives and distractions open to young men now. Such interests as sporting and social activities, post graduate studies, and family pressures, to name some of the more obvious, are all competing to some degree for the spare time of the sort of young man we wish to attract. In other cases, adverse attitudes in some parts of the community, the views of vocal extremists or opposition on the part of some employers must all exert an influence on the potential recruit. Whatever the influences, the CMF today is being evaluated in competition with other factors; and, if not considered attractive enough, it loses, and the member seeks discharge or the potential recruit is lost. public relations and the general fostering of a wider understanding of its true value and purpose. Methods of achieving this on a wide and continuing scale are receiving close attention. One attractive proposal is for greater involvement of CMF units in local community activities on a nationwide basis. Apart from the resultant contribution to community service, such a scheme would enable people everywhere to come into direct contact with units and to make their own personal assessments of the merits of the CMF, as distinct from second hand impressions derived from other sources. Another aspect is the attitude of some employers towards the CMF and in particular towards releasing CMF members for camp and other training. Officer training appears to be generally well regarded by employers for a promising young executive, but sometimes only up to the stage where preoccupation with the CMF tends to conflict with job requirements. There is no doubt that the training a member obtains in the CMF is of value to the community at large and particularly to his employer. Development of the qualities of leadership flows on into all the fields of acceptance of responsibility, decision making and man management. These intangible benefits are not always recognised by employers, and it is proposed to establish closer liaison with them on this matter by brochure form not only the obligations involved but also the positive benefits of CMF service. Australian governments aud instrumentalities and many private organisations have given an exemplary lead in recognising the overall value to the community of the CMF service performed by members of their staffs and in releasing them for training. The Commonwealth Government in particular has marked its special recognition of the importance of the CMF by making CMF pay tax free. One can only hope that an increasing awareness of the CMF's role and value as an essential part of our defence system, and as a means of developing the individual's own capacities, wiil encourage employers generally to facilitate, in the national interest, CMF service by members of their own staffs. Enough has been said to demonstrate lo honourable members and the public in general that the Government regards the CMF as a vital link in our defence arrangements and that the Army, as a result of careful studies, has laid bare many of the problems relating to CMF effectiveness and is endeavouring to the best of its ability and within prevailing financial limits to meet the challenge with imaginative and practical ideas. In the post-Vietnam situation, it is essential that the Citizen Army be developed to the level and standard required to enable it to fulfil its role. With the infusion of new ideas and attitudes, such as the Ready Reaction ForceI have mentioned, and with the enthusiastic support of all members of this Parliament and Ihe people of Australia, I have no doubt that the Citizen Army will become an even stronger and more viable force on which we can rely for an adequate and purposeful contribution to our defence and of whicb Australia can be justifiably proud. I present the following paper: Citizent Military Forces-Ministeria l Statement, ciple of a Ready Reaction Force. It is 8th December 1971. Motion (by Mr Howson) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Minister for the Army( Mr Peacock) has ments of the British ready reserve and made a generally sound and sensible incorporates also some features of an elabassessment of the present state of the Citiorate proposal put forward by the Citizen zen Military Forces. There is general Military Forces Association. The proposal agreement that the CMF is facing a period of extreme pressures. This has been to some extent the result of an end to the Vietnam commitment. Certainly the Vietnam war swelled the numbers of the CMF, but this was only an artificial stimulus. Quite a number of the new recruits were not bona fide militia men; they were able to take advantage of the CMF to avoid the impact of selective conscription on their lives. It was a sane and rational course for young men to take, but of course they were not motivated to serve in the CMF. This has been reflected in the high wastage rate of the CMF in recent years. The numbers are now declining, but this is a healthy sign. At least those who join the CMF now and serve in it for their full terms will be motivated predominantly by the simple wish to serve in the Army. Undoubtedly there will still be a component recruited from those who want to avoid the consequences of an 18-month call-up on their professional and personal lives. But with the Vietnam commitment out of the way this component should be much smaller. In a sense the CMF is finding its proper strength by the hard necessity of supply and demand functions. The implicit forces of moral pressures are fading, and hopefully will disappear completely. The end of the Vietnam war will have other important effects on the CMF. It will free more regular Army personnel and much equipment for use by the CMF. In particular, it will allow much closer co-ordination of policy designed to promote the effectiveness of both regular and civilian wings of the Army. The CMF has been neglected during the 6 or 7 years of the Vietnam commitment. Now it is time to start to redress this injustice and give the CMF structure its proper weight in the military establishment.

175,Mr Barnard (Bass) (10.12),"The ment. It seems the concept has some elefrom lhai Association had some very useful features. However, it was based on expansion of the CMF to 50,000 by the extension of the conscription ballot to CMF 5-year service. The moral objections which apply to the present selective ballot for the regular Army would apply just as strongly to its use to increase the CMF. Aside from these objections, which are the basis of Labor Party standpoint on conscription, it would not be practicable even on the Government's terms to extend conscription in this way. The theory of selective conscription is that it picks young men by random sample and brings them together in consolidated units for training. This could not be done with the CMF which has a far-flung structure based on drill balls and small units scattered throughout Australia. Obviously these units could not be increased by random sample unless the ballots were cooked. The only alternative would be to concentrate on forming conscript CMF units in the major centres of population, which would negate the principle of the CMF. Besides, as the Minister has pointed out, the only areas where recruitment.of other rank personnel has increased are raised by the Minister.

It has been reorganised because of the abolition of universal national service in the late 1950s, the introduction and then the abandonment of the pentropic organisation, the selective conscription scheme, and the Vietnam commitment. Now another major reorganisation is to be imposed on the CMF. It cannot be emphasised too strongly that the CMF will crumple unless there is consistent planning. In particular, it would be a disaster to the CMF if an extensive reorganisation were undertaken and then the role of the CMF was abruptly revised for the umpteenth time. If a ready reaction force can be established with volunteers organised into a number of sub-units it would give a fillip to the worth, effectiveness and morale of the CMF. But the Government must ensure that it is firmly committed to this form of organisation and that this commitment is reflected in long term planning.

Report relating to an Article Published in the 'Daily Telegraph', 27 August 1971 for National Development) (10.29)I m:>ve: That this Huuse agrees with the Committe in iu findings and is of opinion that it would best a member of it-of course, the Governconsult its own dignity by taking no further action in the matter. 1 would like to make it quite clear that this is a matter for the House itself and not a matter for consideration by the Government as such. I would like to pay a tribute to the Committee of Privileges for the painstaking work it has done not only in this case but in previous cases, and for the findings which have emerged in this case. However, the reason why the motion has been moved is that a number of individual members in the House have indicated that because the matter was not of overriding importance the House should have recourse to its own dignity and should not pursue any further action, though indicating that a breach of privilege has been committed. 1 put this recommendation before the House as a private member and noi on behalf of the Government. I would like to refer to the fact that a similar recommendation was made by the Committee of Privileges in a report which was submitted on 1st November 1951. In that case it was acknowledged that there had been a breach of privilege but the wording of the recommendation at that time was that the House take no punitive action against the writer and that the House would best serve its own dignity by taking no further action. So there is a precedent for this proposal. There is one other matter that I wish to clear up. It is the method of raising matters of privilege in this chamber. I do so because there is a small query as lo a response by the Leader of the House indicating that a matter is accepted as one of privilege and that it should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. The position is lhat all 7 cases that have been raised in this House since 1954 have been dealt with immediately and referred immediately to the Committee. But before the matter is raised in the House in the form of a motion by a member, he will first of all consult the Clerks of the House to ensure thai the wording of the motion is correct. By doing so, he establishes himself that there is a prima facie case of privilege to be considered. This procedure was again followed in this case by the honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope). He had a correctly worded motion prepared. It was a prima facie case of privilege and as Leader of the HouseI indicated merely as ment is in charge of the business of the House-lha t the motion would be accepted. I should like to make it quite clear that when I did so I carried out the normal tradition in all the 7 cases. There should not. be a query in relation to it. The honourable member for Sydney had a perfect right to raise the matter. The form in which he raised it was correct and there was a prima facie case to be considered by the Committee. Therefore, the House was qui:e right in accepting his motion at that time and so approving its submission to the Committee. I thought it essential to ensure that that point, which has been raised outside the chamber, was cleared up. But1 do not want to take up the time of the House in relation to this ma'.ier. As I say, the motion has been proposed because a number of members of thc House have indicated that they felt this would be a better approach.

178,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rits findings as occurred back in November 1951 when it was felt that the House could best consult its own dignity by taking no further action in the matter. SoI have proposed this motion. As I have indicated, it is a matter for the House to decide and I leave the motion for its consideration. (10.33)I do not agree with the motion moved by the Minister for National Development ( Mr Swartz) that thc Committee of Privileges is correct in finding that there has been a breach of privilege. I do agree that the House would best consult its own dignity by taking no further action. If these the intimidation practised on members of 2 propositions are to be put as one, I shall find myself in a difficult position. But1 shall not proceed to push the matter any further than to state my view to you, M> Speaker, and to the House. After this report was tabled, some of my colleagues said to me very kindly that they noted I did not vote on the Labor side. I want to make it clear that in matters affect ing privilege 1 do not see any sideLabor or anti Labor-o n the Committee of Privileges or in the House. During the Committee remarked to me when 1 advanced one argument: 'How cringing can you become? How servile in the interests of the Consolijustice. dated Press can you become?' My concern is that the necessary privileges of this House and of its members should be upheld, that the accused should be treated justly and thai the decision whether privilege has been breached should be reached impartially. In this case, a verdict of guilty brought by the Committee against Messrs Reid and McNicholl is accompanied by recommendations for penalties which are very mild. They consist of a correction and apology on the front page of the 'Daily Telegraph' and a written apology to the House by Mr Then when the report was being finally Reid. But this does not detract from the seriousness of the procedure or of thc weight that the House should attach to recommendations which come through this procedure. A colleague on the Committee proposed that Mr Reid should be committed to Goulburn Gaoi or, better still, to one vote and, with a larger attendance, the Kenmore Mental Hospital. That was not verdict of guilty was later carried by one pressed to the vote. Perhaps every man should declare his interest. I must say that it is true that in the past I have worked for Sir Frank Packer. I worked on the staff of the 'Daily Telegraph'. I was a sub-editor there. AfterI had been 3 months in the position, sacked me. He did not agree with my subediting. I took a stand in this House similar to the stand that I am taking on this case on another case many years ago. The accused then were Browne and Fitzpatrick, not Reid and McNicoll, and the 'Daily Telegraph' at that time scathingly attacked my attitude in a special editorial. 1 mention these things simply because 1 object to Ihis Committee who attempted to advance an honest view by colleagues alleging that their view must be coloured by servility and a cring ng attitude towards Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. In evaluating the recommendations of the Committee, the House must take into account the limitations under which it worked. Therefore, it is pertinent to remember that the accused had no right to legal representation, no right to hear eviproceedings a colleague dence, no right to question witnesses, no right lo call witnesses, indeed none of tie rights of an accused in any British court of Something so utterly extraordinary occurred in this Committee, something so horrifying, to me anyway, that it alone would justify casting the Committee's report right out of the window. At the end of the Committee's inquiry, after due deliberation, it reached a verdict of not guilty. It decided that there was no breach of privilege and no contempt of Parliament. The report for presentation to the Parliament was then drafted and brought to its final stages on that basis-that the accused were not guilty. It was decided that there had been no breach of privilege. approved, as records now in the possession of the House show, the verdict of not guilty was struck out and the verdict of guilty was substituted so that the report to this Parliament had to be redrafted. The verdict of not guilty was carried by vote. As the House knows from the report",90,Committee Of Privileges

What seemed incredible to rae was that these recommittals, these reversals of decisions, were permitted and occurred without any suggestion that the earlier verdicts had not been properly reached, or that the matter had not been fully or honestly considered, or that any false evidence had been given, or that any new evidence was available or that anything whatever improper had occurred in the consideration of the verdict. So this was not ing. I cannot say with certainty whether justice by any standard; it was the numbers game. We are members of the high court of Parliament. We are required to act justly and I therefore say deliberately, as a member of the Committee and having participated in its proceedings, that it was a travesty of justice to allow a verdict duly I do not think it was a false report, and reached to be reversed without any reason in law or in justice which would in any court in the world be accepted as a reason to reopen a case. Of course, the Privileges Committee is not a court and what happened in the Committee could not happen in any court except a kangaroo court. This Committee is not a chamber, but what was done in this Committee could not happen in any chamber except a star chamber. I think it merits the scorn of everyone who has respect for the law. It will be an everliament. Inaccuracies occur every day in lasting reproach to this House if such a procedure is ever permitted to operate again.

I applaud that. Today, however, this House mustI hope it will be for the last time-mak e a decision at the Bar of this House at least once a on the report that is before us with all its inadequacies. The Minister for National Development has put forward a proposal for the Government but he does not suggest that that should commit the House. It is for each member of the House to vote as he chooses on the matter. This House is at least fortunate that it has available all the evidence given to the Committee, something which 1 do not remember ever happening previously. On the evidence, and 1 studied it very carefully, I do not think that members walked out of the chamber while the quorum bells were ringing. Mr Donald Cameron-That is a nice concession. stand the meaning of the interjection, but no doubt the honourable member will speak for himself in a few moments. I do not think that members walked out of the chamber while the quorum bells were ringthey walked out nor, seemingly, can anyone. The most that could be said before the Committee was that it was extremely unlikely. There could be no positive statement one way or the other by anyone who gave evidence to the Committee. While I think that Mr Reid's report was incorrect, in fact the Committee deliberately struck the word 'false' out of its findings. There is no ground for saying that Mr Reid knew that his report was untrue. The evidence shows that he had grounds of substance for believing, wrongly in my view, that members did walk out. I cannot support the motion of the Minister for National Development fhat the finding is correct because inaccuracy of itself is no ground whatever for finding contempt of the ParPress reports of the proceedings of this House, they occur in the published reports of Party meetings and they even occur in the reports of the whisperings of well informed observers in the lobbies. I have even known members themselves to make inaccurate statements. It is a human failing, and if inaccuracy of itself were to be regarded as a contempt of the Parliament then we must have the whole Press gallery week. But does Mr Reid's further statement that members deliberately breached Standing Orders constitute a reflection on the House? That. 1 think, is the real point. Does it constitute an imputation of discreditable",91,Committee Of Privileges

184,Mr Drury (Ryan) (10.48),"I have lismembers had walked out. The important fact, of course, is that a journalist has a responsibility with regard to the accuracy of what he writes concerning the proceedings of Parliament. Mr Reid is a very senior and experienced journalist of considerable standing. His Editor-in-Chief, Mr they were unable to attend. McNicoll, had no hesitation whatever in accepting as true and accurate what Mr It has been suggested by my friend the. Reid wrote in his article. Nor did Mr honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and McNicoll have any hesitation in accepting responsibility for its publication. However, the evidence given before the Committee by a number of very responsible witnesses does not support the allegations contained in Mr Reid's article. In my view, the ultimate finding was the correct one on the evidence. At page 140 to 144 of Erskine May's 'Parliamentary Practice', Eighteenth Edition, 'constructive contempts' are set out clearly and explicitly. On the evidence given there is no doubt in my mind that the writing and publication of the article fall into this cateendeavoured lo preserve an atmosphere of gory. Tliere are 2 particular aspects of this inquiry which are extremely unusual and on which I should comment. The first which, as the report indicates, was viewed very seriously by the Committee, was the premature disclosure of part of the proceedings. May deals on pages 142 and 143 with 'premature publication or disclosure of a committee's proceedings or evidence', and says that this in itself constitutes a breach of privilege or a contempt of the Parliament. In my experience, this has never happened before in a House of Representatives privilege inquiry, and nobody regrets more than I do that it happened on this occasion. Thc Committee also viewed seriously Mr Pettifer's paper. Having regard to the McNicoll's refusal to disclose the 3 sources from which he had heard that there had been a finding favourable to Mr Reid but that the finding had later been reversed. correct. So there was clearly a premature disclosure. This brings me to the other unusual aspect of the case, that is, the recommittal and subsequent reversal of the original finding. The report draws attention to the fact that on each of the main votes the decisions were arrived at by an extremely narrow majority. This is one reason why the committee decided to append the evidence in full, so that the position was. As the Chairman of the Committee 1 endeavoured always to fix meeting times to suit most, if not all, of the members of the Committee. But when the time came, there were occasions when some members found unexpectedly that one or 2 others whom I have heard, that having made the original finding, the Committee's work should have finished there. I for one do not accept that. I believe that the Committee's job ends when the Chairman's draft report is approved down to the last detail. On this occasion, al the request of the Committee, 1 prepared a second draft report. Only when this was finally approved by the Committee for presentation to the House was the Committee's task completed. The Committee of Privileges does not, of course, observe any judicial forms, but as ChairmanI have always calmness and objectivity throughout the whole proceedings and to exclude political considerations. Thc Committee was greatly helped by the Acting Clerk of the House, Mr Pettifer, and his paper dated 13th September 1971 is attached as Appendix II. I draw the attention of the House to pages 3 and 4 of Mr Pettifer's paper setting out particular references in relation to the matter before the Committee, and also to page 5 and subsequent pages listing matters for determination by the Committee. I also bring to the notice of the House the synopsis of some recent cases of privilege, set out as an appendix at the end of Mr unusual aspects of this case and to the fact that the ultimate finding was made only on the casting vote of the Chairman-that is myself1 feel personally that the motion moved tonight by the Leader of the House is reasonable and, in all the circumstances, would best serve the dignity of the House. After all, it is the dignity of the House and the rights of members with which the law of privilege is very largely concerned. As this is to be a free vote I intend to support tbe motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House. Finally, may I say that I am glad the",93,Committee Of Privileges

A review of the whole question of parliamentary privilege is, I believe, overdue. I for one welcome the Prime Minister's move in this direction. Speaking in the House on 23rd August last the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen), representing the Attorney-General in this House, said that the legal matters involved would need to be looked at in some depth. I look forward to taking part in a discussion on these matters in due course when they come before the House, as I have some very definite views on them myself. member of the Committee that took part in thc framing of this report 1 want to say firstly that it is of great satisfaction to me the decision of the Committee I wan to to note the interest that the report of the Privileges Committee, relating to an article published in the 'Daily Telegraph' of 27th August 1971, has engendered in this House. It is also of great satisfaction to me to know that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Alan Fraser) and I can agree absolutely on one important subject-that is, the functions and powers of the Privileges Committee in this day and age. It may interest the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to know that, immediately the Privileges Committee report on what vve now know as the Uren case was made public, I approached the honourable inember for Reid and appealed to him, as iin executive member of my Party, to bring before that executive my misgivings on the guidelines the Committee had to follow in order to reach a decision. 1 pointed out that these guidelines had been operative since Federation and were laid down long before Federation. For these reasons i argued that the inspired by personalities. In consideration House of Representatives should set up a of thc article the man, Alan Reid. never select committee to investigate and recomentered my thoughts. The article was my mend to this House more modern and first consideration. Matters arising f'om more satisfactory guidelines which the the article were the second consideration. Committee could use to arrive at decisions. The decision reached marks the niiun I regret that the suggestions were not acted taken on these matters. upon. The Uren case is now past and so is the case relating to the letter in the 'Ausings that has caused some heated debate. tralian' newspaper. So it is with the arrival That is the decision reached on ""?7th in this House of the 'Daily Telegraph' case October referred to on page M7 of the lhat there arises, not for the first time, a request to examine the procedures of the Committee under question, in spite of the fact that since March 1945 to the present day about 30 cases have been before that Committee. I highlight a particular instance ot the difficulties which confront this Committee. During the hearing on the Uren case t'le Committee had before it 2 constitutionjl lawyers-on e from the Attorney-General's Department and one from the Australian National University. One was quite definite that a breach of privilege had been committed. The decision of the other, to me, did not convey yea or nay. I am sure ""hat the honourable menber for Reid will confirm fhe remarks I have made in '""elation to his case. Having said that, I now turn io the report before the House. In reference to say that, faced with the same evidence and working within the same guidelines, I could not in any shape or form or at any time depart from the decisions or decision to which I was a party. After having read the evidence, and read it again, and read it a third time, and not being able to find a single sentence that could vindicate any truth in the article as to the event it described, I could come to no other conclusion, after reference to the guidelines, than that the article constituted a breach of privilege or a contempt, and I maintained this attitude throughout t'.e wbole weary proceedings of the investigation. I said early in the proceedings thnt I thought ihe whole thing was blown up out of all proportion, but the matter having been referred to (he Committee that Committee had no other option but to take every available step to bring down a decision. Not one word or thought of mine could be construed as being personal or 1 refer now to that part of the proceed-",94,Committee Of Privileges
187,Mr Mcivor (Gellibrand) (10.56),"As areport. Concerning this decision, it is common knowledge that some person or persons committed a grave breach of privilege by disclosing this decision before it had been ratified in the draft report submitted to the Committee. The report emphasises this very clearly. Now let me explain the advice and the direction given to members of the Committee by the Chairman prior to discussing and ratifying the report. Firstly, the Chairman informed the Committee that he must read every paragraph of the report. Having read the paragraph the Chairman then moved: 'That the paragraph stand as part of the report.' by Mr PetliferI could not in true conHowever, before proceeding to read the paiagraph theChairman informed the Committee that a member can move for the omission of the paragraph or move an amendment to the paragraph or move for the substitution of other words in the paragraph. Now this was the stage that had been reached when a desire was expressed to recommit the decision of 27th October. As indicated in the report I moved accordingly and my motion was carried by one vote. I might say that at no time was I convinced that the decision reached on 27th October was the correct one. In fact, I called it irresponsible, and I still call it irresponsible in tbe face of the evidence before us. In my opinion, this information should discount the unofficial report that a final decision had been made. Quite definitely this was not the case. Referring to the one vote one way or the other, I desire.to say on a committee constituted as this Committee is, decisions would more often be made on that basis. The votes taken during the proceedings indicate this. 1 come now to that part of the evidence submitted by Mr Reid relating to the unknown journalist who submitted information to him on the article he wrote. I have a great deal of respect for the ability of Mr Reid and with the knowledge that Mr Reid is a parliamentary reporter of many years standing I found it hard to believe that he did not know or would not know the journalist who was supposed to give him the information. That is No. 1, as it were. It has been asserted that Mr Reid wrote the article believing it to be correct. On this score let me say this: There was not a great deal of effort needed by Mr Reid to ascertain the truth of the matter. Mr Reid had only to ask the Deputy Speaker or any of (he officers present on the occasion to ascertain the truth. This procedure would have been better by far than putting the Committee and his Parliament to the intensive investigation that has been carried out on this matter. I said at the opening of my remarks that I carried no banner for anyone in these proceedings. My attitude was completely impartial. I also said that after giving full consideration to the guidelines laid down science come to any other decision than the one to which I was party. These are the guidelines: Firstly, a writing which reflects on the character or proceedings of the House or its members; I say that it did. Secondly, a publication of proceedings of the House which is false or perverted or partial and injurious; I say it was. Finally, a misrepresentation of the proceedings of members in the Parliament; T say it was. I now refer to what created a great deal of debate by the Committee, that is, the choice of words which were so much discussed by the Committee. In relation to this I found difficulty in knowing when an inaccurate statement becomes a false statement. When it becomes false, when does it become untruthful? So again I had to rest on the guidelines laid down in the report by Mr Petlifer. Much has been said about precedent. In this regard, I say: Tf we set up a precedent to turn a blind eye to matters of this kind then I am afraid we make rods for our own backs'. If untruthful statements are to be called inaccurate statements for the purpose of lessening the offence, then the public has the right to treat us with distrust and scorn. FranklyI could not be party to measures of this kind. I say further that to bring down a verdict other than the verdict that was ratified would have been to disgracefully humiliate the Deputy Speaker and the officers present at the time of the incident. I have no desire to hurt anyone nor have I any desire to take part in another inquiry by the Privileges Committee under the same conditions as those that applied to the 3 inquiries with which I have been concerned in the past weeks. Further, I think it is wrong to place the onus on the shoulders of officers of this Parliament to set the guidelines inside which the Committee must operate. That is the duty and responsibility of this Parliament. In no circumstances should further investigations be made by the Privileges Committee until this Parliament has modernised the proceedings and reshaped them in such a manner as to remove from the shoulders of the officers of the Parliament the necessity to set down guidelines and directions for the Committee. We should protect the members of the Parliament serving on that Committee from the unfair criticism that the present procedures invite and give to each and everyone appearing before the Committee a much broader opportunity to place evidence before it. I congratulate the Chairman for his patience and tolerance during this lengthy and somewhat protracted hearing. I close by saying that any judge or jury faced with this case and presented with the same evidence could not in true justice bring down any other verdict than the verdict contained in the report before the House. (11.7)-The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has implied that on occasions such as this sometimes unholy alliances arise between members of the differing political persuasions, and I find myself on this occasion in such an alliance with him and the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull). There are 2 important matters arising from this report to which I wish to refer. I think both of them have been referred to already by previous speakers, but they are of equal importance and should be emphasised. The first is the change in the decision of the Committee as to whether the newspaper article constituted a breach of privilege. Honourable members who read the minutes of the meetings held by the Privileges Committee will see that a meeting of the Committee was held on 27th October 1971. At that meeting I moved: That this Committee finds that the article pubsion that is now before the House. I am lished in the Daily Telegraph of Friday 27th August 1971 does not constitute a breach of privvery concerned that the Committee should ilege or contempt of the House of have reversed its decision in this way withRepresentatives. I supported this motion with reasons to for doing so or, indeed, without any which I will refer later. There were 5 reasons at all being advanced for doing so. members of the Committee present and I should say clearly, however, that I those 5 members constituted a quorum It was a properly constituted meeting, properly called, and whatever decisions were to be made at thai meeting would be valid. I disagree completely and most strongly, with respect, with the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor) who has described the decision reached at that meeting as being irresponsible. The facts are that the decision was made by those who were there, that there was a quorum, that it was a properly constituted meeing, and that there was a lengthy and involved discussion by all members present on that occasion as to the evidence adduced at the previous meetings of the Committee and as to whether that evidence amounted to a breach of privilege. It was not an irresponsible decision; it was one properly made. It will be seen from the minutes that my motion was carried and consequently became the decision of the Committee. At that stage, then, the Privileges Committee had resolved that the article in question did not constitute a breach of privilege or a contempt of the House of Repre entatives. It is not strictly accurate to -ay (Diamond Valley) that Mr Reid, the journalist, was a defendant in these proceedings, but insofar a-, he was a defendant he had then been acquitted. The next meeting was held on 3rd November and it is clear that the bulk of that meeting was devoted to a consideration of tbe draft report which had been prepared by the Chairman in the meantime. But at the end of the meeting it was moved that the previous decision of the Committee should be recommitted for reconsideration. At the next meeting, on 4th November, that motion was carried and the original motion was put again. On this occasion the motion was lost; in other words, the Committee undid its previous and valid decision that there had been no breach of privilege or contempt of the House of Representatives. The Committee then resolved lhat the article did constitute a contempt of the House of Representatives. That is the deciout any persuasive reasons being advanced",95,Committee Of Privileges
188,Mr Brown,"believe the Chairman of the Privileges Committee acted correctly in allowing the motion for recommittal to be put to the meeting on 3rd November. Once that motion was moved the Chairman had to accept it, and I cannot see any ground on which he could have refused to accept it. My complaint is that the motion for recommittal-wit h respect, if there were any irresponsiblity at this stage it was in movbe changed daily, fluctuating backwards ing that motion-shoul d not have been moved and should not have been carried. The first meeting at which the Committee decided there had been no breach of privilege was a properly constituted meeting and its decisions were valid. It had decided there was no breach of privilege. I believe it establishes a very unfortunate precedent to undo the Committee's decision at a subsequent meeting unless good reasons are shown for doing so. Whatever grounds may be appropriate for doing so, it is not an appropriate ground merely that all members of the Committee were not present. Why, after all, is there a requirement for a quorum in the Committee, in this House, or in any deliberative body? It is because decisions of a body must be made valid although all members may not be present due to some exigency. That is the very purpose of a quorum requirement-to make the decisions of the body valid if a quorum is present. It goes completely contrary to the quorum requirement and the reason for it to suggest that at a subsequent meeting when other members come along, they can upset the valid decisions made in their absence at a previous meeting. If it were said that there had been a fraud perpetrated at the earlier meetingthat the Committee had been tricked into making its decision-the n the Committee could reconsider its earlier decision. That would be the case in an application to a court of law for a new trial and it could well be the case where it is sought to have the Privileges Committee reconsider its earlier decision. Again, if new evidence became available which was not available at the first meeting, then likewise the Comthe sources of his information and the mittee could reconsider its earlier decision. basis on which he writes his article, and Again, this could be done in an application to a court for a new trial. There may be other reasons that could be given, but when there are no valid reasons advanced, and when the only reason advanced is that some members were absent from the first meeting, and when in this case no reasons at all, valid or otherwise, were advanced, then 1 for one am not persuaded. In that case the Committee should not upset its earlier decision, and the reason it should not upset its earlier decision is simply that what it did at its earlier meeting was valid. It would be a very unfortunate state of affairs if decisions of this Committee could and forwards, depending on the ebb and flow of who happened to be present at any time, who was not present at any time and where their sympathies lay in the particular matter. That is the first matter-that the decision first made that there was no breach of privilege or contempt was validly made and should not have been rescinded in the absence of reasons given to the contrary. The second matter is that, in my view, the decision itself that the article constituted a contempt of the House of Representatives was wrong. There are several reasons for this and I will give them as briefly as I can. Firstly, it should be remembered that the journalist concerned, Mr Reid, gave his evidence on oath and that is not lightly to be considered. He said on oath that on his way to the chamber he heard, one Labor member say: It is a quorum: we walked out; that he heard one member castigating several people for being idiots for walking out; that in the chamber he heard another member saying that Opposition members had walked out of the chamber, and that he was told by 2 journalists that some Opposition members had walked out. He also said, and this is probably the most important single thing that he said in bis evidence, that he believed that he had written an accurate report of what had happened, that is, that he had believed it when he wrote it and he believed it at the time he gave his evidence. It seems to me that we should not find a journalist guilty of a contempt of the House, which is a serious matter indeed, when he writes an article purporting to be factual, when he states on oath when he believes that what he writes is true. At the very least there must be some doubt about the matter when evidence of that nature is given and in such a case the journalist should be given the benefit of the doubt. Reading the totality of the evidence given before the Committee it is a fair conclusion that anyone placed in the journalist's position at the time when he wrote his article would be justified in concluding that some Opposition members had left the chamber when the quorum was called, even although we now know, after hearing the evidence of numerous witnesses, that it is extremely unlikely that any of them did leave. The second reason follows from the fact that we are the repositories of the privileges of this House. We allow journalists in the Press Gallery because it is part of our democratic tradition. We must be presumed to allow them there on some conditions. We know that journalists will write some articles that will be no more than verbatim reports of what is said in the House. We also know, or should know, that they will also write articles based on information that they receive from a variety of sources other than debates in the House; that there will be articles based on facts of which tbe journalist could not poswith the honourable member for Edensibly know from his own personal knowledge. We know that that happens and we do not object to it. We continue to allow journalists to occupy the Press Gallery, and at least by doing nothing to the contrary we accept this practice. What then are the restraints that we impose on journalists? What are the limitations on the articles that they write? SurelyI want to make it perfectly clear, as is what we expect is that they will be honestly written, that a journalist will not put moved, that T fully support the findings forward as an accomplished fact what he knows to be untrue. We also expect that if a journalist puts forward what purport to be facts he will have some justification for putting forward those facts. It could be put this way: When a journalist is writing what appears to be factual but what he does not know from his own personal knowledge, has he acted responsibly or has he acted recklessly, merely throwing words casually down on to the paper without checking them and without making inquiries to ensure that what he has written is true? Applying those principles to this case I leges Committee stems from the matter would say that if the journalist, Mr Reid, that I referred to the House on Tuesday, had heard from a scullery maid or in 7th September 1971, regarding an article backstairs gossip that seems to be relied by Mr Alan Reid which appeared in the upon so much in this Parliament that Sydney 'Daily Telegraph* of Friday, 27th 23144 71-Jt-[155 ] Opposition members had walked out of the chamber when the quorum was called and he wrote his article without checking and without inquiring to see whether it were true, he would be acting recklessly and not at all responsibly. The article then being inaccurate in those circumstances he would clearly have committed a contempt of the House. But it is clear that that is not what happened in this case, and the evidence makes it clear that that is not what happened in this case. Mr Reid heard a story from one member of Parliament, then from another and then from 2 journalists. He said that he believed that what he wrote was true and he gave his evidence on oath. In those circumstances, although I have no brief for any of the interests in this particular case, I could not say that he had acted reck1 lessly or irresponsibly. I could not say that he had committed a contempt against the House of Representatives. I hope, Sir, that that explains the reason why I find myself in good company in this unholy alliance Monaro and the honourable member for Mallee. move the following amendment to the motion: That all words after 'opinion' be omitted witb the view to inserting the following words in' place thereof-'that the recommendations of the Committee should be carried out'. apparent from the amendment I have and recommendations of the Privileges Committee. I stress that I would not support any punitive action being taken against any person adjudged to have committed a breach of privilege. Tn 1955, in the Browne and Fitzpatrick case, despite the fact that I agreed with the finding of the Privileges Committee, I was one of the II members of this House who voted against those 2 persons receiving a gaol sentence of 3 months, because I do not believe that this House should exercise the power to impose such a penalty. The report brought down by the Privi-",97,Committee Of Privileges
189,Mr Cope (Sydney) (11.14),"I wish toAugust. It contained comment about the House being counted out for lack of a quorum on me previous day, Thursday, 26th August. At the outset I should like to mention that at the time of this incident Mr Lucock, the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees-incidentally , he has occupied these official positions since 8th March 1961-wa s in charge of the proceedings of the House, and the parliamentary officers on duty were the Clerk of the House, Mr Turner, the Second Assistant Clerk, Mr Pettifer, and the Deputy Sergeant at Arms, Mr Piper. NowI shall cite standing' order 47, which governs the proceedings of the House when a quorum is called. It states: When ths attention of the Speaker, or of the Chairman of Committees, has been called to the fact that there is not a quorum of Members present, no Member shall leave the area within the seats allotted to' Members until a quorum is present or 2 minutes have elapsed. NowI sball cite the relevant section of Mr Reid's article to which I took exception. It is as follows: A group of ALP Parliamentarians walked out of the Chamber when the quorum was called, well knowing lhat their action could cause the collapse of the House of Representatives. I shall proceed to substantiate what I said on 7th September, that this was a deliberate untruth, and I shall quote from the evidence submitted to the Privileges Committee. Firstly, I quote from the evidence able member for Diamond Valley( Mr noticed Mr Uren rise frnm his seat on the front Brown) lhat Mr Turner was also under oath-whic h appears on pages 144 and 145 of the transcript of evidence. The relevant section reads: Chairman-Thank you, Mr Turner. There is a point, a technical point. Alan Reid does not quote correctly standing order 47. I do not know whether you recall that he said that standing order 47 referred to members leaving tlie chamber. But in point of fact, the chamber is not mentioned, as you know. Standing order 47 simply states that no member shall leave the area within the seats allotted to members until a quorum is present or 2 minutes have elapsed. This is only a technicality, I suppose, yet il is possible that a member or members migbt have been in, say, some part of the Speaker's gallery Fox, and have gone out through the doors. Strictly, understanding order 47, they would have been entitled to leave, would they not, if they had did you notice any members from either side of not already, been in the seats reserved for members? this stage: I was not aware, nor do I think my Deputy was aware, or was the Chair aware, of anyone having left Ihe Chamber after Mr Gun had called for the quorum. Does the honourable member for Diamond Valley want any more than that? lt continues: It is, I think, a fairly well established practice that when a quorum is called any member who is sitting in thc public galleries, downstairs, the diplomatic galleries, the Speaker's gallery, rhe officer seats, or perhaps even in the attendants' box is not counted. But if he were to get up and take himself outside those seals, he would be counted; . . . Let me quote from what the Second Clerk Assistant, Mr Pettifer, said, and, as I again remind the honourable member for Diamond Valley, he was also under oath. Mr BrownI was there when the evidence was given. emphasised the fact that ' Mr Reid was under oath. I am pointing out that these other witnesses were under oath, too. The following is a section of Mr Pettifer's evidence: Chairman1 know that in the ordinary course of events-it is part of your normal function at the table-that while the quorum bells are ringing you are counting the numbers, but would you, as part of that operation, be keeping half an eye on th: doors? Would you have noticed if any members had gone out. as well as come in? keep an ey,e on members who might tend to move outside the chamber, from the area in which members are normally seated. For instance. I bench and make towards the Opposition main corridor. I thought he was going out, but he stopped when he got towards the final row of seats and came back again. I saw no members leave the area allotted to members. In talking the matter over with the Clerk, he agreed that he saw no members leaving the chamber on his side. I think it is worthwhile, Sir, to note the wording of the newspaper article. Let me quote further from pages 174 and 175 of the transcript of evidence in regard to what Mr Lucock said. The honourable member for Diamond Valley should note that Mr Lucock was under oath also. The transcript states: quorum and during the period of just over 2 minutes that elapsed before the doors were locked the House leaving the chamber? were standing, as far as my recollection goes.

Chairman-When you are in the Chair, do you Bud that normally you can keep an eye on all the various entrances and exits? Mr LucockI would think that, witlun reasonable limits, I could say 'Yes' to that. You are sort later decided that he was to be found guilty. of looking round the chamber at that particular stage. You are watching for people coming in, not so much for people going out, but if you noticed a member who was in the chamber getting close to tbe door, you would naturally keep a fairly close eye on that member, knowing that members arc not supposed io leave thc chamber, lt has happened that I have called members back who have gone out of the chamber at the time. I have been watching. Chairman-Would you say that it would be extremely unlikely that any members left the chamber during the period in question? Mr LucockI would say it would be extremely unlikely. Chuirtiiuu-Can you say positively that no members walked out of the chamber? Mr l.iicuck-Within thc framework of what I have said previously I think I would say fairly emphatically that no meniber walked out. Let us look at what Mr Piper, the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms had to say. This gentleman was under oath, too. Mr Piper said: 1 should sturt off by saying that I did not see anybody leave the chamber. 1 was very near to the member who called the quorum, at the back of the chamber. I can clearly remember several members being in that area when the bells were rung, but 1 must say I did not see anybody leave the chamber after the bells commenced to ring. It is interesting to note that Mr Turnbull, the Country Party Whip, also stressed lhat he did not see anybody leave thc chamber. Mr Turnbull is a member of Ihe Committee. Mr Reid has not submitted one iota of evidence to substantiate his claim that a group of ALP parliamentarians walked out of the chamber when the quorum was called. In evidence he admitted that he was not in the House when the qurorum wai called, in an endeavour to justify the claim he mentioned Mr Calwell and Mr Les Irwin, each of whom admitted that he was not in the House at the time. The pertinent part of Mr Calwell's evidence is at page 66, of Mr Irwin's evidence at page 124. Mr Irwin has stated that he was 99 per cent sure that Bill Fulton had said that it was a walk out. Mr Fulton appealed before the Committee and denied that he had said any such thing. There was some interesting evidence tendered by Mr David McNicoll, the Editor in-Chief of the 'Daily : Telegraph'. I quote from page 185 of the report. This is roost interesting. In answer I must say, if 1 may, with great respect, Mr Chairman, that our organisation in Sydney has been greatly disturbed and bewildered at the reports which are current in Sydney-that the Committee found Mr Reid not guilty and then Everybody-fro m our legal men and everybody-is quite bewildered and staggered at this having happened. It stems to us something which, if it eventually sees the light of day, as I have no doubt it will, must call for some explanation and I think lhat we, as a newspaper, deserve an explanauon for this. The evidence was supposed to have been kept very secret until it was presented in the House, which was Thursday of last week. Nobody was supposed to give any information of any kind about the Comvolition, said that he had received information from 3 sources. Mr Clyde CameronMr Irwin was one. were. 1 shall noi make any accusations. question, volunteered this information. say-thes e are his exact words-that he put more faith actually in Mr Reid's statement than he would in the findings of the Committee. I always thought that Sir Frank Packer had great influence in Sydney but I did not know that his influence extended to the Liberal Party in Canberra. I say without any fear or inhibition that I wonder what the recommendation of the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) would have been if the reporter involved in this matter represented the Communist Party newspaper 'Tribune'. I wonder what the recommendation would have been. I was quite surprised that the Chairman of 'the Privileges Committee, the honourable member for Ryan( Mr Drury), whose casting vote was thc one that was responsible for bringing down the findings and recommendations as set out in the Committee's report, has indicated that he intends lo do nothing about the recommendations for which he voted and intends to vole in support of the Government. Yet, the vote on this matter will be a free one. I have always respected the views of my colleague, the honourable member for Eden",100,Committee Of Privileges

He quoted what had happened in the Browne and Fitzpatrick case. Our friend, thc honourable member for Diamond Valley, spent half of his speech on a matter that was quite irrelevant. It had nothing whatever to do with the issue that was before the Privileges Committee. The bonourable member said nothing about what Mr Reid had alleged. It is quite obvious that his allegation was a deliberate untruth. integrity of Mr Reid and in what he writes, 1 would suggest that Mr Reid should adopt the pseudonym of 'George Washington' and possibly, in the future, everyone will believe what he says. But, on this occasion, no doubt exists, as has been mentioned already by my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor), that Mr Reid's article is a reflection on the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock); on Mr Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron). I do so Turner, the Clerk; and on Mr Pettifer, Clerk Assistant. Also it is a reflection on every member jn this House because that article was a deliberate untruth. As I mentioned before, the honourable member for Lyne has occupied his office for 10 years. He is meticulous to see that nobody leaves the'chamber when attention is directed to the state of the House. Tn common with you, ' Mr Corbett, I ' am a deputy chairman of committees. Our own duty when occupying the Chair-and this is the advice that we receive from the House officers at the tabic-is that no member should leave the' House when attention is directed to the state of the House and a count takes place. I say now that it is impossible for any member to leave the House and to avoid notice of the 2 pairs of eyes at the table and the eyes of fhe occupant of the chair. I repeat that I am very surprised indeed that the Chairman of the Privileges Committee whose casting vote was responsible for thefindingsand recommendations that are before the House now has altered his mind, will not vote for the recommendations of the Committee but intends to suport the motion moved by the Leader of the House.

But the fact of the advocated over the years by honourable matter is that it is one of the tricks of the members on both sides of the Parliament. Having read closely the evidence in this a scrum in a game of rugby league or anycase and having been a member of this thing else; it is a part of the game. HonParliament for 28 years, I know that the ourable members who know the Standing parties concerned in this breach of privilege Orders should use them.

I will tell honmember for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) is never ourable members why I was present. I was in his place when a quorum is called. at a meeting a long way from here and the bells began to ring. As I did not know for what reason they were ringing, I dashed parliamentary privileges is long overdue, along to the chamber. I was told that the not to place it out of the scope of the bells were ringing to summon a quorum. Parliament but to place it in a more judicial I said: ' I could not care less. I am going light whereby we might be able to divorce to find out who called for the quorum and our hatreds or animosities from those in what I am going to do to him will not be the Press and other places who come before printable'. When I got into this chamber us. At the same time. I believe that honourI found that I could not get out. HereI able members who have read this evidence was a hero among 5 simply because the closely will recognise that the editors who Standing Orders prohibited me from leaving printed and the persons who wrote this through this door, that door or any other matter were guilty of stating something door I could find. I will tell honourable members something. After 28 years here, I would have found ray way out of this chamber if there was a way out. That, above all else, proves to me that Mr Reid could not have been right when he said that members of the Opposition had walked out. It is just not possible to get out of this chamber. Standing order 47 prevents one from doing so. Despite the fact that Mr Reid said that game of politics. The people outside do not know about it, but it is like a punch in I say quite sincerely that a reform of about this Parliament which was untrue. I could not care less what the Government thinks of it, but honourable members on this side of the House do not want to bcategorised as people who do not care for the dignity of Parliament, as psoplc who walk out and let the Parliament collapse, particularly when these suggestions are untrue and affect us in the community. It is a very serious allegation which was made against members of this Parliament, and if the charges have been proved against these people-as they undoubtedly have, as would be accepted by those who read the evidence-tb e requirement that they tender an apology is, compared with what happened in the Browne-Fitzpatrick case, a very mild form of rebuke. I put it in the category of being brushed across the forehead with a feather. Browne and Fitzpatrick were brought before ths Bar of the House charged with contempt not of the Parliament but of one member. Within 48 hours they were on their way to gaol for an offence against one member. Those concerned in this latest liament. While I do not want to show incident have been found guilty by the Privileges Committee of an offence against the whole Parliament. But what are they required to do? They are not required to come before the Bar of the House, but just to tender an apology. To my mind this is a mild punishment indeed, and Browne has the right to ask that his case be reopened and that we apologise to him because he received 3 months imprisonment for an offence against one member of this Parliament while this present offence is against the whole Parliament. These are matters that we have to consider and arc worthy of consideration at this stage. Even though the Committee has brought in this recommendation there are those who seek just to accept it and do nothing about it. They will be the laughing stock of the country if that is the case. Some penance is necessary for those who offend the dignity of this Parliament. This is a very mild penalty whicb is sought by the Privileges Committee. I give all due respect to my honourable friend who had the courage to vote in the Committee on a matter he saw affecting thc dignity of his Parliament. I give credit to those who may have voted against thc findings of the Committee because they did not agree with the methods adopted by the Privileges Committee which I mentioned earlier. But nothing can lake away the fact that even without a trial honourable members know that the e conr cerned in. this offence were stating false things about this Parliament. It might look funny to the public, bat there i.s nothing humorous in being depicted as people who do not do the right thing by those who have elected us. We have certain dignities and responsibilities. We occupy a high position in this country. And: if pressmen and others make is a laughing stock in this country and we do not take due retribution when we can take it in accordance, with the Standing Orders, lhat is something lhat honourable members must bear, realising that they are not doing the right thing by the people who sent them here. I understand that Mr Browne has already written to Mr Speaker asking whether he might appear before the Parliament again to vindicate his name in view of the leniency extended to those who offended not just one member, but the whole Parpersonal bias against the 'Daily Telegraph', Mr Reid or others, I suppose that not only no member of the Labor Parly but also no member on the Government side has any love for them. That is why I seek reform of parliamentary privileges. Quite frankly, I would find it difficult to give any of them a very fair trial if 1 were a member of the judiciary.' I am honest about that. But there could come an occasion when I. sit on that Privileges Committee. That is why ] say tonight that it is time for reform. From long, bitter and tedious experience, I know-and I repeat-that an honourable member cannot get out through the doors of this chamber when a quorum is called. Some of the smartest characters in this House have been beckoned back by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, or by the intelligent Clerk who sits on my right. Therefore we know that the article which is the subject of this case was written from fantasy, as it were, in an endeavour to discredit not so much the Liberal Party but the members of the Labor Party. We appear to be always the villains in this case. We are expected to stay here while the Liberals go to sleep all day. We are expected to keep the House for them, as it were. The people who really suffered ia this case were not the rxembers of the Government parties but the members of the Opposition. When it is the responsibUity of the Government tc run the House, why should members of the Opposition be defamed by a statement which was untrue and falsely represented and one in relation to which rhe Committee has found those responsible for its publication guilty of a breach of privilege? I pay tribute to those membeis of the Committee who have brought in this vetdict in view of all the evidence. Let me say to the Committee that I think it is a pretty shabby state of affairs when after deliberations that lasted, member for Ryan. AllI implied was that I 1 understand, for more than 30 hours, a decision was reached when some members could not possibly .be present because of their commitments. Surely when men's liberties are at stake it is good enough to expect that a committee meeting will be called al a time when all its members can be present so that all who have heard the evidence can deliberate on the issues that have to be decided. To reach a decision when a couple of membeis are away is not, to my mind, good enough. To the honourable member for Ryan( Mr Drury), who I understand exercised a casting vote, I say good luck for his courage on this important issue because it is a difficult position io be put in. Let me say in summary that I hope the House will give consideration to reviewing the procedures involved in the trying of men when their liberty could be at stake in certain circumstances. There is room for improvement in these procedures. Having read closely every vestige of the evidence in this case, and backed up by long experiway when he suggests that it is unjust to ence in this Parliament, 1 say that the findings of this Committee are correct, ancl if we adopt the motion moved by the Leader of the House it will be one of the greatest discredits ever brought on this national Parliament. sonal explanation. bett)-Order! Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? member for Grayndler, perhaps unwittingly, said that I , as Chairman of the Committee of Privileges, had called a meeting when I knew 2 members would not be able to attend. This is not correct. If he checks tomorrow the Hansard report of my speech he will find that I went to particular pains each time to ascertain from members before I fixed a date for the next meeting whether there could be a full attendance, As1 explained earlier tonight, it was not always possible to have a full attendance when the time came. But it is incorrect for the honourable member to say that I called a meeting knowing that 2 members would not be present. meant no reflection on the honourable thought it was unfortunate that meetings had been called when all members could not be there because of circumstances. I assure the honourable member that 1 made no personal reflection on him in relation to the calling of that meeting. (11.49) I speak as the first member on the Government side who I suppose has stood out to be counted in the last few weeks. It took many weeks to deal with this case. I have listened and watched with great interest in the last few days as suggestions have been made that the Committee of Privileges, because it was adopted from the British system at the beginning of the century, is completely unacceptable. The Committee was partially denigrated. I contend that the Committee will be much better when we have our own setup. However, up to 1970 it has been acceptable to most, but suddenly it becomes unacceptable. I support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) all the say that because he worked for the 'Daily Telegraph' he came down witb a vote of not guilty. This is an unworthy comment from any person. I refer the House to how the honourable member voted on 12th October in the case of the letter that had been printed in the 'Australian' claiming that to get anything done one had to give members of Parliament $10,000. On that case Messrs Brown, Donald Cameron, Crean, Jarman, Turnbull and Whitlam all voted together, whilst Mr Allan Fraser voted the other way despite tbe fact that the editor of the newspaper concerned had agreed that what was involved was a contempt of the Parliament.

The point 1 wish to make is that nowhere in the proceedings did anyone come forward and present evidence to suggest that members of the Australian Labor Party walked out. 1 would not care whether they were members of the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or the Country Party; the statement was made that men walked out. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro talked of intimidation at a particular meeting. I am' sorry that he raised that proceedings of the House or its members, question; but I assure him that he did not or have intimidation on his own.

It read carefully the evidence and crossis a very difficult task to convene and where he refused even to consider a withdrawal of the statement that had been printed in his newspapei. I come to the questhn: What exactly is privilege? I do not regard privilege as vidual members of this House. It is something that belongs to the people we represent. Privilege continues on. Although we something belonging to the people. The report of the Committee sets out quite clearly what constitutes a breach of privilege. I remind the House that when this matter was referred to the Privileges Committee we members of that Committee had to work on terms of reference which had been laid down at the beginning of Federation in Australia and which went back into the last three or four centuries. Let me remind honourable members-som e of those on my own side as well as some of those on the Opposition side-of exactly what constitutes a breach' of privilege. I quote the following from the report-and I will read it carefully: (1) A writing which reflects on the character or (2) A publication of proceedings of the House (3) A written imputation affecting the character or conduct of a Member or Membeis of the (4) A misrepresentation of the proceedings of man of the Committee of Privileges.

214,Examination Of Mr Mcnicol! They Will See Carry Out Properly The Proceedings Of The,"Committee during the times of parliamentary sittings. Perhaps the matter of whether the Committee should meet only outside of parliamentary sitting hours and in a proper, uninterrupted manner should be given consideration. Tbe present practice is not conducive lo arriving at a decision free of controversy, which I am sure everyCommittee. I cannot help but wonder one in this place would prefer. I do not question Mr Reid's belief that his article was correct. If one was to read carefully the mimttes of Mr Reid's evidence, one would see that he believed what he said. But with respect, 1 suggest that he we had a Committee of Privileges system was badly misled. I know that many journalists depend on certain people as sources of information. After a time, and after fhe passing of a certain amount of information, they might regard a source as being reliable or unreliable. This has nothing to do with the Committee or ihe Parliament. But if such journalists rely on people, whether they have reason to rely pn them or not. and they suddenly find themselves writing the wrong thing, J regard that as a peril of occupation and an indication that perhaps more checking was required. I repeat my view, and the view of every member of the Committee, including even the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Firstly, I am deeply concerned about the Turnbull)-as contained in (he minutes of the proceedings of the various meetingsthat no member of the Labor Opposition walked out of the Parliament. ourable member is rather unusual. Each and every one of us in this Parliament has been misrepresented by the Press at some time. I recall another unusual person named Mungo McCallum writing an article some weeks ago which reported certain events in the Parliament. I could have easily s'.ood in my place and taken a point of order on misrepresentation and so on. But honourable members are used to this and no-one gets greatly inflamed unless he feels that an injustice has been done. The facts are that under the present system any member of the Press is liable at any time to become the subject of an inquiry such as the one just, completed. Many articles are written which are inaccurate. Perhaps they are only partially inaccurate but a thing is either true or false and, as 1 said Thcy were thefindingsand lhat i.s what is earlier, once the Committee found that a breach had been committed or that tbe article was false it had no alternative but to come forward with the present suggestion. Every effort has been made over the last few weeks to denigrate the findings of this whether, if some other journalist had been involved, the same lengths would have been reached in an effort to bring about a different decision. These are questions which can only be asked because no-one really knows. I reiterate that it is time that operating in a way that would remove us from the areas of criticism which unfortunately have arisen this time, particularly because of the recommittals. FinallyT hope lhat every honourable member of this Parliament will be objective when voting on the amendment because if justice is to be done it must be done for all and not just for special people. Thursday, 9 December 1971 enter this debate for 2 major reasons. motion moved by the Leader of tbe House, the Minister for National Development ( Mr Swartz). It is: That this House agrees witb the Committee in its findings and is of opinion that it would best consult its own dignity by taking no further action in the matter. They sound very rational, balanced words-ver y rational indeed. But if one examines the recommendations of the Privileges Committee one finds that it could not present a majority decision to this Parliament. The Committee found after deep consideration thai Mr A. D. Reid and Mr D. R. McNicoll were guilty. The Committee'sfindingswere as follows: (a) That the article published in the 'Daily Telegraph' of Friday, 27 August 1971 constitutes a contempt of the House of Representatives, and fb) That Mr A. D.

In fairness to Mr Reid. he is a journalist, he lives md works here and he accepts the forms of the House, and he can probably accep; that he should apologise. But the lord and master Sir Frank Packer is a different kettle of fish. He will not apologise. He is one who is going to be tough; he is the one who is going to say: 'To hell with thera. I am not going to apologise'. This, is what we have to face. We have to face that man who says: 'To hell with Parliament. To hell with politicians; what does it matter about people who are elected? After all, I have the power to make these decisions and I will make the decision'. In the time that is left to me I would like to quote 2 further extracts of what was said by the honourable member for Mitchell. The report states: Mr Irwin1 do want it recorded, too, that 1 reported the incident immediately afterwards to the Prime Minister'ssecretaries and I remonstrated in a particular place with the Prime Minister for taking the responsibility. I said: 'It is libelled outside this Parliament one is was a walk-out'. He said it was a walk-out. What evidence able member says-it was a walk-out. The report continues: That was after-nothin g to do wilh the circumstances-bu t I remonstrated with the Prime Minister and told him that he had no right to accept the responsibility as front what I knew and heard, it was a walk-out. Under examination the honourable member gave evidence that he had passed a group of people. At first be said that he did not know who they were. Then as shown on page 138 of the evidence the honourable member for Mitchell was under cross examination by tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam): and you few people desire. It was Bill Fulton. Then again, he was walling along and it would only be by his voice that I would know him, but I am almost certain-9 9 per cent certain-that it was Bill Fulton that said it Chainnan-Thank you, Mr Irwin. duress, because I do not like putting somebody in unless I am positive. Anybody who has read thc evidence and who wanted to be fair about it would know that there is something crook in Tallarook. They know that there is pressure, outside pressure. But does anybody get a Press like the honourable member for Mitchell gets in the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph*. What contribution does he make to this Parliament? l t is laughable. It is just laughable that such an honourable member gets such a national coverage as he gets in the 'Daily Telegraph'. I have no personal animosity against Mr Reid or any other person but there is a' dignity involved here and a mistake has been made. I ask honourable members to support the proposition of the honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope) that there has been a mistake made. The evidence is there. There was plenty of opportunity to prove it. It was hearsay. Mr Reid said himself that he was not in the House; he was relying on hearsay. If he is relying on hearsay he has to prove his case. We do not have to prove that he was wrong. 1 think we are entitled to an apology. If one entitled to an apology. Under the Defamation Act one has to apologise. As far as I am concerned this House was defamed and it was used for political capital. This started off as a minor matter but it is now a major question because of the cobweb of deceit put through this evidence. It is a bit sickening that such members of Parliament as the honourable member for Mitchell could' give sucb evidence. I ask any honourable member to look at the evidence that he has given. It will be seen that there is a complete distortion of the facts and that he in fact probably was the informer who made that stupid story and sold the story and, of course, it is to Mr Reid's discredit that he did nof check or double check sufficiently before he wrote it. want to make one or two very short observations. I start by taking up the last comments of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) about this Parliament having been offended. I would seek to remind my honourable friend and the person who moved this motion that this is the national Parliament; it is not a borough council. I have had 16 years here.

231,Mr Kille N (Moreton) (12.15 A.m.),"Iin 16 years have I asked any person to withdraw anything said about me. When dealing with a national parliament we are not dealing with some curio; we are dealing with an institution that has a character think this is wrong. That is the general and a quality about it. I think that the beginning-ton s et origo, if my distinguished friend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) will forgive this lapse into Latin When this matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges I thought it was a disgraceful reference.. I have said elsewhereI hope that those who have heard it said elsewhere will forgive me if I say it again-that if any pf us who come in here have an overweening anxiety about our own feelings it is high time we got out. This remark goes also for the Parliament. I draw parUamentary privilege in a very narrow aspect. I have sat on Privileges rommittees. I sat on the Privileges Committee when the right honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) was grievously offended and the Committee brought in its finding. But every time a person writes about the Parliament, about the Leader of the Opposition, about tbe Minister for National Development, about the Minister for Defence or about such unsuspecting souls as .myself-the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn) has just collapsed with excitement-is it seriously suggested that we should say: 'Look, I feel upset; 1 feel as though my privilege has been invaded'? The western democratic parliamentary institution has not been built on such shallow grounds and it will not survive on such shallow grounds. I know my friends over there. Many of us have confided in each other over the years. We disagree, but so be it; it adds nothing to the gaiety of our existence. I simply voice the expression, and I hope that honourable members will respect me for it, that we should not draw too narrowly. Because a person outside complains about the Parliament we should not get up and complain about him. This is the greatest forum in the nation, bar none. I do not know of any other. If honourable members can come in here and command respect their message can go into every home throughout the country. What finer forum do they seek to command than that? Because some person may seek to place his distemper upon you, because he may seek to impeach you, does one seek to put him upon the cross? I principle. 1 have been insulted but I hope that I have not displayed my reaction too vividly. When people have said something about me I have taken the view that they will. keep. I have written it inside my little black book'-'Gough upset me, 18th March 1971; right honourable member for Lowe upset mc same day'. I hope the House will understand the way I fed about the matter. I am really upset about the matter when I look at the Committee's report. The Committee cannot operate unless it has a quorum. It had a quorum and it took a vote. It found Mr Reid not guilty. I repeat the words 'not guilty'. Forgive me for emphasising that. I have a very distinguished friend, Mr Dan Casey of counsel, a member of the Queensland Bar. He is probably one of the few counsel in the English speaking world who has been involved in hundreds of murder trials. On one occasion, when cross-examining a character, he said: 'That is not the evidence you gave below'. The inspector of police replied: 'No, but there is only one word different, Mr Casey'. Mr Casey said: 'Yes, bnt there is only one word of difference between guilty and not guilty'. I ask honourable menibers to look at this report. The Committee, meeting as a properly constituted quorum, found Mr Reid not guilty. One is not at liberty to take the view that some members of the Committee were present and some were not. Those members who were present heard the evidence. The responsibility fell upon them. The moment that Committee gave its decision, that was the end of the matter. To put it in LatinI do not know much Latin-it was functus officio; that was the end of it. I looked at the report and found that the matter was recommitted. I was reminded of a jury which met in Cloncurry, which is in the heart of the electorate represented by my distinguished friend from Kennedy( Mr Katter). A man was charged with catde stealing.

235,Mr Killen,"There it is, my friend.really: it is a sort of provincial sport. Thc jury went out. It came back and the judge's associate asked: 'Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached your verdict?* 'Yes', the foreman replied. 'Do you find the accused guilty or not guilty of the charge of cattle stealing*, thc associate asked. The foreman of the jury said: 'Not guilty, provided he hands the cattle back*. The judge hit the roof and said: 'You cannot possibiy bring in a verdict like that. Go out'. The jury went out, much to their bewilderment, and after having a cigarette came back. The same question was asked: 'Is the accused guilty or nor guiity of the charge of stealing cattle?' The Foreman said; 'Not Guiity, and he need not hand the cattle back'. Those who have served on the Privileges Committee have had a difficult time. They, have been exposed to a variety of pressures. sures one way or the other. I hold no brief for Sir Frank PackerI was going to call him Sir Spank Fracker. I try to speak witb a measure of frankness or candor, to enter into a safer form of consonantal pronunciation. I think it is a'great pity if the Parliament, the national Parliament, at 12.25 a.m. on 9th December, as we are gathering for the Chrisimas rush, is occupying itself with this tizzy little affair. on to withdraw it and to apologise for it. I want to say quite bluntly that I do not know from where the impeachment will come, one side or the other, but J am firmly committed against voling for any proposition that seeks to condemn a person for having made any insult, any slight upon this Parliament.

But more important matters. I might make an not less seriously-rathe r more seriouslyexception where a Minister in answer to a thc House should remember that there question, ostensibly without notice, obtrudes some reflection. I take the general attitude that there are more important things to do. Nevertheless it is rather late in the day for the honourable gentleman to take this atliiude on this matter. Whenk was referred to the Committee of Privileges not one voice was raised against the reference, and the Committee devoted many days and many hours to the contemplation of this matter, lt spent 14 days on this and on associated inquiries, because some of them were heard on the same days. It devoted about 30 hours. It is rather late to say. tliat we should not have worried ourselves with the matter. When the Committee did have this reference it had to do its duty and consider the reference. There was undoubtedly a contempt. The motion that thc Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) has moved says there was a contempt. The Committee unanimously said there was d contempt.

There is no dispute among honourable One of the reasons why 1 have to speak Committee that there was no contempt was recommitted. I should have imagined that this? The Committee did consider it in various attendances and finally and usually made, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and I were absent. The last time. I missed a sitting of this House was in August 1964. The last time the honourable member for Melbourne Ports missed a sitting was 2 years before. This Committee met, I thrnk I said, on 14 days. I attended 12 of the days and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports attended 13. It would have been more gracious if the persons who made these references to absence bad had a better attendance at the Committee or in the House. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports and I have some seniority in this place and some obligations. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports was concerned with the Banks (Shareholdings) Bill cn the day when this decision was made. I also had spoken on that day. I forget what detained me afterwards. But perhaps it will not be taken amiss if I point out that the Government Parties take this Committee quite lightly. At Westminster, the Attorney General, the Leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Party are members of the Privileges Committee. Other members are former Attorneys-General, chairmen and senior members of the House. I do not reflect on those wbo from the Government Parties have served on our Committee or who are serving on it but it is clear that only tbe Chainnan himself has had a long membership of the House and that there are no persons with experience as presiding officers or as Ministers who have served on it. I should make a few concluding remarks on this matter. Mr Reid never made the excuses on his own behalf that some earlier speakers have made. If he had pleaded, as I suppose he might have done, that he had to meet a deadline, that he had been betrayed by a hitherto infallible and unfailing source or that he was under some sudden illness, then one would have understood and made allowances. He pleaded self was asked: If it were to transpire that the whole of the Committee after hearing the evidence given before people have walked out the doors of this them concluded that Mr Reid's statements were inaccurate, would that affect your own conclusion chamber. On many occasions when that bas as to the accuracy ofhis statements? It would certainly make me take another look at the whole situation, yes. There is no indication from the 'Daily Telegraph' that any further consideration has been given to this matter by the Editor-inChief. We are making excuses for the 2 gentlemen thai they have been too proud to make for themselves. The House has before it 2 motions pp'On which it can vote. Both of them accept that a contempt was committed. Are we then to baulk at the logical and honest conclusion in view of that finding in those motions and the conduct of those witnesses? want to stale right now that I am the person who, within 5 or 10 minutes of the incident, went straight to the Prime Minister's office and told the Prime Minister's secretary what had occurred aud what I had heard. I have here a Bible and 1 would swear by almighty God that as I walked down the stairs and into the hall 6 or' 7 people, members of the LaborParty, came along and one of them exclaimed to other Labor Party members coming towards the chamber: 'We have walked out'. I gave evidence before the Privileges Committee about 8 weeks later. I had not thought that the incident would blow up into the proportions that it reached. HadT known, I would have memorised the names of the people who had said that they had walked out. Unfortunately Sir John Cramer has left Parliament House tonight. I have sent a message for him to come here. He would tell you that those persons gathered around him and said: 'We walked out. Do not bother going in. It is only a quorum.' Honourable members heard what Sir John Cramer said yesterday. The transcript of evidence before the Privileges Committee shows that not one member has sworn that no-one walked out the doors of the chamber. They swore that they did not see anyone walk out. There is a vast difference between swearing that you saw someone walk out and swearing that yoii did not see someone walk out.

They are the facts of the case and, of course, the facts always hurt. of them? apparently you do not remember that this matter did not come up until 10 or 12 days afterwards. Order! I ask the honourable member for Mitchell to address his remarks to the Chair and I also remind honourable members that interjections are out of order. not come up until 10 or 12 days afterwards, and of course it was not of any great moment at the time the particular incident happened. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) was astounded and stunned when a quorum was not reached within the specified time. He wondered where all the members had gone. When the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr men; stand up and be counted. I say to Daly) went over to congratulate the honourable member for Kingston it took him quite a long time befoie he proffered his hand to shake hands with the honourable member for Grayndler. The honourable member for Reid (. Mr Uren), I am sure, will not deny that he I saw him do so. When I was giving evidence before , the Committee J. was meticulous to ensure that I did not make a misstatement, or utter an untruth. I tried to be very careful. I did not .want to name the person who said: 'We walked out' because after 8 weeks I was not positive about it. But there was a journalist in the gallery, or in the precincts of the House, who says that 2 Labor members said to him: 'We walked out'. That person was Mungo McCallum. Of his own volition, he approached Mr David McNicoll. in company with Mr Baudino, and offered to make a statutory declaration to the effect that 2 members of the Labor Party said that it was a *walkout' or that they had 'walked out'. head now? for Adelaide can hear the evidence all over again But of his own volition, Mr McCallum, in company with Mr Baudino, approached Mr David McNicoll and offered to sign a statutory declaration. Mr Baudino will sign a statutory declaration to that effect tomorrow morning and give it to the Speaker of this House. NowI come to the amazing statements made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). On the day of the second trial in this case the Leader of the Opposition told the Privileges Committee that he could not accept or he could not return to his Caucus with a verdict of not guilty or not proven. This is what he said, and there is no doubt about it. It does not appear in the evidence. Of course, all these things should appear in the evidence. But that is what he said, and there is no doubt about it. They may not be the exact words, but he did say words to that effect, and nobody on the Committee can deny that he did say them.

If honourable members read the evidence, as no doubt most of them have, they will decision not to apologise, as stated in the minutes, is that he has this complete faith and belief in Reid's reporting. That is the only reason why tonight I pointed to the 4 mistakes in Reid's stories on the one day. Three were mistakes which 1 think nobody in this House and nobody in thc Press gallery would make. The other dealt with the salaries which we have been seeing for a considerable time. The3 mistakes were not made by any other newspaper, although the same story was given to those newspapers. the Opposition)Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. Order! Does the Leader of the Opposition claim to have been misrepresented? member for Mitchell( Mr Irwin) misrepresented me. He attributed to me a statement allegedly made during the Committee hearing. I never made any statement in those words or in similar words or in similar substance. In fact, on none of the days that I attended the meetings of the Committee did any of the members advance arguments in Party terms. for Social Services) (12.56 a.m.)-As so for Grayndler said-and they will read it often happens in this House, the most tomorrow in Hansard-the y will see significant speech on the Opposition's side that has been made by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), and I will return order. I will let the cat out of the bag to that speech in a moment. It has been too. My point of order is that the matter admitted that nobody who appeared before being referred to by the honourable memthe Privileges Committee was untruthful. ber has nothing to do with the reference The Committee came to the conclusion that to the Committee. a mistake had been made. The question before the House relates to the significance of that mistake. If the mistake was an Orderl The point of order is without subinsignificant one, the motion as proposed stance.

Let us look at this matter, lt has been quite obvious from speeches made by members of the Opposition that they believe that they have been wronged by this statement. They believe that they have been put in a wrong light. They say that they would not do a thing like this and that what was suggested was entirely foreign to thc way in which the Opposition behaves. The honourable member for Grayndler made it quite clear that this contention could not be upheld. The honourable member for Grayndler said: 'This is the way in which we do behave. I was caught in the chamber, lf I had been able to get out of the chamber T would have got out. But I could not do so'. Tliat is what he said. This is how the Opposition behaves. The Opposition was trying to bring about the result which it did bring about. Opposition members have been saying: It is our job to keep the Government on its toes.' Every member knows that this is what the Opposition does time and time again. So often I come along the corridor to answer the quorum bells and find Opposition members going in the opposite direction. They say: 'We are not going to get into the House. It is only a quorum'. I have seen this happening dozens of times. hundreds of times, but certainly dozens of times. This is the way in which the Opposition behaves.

Everything that he has said up to this stage is quite irrelevant to the motion your experience in the cbair, Sir, that the and the amendment before the House.

I ask you, Sir, to request the Minister quorums for that purpose. That is why it to withdraw that statement.. does so. One sees members of the Opposition Minister for Social Services has said that member of the Parliament. thc Opposition is complaining about being charged with a crime which it was only the remarks made in this debate by the attempting to commit. There is nothing in honourable member for Grayndler who, the matters referred to the Committee of describing his own conduct on that night, Privileges which says that the Opposition said that if he had been able to get out of was trying to commit a crime. There is no the chamber he would have done so. He allegation that menibers of the Opposition said: ' I have been a member of this House were trying to get out of the chamber.

Mr I>ALY (Grayndler)1 wish to make a personal explanation. -Does Ihe honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? Social Services made certain allegations against me which are known to the House. The point I was explaining was that Mr answer to that is simply that Ihe matter Reid's statement must have been completely false because under the Standing Orders tt is impossible for an honourable meniber to leave the House when a quorum has been called. I. did not at any stage say lhat it was thc Opposition's intention to leave the House. Rather1 soiight to prove the falsity of the statement by indicating not that I was trying to get out of the House but that it was completely wrong to suggest that any member of this Parliament could get out once a quorum had been called. 1 explained the position clearly lo the House and the Minister has misinterpreted what I said in an endeavour to defend one of his friends, irrespective of the findings of the Commirtee. able member cannot debate the matter. When I was reading the report of the Privileges Committee one phrase caught my eye. It occurs on page 9 of the report and deals with proceedings of the House of Commons in 1953. After finding that a certain set of circumstances did constitute a breach of privilege of the Parliament, the Committee of that House went on to say: But. . . it is not every such breach of privilege which is worthy of occupying thc time walked out to cause it. Neither do I have of the House. In my view lhat sentiment is appropriate here and should be adopted in order to maintain a reasonable perspective. According to the record, we had 9 grown men attending umpteen meetings and spending hundreds of man-hours of labour producing a report 1 inch thick and 205 pages long. And what about? It was about a statement by a journalist that a number of Australian Labor Party members walked out during a quorum when the accepted fact is that they did not. We have spent time enough on this both in the Committee and in thc Parliament and we would be taking action enough if we were to take the action suggested to us by the Leader of. the House( Mr Swartz). I say that with the. greatest respect to those .of . my colleagues who think otherwise. I take into account the views of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) who asked why, if that is so, we agreed in thc first place to refer this 'matter to the Committee. I would have thought that the was raised, that prima facie .it did indicate a misrepresentation of facts and that it was reasonable in those circumstances to have some .investigation made to. sec what action, if any, should be taken. The whole colour .of the situation could have been changed, for example, had it been demonstrated that there was some element of deliberateness. or malice.. So far as I am aware tbe Committee, including those in favour of its full recommendation, has not been prepared to make any statement indicating that either element existed. It .is agreed that the Press report was wrong or mistaken or false, depending .on how much malice one wants to attribute to it. But where do we go from there? At one point in the report the following passage appears: The Presiding Officer or the membsrs have been held up to hatred, ridicule aiid contempt. The Presiding Officer or the member!, have been disparaged and (he institution has been damaged. AgainI say with the greatest respect to the author of that statement that, I am sorry but I do not accept it. If any damage was done to the institution by the incident in question the damage was done by the collapse of the House and not by the statement that bonourable members deliberately evidence to show that individual members have been prejudiced by the report. One of our problems in this House is that we tend to take our own procedures too seriously in the sense that we believe that the eyes of the world are glued upon us and that people are ascribing the same significance to our individual acts that we sometimes tend to ascribe to them ourselves. Divisions are just one example of that .attitude. We go through periods when we fee) that a great number of divisions",117,Committee Of Privileges

275,Mr Deputy Speaker,-The honour,118,Committee Of Privileges
276,Mr Berinson (Perth) (1.6 A.m.),"will impress people with the seriousness of our attitude to some proposal whereas in fact people who are listening on the radio are simply irked by the silence and those who are reading Hansard simply flip over the pages. Again, we know that we should in theory in divisions have a margin of 7. We sometimes tend to believe that if we can only reduce that to 6 we will have gained a victory and that if we relax it to 8 or 9 people will say we have slipped. I think that most of that is unrealistic and is ties' responsibility, and theirs alone, to to be attributed to the fact that this place tends to divorce us from reality too much. If the public understood our proceedings at all, J believe that at worse it would think that even had we gone out-ther e is no question about the fact that we did not-w e were not after the collapse of the House, as the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) has been trying to suggest, but that we were after some added inconvenience to members on the Government side, and Ministers in particular. Given the scarce resources at the disposal of the Opposition to harass the Government when harassment seems in order, I would even go so far as to say that harassment of Ministers in this way, depending on other circumstances, would hot be unreasonable or something of which we might be ashamed. To summarise what seems to have occurred, in the first place an incident was said to have taken place which did not take place. Secondly, I accept that, as the Committee suggests, the statement made in the newspaper did constitute a breach of the privilege of the Parliament. I do not even qualify that by extending reference to the fact that to establish that we have to go back to some reference of the House of Commons of 1699. Finally, having agreed with those 2 facts, one has to come to some judgment of the seriousness of the position. In spite of the tirade of the Minister for Social Services, who all but talked me out of my resolve, I have to come to the conclusion on my own judgment that the matter was simply not so serious as to merit being laboured by both the Committee and this House to the extent that it has, and no more ° serious than would have been amply met by the motion moved by the Leader of the House. Dr MACKAY (Evans-Minister for the Navy) (1.13 a.m.)I would like to follow the honourable member for Perth( Mr Berinson) because I believe that be has brought an element of common sense into this situation. I would like to remind the House of the way in which the Prime whole matter the day after the incident in question occurred, when he refused to accept the kinds of divisions that have been suggested tonight and fully accepted the fact that it was the Government parensure that the House was kept and that a quorum was present. There has been tonight a lot of discussion as to the relative merits or purposes or objectives of the Opposition in exercising its function in what was called keeping the Government on its toes. Tonight it has been stated by the honourable member for Perth, who has just spoken, that a quorum is called not necessarily to bring about the collapse of the House so much as to cause great inconvenience to the Ministry in particular and to members on the Government side in general. This of course is recognised. During the 8 years I have been here it has been a fully recognised fact that this is one of the methods that an opposition has to harass a government. At a late hour of the night, and when the Opposition feels that business should be going in a way contrary to that which is being pursued, it is one of the legitimate devices for harassing a government. This is. as the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) said in his speech, one of the rules of the game as much as some of the things that can take place in a rugby scrum, and it is fully recognised. But on the night in question the honourable member for Grayndler will recollect that I came into the chamber) immediately on the ringing of the bells. I had been immediately outside the door. I felt that there was something rather different about this evening. There were obviously a number of people who did not come into the chamber. I called out to the honourable member for Grayndler in a somewhat joking manner: 'What is the matter, Fred? Did you lose a toss in the Caucus meeting this morning?' In what I thought was mock horror at the suggestion that it was a put-up job, he replied: 'What a dreadful thing to suggest', or words to that effect.",118,Committee Of Privileges
277,Minister ( Mr Mcmahon) Dealt With This,"lt was my impression that there was a plan, and a successful plan, behind it. Perwhich had never happened before-then , haps the plan was more successful than was intended. But it was as a result of a deliberate action that the House was counted out. ment members did not turn up. Dr MACKAYI fully accept that, and the Prime Minister the next morning fully accepted it. It was tbe Government's responsibility. But the point 1 want to make is that, instead pf having a slanging match between the 2 sides of the House, the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) has put before tbe House a motion which, I believe, states quite fairly the relative merits of the case. Certainly, as will be apparent to all who have read the evidence, there was an explicit statement that was untrue in the exact wording and verbiage that was used in the newspaper. In terms of the spirit of the occasion and in terms of the severity of the incident that was being discussed, 1 believe that the motion before the House sums up very nicely what should be the proper attitude of the House. Certainly a mistake was made. Certainly it was something that reflected on the House and went far beyond what could ordinarily be intended by the circumstances. But the dignity of the House is best served by simply noting that fact. That is the reason why I-and , 1 hope, a majority of honourable members!-wil l support tbe motion moved by the Leader of the House. Dr Jf. F. CAIRNS (Lalor) (1.17 a.m.)-It seems to me that in this matter the House has a choice to make which is one that has been delayed unduly long. Whether it considers that the report in the 'Daily Telegraph' of what happened on the night in question-that certain members of the Opposition had deliberately left the chamber after the quorum bells had rung-is serious enough to be satisfied by the motion before the House, which is merely that the House notes this and relies upon its dignity; or whether, if this was a false report, the 'Daily Telegraph' should be required to publish an apology. It seems to me that the amendment is approporiate. If the honourable member for Perth( Mr this. In Mr Uren's case the court said the Berinson) was correct and this was simply an accident or simply a mistake by Mr very high 5-figure award for damages. I Reid-a n isolated incident, one alone, to my mind, his argument would be supportable. But, of course, this is not an isolated incident. It is not just one incident alone. It is not just a mistake. Even if the journalist concerned, Mr Reid, were willing to rely upon a person like the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Irwin) alone, I think he would be vulnerable to pretty serious criticism because, if a journalist with a by-line that goes all over Australia is the kind of man who conducts his work by relying on people like the honourable member for Mitchell and sees fit to check with nobody else, then he is seriously at fault. That is not the way we want journalists in this building to report the proceedings of this House. If he has no better authority than the honourable member for Mitchell, who runs to him and others with stories deliberately calculated to harm the Labor Party on every opportunity he gets, then the journalist concerned is not being fair; he is being biased and he is seeking to do as much damage as he possibly can to one side of the House. But, of course, this is not an isolated incident. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-Of course that is his job. If he did not do his job like that, he would not keep it. But this is not an isolated incident. A little while ago the honourable member for Prospect quoted in the House4 other mistakes this week. Dr 3. F. CAIRNS-In one day. The mistake concerning the salary does not matter. But the mistake about marihuana does matter. What is the purpose of that report? It is to suggest to the credulous reader of the 'Daily Telegraph' that the Australian Labor Party is tied up in the marihuana racket and that it wants permissiveness in the taking of drugs. Tbat is the purpose of the report. Is not there malice in that? Of course there is malice in the attitude of the 'Daily Telegraph'. The 'Daily Telegraph' has libelled at least 3 or 4 members on this side of thc House. The courts of not only the States but also the Commonwealth have found libel was malicious enough to run into a",119,Committee Of Privileges
278,Mr Reynolds;,l t was because Govern,120,Committee Of Privileges
279,Dr Klugman,That is his job.,120,Committee Of Privileges
280,Dr Klugman,"In one day.was libelled by tbe 'Daily Telegraph'. Sir Jrank Packer chose to settle that case with a payment that ran into 5 figures rather than see the case taken into court. He knew there was enough malice in what he had done, together with his own costs, for an award for damages running into 5 figures to be granted if it were taken into court. Do not tell me that there is no malice in what the 'Daily Telegraph' reports about this Parliament. Therefore. I think that if this incident is taken, for political reasons, as an isolated incident, a mistake or reliance upon an unreliable witness, what the Leader of the House proposes would be an appropriate remedy. But if it is seen in the context of a carefully arranged plan with malice aforethought to damage as much as possible and continuously one side of this House and unduly praise and improperly report activities on the other side of the House, it becomes a different matter. If it was left alone to Mr Reid, the matter would not be so serious. One might be able to explain it away in Mr Reid's terms. But this cannot be done when it is realised and Sir Frank Packer. If Sir Frank Packer was not involved the Leader of the House would not have come in here with a watered down version of the Committee's report. The Leader of the House would have come in here supporting the Committee's report. I say that Sir Frank Packer's influence in this House has gone much too far. If there were no better reason to support a requirement that the 'Daily Telegraph' should apologise, that would be very good reason to do it. It is about time we decided to stop a little Sir Frank Packer's influence in this House. Some people believe he has selected the Prime Minister for us. Some people believe he has a continuous and improper influence upon the Government. Some people believe he has a continuous and improper influence upon Ministers and membeis of the Government parties. We do. not face a simple isolated matter about a report of some members of the House who left it after the quorum bells rang. We. face a conspiracy. It is ,a conspiracy to damage and endanger. The honourable meniber for Chisholm( Mr Staley) from the academic circles and the ivory towers of thc University of Melbourne comes in here with his innocence and laughs. The honourable member will find, when he grows a little more hair on his face and gains a little more political experience, that he is not living the same kind of life now as the one he was brought up in. He will find that this place is a little harder and a little tougher than he imagined it to be when he studied it academically before arriving here. If it has not happened already, he will be brought before the finger of Sir Frank Packer or some similar newspaper magnate in the future. I would leave the decision he has to make about that to him. This House has to decide whether it will accept the kind of biased and prejudiced reporting that the 'Daily Telegraph' has adopted constantly about affairs in this House in at least the 16 years that I have been here. No, this is a much more serious matter than an isolated instance that might have been based on a mistake or on a leak by an unreliable witness; it is something much more considerable than that. Further, the penalty suggested by the Privileges Committee is not a serious penalty. The Committee merely said to these people: Because you have misreported something about the activities of this House we ask you to apologise for that misreporting. I would have thought that anyone with any sense of manners or propriety would have been prepared to go that far under any circumstances. But why will not the Government go that far? The answer is, because it is the 'Daily Telegraph' that is involved. I do not intend to spend any time examining the procedures of the Privileges Committee. I believe that is irrelevant to the matter. I think the Privileges Committee unanimously came to the decision that there was what it called a contempt in this article, that is to say, there was a misreporting. The only difference of opinion amongst members of the Committee is about what should be done, and that is the only difference of opinion amongst honourable members in this House tonight. I think it is perfectly reasonable to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope) that we ask these people who have misreported the House, with. at least some element of malice, to apologise for doing so.",120,Committee Of Privileges
281,That The Matter Also Involves Mr Mcnicoll,"a.m.)-This matter seems to me to be singularly clear. Tbe report of the Privileges 'reasonable' and I repeat it. This does not Committee makes 2 points. The first is that a breach of privilege was committed because an untrue report was made in a newspaper about a happening in this House. The second point is that this being so, the guilty party should apologise, that is to say, there is to be a penalty. The secconstitute mens rea in this case. That is my ond point can be dealt with very quickly. The matter is so trivial that the House has not consulted its dignity in dealing with it at such enormous length as it has tonight. The matter was trivial; there should be no apology; there should be no penalty. I should have thought that this would be as clear as crystal. The first point made by the Privileges Committee needs a little more attention. The Committee said that as an untrue report was made about a proceeding of this House a breach of privilege, therefore, had been committed. I listened with attention to the speeches made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) and the honourable member for Diamond Valley( Mr Brown), both of whom made an extremely valid point. In a sense this is a kind of criminal matter. Indeed, for a breach of privilege some little time ago many of us may remember that 2 accused persons were incarcerated; they were sent to gaol -So in a sense this is a criminal matter, and in this sense also it may incur a penalty, which is a characteristic of a criminal matter. There is a very well established principle of law that to constitute a crime you must have not only a particular act as defined but also a criminal intent; what the lawyers, if I recall the dog Latin they use, refer to as mens rea, that is, a guilty mind. Now, when I look at this case I find that the act was committed. That is to say, something untrue about the proceedings of this House was stated in the Press. So far one ingredient in this criminal act is established. But what about the other element, the guilty mind? I have read the relevant part of tlie report with some care and I do not propose to read it again. Probably it has been read several times already. However, from reading it I would reach the conclusion that the journalist concerned (Bradfield) (1.27 made reasonable inquiries to satisfy himself that what he said was true. I said, necessarily mean that he saw something with his own eyes but merely that he had reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. Only if he were so utterly careless of the truth lhat he could not care whether what he said was true or false could this opinion. He satisfied himself as reasonably as journalists do and so one essential ingredient to make this a criminal act was not present. It is true he said something that was false but he did not do so with criminal intent. He was not utterly careless of what he said and he would have to be as careless as that for this to have constituted criminal intent. Therefore, having an old fashioned idea that this being a matter of privilege it should be approached by the House in a judicial frame of mind, I conclude firstly that there was not a breach of privilege, and secondly that, even if there were, the matter is so trivial that the House should have consulted its dignity and not wasted so much time on this matter. Dr GUN (Kingston) (1.31 a.m.)I want to speak for only a few minutes and make a smail contribution as I was certainly the person wbo started the whole business off by calling a quorum. I cannot agree with those honourable members who regard this as a trival matter. I think that if they had been subjected to a campaign of the kind that was directed against me by the morning newspaper in South Australia, which attempted to discredit me as much as possible as a result of what happened, they would agree that this is not a light matter. I think most people in Australia who think about politics do regard the counting out of the House earlier this year for the first time for many years as a serious matter. I believe it is a matter that must be taken very seriously by all members of this Parliament. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) did suggest earlier that this was part of our job, that people expect the Opposition to try to close the Parliament down if it can. I am sure that this is not what Mr Reid intended to convey when he wrote the article in the 'Daily Telegraph'. Surely he is not going to try to tell us that he was",121,Committee Of Privileges
282,Mr Turner,"trying to praise the Opposition for being alert and doing its job in counting the House out. Everybody here knows that the object of Mr Alan Reid in writing the article was to try to discredit the Opposition. I might just put the record straight because I think that the Minister for the Navy (Dr Mackay) might have misrepresented things when he said this was deliberately brought about. For the information of honourable members 1 point out that on the day that the quorum could not be formed, 1 was sitting here with fhe honourable member for Sturt( Mr Foster). 1 called the quorum with the .sole intention of trying to get an audience for the honourable member for Sturt. There was no intention on my part to try. to close the House down. I think an honourable member mentioned the fact that there was some surprise on my part. I think that is probably fairly true. I was extremely surprised. It was not my intention to close the House down at all. It is not my custom to call quorums. 1 had not called one before and T will probably not call one again. But it was a serious matter as far as I was concerned and there was certainly an effort by the Adelaide 'Advertiser' to represent it as a very serious matter. It said that T was trying to close thc Parliament down. . I suppose it is rafher amusing ro think about it now because the photograph of me that appeared in the newspaper made it look as if I had spent the night in the cells. The photograph had been taken a couple of months before when ! had returned from India. I had been held up by Customs at Tullamarine because I had been to an area where there had been foot ahd mouth disease. The Customs took my clothing. They took everything except my shirt, trousers, shoes and socks. They even took my razor blade. When I reached the Adelaide AirportI had more than a 5 o'clock shadow and no clean clothing. I looked as if I had been dragged through an anaesthetic machine backwards or something like that. This photograph was not published immediately after I had returned from India, but this photograph of the convict-looking person appeared the day after the quorum could not be formed on the front page of the 'Advertiser' as the bloke who had successfully closed the Parliament down. 1 think that honourable members would also appreciate the situation if I pointed out to the House that a representative of one of the Adelaide television stations, meeting me at the airport, asked me: 'Do you really think that parliamentarians' salaries increases are really warranted in view of what went on verierday?' I want to refer to only one other maitcr because I believe it is important. I want to relate my remarks to something which was mentioned by the honourable meniber lot Diamond Valley( Mr Brown), who is lot here at the moment-and I think that other honourable members, including thc honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) said the same sort of thing afterwards-that we should take no action because Mr Reid made the error in good faith. I point out that this attitude is completely inconsistent, as far as I can see. with tbe attitude that was expressed during the hearing of ihe Privileges Committee which inquired into a letter which was published in the 'Australian' on 13th September 1971. The letter was written by a person rejoicing in the name of P. Wintle, who wrote to the editor of thc 'Australian' saying that members of Parliament accept bribes. At lhat time the report of the Privileges Committee was that the editor of Ihe 'Australian' did not agree with the substance of the letter and that he believed it to be without foundation. Nonetheless the members of the Privileges Committee decided that the editor of ihe 'Australian' should have to retract and apologise. The exception was thc honourable member for Eden-Monaro-and I will give him credit-wh o was at least con; sistent in the vicw that be took on that occasion. On page 14 of the report of the Privileges Committee Ihe honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved the following amendment: That all words after 'That' (first occurring) oe omitted with a view to inserting thc following words in place thereof: 'this Committee recommends to the House of Representatives that it would best consult its own dignity by taking no further action in respect of the publication cf thc letter to the editor, signed by P. Wintle of Mundingburra, Queensland.'. So at least the honourable member is consistent when he says that vve should take no action in matters like this. But contrast this with the attitudes of the honourable member for Diamond Valley and the honourable member for Bradfield. In a previous matter when their own honour and reputation were at stake they supported a resolution that the editor of the 'Australian' should retract and apologise. But when the reputation of only parliamentarians on this side of the House is at stake they could not give a damn. (1.38 a.m.)I just want to make a few comments on this matter. I was the honourable member whose speech apparently riled the Oppostiion into calling a quorum. I admit that my speech could have been an inefficient one and that. 1 was having a crack at the Opposition. I . think that the subject matter of the debate tonight is divided into 2 parts-firstl y whether the statement as published was true, and, secondly, what penalties should be imposed, if any. I want to say quite candidly that I agree 100 per cent with the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), who was in the Chair at the time of the incident, as to whether honourable members left the chamber I have a trained eye for that sort of (hing because I had been Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker for about 9 years. Obviously when a quorum was called for I looked around to see whether anybody was leaving. Therefore if it clears the Labor Party, I say that the statement as published was not true. Nobody left the chamber. I know that this is the case because 1 purposefully looked around to see if anybody was leaving. If that clears the Labor Party well and good. But I do not think it is much to the credit of the Labor Party that only 5 of its members were in the chamber. The second point I want to makeI do not know whether it is relevant or not-is in relation lo the intent of the Labor Party. The intent obviously was not to come in when the quorum bell was rung. Quite often when the bells are ringing I come from my room and find that the passage is blocked or that Opposition members are going the wrong way. They have no intention of helping to make up a quorum. I do agree with the Deputy Speaker at spot that I am in now and I know everythe time, who was Mr Lucock, that no-one thing that happened. The honourable left the chamber. I am not here to justify member was being urged by the honourany statement made by the honourable able member for Sturt( Mr Foster) to call member for Mitchell( Mr Irwin). If he rushes about and makes statements to the) Prime Minister or to anybody else I would not justify them at all. Was he here at the time to see for himself? We are not here to judge whether his statement is true or whether that is the basis on which Mr Reid made his statement. 1 am not here to protect the Packer Press. T do not think much of them anyhow. 1 am here to see that justice is done. Every day of the week commentators are making wrong statements over the air about Parliament and about members of Parliament. Are we going to single out this one and impose a penalty on him when the.others go free aud daily commit the same offence against members of Parliament? I agree with the honorable member for Path( Mr Berinson). We should not be debating this matter. It is too trivial. If there is any fault it is the fault of the Parliament, for accepting this motion as one that should go to the Committee of Privileges. If we are to investigate every complaint and every attack against members of Parliament the Committee of Privileges will never cease to sit. The statement published was not true. There is no basis for suggesting that it was true. My statement exonerates the Labor Party, if that is what it wants. If that is any credit to the Opposition. It ought to have more than 5 members in the Parliament. Because we as a parliament were guilty of accepting such a trivial motion to put before the Privileges Committee I think we should accept the Government's motion as a consequence. 1 will not keep the House very long. I want to state just one or two salient facts that I really know. First of all let me recount what happened. As the right honourable member for Fisher( Sir Charles Adermann) said, he was speaking when the quorum was called. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) seems to be embarrassed at having called the quorum. 1 can tell honourable members that he was very reluctant to call it. I was in the very",122,Committee Of Privileges
283,Sir Charles Adermann (Fisher),,124,Committee Of Privileges
284,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) (1.43 A.m.),"the quorum. He did not want to call it. 1 intervened to say something that in fact 1 should not have said: 'Calling a quorum against the right honourable member for Fisher is one of the lowest things in humanity that you can do.' That is what I said, because he was making a speech and had just about a minute at the most to go when the quorum was called. Sir Charies Adermann-The light was on. he had a very short time to go. 1 want to point out how the Opposition and the people who are supporting the amendment are approaching Ihe matter. First of all the honourable member for Kingston is embarrassed by a photograph. His whole speech was about this. He did not look quite as nice as he would like to look. He had been on a long trip, and he was not looking too well. This is how he appreciated it. Tbe honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns) spoke a lot of malice. One cannot judge anything if one has malice. When Abraham Lincoln was up against a certain proposition he said: 'With malice towards none'. Most of the speech made by the honourable member for Lalor referred to certain malice which he thought the journalist had towards the Australian Labor Party. in Hansard and the honourable member can read it there. I believe that, from tht beginning of the evidence which was given by Alan Reid when he came before the Committee, at no stage did he claim that he saw anyone walk out. He did not claim that at all. In fact, he said quite clearly: ' I Leader of the Opposition came back to the was not in the Press gallery. When I beard a commotion outside I went down into the gallery which is opposite this chamber'. He went there when he heard the commotion. From what he heard there he formed the opinion that certain members of this Parliament had walked out. That is what he claimed. He made a mistake. He was wrong. After all, if we were to penalise everybody who made a mistake in this House we would be in a very funny way. Because the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has walked in I am I voted that the matter did not constitute reminded that tonight he said: ""Fhe honoura breach of privilege or contempt of the able member for Mallee is seldom in his place',knowing all the time that my record is a world record. never being in your place? member not to try to be funny. He needs to wake up. He does not understand these matters. The honourable member for Grayndler knows these things and because of that I am always a thorn in his flesh, as he shows at every opportunity. So far as I am concerned I have been consistent while on the Committee. If honourable members read how I voted and what I said thcy can do nothing but agree with this. The simple reason for my attitude is that I thought the case had been blown up tremendously, but not because of tbe importance that the Committee had put upon it. What really happened was that we came to a decision. Honourable members have already been told this. On 26th and 27th October the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) was not at the Committee. He did not turn up. I pay a tribute to the Chairman of the Committee who did everything possible to call meetings when he thought that menibers would be present. He went out of his way to do that. It is a strange thing but this discussion tonight and the occurrence which v/e a>e discussing concerns two quorums. It concerns the occasion on which a quorum was not present when called and it concerns the quorum which was present when the Committee made its first decision. It is noi as if we did not have a quorum in the Committee. We had a quorum and we made a decision. On 3rd November when <hi Committee after being absent on 26th and 27th October he moved a recommittal of the whole affair. Of course that motion was carried. I have been consistent right through in the attitude I have adopted. What was decided by the quorum on 3rd Novemiior is set out very clearly. The report states. That this Commitleefindsthat the article published in the 'Daily Telegraph' of Friday, 27th August 1971, docs not constitute a breach of privilege or contempt of the House of Representatives-be recommitted for consideration.",124,Committee Of Privileges

288,Mr Keogh,What? A world record of,125,Committee Of Privileges
289,Mr Turnbulli Ask The Honourable,"House of Representatives. After the recommittal every vote which I made in that Committee led to the same conclusion. My opinion was the same right through. I am of the opinion that the journalist, Alan Reid, made an incorrect statement. I know -and I am prepared to say that 1 know that no one walked out of the House. I know that for 2 reasons. The first reason is that every person who came before the Committee said in evidence that he did not see anyone walk out of the House. From where I sit in this chamber I was able to see what happened and I personally know that no-one walked out of this House. The journalist, Alan Reid, made a mistake. I believe he was being very frank when he said before the Committee that he did not see anyone walk out of the House. He was not here to see anyone walk out; so how could he say he saw someone walk out of the House? But, of course, he did no say that. When he left the Press gallery, the one opposite where I sit, he heard things which led him to believe that there had been a walk-out. This was incorrect. Of course a lot of us sometimes make incorrect statements. I could name dozens of times when incorrect statements have' been made, but they are not made with malice. Mistakes are made quite honestly by members. I believe this is what happened in this case. Therefore I am asking the members of this House to vote for the motion moved by the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz). I believe that this motion gives justice and is in the best interests of the dignity of this House.
