The Acting Prime Minister gave a sympathetio reply to the deputation, and promised that he would place the facts before the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) on his way over to Melbourne, so that an early decision might he arrived at.

I desire to letter repeat that question to-day. f u l l statement of the position, I ask the passed, leave of the House to do so-(Leav e of the 15th July. In answer to the last paragranted). On the 26th June last I made graph in your letter, the subject discussed a statement regarding the embargo that upon the occasion in question was the possihad been placed on the importation of sheep dip. In the course of that statement. I said that "" for some time the Australasian general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephews was in communication with Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company,"" with a view to the latter firm manufacturing dip in Australia under 'Cooper's' label."" I understand that Messrs. Cooper and Nephews have in a circular letter repeated some statements they made to me in a letter which they addressed to me on the 15th July last. which I have just read, and then went on to sayI would respectfully inform you that Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company were never apI asked the Asproached by me, or any representative of my firm, to manufacture sheep dip under Cooper's label. In June, 1918, I interviewed Mr Leggo with quite a different object, and as at that time neither I nor any member of the Cooper organization had ever seen a packet of the sheep dip produced by Messrs. Leggo and Company, nor liad we ever heard of a single instance of it being used, we were not in a position to form any opinion of the merits of that article or the qualifications of Messrs. Leggo and Company as dip manufacturers. As the statement quoted above is incorrect, and is likely to detrimentally affect the interests of my firm, I am compelled to send you this correction, which would have reached you earlier had I not been indisposed. The Acting Controller replied to that letter in this wayWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, relative to the statement made by the Minister in the House of Representatives on the 20th June, as to the general manager of your company having been in communication with Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company, with a view to the latter firm manufacturing dip in Australia under Cooper's label, I am directed by Mr Massy Greene that he has made further inquiries into the matter, the result of these being to confirm his previous impressions. Regarding your statement, "" in June, 1918, I interviewed Mr Leggo with quite a different object,"" the Minister would be glad if you would kindly indicate the nature of the subject which was discussed on that occasion. We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your of the 7th instant, addressed to our manager at Sydney, and to say that the evidence in our possession, put on record at distinctly confirmed the correctness of the statements contained in his letter to you",23,Healthpowers Of Commonwealth

42,Mr Greene,"In relation to theit. I have also a further record of an interview which took place between Mr Harrowell, the Australian manager of Messrs. W ill i a m Cooper and Nephews and Mr Victor Leggo. It is dated 5th June, and reads:Mr Harrowellcalled, and said he had been giving a lot of thought to this matter and he could see no reason why they should not come to terms on a partnership basis. A. Victor Leggo and Company could do all the manufacturing for the partnership in Australia, and after allowing for its costs on a fair basis, the profits could be equally divided between the two firms. This would suit A. Victor Leggo and Company very well, as they would have the benefit of the Cooper name and selling organization, whilst it would suit Cooper's, who would have an immediate and plentiful supply of dip, and would avoid the expense of having to erect a factory here. Harrowell's opinion is that thc partnership would easily command SO per cent, or more of' the Australian trade, and by working together the costs of distributing, selling, advertising, &c, would be much cut down, and tlie whole arrangements would be more satisfactory to both firms than fighting each other on a cutting competition. The record goes on to sayOn discussing what name we sliould call the dip, Harrowell suggested that we could not do butter than stick to tlicname, "" Coopers,"" as it had been established now over seventy years, and was recognised world-over as the leading dip; in fact, thc use of their name would be one of the chief advantages of the partnership. I pointed out that we had now already put it out as "" Vallo,"" and made broadcast announcements that we were putting our dip out in that name, and I thought it would perhaps be well if we called it "" Cooper-Vallo"" dip, and announced quite frankly that tlie two firms hud joined forces in the Australian trade. He said he did not think this need stand in the way, but he thought his people would want to stick to their own name for it. I now desire to refer to one or two other cables which passed, and which appear on the file, and thereafter I shall not detain the Housef o r more than a moment or two. In reply to the cable which I have just read, and which, I believe, was written by Mr Harrowell himself, Coopers cabled to their general manager in AustraliaRequire general description of Leggo's plant and what is tlic present actual capacity enable us to decide adaptability of process. In answer to that communication, the following cable was despatched:Leggo's have own arsenic mines and refineries; also plant manufacturing all arsenic salts and products, arsenate sulphide, sufficient 100 tons dip weekly. Present blending plant capacity 20 tons, increasing to 40. Ilr. Greene. These are all the cables which it is necessary for me to read. They show very clearly that Messrs. Leggo and Company's statement that they were in active negotiations with the general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephewsi n Australia is absolutely correct. They prove that Messrs. Cooper and Nephews did enter into negotiations with a view to using Messrs. Leggo and Company's organization and plant, and that the latter firm was to manufacture Cooper's dip in Australia. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, because, to my mind, it absolutely clinches the statement which I made, and the accuracy of which Messrs. Cooper and Nephews now deny. On the 4th July, last year, in answer to a letter which was written by Messrs. Cooper and Nephews in regard to another matter, Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company sayWas it not for this reason that you (that is Mr Harrowell, of Coopers), approached us with a vicw to inducing to manufacture dip under "" Cooper's"" label. That deliberate statement is made in the letter sent by Victor Leggo and Company to the representative of Cooper's in Australia, and to that communication they have received no reply. matter. Every user of Cooper's dip will be concerned as to the business morality pf the firm. from the records. Victor Leggo and Company wrote to Cooper's representative and received no reply. That is all I have to say on the subject. Later : William Cooper and Nephews, during the negotiations with Victor Leggo and Company, or subsequently when the negotiations had fallen through, exported dip from England to Australia, contrary to the regulations then in existence? rangements were made, which we thought sufficiently drastic, to prevent shipping space from Great Britain being taken up with sheep dip. A t that time priority was given to certain cargo, and we advised the British Ministry from time to time as to the goods which were to take including arsenite, priority of despatch to Australia. I am not personally acquainted with the actual details of the matter, but I understand",25,Sheep Dip

GreatB r it a in and the United States of America to-day are trading with Germany, and through such channels much of our produce is finding its way into that country. It is because of this trade that the prices of many of our commodities have been seriously increased. It would seem that, while the Government is going to trade with Germany, it w ill not allow Germans pose that any honourable member is as free from German influence as I am. I cannot say that I know of any Germans or descendants of Germans in my electorate. electorates in the same position. B ill was before this House, in 1907-S, I endeavoured to secure the insertion of a clause providing that the country of origin should be stamped on all goods and packages in letters of the same size as those used for other markings. A number of warehousemen then urged that it would he absurd to insist upon that requirement, and pointed out that we were doing a very large trade with Germany. I have always opposed the importation of German goods to Australia; but it would seem that some honourable memhers opposite, while quite prepared to allow goods of German origin to enter this country, are ready to vote against people of German origin coming in .

The power of exemption is sometimes, applied to cases of persons who were wrongly brought in , but whom it would be undesirable to send away at that particular time. What is done is that a bond is taken from the ship-owners or from the person they have lef t here, to secure them against any possible obligation to take him away. As a matter of fact, after the exemption is issued, there is no obligation, under the Act as it stands, on the owners of the vessel to take away the person at their expense.

I do not intend to labour the point which I desire to make iu connection with this amendment. It is a very obvious one. As the clause stands, any convicted criminal, even though he may have been convicted of a shameful offence, will be absolutely immune from deportation if he succeeds in evading the operation of the law for three years. Thus a person who has been three years and one month in the country, even . though he is a convicted criminal of the worse type, will escape deportation. member's amendment, a person who has heen resident in Australia thirty years may he deported. type indicated in this clause has heen resident in Australia for many years, and has shown no sign of mending his ways, it is highly desirable that we should have tbe power to deport him. It is absurd that we should limit the term within which he may he punished for his evil doings to three years. If the Bill is intended to rid the country of undesirables, we have no right to limit its operation in that way. I trust that the Government will accept my amendment as one which is necessary to the proposals embodied in the measure. Tlic honourable member for Perth( Mr But many other men have been kept in Fowler) is anxious to 'do what the British Government. ...attempted to do many years ago, .when it sought to populate this country hy sending persons out to it who were alleged to be guilty of offences, but who had been granted the [454] right of a trial. Those of us who know anything of the early history of Australia know that there were quite a number of people sent out here because they were regarded as undesirables by those who ruled England ,at the time. for quite the contrary. of the sort. Under the amendment of the honourable member for Perth, if the Minister were satisfied that a person not born in Australia had been convicted of a criminal offence punishable by im(Perth) [3.52] I prisonment for one year or longer, he could order his deportation. The Minister alone has to determine the matter Minister has to refer the matter to a Board merely reviews the position. cites the individual to appear before the Board. member for Barrier( Mr Considine) is absolutely misrepresenting the provisions of the Bill. ahle member will have an opportunity of correcting me.

The Act of 1917, but it is subject to a conwhole clause is repugnant to me, because dition similar to that in section 7 of the I see no necessity for it . One of the best Commonwealth Act, namely, that the Dearguments in . support of its elimination partment can prove that at the time a is the statement by the Minister( Mr. person entered the United States of Glynn) that the existing Act gives power America he evaded, or was in the country to deport. persons who are convicted of in contravention of, the Act, so that our certain offences.

After living here for ten or twenty years, a man might lose his reason, or, owing to a series of misfortunes, might become an inmate of a charitable institution. Under this amendment, such a person could be deported on the recommendation of the Board, although probably he had relatives and family ties here. I said last night that in proposing legisthere is no cause, and in the near future lation.of this kind we seemed to be suffering from shell-shock. This is certainly panic legislation, and quite unreasonable. Under paragraph a of this proposed new section, any person who has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer may he called upon to show oauso why he should not be deported. We can all carry hack our minds to industrial troubles in connection with whicb much feeling has heen aroused, and which have led to men making statements in the heat of the moment which have resulted in their imprisonment for twelve months or more. I can recollect cases in my own district where, because of much public excitement caused by certain troubles, the military were sent to the mines. Their -appearance in the district served only to intensify the feeling, and led to -certain men making statements which brought them under the law of conspiracy. Ordinarily, they were excellent citizens, hut in a moment of excitement they made statements which led to their prosecution and to their imprisonment to' a year or more. Such men, if this amendment were agreed to, might at any time he called upon to appear before this . Board to show cause why they should not be ' deported. solemnly recommending the deportation of such men after they had heen living in the Commonwealth for ten or twenty years. They are good citizens-hard working, men-but , because of a dispute w.bh their employers leading: to much feeling, they might, in the circumstances I have named, he recommended for deportation; Are we going to place people in that position? r no common sense? that common sense very often, forsakes those who have to adjudicate upon such matters. Men are often unconsciously biased. Many persons, called upon to adjudicate in cases of the kind to which I have referred honestly helieve that they are doing the right thing in inflicting severe punishment, whereas others, who are free from all prejudice and are ahle to reason out the matter dispassionately, take an entirely different view. This is panic legislation for which it may have a boomerang effect. It goes beyond the bounds of reason. Surely in these enlightened days it is unnecessary to pass legislation the only effect of which will be to create dissension. A measure of this kind will produce not harmony, but turmoil, in the community. If , as the result of industrial trouble, men, because of statements made in a moment of excitement are .sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, and are thenrecommended for deportation, we shall have the country up in arms. In moments of agitation,' common sense often flies to the wind. This is an 'abnormal production. It is because of the happenings of the last two years, which have affected our mental calibre, that it is brought forward.

There has been good reason for inserting this paragraph in the Bill. Persons very badly affected with disease have come into the Commonwealth in violation of the Act, but their diseases were not disBut certain people are coverable at the time.

Other countries have legislation in the same direction with much wider powers.

238,Mr Glynn,"No. A person who isif a disease develops witliin the Commonwealth it would be grossly unfair to take any person affected out of an institution and deport him. T can say at once, speaking from an administrative point of view, that such a case would not occur; but there are circumstances in which one is practically aware that the disease must have existed at the time of the person's entry, though that could not be proved. The clause in the Bill will meet such a case. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Bobert Best) referred to the possible invalidity of the clause if the amendment were accepted. It would not apply to aliens, but it certainly would to a British subject. In the case of Robtelmes v. Brenan, reported in the fourth CommonweaUh Law Reports, the law as accepted by the Chief Justice is the following extract from the opinion of the Privy Council, which had been taken from Vattel's Law of Nations:The power of expulsion is, in truth, but the complement of the power of exclusion. If entry be prohibited it would seem to follow that the Government, which has the power to exclude, shall have the power to expel the alien who enters in opposition to its laws. As a matter of fact, I believe that this power can go on indefinitely so far as the alien is concerned; but if the amendment is carried it may raise a doubt as to the validity of the whole provision. It is our duty to see that the law is clear on the point. withstanding the clear and courteous explanation furnished by the Minister( Mr with the law-for instance, through comGlynn), I think the clause contains too many drastic' provisions, even without the extreme suggestion of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler), whose amendment I could not in any circumstances support. that owing to the convulsions of nations and the disruption that has taken place everywhere there may, perhaps, he a tendency among the worse ele'ment of various countries to seek ""fresh fields and pastures new,"" and possibly it is very essential for all countries, especially young countries encouraging immigration, to be more careful than in normal times in regard to who shall be permitted to enter them. However, I think that due care can he taken without the drastic provisions in the clause. If we have methods of carefully examining the qualifications of people who seek to come to AustraUa under assisted immigration laws, it seems absolutely wrong to have legislation by which people who, through sickness or accident or from any other cause, may be cast into a charitable institution, shall he subject to an inquiry by a Board which may decide whether they are to he "" shunted"" out of the country or not. A pernicious principle such as that ought not to find expression in the laws of a free country, where we depend for justice on the administration of our Statutes and on the discretion of those who administer them, rather than on the actual working of the laws themselves. I appeal to the Minister to eliminate, paragraph c. I cannot support it, .because it is inimical to the spirit of freedom which should actuate the people of Australia. We are anxious to keep our country free and a home to all law-abiding people. We seek by every means in our power to raise the standard of living and make Australia an example to the less-favoured couhtries, but that ideal cannot he approached if we subscribe to principles which are, no doubt, due in some measure to the extraordinary conditions that have developed all over the world, or the panicstricken fear that we may perhaps suffer to a greater extent than have other lessfavoured countries.

In passing a B ill we must assume that it w ill be justly administered. Generally speaking, all our laws are..

As to the provision under which it w ill be possible to deport men who are sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months or longer for an offence committed within three years of their arrival in the Commonwealth, I think that the policy of the Government is to protect Australia against an influx of criminals. When a man comes here the Government know nothing about him. They have had nothing to do with his upbringing, and they say, in effect, under this clause, that we w i ll give such a man three years in which » to declare himself. I i he should prove My experience is to be a criminal and displays criminal instincts within this reasonable period, is there any hardship in declaring that such a man, on being convicted of a. crime for which he is liable, to a term of twelve months' imprisonment or more, shall, be sent back to the country from which he came ? It is only just that the Government should have such a power. Every case w ill be considered on its merits. I cannot conceive it to be possible, as the honorahle member for Batman suggests, that the honourable a man who, after leading an upright and honourable life, suddenly yields to momentary temptation, and commits No t unless the rea crime for which he is liable to imprisonment for twelve months OT longer, would be summoned before this Board, and that on such facts he would be recommended for deportation. I do not think that such a recommendation We shall not be able would be made, or if it were, that it would be acted upon by a responsible Minister. Such cases are quite safeH o n o r a b l e memguarded by this B ill . It is only the class of men to whom I have previously referred, men who come here with criminal instincts and within three years show that they are criminals, that any Minister would think of deporting.

Evidently Ministers are so satisfied with theil efforts to maintain the purity of Australia during the war by the use of the drastic War Precautions regulations that they propose' to continue them. Budyard Kipling must have had them in mind when he spoke of men who were drunk with the sense of power."" The Government find that they have such a suhstantial authority to carry any proposal they put forward that they have entered on a career of legislation which, conceived in a hostile spirit, is evidently aimed at securing purposes that serve their particular ends.. That is not a. basis upon which they should approach legislation meant to he of a permanent character. We are told that this measure will he administered in 'a reasonable spirit, and that no sane Minister of the Crown would dare do certain things under it. When the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was Attorney-General of the Labour Government, he and the then Prime Minister( Mr Fisher) gave exactly the same assurance in regard to the War Precautions Act-namely , that it would he administered with prudence and discretion-as the Minister now at the table ( Mr Glynn) gives in connection with this Bill. Their assurance was given in the same tone, and on exactly the same basis as that on which the Minister to-day guarantees the administration of this Bill. Paragraph a provides that a person who has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer may be deported after certain inquiries have been made. It would ho all right if the provision applied in one direction only, but it is meant to apply all round,, and, therefore, it should he a general rule. _ If ; enemies of society, but to-day they are for instance, a man is declared to be a confirmed criminal, he should be deorted, hut we must wait to see whether e develops into a confirmed criminal. If he exhibits criminal tendencies within Australia inside three years or beyond that period, I consider that he is a type of man who, without much .hesitation or inquiry, should be deported. We do not want men with criminal tendencies in Australia. But the application of the provision is that a man who in a season of national excitement, or under great provocation, or at a time when the moral elements in his constitution! are at the lowest ebb, may commit an /offence punishable by twelve . months' imprisonment shall be deported, although he may be sentenced to one month's -imprisonment only. ""i deported."" That is a very different thing liable, not only to the punishment of imprisonment, but also to deportation. Soon after I came to Australia there were two big strikes in progress-the maritime strike and the shearers' strike-and I can remember hearing the honourable referred to as a danger to the community and as a firebrand.

Everything that took place was laid at his door, and most outrageous demands were made for his arrest and imprisonment. I used to terrific kind of individual. him. He is an Australian. moment.

To-day he is the honoured President of the Legislative Council of Queensland. for which the honourable member for Kennedy was charged? being charged with having incited people to rebellion and disorder, and that kind of thing. Take the case of the Eureka Stockade. The men responsible for that revolt against established government, which the Bill professes to provide for, were at that time considered to be the regarded as heroes. One of their leaders afterwards became Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and a monument has been erected to his memory in Ballarat.

To that extent I arn entirely in sympathy with his attitude.

We on this side have a confirmed opinion, and it is shared by thousands of people outside, that most of the prosecutions and deportations were ordered for political, and not national, purposes.

The honourable member for Wilmot is not the only inember on that side who is ignorant of the subject. I do not charge the Minister( Mr Glynn) with ignorance of that kind. He knows that the advocates of anarchy have been charged with being criminals when they really are The idealists. If I were sure that the Government way they say they will, and in the best interests of Australia, I would he willing to let it go, but there are members of the present Ministry, and others among their supporters, who will use it for political purposes and in a vengeful spirit. The War Precautions Act would not have passed this Housei f the Prime Minister had not given us the three assurances he did in 1915. The House rose in rebellion against giving to any set of individuals the powers embraced in that Act, but we were told that it would not be allowed to be administered hy the military, that British subjects would not he treated in certain ways, and that the Government themselves would see that it was administered in the way originally intended. I am candidly afraid to trust the Government with powers of this character. The only thing I can trust them to do is to look after the well-being of the plutocrats of this' country. They have done that ably and well. They have looked after the interests of'the friends who placed them there, and of the misguided individuals who assisted their friends to place, them there. I would not trust them to administer any measure. Honorahle members opposite are like a crowd that I once sawlistening to a speaker in the Sydney Domain. He had a most idealistic idea of what civilization should be, hut, because in the course of his lecture he touched the rer ligious feelings of certain of his hearers, they rose in their might and pulled him from his platform. He was trying to show that under a proper system of anarchy the Church .would not have the power that it wields to-day by instilling into the people the fear of hell. There were men and women among his hearers who would have deported him; but surely they had no right to inflict punishment upon him because they happened to differ",57,Thechairman Oe Committees Hon

Home and Territories) [9.35] I have no desire to go into specifications such as t'he honourable member for Batman( Mr. Brennan) has just dealt with. All sorts of opinions have been expressed about the Bolsheviks. We can read differing views on them in the New Europe, the Nation, the Athenaum,.&yid other papers-, but this clause does not deal with any particular names. Paragraph d does not deal with men who violate a particular Act of Parliament, or who come here and may be mixed up in strikes. It deals with men who are against: all forms of government.' That is practically what the clause is directed against. It has been suggested' that under this measure men who advocatecertain political views may be kept, out. by a Minister by an abuse of administration. I remind, honourable members that except in two or three very special cases, the dictation test, has never been used to my knowledge for any other purposethan to keep out coloured imr migrants-. The instructions given to the officers time after time call their attention to that. Instruction 56 says"" It is intended that the dictation test, which is to meet the case ""of coloured persons desiring to enter the Commonwealth, shall be an absolute bar to admission."" If it was used for any other purpose, it would not be necessary to specify the other classes that are mentioned in section 3 of the Act. In it a number of classes are specifically rer ferred to, and are, as such, prohibited i m migrants. They could have heen kept out by the dictation test, but it is not used for that purpose, so that no one can possibly assume that any Minister, without",64,Temporary Chairman Make Any Comment For Fear That I Should
392,Mr Glynn (Angas,"Minister f o ra breach, of the spirit of this Act and of the administration up to the present, could use the dictation test to keep out people who are not of the class against whom it was originally designed. Reference has been made to paragraph c, which mentions inmates of insane asylums and public charitable institutions. Under sub-section 5 of section 5 of the existing law persons of that class, if found in the Commonwealth, within three years of the date on which they came in, suffering from disease or disability, may be regarded as prohibited i m migrants, unless they convince the M in . ister that they were free from the disease or disability at the time they entered. tion really runs through the Act at present. man who is suffering from a disease mentioned in the Act or prescribed by the regulations was suffering from it when he 'entered the Commonwealth, if he' is suffering from it within three years of the time of his immigration. administration, if the Minister is satisfied that a person who has become an in mate of an insane asylum or of a public charitable institution is suffering from any of those disabilities .within three years of his entry, the Minister can regard h i m as a prohibited immigrant. That means those particular persons only. Under the Act as it stands at' present, persons suffering from such disabilities may be declared by the.Minister to be prohibited immigrants, unless they show cause to the contrary, and are then liable to prosecution under section 7, and can on summary conviction be deported by the Minister. Y o u can scarcely charge an inmate of an insane asylum or charitable institution in a Court of summary jurisdiction with an offence, but that charge and hearing-is a condition for deportation under the Act as it stands. We are now putting that class of person under clause 7 of the B ill , so that they will not be prosecuted for an offence. Their cases w ill he inquired into hy a Board to be appointed hy the Minister. If anything may be regarded as a mitigation of the Acti n relation to that particular class, this provision may be. cases to come in now? in ; hut if a person is found suffering from mental, or physical disability w it h in three years of entry, unless he shows that he was not so suffering at the time he came in , he is liable to deportation under the existing Act, but only after prosecution in a Court of justice.

We have had reference to Bolsheviks. Let me quote an authority which every one will admit. The following cablegram appears in the Herald of the 28th August: Mr Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labour, who has returned from Amsterdam, declares that thc Germans are still boastful and unrepentant. Referring to the overwhelming defeat at the International Labour Congress of ,the motion calling for organized Labour's support of the Soviet revolutions, he said:-The defeat of this proposition means the definite and final repudiation of Bolshevism by organized Labour of Europe and America -Act would be extended and used for the I prefer that authority to the one quoted by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). .1 probest against the onslaught of the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith) when he pointed to us and said, These men who vote to allow persons who live on prostitution to come into Australia."" Honourable members of the Opposition are as honourable and clean living as any honourable member on the Ministerial side, and it is .a disgrace to this Parliament that an honorahle member should take advantage of his position to slander a body of men with whom he has been closely allied. I did not think any honourable member would have such a filthy mind as to suggest what the honourable member has suggested. The honourable member for Denison also said that Mr Willis, Mr Rae,. and other men had been, expelled from the Labour -put . The Committee divided. party. uot been deprived of their votes, but they have been expelled from the party, just as the honourable member himself [455] was expelled hy the very men to whom he now refers. In fact, they are merely the honorgetting back a little of their own medicine. The pity of it is that tiiey were not expelled earlier. Under this clause, Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, who at one time was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for conspiracy, could have why does the been deported. He took a risk to get a Labour paper launched, but it failed, and he was sentenced to three years' i m prisonment for conspiracy. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence) has taken some great risks in this counmy tongue. Although detectives followed me, they could not run me in . member been tried for conspiracy and convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment, he could have been deported if he -had been a new-comer to Australia. I do not believe that any Minister worthy of his salt would use the powers given under this B ill to deport people wholesale; but, as there are some people who would do so, we. are not justified in giving them the opportunity. We never anticipated that the War Precautions purposes to which it was put. In the ' same way, we are taking great risks in giving Ministers the power contained in this B ill . The honorahle member for Denison claims that if we vote against this clause we advocate the admission of the classes of individuals referred to in the various paragraphs; but Australia has been governed under the Eederal Constitution for the last eighteen years without any of these powers, and has not "" gone to the dogs."" Why, therefore, should we be stricken with the desire to place panic legislation on the statute-book?

In other words, 400,000,000 people in China, 350,000,000 in India, and 70,000,000 people in Japan, resent that provision. The intelligent minds of those countries have not been deceived as to the purpose of the dictation test. I have heard a Minister declare in this chamber that by means of that test any person could be kept out of Australia.

421,Dr. Maloney,"Whenproof, alike furnished by the inter-marriages of human races and by the inter-breeding of animals, that, when the varieties mingled diverge beyond a certain slight degree, the result is invariably a bad one in the long run. I have myself .been in the habit of looking at the evidence bearing on tliis matter for many years past, and my conviction is based upon numerous facts derived from numerous sources. This conviction I have, within the last half-hour, verified, for I happen to be staying in the country with a gentleman who is well known as an authority on horses, cattle, and sheep, and knows much respecting their inter-breeding, and he has just, on inquiry, fully confirmed my belief that when, say, of different varieties of Bheep, there is an inter-breeding of those which are widely unlike, the result, especially in the second generation, is a bad one-ther e arises an incalculable mixture of traits, and what may be called a chaotic constitution. And the same thing happens amongst human beings-the Eurasians in India and the half-breeds in America show this. The physiological basis nf this experience appears to be that any one variety of creature in course of many generations acquires a certain constitutional adaptation to its particular form of life, and every to amend the principal Acb by removing other variety similarly acquires its own special adaptation. ' The consequence is that, if you mix the constitutions of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to.the mode of life of neithera constitution which will not work properly, because it is not fitted for any set of conditions whatever; by all means, therefore, peremptorily interdict marriages of Japanese with foreigners. I have, for the reasons indicated, entirely approved of tbe regulations which have been established in America fbr restraining the Chinese immigration, and, had I the power, would restrict them to the smallest possible amount, my reasons for this decision being, that one of two things must happen. If the Chinese are allowed to settle extensively in 1 America, they .must either, if they remain unmixed, form a subject race, in the position, if not of slaves, yet of a class approaching to slaves; or, if they mix, they must form a bad hybrid. In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of thc European or American races with the Japanese.. You see, therefore, that my advice is strongly conservative in all directions, and I end by saying aB I began-kee p other races at arm's' length aB much as possible. I give this advice in confidence. I wish that it should not transpire publicly, at any rate during my life, for I do not desire to rouse amendments. the animosity of my fellow countrymen. P.S -Of course, when I say I wish this advice to be in. confidence, I do not interdict in Committee forthwith. the communication of it to Count Ito, but rather wisli that he should have the opportunity of taking it. into consideration. [456] It is stated in this work thatShortly after Spencer's death, the letter of 26th August was sent from Tokio for publication in the Times (18th January, 1904), which' wrote of it as giving "" advice as narrow, as much imbued with antipathy to real progress, as ever came from a self-sufficient short sighted Mandarin, bred in contempt and hatred of barbarians."" This means that Japan stood for a .policy such as we favour. Just as we support the policy of a White Australia, so she sounded the note of "" Japan for the Japanese,"" and appealed to a man of the strongest intellect m our race for advice.

We believe in bhe policy of a White Australia, and we should bell Japan thab we are seeking to follow the very example which Japan set us when she sought tbo advice of Herbert Spencer. In such circumstances Japan could nob bake offence ab our action, since "" imitation is bhe sinceresb flabtery.""
