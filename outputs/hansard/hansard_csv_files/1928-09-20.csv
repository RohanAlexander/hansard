Estimates will be considered as soon as the budget debate is concluded. It will be for honourable members to decide how long the detailed consideration of departstatements. The object of a question is mental estimates shall take. of the Prime Minister been directed to and Territories and the latter says that the following paragraph published in the Sydney Sun of the 18th September:Judge's Comment. (Hon. Sir Littleton Tamworth, Tuesday. A t the Tamworth Quarter Sessious Francis Arthur Goodreid and Michael McGill pleaded guilty to a charge of breaking and entering a shop at Drake, and stealing groceries. John McGill, brother of one of the accused, pleaded guilty to stealing. Counsel for the defence explained that the men were down and out, and wanted food. The two brothers were Scotch migrants, and the other an Englishman with a good war record. Judge Mocatta said that they had walked from Stanthorpe, in Queensland. It was a pity that young men who were prepared to work could not get it , and he questioned the policy of migrants coming to Australia when there was no work for them. The accused were remanded. Will the right honourable gentleman divert the whole or part of the £300,000 provided on the Estimates for assisted passages to migrants to the relief of distress among migrants and others already in Australia ? paragraph quoted by the honourable member, but I remind him that British migrants reach Australia in compliance with either requisitions by the State Governments or nominations approved by them. It would be necessary for me to make full inquiries into an individual case before I could express any opinion on it.

Any effect upon Victorian industries will be occasioned by the action of the New South Wales Government and those interested in the coal-mining industry in that State, and it will be for the Government of Victoria and other State Governments to determine whether action should be taken to bring about a similar reduction within the borders of the other States. As to the effect upon the Yallourn scheme and the supply of electrical power, I would point out that it is anticipated that if the proposed scheme is adopted, there may be a permanent reduction in the price of coal, which will be of great advantage to those in control of transport services and also to manufacturers throughout Australia. It will be for the Yallourn authorities to take that very seriously into account, and place themselves upon a competitive basis, not merely for the first year in which assistance will be granted, but for later years, when the reduction may take effect without any assistance.

Sir NEVILLEHOWSE September, the honourable member for Swan( MrG r e g o r y ) asked me the f o l l o w in g questions:1. What is the length of the road unnamed on the plan on view at Parliament House, branching off Acton-road and traversing the roar of the Chief Commissioner's residence, and commonly known as ""Contour-road""? 2. What was the cost of this road, including guttering, drainage, &c. ? 3. How many and whose residences does this road serve? 4. Was this road part of the original"" Griffin plan ? 5. If not, what reasons were assigned for the departure from the plan, and was the Minister satisfied that the expenditure was justified before approving of the alteration? 6. Has any special rate been imposed upon those benefiting by this expenditure? I am now in a position to advise h i m as follows:1. It is not known exactly what is meant by "" Contour-road "" but only one road job has been undertaken in this vicinity and this comprised 2,311 lineal feet of 100-ft. roadway, and 2,478 lineal feet of GO-ft. roadway. 2. The total construction cost of excavation, filling formation, batters, paths, plantation areas, culverts, kcrbing and guttering, together with the cost of new entrances was £7,300 excluding overhead charges and interest during construction. 3. These roads serve, or w ill serve seven residences, the hospital, the Public Health Laboratory, and five allotments whicli are shortly to be built upon; the principal objects of the roads are, however, to improve the main road in this district and provide proper access to the hospital. 4. The Griffin plan did not provide a road in the close vicinity. The Griffin plan has been modified at this point in the manner prescribed in the Seat of Government Act, to enable the considerable investment in buildings in this vicinity to be utilized. 5. The nearest roads aligned in accordance with the Griffin plan were economically impossible, the old road was dangerous and passed the back entrances of a number of houses in the vicinity and missed the delightf u l view to be obtained from the new road, which is a very popular one. The roads which have been constructed are part of the permanent new subdivision of Acton, the 100-ft. portion of the road now being the main road through Acton; the superseded dangerous portion will later be converted into a lane. The Minister was satisfied with the whole proposal before he approved of the alteration to the plan. The Government has t(. No, as no special benefit attaches to any individuals. On the 18 th September reference was made by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) to the apparent high cost of bricks in Canberra, which he On the 13th stated is £6 5s. per 1,000 at the kiln as compared with £3 Is. and £3 3s. in Melbourne, and he asked if some reduction could not be made. In the first place it is necessary to make a correction, as the price to the general public for ordinary common bricks in Canberra at the kiln is £5 5s. per 1,000 and not £6 5s., and a special reduction to £4 16s. per 1,000 has already been made for cottage construction for public servants. The Federal Capital Commission has given the closest attention to the question of brick manufacture with the object of bringing down the costs as far as possible. There are certain circumstances, however, which govern the production and cost of bricks, and it is necessary that these should be carefully regarded when considering comparative prices. The special factors which operate at Canberra to affect the cost of brick production, however, are as follow:(a) The capital liability for the brickworks which the commission was required to take over. (b) The difference in the process of manufacture in Canberra necessitated by the nature of the raw material, involving the use of the "" semi-plastic "" method instead of the more generally adopted and cheaper "" dry-press "" method. (c) The necessity for careful selection of the.material owing to the nature of the shale deposits. (d) The difference in rates and labour conditions (e) The heavy cost of fuel. (/) The uneven nature of the demand which involves loss of effectiveness and comparative increases on overhead expenditure.",19,Canberra Bricks
60,Mr Bruce,"The commission has not detailed knowledge of the conditions under which bricks are produced at the kilns in Melbourne mentioned by the honourable member, but it has made a careful comparison of the cost of manufacture at Canberra-unde r the "" semi-plastic "" system-wit h the cost Canberra"" Semi plastic Operation.

This comparison of course is based on conditions which have not been realizable in Canberra owing to the intermittent nature of the demand, which has not rendered it possible for the kilns to operate continuously at maximum capacity. The actual cost has therefore fluctuated from time to time, and £5 5s. represents a fair average cost. It has heen explained that a concession has already been made on the average cost by charging at the rate of £4 16s. per 1,000 for the bricks used in connection with homes built for public servants. The site for the brickworks was chosen many years ago after careful expert investigation as being the best available. Nowhere in Canberra could the manufacture of bricks by the ""dry press"" nrocess be"" relied upon.

The commission is satisfied that the plant installed is suitable and the management efficient. It has obtained the best expert criticism it could on all aspects of the matter with the object of adopting any expedient which might have the effect of reducing the price of bricks. In view of the special factors that have been explained, it appears that the only likely possibility of effecting a small reduction of the cost of bricks would be a steady maximum production, but this is, of course, dependent upon a continuous demand which cannot be guaranteed at the present time. It will thus be seen that a -superficial comparison of the cost of manufacture of bricks in different places cannot be accepted and that the controlling factors-suc h as the conditions of raw material, labour, and other costsmust in each case be ascertained and examined before a reliable opinion can be formed. ister for Defence, upon notice1.

Most of the information desired by the honourable member was given in my reply, but, in regard lo the question whether the majority of tellers in the various banks would welcome the making of notes of different sizes, I stated that inquiries would be made. I have since taken this matter up with the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank and am advised that the board has given the question of the size of notes the most careful consideration and, in this connection, has not only had the advantage of the advice of the general manager of the note printing works, who was lately brought from England, but has had that of its own officers who are used to handling notes at the tellers' counters. The board has thus been able to determine the best means of dealing with the question of the size of notes and considers that, to invite further opinions, would only lead to complications without any practical advantage. stances I do not think it necessary to approach all the other banks with a view to ascertaining the opinions of tellers.

What primary products were assisted in that which it already possesses? Cannot each of the above-mentioned years, and what this Government, under the existing law, amount was advanced in respect of each product in each year? I am now in a position to supply the honourable member with the following in formation :1. The Commonwealth Bank now advises that the undermentioned primary products have been advanced against in the Rural Credits Department of the bank during the period 30th June, 1926, to 30th June, 1928:-Arrow root, broom millet, butter, canned fruits and pulp, cotton, dried fruits, eggs and egg pulp, fortifying spirit, osmiridium, peanuts, superphosphates, wheat, wines, wool. 2. The bank regrets it is not in a position to state the amount of advances in respect of each product, but the following figures indicate the total advances in the Rural Credits Department during the periods stated:-Yea r ended 30th June, 1927, £7,427,649; year ended 30tli June, 1928, £5,360,162. The decrease is attributable to the smaller wheat harvest.

During Arbitration Act, under which it has What greater power does it require than do all that it is proposed to do under this new bill? What is the need for such a measure at this particular juncture? We were told that the amended Arbitration Act would make it possible to ensure peace, order and good government in this country, and that under the Crimes Act the Government would be in a position to maintain peace, order and good government. Actually, under the Crimes Act it has all the power that it needs in the event of any situation arising that threatens to interfere with trade and commerce between Australia and other countries. Has it not the power to declare certain organizations unlawful associations, and similarly to take the necessary action against any person who may in the opinion of the Government be were predoing an unlawful act ? There is no limit to the power which this Government possesses if it cares to exercise it. I say, therefore, that there is no necessity for the introduction of this bill, to occupy public attention by its discussion. We are not unaware of what is behind this move. The Government desires to display this measure as a political poster. That is what it is after. We are led to believe that the legislation proposed 'is necessary in order to enable the Government to control trade and commerce.

72,Motion (By Mr Bruce) Proposed,,25,Transport Workers Bill
73,Mr Anstey (Bourke) [11.3.5],"Iwith Viich firms as Paterson, Laing and 1 Bruce, which for 40 years has offered the most determined opposition to the trade union movement. During that time it has kept its gang of hired thugs to beat down any one who stood for trade unionism. This Government now proposes to do something to stimulate employment in relation to trade and ""commerce. Does it propose to deal with firms like that I have just mentioned, which only a few weeks ago was haled before the courts for having acted in defiance of the industrial laws of this country. Only the other day, I noticed a report in the public press that this firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, which presumably stands for peace, order and good government, and for the maintenance of our industrial laws aud for fair dealing as between master and man, had a number of thieves amongst, its employees. Evidence given in the course of the trial disclosed that a number of these men were in receipt of only £3 and £4 a week, and I presume that the hill which this Government proposes to introduce will enable it still more effectively to suppress the facts in prosecutions of that nature. What justification can the Prime Minister offer for the introduction of the bill at this time? Already the Government possesses all the powers that it is seeking. There is nothing that it could not do, if it had the will, to preserve peace, order, and good government and to promote employment in this country. At the last election the Government kept its gang of thugs, its urgers, creating trouble along the waterfront. These men were to be seen at work in Western Australia. They are well supplied with money. A few months later they were to be found in South Australian ports, and later m Queensland ports. After they had done their dirty work, they were to be found in good jobs, in the "" get-together "" league, and businesses. We have been told that the funds with which they have been paid came from some communistic source; that the money came from Moscow. It comes from the Employers' Federation, which reaps some advantage from the employment of these political thugs, whose purpose seems to be to defeat the efforts of those who are doing their utmost to ensure peace upon the waterfront. These hired urgers are making the path of the real leaders of the working class more and more difficult. After their dirty work is done, after the elections are over, they are given decent jobs and so retire into the background. This Government has power to regulate trade and commerce on the waterfront. It has power to deal with employment and with the tying up of vessels upon this coast. They have seen men meeting together in conference in different parts of the Commonwealth, and coming to certain decisions in secret conclave. There is a law against such gatherings, and it could have been given effect. But this Government did not put that law into operation. It did not want to suppress the trouble in the bud, or to seize the leaders at that moment. It wanted the trouble to grow, and the dislocation of work upon the waterfront to take place. The Government waited until these men were able to take control, and were again creating disturbances on the waterfront. There is a Crimes Act upon the statute-book, and what cannot be done under that legislation? The Government may declare any organization to be a seditious one. It can declare any utterance or word to be seditious. It is a seditious act for any one to bring about disaffection and dissatisfaction between one body of men and another. There is not a single thing that does not come under the purview of the Crimes Aet. The Government can declare every workman upon the waterfront to be a member of an unlawful organization. It can prosecute and punish with imprisonment for from one to three years any man in this country who offers one penny to the men on the waterfront who are involved in this trouble. It can punish with imprisonment for from one to three years any man who offers any woman on the waterfront a crust of bread. But the Gosupplied with hotels and vernment does not wish to use its powers. In 1917 when Mr Hughes was Prime Minister, the first Unlawful Associations Act was passed. Under it the Industrial Workers of the World was declared an unlawful association. It disappeared after the war, but was re-enacted in the form of the Crimes Act. Under the Unlawful Associations Act any organization could be declared illegal or unlawful. There was a penalty for belonging to such an organization. Although this Government could, under the Crimes Act, declare any organization to be a pernicious and unlawful institution, no action has been taken by it. Certain institutions are allowed to flourish in the land and to publish their propaganda in the leading newspapers. Who supplies the funds to keep them going ? It is said that There is nothing in the bill to be the funds come from Moscow. Government supporters say that the men on the waterfront, who are at present dislocating trade, are communists. There is published in Sydney a newspaper known as the Communist Journal. Why not declare that an unlawful publication ? Who supplies it with money? It is not Moscow, but the gentlemen behind the Nationalist party. They keep the communists fat, and pander to them. Groom) I remind the honourable member that we are discussing a motion for leave to introduce a bill in relation to employment, and I ask him to confine his remarks to that subject. ployment upon the waterfront. Honourable members behind the Government may laugh, but let me remind them that in Western Australia two years ago there was a representative of the I.W.W. fomenting a dispute on the waterfront. When that trouble was over, he went to Queensland on the same errand. He is now in Sydney. Who pays that man? Just prior to the last elections there were this Government. other men in Queensland fomenting trouble. .They are now in good jobs, and who gave them those good jobs? It was not Moscow. Those men are not friends of the Labour party. This Government had power to take action against them, but nothing was done. They were fed, fostered and pampered by this Government. They were its urgers, procurers, and agents provocateurs. The bill which the Prime Minister is now seeking to introduce to deal with the trouble on the waterfront is a sham, a delusion, and a it. snare. seems to be very frightened of it . frightened of it? I am not. It would be infinitely better for all political 'parties, and particularly the Labour party in this House, if the Government would put the laws of this country into operation. If it applied those laws, which it says are necessary to establish peace and good order on the waterfront, what a Godsend it would be to the members of this House. But it dares not do that. The Nationalist party is a gutless party. frightened of. It is but a sham, a fraud, and a delusion. It is not being introduced to meet a public necessity, because any extraordinary position that arises can be adequately dealt with under existing legislation. test against leave being granted to introduce a bill of this character. It is not in the public interests. If it is passed, it will be nothing more than a duplication and repetition of legislation that is already upon the statute-book. It may look like iron, but it is only a painted lath. This Government has no guts. It is seeking to place its responsibility upon the States. If this bill is passed, will it be put into operation? No. The Government will do no more than it did at the last election, and that was to take action against two individuals who afterwards obtained damages for unlawful detention. As a protest against the bill I ask that leave to introduce it be not granted. It is nothing more than a sham and a delusion, and illustrates clearly the hypocrisy of ister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.48] I remind the honourable member who has just spoken that the motion before the House is for leave to introduce a bill.

This press contributor stated that various towns in North Queensland were in a decadent condition. him, or any honourable member of this Parliament, to produce evidence that the towns in the' sugar districts of North Queensland do not compare more than favourably in civic pride and administration, and general prosperity, with towns of similar population anywhere else in Australia. My reply to the contributor's statement that a grave state of affairs exists in North Queensland is that the sugar industry,.from Port Douglas to Mackay, represents an investment of about directly and indirectly a population equal to that of Tasmania. year the sugar harvest that went through .Mackay alone was valued at about £2,000,000, and the harvest in the area from Port Douglas to Mackay returned products valued at about £12,000,000. In these circumstances, it-is not necessary for me to labour this subject. The plain fact is that the sugar industry has enabled us to settle and develop these northern tropical areas which are contiguous to the teeming millions of the East. Who can deny this fact? tic progress that has occurred there, however, has been, and still is, dependent upon the continuance of the sugar embargo. "" J. A. Burke"" criticizes the sugar embargo, and objects most strongly to the wage-earners in the sugar areas receiving the ruling remuneration for their services. I contend that these workers should be well paid for their services. There are, however, two factors which challenge the continued prosperity of our sugar districts. The first is that we have a limited market for these products and are compelled confine our profitable operations almost exclusively to Australia. When we reach a stage of over-production, we are forced to export our surplus sugar to the English market and accept world's parity. There are at least 250,000 people dependent directly and indirectly upon our sugar industry, and in it is invested a capital amount of £30,000,000. Those people and that capital rely absolutely upon the embargo that has been granted by the Bruce-Page Government, which has made possible the carrying on of our wonderful industry, so enabling us to people the distant I challenge parts of north-east Australia. But much yet remains to be done. It is not advisable that in such an important national industry, we should be compelled to restrict production, and to dispose of our over-production overseas at world's parity and at a loss to the producers. There is a problem to be faced by the Government, and I hope that it will receive urgent consideration, and that an endeavour will be made further to expand the sugar industry on safe and stable lines. No avenue £30,000,000, ' and maintains should be left unexploited in the endeavour to bring that desirable state Last of affairs into existence. The sugar industry is truly developmental in nature, and has been aptly described as a national industry, although it is mainly concentrated in Queensland. Quite recently Sir Benjamin Morgan, an eminent British economist who has for many years occupied distinguished positions in Great Britain and who, I understand, has the ear of the British Government, visited our sugar areas and was tremendously impressed with what he saw. He The romanrecognized that there is unlimited room for expansion in the industry, and stated that he was prepared to recommend to the British Government that it should accept another 300,000 to 400,000 tons of sugar annually, and assist the industry by granting a further £3 to the preferential treatment' now given to empire sugar.

98,Dr. Nott (Herbert) [12.5],"Lastappeared as if we had found a solution of our problem of over-production. Buti f the proposal is closely analysed it will be seen that it confers little advantage upon the industry, and although it has brought about an increased interest in the suoject it oners no economic key to the solution. over-production a reduction of production? effect a cure, but the honourable member must admit that such a drastic course is most undesirable when it adversely affects an important national industry. We possess all the conditions suitable for a great production of sugar under White Australian conditions, and those in the industry are animated by a desire to increase production. But that can be carried only to that length which enables producers to obtain a satisfactory return for their efforts under our peculiar standards of production. The suggestion of Sir Benjamin Morgan really does not afford a solution of the problem. On the contrary, its adoption might artificially stimulate the industry to such an extent that a great deal more land would be placed under cultivation, the capacity of the mills increased, and probably it might even bring about the erection of additional mills. Then, if by some mischance a party came into power in Great Britain which was not prepared to continue the reciprocal arrangements instituted by the Baldwin Government, our sugar industry would receive a setback from which it would never recover. I urge the Government to leave no stone unturned in an endeavour to collaborate with the British Government to design a scheme which will effectively allow us to bring about a proper expansion of the industry on safe economic lines. There may be a momentary retrogression in the sugar industry, but it is due chiefly to the regrettable industrial unrest that has prevailed in the sugar areas for a number of years, and which has brought about a continual interruption of the wheels of industry. RecentlyI indicated that Cooktown, a port in the far north of Queensland which is entirely dependent upon an intermittent shipping service to obtain the necessities of life, is now completely isolated through lack of shipping communication. with the southern ports, and its inhabitants are being subjected to very severe hardships. Later reports indicate that a chaotic condition of affairs exists along . the whole of our eastern waterfront. It is no exaggeration to say that millions of pounds worth of commodities are held up by this maritime disturbance, and as most of those commodities are paid for on delivery it means that a vast amount of money is tied up, and that the wheels of industry are spragged. The Government has made certain provisions to cope with the situation and if sane and reasonable counsels do not prevail with those who are causing the upheaval, I hope that the Government will take firm action in dealing with the situation. The subject of industrial strife has received considerable attention from this House recently, but although much has been said, little has been done. The time is ripe for the Government to take the matter in hand and indicate to the people of Australia that it is not prepared to stand idly by while our industry is dislocated through the action of a few recalcitrants who are not prepared to accept the advice of their executives and are entirely regardless of the effect of their action on producers, consumers and the public at large. We have had to submit to the dislocation of industry at the most critical period of the year. This year the sugar areas have suffered a dry spell and the growth of cane in many instances has not progressed in a satisfactory manner. But the recoverable sugar content is exceedingly high and its richness counteracts the deficiency in the weight of the cane. This is a striking tribute to the efficiency of the growers. Just when that cane should be harvested and milled the whole industry is held up by industrial disturbance. Already one mill has ceased operations and others must soon follow suit. There will be a repercussion of such inactivity upon the railways, cane cutters, farmers and the community generally, to the detriment of Australia. I regret exceedingly that that state of affairs has come to pass and I trust that the Government, if its appeal to reason is in vain, will take the necessary action to ensure that those engaged in the sugar industry are privileged to conduct their own affairs to the best advantage.",29,Budget 1928 29

100,Dr. Nott,"That would certainlyI wish, to congratulate the Postmaster General, and the Minister for Works and Railways, upon the decision to instal a new automatic telephone exchange at Cairns, and to renovate the post office. Cairns is one of the most progressive sugar cities in Australia, and for too long it has now, as I know that he is keenly inhad to get along with a post office which has been hopelessly inadequate to deal with the business offering. Yesterday the House passed an enabling measure authorizing the department to proceed at once with these works. Works and Railways said that the accommodation to be provided would suffice for only a limited time, and that he anticipated an increase in revenue in the immediate future. That statement shows a recognition of the progress which is taking place throughout my electorate, a fact that is appreciated by every member of this House. sion of business in the various post offices throughout that area is an effective answer to the calamity howlers and dismal prophets who insist that the north is going back. General should realize that the type of building which is suitable for a temperate climate is not satisfactory in the north, and I trust that he will have an investigation made into the conditions under which postal officials have to work in many of the smaller offices in northern Queensland. built of sheets of galvanized iron and are an actual menace to the health of those who have to work in them. I propose to deal cursorily with the subject of tobacco culture in Australia. The Government recently appointed as Director of Tobacco Culture a gentleman who has had wide and successful experience in this class of work in America, and who is also familiar with conditions prevailing in other tobacco-growing countries. No country in the world offers greater possibilities than does Queensland for the successful production of tobacco leaf. Much experimentation will be required in order to determine the class of leaf which is the most suitable. I understand that the Director of Tobacco Culture has expressed himself as being highly pleased with the leaf submitted to him by growers in the more remote north. unlimited area in the tablelands of Dr. Nott. Queensland, more particularly in the electorate of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis), which is entirely suitable for tobacco-growing. I am sorry that the honourable member for Kennedy is not here terested in the development of the tobacco industry. However, it is not only in the far northern areas that tobacco can be successfully grown. For years past a very high-grade leaf has been produced in other The Minister for parts of Queensland. I hope that the Government will deal generously with this industry, and will make available sufficient money for carrying out the necessary experiments. night two honourable members on the opposite side made speeches in which they The rapid expandealt with the existing waterside dispute, and it was evident that they would like to see the waterside workers ruthlessly flogged into submission by the Government. submit to the Government dictates, but to obey an award of the Arbitration Court. the industry are quite convinced that the judge did not understand the position, and for that reason imposed conditions Some of these offices are which are not compatible with common sense, or equity. The honourable member who has just interjected claimed to know something of the workers' conditions, because he had both worked with them, and had employed them. I worked in a factory for seventeen years, and I know more about the conditions obtaining iu the industry with which I was concerned,than could be known by any outsider. Therefore, I can readily believe that the waterside workers are more familiar with their industry and its conditions than any one else could be, and I am inclined to listen to them with respect when they say that the new award is an impossible one. Instead of using the big stick method advocated by some honourable members, the Government should, I think, make some effort to understand the workers' point of view.

103,Mr Yates,"The men concerned inits achievements more particularly during the last ten years since the war, and taking things by and large there is very little room for complaint about the workers of this country. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) has referred to tobacco culture. For a long time. I have thought that the cultivation of tobacco in Australia has been neglected, and I support the honourable member's contention that if we are to absorb the migrants we desire to come to Australia, it will be the duty of the Government to give a stimulus to tobacco culture. As a factory worker I started at a wage of 8s. a week, and at the end, when I was a married man, -I was receiving the magnificent sum of 39s. a week. I was a steady smoker in those days; I smoked OD an average a quarter of a pound of tobacco a week. Multiply that quantity by 52 and consider the amount of excise duty I paid yearly. Compared with the ability of the individual to pay, it will be found that the excise duty OD tobacco is one of the heaviest of Australian taxes. The honourable member for Herbert spoke of the need for alterations to the post office at Cairns. His remarks struck a sympathetic chord in my heart because I have been most assiduous in my attempts to get a new post office in the eastern portion of Adelaide. The business done in that part of the city amply justifies the erection of a new post office there. As I have previously said the present building has been described as a hen roost. It is not paying much of a compliment to the hen roost. When the present Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) was a private member -and was criticizing the budget presented by the then Treasurer, he said1 have previously referred to the post office at Mildura, which is n disgrace to civilization and can only be compared with the Black Hole of Calcutta. office at Mildura now. about a similar result in regard to the post office in the eastern end of AdelaideI should be satisfied. her had better take me to see it. has already seen' the building and knows that what I am saying is quite correct. A few days ago I said that if the Commonwealth could afford to spend £133,000 ou the reconditioning of the Goulburn to Canberra-road, to which I did not object, it could"" easily have made provision on the Estimates for the erection of a new post office in the eastern part of Adelaide. The Postmaster-General has informed me that the new post office in George-street, Sydney, has cost £32,000. The amount is not a staggering one and I do not think it is too much for me to ask the Postmaster-General to provide a building of the same suitable type iu Rundlestreet, Adelaide. If the Postmaster General, having heard the Treasurer's comparison of the Mildura post office with the Black Hole of Calcutta, could proceed with the erection of a new post office in Mildura, I think he will admit that I have a better claim for the erection of a new post office in the eastern portion of Adelaide. Much more revenue is obtained from the eastern portion of Adelaide than from Mildura. The citizens are entitled to a post office commensurate with the importance of the capital. I desire to be fair in discussing the budget. I intend to read a few extracts from speeches delivered by the present Treasurer in 1921, when he attacked the then Treasurer, Sir Joseph Cook. His accusation was that Sir Joseph Cook did not budget in the best interests of Australia, and the Treasurer of the day characterized the present Treasurer's remarks as insulting and blackguardly. In October, 1921, Dr. Earle Page, as a private member, went so far as to accuse the then Treasurer of "" dummying "" his estimates, and making misleading statements in connection with them. He furnished figures that were claimed by him to prove that his argument was sound. On the 25th November, 1921, le saidW i th regard to practically all tlie departments, it is my intention to attempt to bring about a reduction of the Estimates by, in effect, rationing the departments, and insisting upon their being conducted within the l i m it thus set.

He made a further reference to the Postal DepartmentI desire to enter an emphatic objection to statements of the Treasurer when he was taking from the Postal Department the profits it ' makes and crediting them to general revenue, while compelling the department to construct the greater part of its new works out of loan funds. By this practice the department, year by year, is carrying an increased burden. my opinion the profits that sometimes accrue in this department should be reserved to the department, so that it can extend its facilities as much as possible. House granted £9,060,000 to the Postmaster General, £1,391,000 of which was not used. The present Treasurer stated on that occasion that postal works should be constructed out of revenue-that was the policy adopted during the Labour regime -bu t apparently from what has since transpired he did not know what he was talking about. Surely he has had an opportunity to give effect to the prin-: ciples which he so strongly advocated when he made a very bitter attack upon the Treasurer. He has said that he would ration the departments, and that the whole system of Federal finance should be changed, in some cases by adopti n g the principles which the Labour party applied. Notwithstanding his utterances on that occasion, we now find him, after a period of unprecedented prosperity, handling national finance in such a way that he has to announce a deficit of £2,600,000, which is to be placed to a suspense account. When similar action was ministration in South Australia, in connection with a railway deficit of £590,000, the Liberals strongly criticized the action of the Government. The Railway Commissioner, who was an American railway expert, said that the amount should be placed to a suspense account and liquidated from future revenue; but the Opposition so strongly opposed it that the Government went to the country and the Liberals misrepresented the whole position in such a way that the Labour party was defeated. The Liberal party said that it would square the ledger; but instead of doing so it came out, after its first year in oflice, with a deficit of £250,000. The The condiFederal Treasurer, like Micawher, is always waiting for something to turn up. He is relying upon the future productivity of the Commonwealth to return him 8uflicient to liquidate the deficit which has been placed to a suspense account. It is amazing to compare the a private member with his action as a Minister of the Crown. He also made the following interesting utterance concerning Australia's indebtedness:The result of this method of dealing with In our war indebtedness and tlie sinking fund is that Australia's State and Federal debts together total £798,750,000. This is equal to £160 per head of the population, and £040 Last year this per bread-winner. Our present debt is approximately £1,100,000,000, and if my calculations are correct the debt per head of the population is now nearly £180 instead of £160 as it was then. I do not know what the amount is per bread-winner, as I am not aware of the basis upon which the Treasurer obtained his figures. The national debt has increased, as also have other financial obligations of the Commonwealth. The result of the Treasurer's handling of our finances is the antithesis of what he said it would be, if the Country party was sufficiently powerful to assume control. It is time the people should realize what he aud the Government with which he is associated is doing. I believe that when the electors become aware of the facts, and realize the position in connection with Australia's development and future financial prospects, they w ill make a very drastic change. They do not believe in treasurers who do not practise what they preach. see what this "" Dismal Jimmy "" of whom I am speaking said concerning Australia's industries at that time. On page 12031 of Hansard he is reported as having saidWhat have we available to spend on the conduct of our Government? A glance at the sources of our national income will show us that prices for our principal products are approximating those before the war. Wool is about the pre-war level, butter is rapidly falling, hides are down, meat is almost unsaleable, sugar has dropped, jam is a drug on the market, timber mills have ceased working in many parts of the Commonwealth, mining operations generally are suspended, and wheat is falling.

Here is anotherLet us Last year we had a trade balance against us of £32,000,000, our imports exceeding our exports by that amount; this year our exports which pay practically the whole of our external interest, and a good proportion of our income tax, are less in quantity, and our imports, which must pay the whole of our customs duties, have slumped to the extent of nearly 40 per cent. Despite this, the Treasurer has budgeted for this revenue from the optimistic side. He was referring to Sir Joseph Cook, who apparently differs little from D r . Earle Page. Is he not budgeting in the same way as the predecessor whom he criticized? The only difference is that he is actually the Treasurer of to-day. I do not wish to score off the Treasurer; but he is in a most unenviable position. I merely want to find out who is telling the truth. It may be said that I , as a factory-bred fellow, do not understand all the intricacies of finance, but as one I have quoted the Treaswith a certain amount of knowledge in every-day affairs, I cannot but be amazed at the Treasurer's advocacy of certain principles which he has failed to apply budget that the present when he has the opportunity. I once ""I advocated the issue of incontrovertible notes for use within the Commonwealth, Who was getting and the South Australian Treasurer at that time, Mr Crawford Vaughan, conferred with the Under-Treasurer, Mr. Gill, as to whether such a system was notwithcompatible with sound finance.

In that year a sum of £2,911,000 was provided for departmental expenditure. This year there is being provided £3,114,000, notwithstanding the fact that in the intervening period the population has increased by 800,000 persons and addi1 tional activities have to be provided for, such as the Department of Markets, the expansion of the Health Department, to collect increases in customs revenue, and in connection with the administration of the Old-age Pensions Department. In that seven years an ii'on control has been kept of departmental expenditure, with the result that to-day the cost per head is only 9s. 10d., compared with 10s. 7d. in 1921-22, and the total amount is very little greater, despite the expansion of our activities rendered necessary Dy the increase of population and humanitarian measures we have passed. The conduct of the post oflice has again been pointed to as an example of what ought not to be done. In 1921, when I made the ref ereuces that have been quoted, the post office was being used as a taxing machine. In that year surplus receipts exceeding £1,000,000 were paid into' Consolidated Revenue. But immediately this Government came into office it said "" We shall regard the post office as a public utility, and shall not use it to tax the people indirectly; the money it earns will be utilized in extending the services it provides, or we will reduce charges so that it does not tax."" That practice has been adopted throughout. Last Dr. Earle Page. year the loss on a largely expanded post office was £44,000. My charge against the post office administration in 1921 was that if it charged for postal, telegraphic and telephonic services more than was justified, the excess of revenue over expenditure should be applied to the extension of those services, and should not -be placed in the revenue account, and so relieve other sources of taxation. That policy has been carried out by this Government. Dealing with the subject of the national debt, I said that steps should be taken to insure that debts should be incurred only to make provision for reproductive works, and that the dead weight war debt should be wiped out at the earliest moment. I pointed out that the prices of our exports were then moderately high, and that they might gradually decline over the ensuing 20 or 30 years with decline in price levels with the result that 2 or 3 bushels of wheat or 2 or 3 bales of wool would be required to do what it was possible to do in reducing war debt at that time with only one. We have since reduced the unproductive war debt by no less than £40,000,000. Although we have borrowed for reproductive works, we have made provision for not only interest payments on these works, but also a 30s. per cent, sinking fund on post office works and 10s. per cent, on other works. Although the total indebtedness j f the Commonwealth has increased in the last six years by £8,000,000, the debt per head has actually declined from £66 to £60. Those figures absolutely justify the speech that I made seven years ago, as well as this year's budget and the general financial policy of the Government. Certain criticisms have been levelled also against the budget for this year. Those criticisms have been concentrated on one particular point, and that is the deficit in the accounts of this year. We have been held up to derision and scorn because we have placed this deficit in suspense. It is suggested that that is an unusual practice, and that the Government has introduced a "" trust-to-luck"" budget. We are, on that account, condemned. It is much more satisfactory to place the deficit of last year in suspense rather than do what is being done in Queensland this year, and that is to budget for' a deficit meet a deficit. Ey special act it took on this year's accounts, doing nothing whatever to deal with the old accumulated deficit. that. making provision so that the revenue of this year will more than meet the expenses of this year. We have placed the deficit in suspense, and that is a reasonable thing to do, considering the financial history of the ComTrust Account. The present State Gomonwealth since the war. This is the third time in eleven years that there has been a serious decline in the customs revenue of this country, and, in each case, a deficit has resulted. On practicprovision to fund the deficit. It is made ally every other occasion the customs revenue has exceeded the estimates, with the result that when special provision has been made by imposing additional taxation, to try to recoup the deficit immediately, there has been a huge surplus in the next year, which has more than met the deficit of the preceding year. For instance, that was the position in 1916-17. Customs and excise revenue then totalled £15,600,000. In 1917-18 there was a slump in imports, with a resultant decrease in customs revenue to £13,224,000. To meet that decrease, additional taxation was imposed to bring in £3,000,000. The customs revenue for the next year amounted to £17,422,000, or more than £4,000,000 more than the revenue of the previous year. A similar thing happened in 1922-23. In 1921-22 there was a decrease of £4,200,000, and in 1922-23 there was an increase of £5,200,000. The experience of Australia is that there may be one,or two lean years during a period of six or eight years. We are generally able to anticipate good seasons over a considerable part of this great continent for four or five years out of every six years. I come now to the treatment of our prethan 4 per cent. We know, from sent deficit, and, in judging the action of the Government, it is worthwhile looking at what has been done in the States. Unfortunately, deficits in the States have been usual, and cause little comment, but they are unusual in the Commonwealth. When ""''the Federal Labour Government came into office in 1910, it raided the trust funds to £450,000 out of the trust funds to meet that deficit. The various States have had deficits during the last few years. The last Labour Government in New South Wales had, on the 30th June, 1927, a deficit amounting to £3,246,000. No provision has been made to remove this debit balance, and moneys standing to the credit of special deposits account and trust accounts,, are used as' cover against the overdrafts on Consolidated Eevenue vernment is funding its deficit, which is tantamount to making it a permanent loan. Victoria, under the Public Accounts Advance Act of 1924, made special a permanent loan on the people of the country. In Queensland the deficit is carried forward, the credit balance in loan fund being set off against the revenue deficit. This year the Queensland Government is budgeting for a deficit in the accounts of the year, and making no provision to meet that position. In South Australia there was, on the 30th June, 1927, a deficit of £i,050,000. That was carried forward and financed out of interest accrued but not due. In Western Australia the deficit in June, 1924, was funded. In ' Tasmania there was an accumulated deficit of £555,000, which has been partly funded. To make certain that these deficits would be satisfactorily dealt with from the point of view of the public and the investors in our Australian stocks, in the financial agreement special notice was taken of deficits, and provision was made so that the funding of deficits by the States should not be regarded as an ordinary investment on account of public works. First of all, the Commonwealth was not to be liable for any part of the sinking fund, and secondly, the State had to provide a sinking fund of not less our experience and that, ofother countries, that there are three alternative methods of dealing with a deficit. First of all, taxation can be increased immediately to remove the deficit. I submit that in a year of depression, especially at a time like the present, when",36,Budget 1928 29
110,Mr Fenton,The Treasurer is doing,38,Budget 1928 29
111,Dr. Eaele Page,"No. I amwe are just beginning to rise above the deoutside Parliament by certain members pression, it would be unwise to ask the people of Australia to provide, in one year, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 by way of extra taxation, which we might be able to remit the succeeding year, and which would undoubtedly be an immediate burden upon industry and preventing it from making a quick recovery. The second alternative is to fund the deficit and make it part of the permanent debt.' With our experience of the last six years, during which we have used accumulated surpluses of £7,500,000 to wipe out debts in addition to the provision of sinking funds, and provided some £7,400,000 for naval construction, besides other moneys for developmental works, it would be unwise to fund the deficit and make it a permanent debt. The third alternative is to hold tlie deficit in suspense, hoping to eliminmake that clear. He has failed to refer ate it before we further reduce taxation. That is what the Government is doing at present. Besides the criticism of the Commonwealth deficit, certain criticism -of Commonwealth accounts has appeared, both inside and outside of Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) compared two periods. He took the six years before this Government took office and the six years during which it has been in oflice, and he showed that there had been an expenditure of £100,000,000 more in the last six years than in the preceding six years. It would be interesting to examine the records of the States during ""those periods and to compare the various items of expenditure with those of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) in a masterly speech a few clays ago showed conclusively how this £100,000,000 had been expended. It was due, first, to the failure of previous governments to pay for the war out of current taxation, thus necessitating our present interest payments. We nave had an extra expenditure of £44,000,000 for war purposes. We expended an extra £13,000,000 on defence, and paid £13,000,000 more to the States. Old-age pensioners received an additional £20,000,000. need for me to refer further to criticism that has been completely answered. I shall content myself by replying to other criticisms which have been made Dr. Earle Page. of the Labour party. These criticisms relate generally to the treatment of the Commonwealth finances. I have in my hands a copy of the Labour campaign Manual, which has been edited by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). It contains the most gross distortion of figures that I have ever seen. Actual figures are taken, but by means of cunningly-designed paragraphs a completely wrong impression has been given. The whole treatment of the Commonwealth finances is disingenuous. The second chapter of this manual purports to show that there has been a huge increase in expenditure from 1921-22 to 1927-28, of from £65,000,000 to £79,000,000. Those figures represent gross expenditure, but the honourable member for Dalleyi n his publication does not to such items as the payment of interest on loans raised on behalf of the States. They are State debts. The States use the monies and they pay interest to the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth iu turn pays it to the creditors. The honourable member for Dalley completely omits reference to such a fact. In 1921-22 these interest payments amounted to £911,250, and in 1927-28 to £2,861,000. The honourable member for Dalley also forgets to say that there has been an increase in the special payments to Tasmania and Western Australia. In 1921-22, £85,000 was granted to Tasmania, and in 1927-28 £378,000. Honourable members opposite supported the Tasmanian grant bill when it was discussed in this chamber, and it was passed unanimously. Yet the honourable member for Dalley states in his manual that because of these payments the Commonwealth expenditure has been grossly extravagant, and suggests that we have incurred expense unnecessarily. who was at one time Treasurer of Queensland ? later deal with his record over the period There is, therefore, no of years that he has taken in respect of the Commonwealth finances. The special payment to Western Australia in 1927-28 was £300,000. Another item which appears in the 1927-28 accounts,",38,Budget 1928 29
112,Mr Maxwell,I s this the Theodore,39,Budget 1928 29
113,Dr. Eaele Page,"Yes, and I shallbut which, did not appear in the 1921-22 accounts, is an amount of £820,000 paid as a contribution to the sinking funds of the States. That payment commenced last year under the financial agreement. The honourable member for Dalley has made no mention at all of that fact, but simply infers that all expenditure has been unjustified. Another item is the payment of £2,000,000 for Federal aid roads. In 1921-22 the total post office figures were £9,000,000, now they are £12,400,000. The old-age pensions have increased from £5,380,000 to £9,790,000. Bounties have increased from £29,000 to £891,000, and payment for naval construction, other than from surplus, was £770,000 in 1927-28. The increase in expenditure on the items that I have named during the two periods taken, amounts approximately to £14,620,000, which is more than the gross increase shown in the manual compiled by the honourable member for Dalley. The comparison of the gross expenditure for the two years, without any reference to old-age pensions, post office, naval construction, roads, and other items, is altogether misleading. member for Dalley says that this Government is guilty of gross extravagance. The Manual saysI t might be objected that some of this exGovernmental accounts. We have, in penditure, such as the interest bill, repatriathese Labour campaign notes, a gross distion services and pensions cannot be controlled tortion of figures. Such a misleading by the Treasurer. Then take some of the departmental expenditure, most of which is subject to administrative control. It will be seen there have been substantial increases in nearly every department. Therefore, the Manual purports to take the departmental expenditure "" most nf which is subject to administrative control."" I ask honourable members to pay particular attention to those statements. Mr Theodore then goes on to discuss different departments. He says that the expenditure in the Prime Minister's Department in 1921-22 was £733,000, while in 1926-27 it was £1,325,000. But there is a simple explanation of this, which is to be found, not in Mr similar expenditure during the five comTheodore's book, but in the public accounts. Mr Theodore suggests that he is excluding interest charges, but to make up his figures he immediately includes an amount of £567,000, which represents the increase in interest and sinking fund charges in [263] 1926-27 as against 1921-22. That really makes up the difference between the two amounts. He then gives certain figures for the Treasurer's Department, which show that in 1921-22 the department spent £6,984,000, while in 1926-27 it spent £10,503,000. The increase is accounted for by increased pension payments, although Mr Theodore says that such payments are not controlled by the Treasurer, and that he is ignoring old-age pension expenditure. Can anything more unfair be imagined? Could any greater distortion of the facts be resorted to? The Department of Trade and Customs is next referred to. It is stated that its departmental expenditure in 1921-22 was £889.00C=, while in 1926-27 it was £1,877,000.' It would appear from that statement that the Minister has exercised a very lax control of the department; but the explanation is that £751,000 of the increase is accounted for by bounties paid in respect of iron and steel, cotton, wine, and so on. The honourable member has lumped this expenditure into the departThe honourable mental account, and says, "" Look how the expenditure has grown!"" The place to find the true facts is, of course, not Mr Theodore's book, but the published document has rarely, if ever, been published before. We hear a good deal, from time. to time, about the alleged humanitarian policy of the Labour party. We are told that Labour is always careful of the poor of the country, and that it alone has ever done anything to relieve destitution and distress; whereas the Government has always been careful to grease the fatted pig and look after the wealthy classes in the community. To test the. accuracy of this allegation I propose to compare the expenditure on old-age pensions during a five-year period when the Labour party was almost continuously in office with plete years this Government has been in oflice. The Labour party in its term of office paid £10,400,000 in old-age pensions, whereas this Government has paid £40,186,000. The Leader of the Opposition, in his usual disingenuous fashion, was careful to conceal these facts when he discussed the financial record of the Government, although everybody and all parties agree that this expenditure is justified, except when political capital may be made out of a concealment of the facts, as stance. It is shameful that the suffering of the destitute and aged poor of the community should be dragged into the arena of party politics by honourable members opposite. During the Labour party's period of five years the average amount of pension paid per fortnight was 19s. 5d., and the average cost of administration was £1 15s. 4d. for each £100 of pension payments. the administration of this Government the average fortnightly pension payment has been 3Ss. 5d. and the average cost of administering this legislation, £1 4s. 3d. per £100. It will be seen therefore how little ground there is for the charge of honourable members opposite that the Government has cared only for the wealthy-classes of the community, or that its administration compares unfavorably. The Labour Manual, from which I am quoting, has been used by the honourable other honourable members opposite who have participated in this debate. to the public? price of 6d. It goes on to state that the taxation per head of the population is 12s. 4d. more now than it was when the Government assumed oflice. The taxation per head in 1921-22 was £9 0s. 4d.; but it has to be remembered that approximately £1,500,000 obtained from the post office annually in those days was included in the Consolidated Revenue Fund or roughly 5s. per head. It is estimated that the amount of taxation per head this year will be £9 4s. 4d.; but the increase of 4s. per head is far more than accounted for by the increased payments that have been made to the States We are paying £4,000,000 more annually to the States now than we paid in 1921-22. If the payments to the States' had remained stationary, the per capita' taxation this year would have been only £8 l is . $d., compared with £9 0s. 4d. There also appears in association with in 1921-22, notwithstanding that we are paying £4,600,000 more in old-age pensions now than We were then. amount in old-age pensions in itself accounts for about 14s. per head. We are also paying an amount which approximates 6s. per head in road grant. It will be seen that these two amounts alone in the present inaccount for 20s. The Manual goes on to allege that the manner in which this Government is levying taxation is crushing the poorer classes in the community, and that such remissions in taxation as have been made have benefited only the wealthy people. Another allegation is that the taxation of the workers has been increased. Nowhere During in the booklet is there the slightest reference to the improved position, from the taxation stand-point, of persons with low incomes. What are the facts ? In 1924 the present Government increased the exemption to £300. The exemption in 1921 was £100. It was altered to £200 in 1922, when the present Prime Minister was Treasurer. The present £300 exemption disappears at £1,200, whereas previously the exemption disappeared at £800. The present Government has made concessions in respect of medical expenses, which disappear at £800; child allowances, which have been increased to £50 a child, and in many other ways. Many concessions have been made to farmers who are opening up new country. As a matter of fact, the number of individual taxpayers has been reduced from 753,000 in 1922 to 231,000 in 1927. In other words, there are nearly 522,000 fewer individual taxpayers to-day than when the Government assumed office. That is a complete answer to the statement that we have not helped the poorer people. The Manual gives a most interesting calculation which purports to show how the 1927 income taxation remissions operate. It is as follows:1927 INCOME TAX REMISSION. (10 per cent.)

116,Dr. Earle Page,"Yes; for the man with the smaller income receives only a lesser benefit. The obvious answer, of course, is that the rate of remission is the same in both cases, and that naturally the man with the large income receives a greater remission than the man with a small income. I propose to give some figures to show how advantageous the remissions in taxation that have been made by this Government are to the man with a small income. There is plenty of reference in this Manual to persons who draw an income of £100,000 and upwards. Unfortunately for the Taxation Department such incomes are comparatively few in number. If there were more of them, many more of the poorer people in the community could be relieved of some of the taxation that they now have to pay.

Let people through their actual income tax us compare that with the record of the payments generally realize that they are paying less taxation to-day than they present Government for the last three paid in 1922 on a similar income.

While dealing with this question of taxation, it is interesting to compare what has happened durng the life of this Government with what took place during the time the Fisher Government had control of the Commonwealth finances. We have heard much from honourable members on the opposite side in favour of a reduction of indirect taxation, and an' increase in direct taxation. Yet they have fought many times against a decrease in direct taxation, and, in particular, fought very hard against our proposal to reduce the postage rate from 2d. to l£d. Honourable members fought the Government for two days and two nights on that proposal to reduce postal rates by 25 per cent. Too many pages of Hansard are devoted to the debate for there to be any doubt upon that point. II eduction. Let us see how the taxation s. d. £ t. d. £ >. i.. record of the Fisher Government ' -"" compares with that of the present 100 90 administration. There was no direct 73 43 Commonwealth taxation in 1910. The Labour Government introduced the land 3 1 8 Ni l 3 1 8 100 tax, which yielded £1,564,000 in 1912-13, 7 5 7 0 19 3 0 6 4 87 equivalent to an increase per head in 69 43 direct taxation of 6s. 7Jd. At the same time indirect taxation increased from 58 1912-13, an increase of 34 per cent. Thus the actual increase in indirect taxayears. During the period from 1924-25 to 1927-28, there was a reduction in In 1924-25, the three years that a Labour Government was in office. During the Labour party's reign of three years there was an increase of taxation, direct and indirect, this government with bringing about of 19s. 3^d. a head; during the last three unemployment, because, amongst other years of this Government's term of office, things, it provided only £1,000,000 for taxation has increased by only Is. 9Jd. a head. Under the Labour Governiaent the increase in taxation per head was almost twelve times as great as the increase under the present Government during the last three years. Let us now consider what was spent durmostly for the extension of postal ing the two periods we are comparing, and the purposes for which the money was used. It is desirable to do this beGovernment spent only £10,350,000 on cause it might be argued by members of the Opposition that the huge increase in taxation which took place during the Labour Government's term of office was due to the action of that Government in instituting a bigger public works and naval construction programme, and paying for the work out of revenue rather than out of loan money. During the three years from 1910 to 1912-13, the Fisher Government provided for "" additions, new works, buildings, &c"", £6,319,438, and for naval constructiou, £2,828,513, a total of £9,147,951 out of revenue. At the same time it spent £1,202,078 out of loan money. Unfortunately for the Labour Government's record, however, their payments to the States less made ment for a corresponding period. Therefore, the Fisher Government actually provided out of revenue for the works and purposes I have mentioned a net increase of only £2,031,721 during the period under review. On the other hand, during the last three years this Government has spent out of revenue on new works and naval construction £6,171,470, while payments to the States were increased by £2,691,000, making a total of £8,863,000 spent out of revenue. Thus we have spent on these outstanding items practically four time.3 as much as the Labour Government did, and we have increased taxation by only Is. 9|d. a head, as compared with the Labour Government's increase of 19s. 3|d. a head. Labour party representatives claim that their government was Or. Earle Page. the greater provider of employment, and that it initiated and carried out a big public works programme. They charge work on the Hume reservoir this year. They make charges such as those, and the next moment they blame us for borrowing any money at all, either hero or overseas. During these years £21,781,299 was spent out of loan money on reproductive public works, facilities, and for such undertakings as the Kyogle-Brisbane railway. The Labour similar works, while it deducted £7,716,000 from Commonwealth payments to the States, thus preventing the States from spending that amount on their own public works. cance of these figures depend upon the amount of, general revenue obtained by the respective Governments? the Opposition, in his criticism of the Government, compared the period of six years prior to this Government coming into office, when price levels were altogether different, with the six years during which this Government has been in power, and he charges the Government with during this period were meeting its revenue commitments out of by £7,116,230 than those loan money. I claim that the comparison by the preceding governwhich I am making is at least as fair as that made by the Leader of the Opposition, or by the writer of this manual. I claim that during the last three years the record of this Government, in regard to public works, naval construction, and State finances, has been more satisfactory than that of the Fisher Government. I propose now to discuss the subject of the public debt, about which similarly grossly misleading statements have been made as about our public works programme. In this manual there is a statement to the effect that the public debt has been increased during the regime of this Government from £415,000,000 to £494,000,000. That is given as the gross increase in the public debt, and the inference is allowed to be drawn that it has been due to the expenditure",41,Budget 1928 29

The facts are, however, that the Commonwealth's own debt has increased during the last six years by only £8,000,000-fro m £364,000,000 to £372,000,000. If we go back seven years the increase has been £15,000,000; but it is suggested in the manual that there has been an increase of £79,000,000 in four years. for Dalley( Mr Theodore) knows better than I do how the increase in the debt has been brought about, hecause he was one of the State Premiers who concurred in the borrowing of £68,000,000 by the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the States, which State debt has been included in the figures quoted. The manner in which the public debt has been built up has been frequently explained. There has been an increase in the debt for public works of £48,000,000, and a decrease in the dead weight of war debt of approximately £40,000,000. The manual says that a Labour Government would be infinitely preferable to any other kind, because Labour Governments can keep down the rate of interestT'Tl; says quently. that the Fisher Government was able to borrow money fifteen years ago at 4 per cent., and afterwards at 4£ per cent. It ments ever published in connection with then refers to the loans raised by the present Government, and says that because we have had to .borrow money in London at 99£, and pay 5 per cent, interest, and pay 4$ per cent, interest on loans raised at 92-^ in New York, our record cannot compare with that of the Labour Government. member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has asked me whether the comparisons I have been making are fair. I ask him whether the comparison made in this book are fair to the present Government? The honourable member for Dalley is not justified in saying that while the Nationalists are in office higher interest rates are charged for money raised in Australia than for money obtained abroad. It is grotesque and absurd for a man with the honourable member's record in regard to the raising of loan money to make that statement. When he was in power in Queensland he dragged the credit of that State in the mud. He made it impossible for that State to borrow money on the London market. He was forced to raise loans in Australia, and for money obtained in New York he paid a higher interest rate than was charged elsewhere. Finally, he was permitted to return to the London market but only after definitely undertaking to remove certain repudiations which had occurred in. Queensland. In April, 1924, he -went to London and issued a loan at 5-J per cent, at The honourable member £99 10s., the interest yield being £5 12s. 4d. Three weeks earlier South Australia had issued a 5 per cent, loan at £98, the interest yield on that being £5 3s. 6d. In the month following the issue of the Queensland loan, the Commonwealth issued a loan of £10,000,000 at 5 per cent, at par. The Queensland loan, therefore, carried an interest rate of 12s. 4d. per cent, more than the Commonwealth rate, and 8s. lOd. per cent, in excess of the South Australian rate. In addition, the honourable member for Dalley was not able to obtain his loan for such a long term as those for which the Commonwealth and South Australian loans were taken up, which would greatly increase his costs of conversion subseOne of the most unscrupulous statenational finance is that contained in the manual to which I have referred, headed, ""Nationalists create underwriting monopoly."" The manual goes on to assert that for many years one agent had acted for the various States in the raising of loans. It is stated that for The honourable many years the various States had always made their loan arrangements through Nivison and Company. Even the honourable member for Dalley, when Premier of Queensland, always did his borrowing through that house. The manual goes on to say that there is no need to do such a thing, and that, because we as a Commonwealth have continued with Nivison and Company, we are guilty of creating an underwriting monopoly. The position in regard to borrowing in the Commonwealth is that since. 1924 our loans have been raised under the aegis of the Federal Loan Council, which consists of a representative of the Commonwealth Government and representatives of the various State Governments. At no period during the existence of this body has it not had Labour representatives upon it. Every action taken by the Loan Council in connection with borrowing has been taken with the unanimous concurrence of Labour governments. Dalley was for a time a member of that council, and he knows as well as every other member of it exactly what the position was. All the time he was a member, he and his Labour confreres were parties to the unanimous decisions arrived at by the council. The action taken was not that of the Nationalist party, the Country party, or the Labour party; but it was the joint action of the members of the Loan Council, which was representative of all the Governments in Australia. The honourable member's attempt to extract electioneering ammunition from the policy of the Loan Council is one of the most mischievous things that has ever been done in Australia, so far as the maintenance of the financial credit of the Commonwealth is concerned, and is absolutely unjustifiable on these facts, Which are known to every financier in Australia. The honourable member goes on to point Out in this manual that the present Government has created an underwriting monopoly in New York. He was in office in Queensland when we first went into the subject of dealing with New York, and he knows why we went there for money. If the honourable member had complaints to make against the action taken, he should have ventilated them be the profits of the hank that should fore the Loan Council and not in a pamphlet of this nature. He declares that we have created this underwriting -monopoly ""entirely to fill the pockets of the men who find campaign funds for the Nationalists."" He was one of the -Labour men who sat in the Loan Council, and those men will repudiate the honourable member's base suggestion just as strongly as I do. issued with the official imprimatur of the Labour party upon it. In attacking the Commonwealth Government in this way tin its handling of the public debt problem glad to have been able to refute the statethe Labour party is backing about the worse possible horse in the race, because it is recognized not only in Australia, but also in every other country, that the 'efforts of the present Government to place tions contained in them. 'the finances of the Commonwealth on a sound basis are the most comprehensive Dr. Earle Page. and constructive that have ever been put forward in this country. This was admitted by practically every honourable The honourable member for member two or three weeks ago in .discussing the bill for the referendum to authorize an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth to enable it to deal with Commonwealth and State debts. Although this Government has been twitted with having borrowed £8,000,000 more than was owing in 1922, the States have in the same time increased their debts by about £200,000,000 and I have never heard special attention drawn to that fact by any opposing critic. The Commonwealth Government has endeavoured to keep down loan expenditure and improve the credit of Australia. It has secured more favorable interest rates for its new loans than would have been charged if the Loan Council had not been established. Sometimes the Labour party ceases condemning this Government for its financial proposals, and condescends to praise it on account of the provision of a sinking fund to wipe out the national debt. The reason for this is that it claims credit for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, and declares that the profits from that bank, and from the note issue are responsible for the sinking fund. But what are the facts? Before the act by which the establishment of the fund was authorized was passed in 1923, have been applied to that purpose were not so used. The Labour party had an opportunity to do this; but it was left for a Nationalist Government to do it in 1920. This Ministry in 1923 brought down a comprehensive measure which not only placed the public debt on a satisfactory basis, but made provision for the redemption of both the old and the new debt. The profits from 1922 to 192S Yet this manual is from the note issue amounted to something like £6,000,000, but out of the revenue of this country about £30,000,000 has been paid for debt redemption.

The next item questioned by the Leader and the price of issue, in the absence of Both cordially agreed to perience has shown that it was a very The Leader of the Opposition -",43,Married Person With Four Children
119,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Minishour a Minister may by reference toother papers on the occasionof the Opening of the Federal Parliament in 'Duchess of York. On that occasion Australia was very prominently before the people in Great Britain, and I think the High Commissioner's office was justified in incurring extra 'expenditure to assist in making those historical issues of special advertising value to the Commonwealth. The whole of that expenditure has to he met in the current financial year. The criticism by the Leader of the Opposition of the proposed expenditure on the official residence of the High Commissioner raises the question whether such a residence should be provided. On both my visits to Great Britain during the last five years I have discussed this matter with other visiting Australians, and they were unanimously of opinion that it was eminently desirable that an official residence should be provided for the High Commissioner, so that his status as representative of this great country might be worthily maintained. But the particular thing that seemed to disturb the Leader of the Opposition was that, having provided an official residence, the relations between the English-speak.we. have continued the amount of £2,000, which has appeared on the estimates in previous years for an official residence) in addition to the salary of ;£3,000. That amount of £2,000 has on Various occasions been the subject of ' discussion between Governments and 'the successive High Commissioners, each of whom was of opinion that £5,000 was the minimum sum upon which his office could be adequately maintained. it seemed doubtful whether, even with that amount, the High Commissioner Could maintain his position worthily, reitiirn the hospitality extended to him officially, and also offer entertainment On behalf of the Commonwealth to distinguished people. Thus the understanding has grown up and been accepted by all governments, Labour and non-Labour, that the £2,000 provided for an official residence was not really a separate vote for that particular purpose, but was part Of the total remuneration of £5,000. Having purchased for the High Commissioner an official residence, we had to decide whether' this Mr Bruce. of £2,000 should be reduced. Tne Government is convinced that even Canberra by the Duke and when the High Commissioner is adequately housed free of cost, £5,000 is the minimum sum upon which he can discharge the duties which the people of Australia have entrusted to him. This matter must be regarded from another angle. Too often a person holding an official position finds it impossible on the salary provided to maintain his office with appropriate dignity. Consequently, when appointments are to be made, the field of selection is limited to persons who have sufficient private means to be able to supplement the official salary. Honourable members will agree that that is a most undesirable state of affairs, and realizing that, the Government has deliberately continued the allowance at £5,000, notwithstanding that an official residence is now provided. The position of Australian Commissioner in the United States of America was created with the authority of Parliament, and the withdrawal of our representative from New York would have an extremely bad effect upon public opinion in that country. At a time when ing peoples throughout the world are daily becoming more cordiala development that may be a tremendous factor in the maintenance of the world's peacewe should be ill-advised to take such a retrograde step. The committee should know, however, that the whole question of Australian representation in America is being reviewed by the Government at the present time, and after the general Indeed, election it will be necessary to take further action in regard to what may be termed diplomatic representation, and probably also trade representation. Therefore, I cannot hold out any promise of a reduction in this item. Mr E.' RII-EY -What benefit has the Commonwealth derived from this representation in America? is thinking of the office in terms of trade. I find it extremely difficult to point to any development of trade between Australia and the United States of America in conallowance sequence of the creation of this office; indeed the present position of our trade",46,Prime Minister S Department

Honourable members understand, however, that our Commissioner in .America is not a commercial agent; he is the diplomatic representative of Australia, and his presence in America has kept before the people of that country the existence of this Commonwealth, particularly by means of visits to various societies, associations and universities. Por the sake of bur national prestige, Australian representation in the United States of America is wise, and at this time in the world's history, when two of our sister dominions have recently increased the status of their representation there, the Commonwealth would be ill-advised to discontinue the system that has obtained for the last few years. : If not, what is he? sador. The honourable gentleman is acquainted with the attitude that has beeu adopted by the Government in regard to the appointment of an ambassador. On a more suitable occasion, that matter might be discussed in this chamber. At present I am dealing only with the expenditure, which in any event is not a very heavy item, and, compared with what we should have to pay if we had to maintain an ambassador, is very light. The next item questioned was that providing for expenditure in connection with the proposal for the holding in Australia of a British Empire Exhibition. has taken unqualified exception to that expenditure, because this Parliament did not pass the bill which was submitted for the holding of the exhibition in 1932. I point out, however, that it had to be incurred, so that the whole position might be examined. It would have been altogether out of the question to present to this Parliament a bill providing for such an exhibition, before steps had been taken to determine the organization that would be necessary, and to formulate plans with respect to it . proposal. much more ill-considered if the Governit had made preliminary investigations. It is not my purpose to discuss on this occasion the question whether the exhibition ought to be held. I merely point out that the subject has been discussed by a conference of the representatives of every self-governing dominion in the British Empire, and the decision arrived at was that such exhibitions are most desirable. The honourable gentleman referred also to the expenditure connected with the visit to Australia of Mr Amery, the Secretary of State for the Dominions. I regret that this matter has been raised, because Mr Amery was the guest of the Commonwealth during his stay here, and his tour was conducted jointly by the Commonwealth and the States, each of which accepted the responsibility of sharing the cost. Mr Amery was received most cordially wherever he travelled. I offer no apology for the expenditure. It is only what a great country like Australia should incur to entertain in a fitting, manner the first Minister of the. British Crown who has visited Australia wh'ije still in office. The honourable gentleman drew attention to the expenditure of £26,600 .upon Government House. The object of that expenditure is to meet the cost of upkeep of the establishments of the Governor General in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. It includes the purchase of furniture, the installation of the telephone service, and every other cost involved in the maintenance of those three residences'. The honourable gentleman There is also an amount which represents rental paid to the Victorian Government During the period for which the Commonwealth has had the use of what .'is commonly known as Federal Government House in Melbourne, it has .not been asked to pay any rent, but it has been, responsible"" for the maintenance of .the building and all its appurtenances. Upon the transfer of the seat of government..to Canberra however, the question of rental was raised by the State Government.

After considerable discussion, the Commonwealth Government agreed to make an annual payment towards the cost of acquiring "" Stonnington."" These Estimates make provision for two of those payments, because an agreement was not arrived at in time to make any provision last year. inatter was settled only six or nine months ago. of the back payment? A further question raised was that of the expenditure incurred by the Development -and Migration Commission. I shall deal first with the expenditure as a whole, and show to what extent it has increased since the appointment of the commission. I wish to make it clear and definite that the amount of £127,000 to which the honourable gentleman referred is not wholly new expenditure. When the commission came into being, it took over, in London and Australia, the whole of an existing organization which was dealing with the question of migration to Australia. The 'annual cost of that organization at the time was in the region of £80,000 or £90,000. I propose to deal with the different items of expenditure seriatim. The first relates to the organization which 'was taken oyer by the commission. The estimated expenditure for 1927-28 at the 1 Australian end was £45,000, but the amount actually expended was only £36,000. The provision for the present year is £42,000. The figures relating to the ' London organization are £34,000, '£32,000, and £34,000 respectively. In both of those cases there is not a substantial variation. The next item relates to 'investigations by the commission. The estimate last year was £20,000, and the 'expenditure £25,000, while the provision 'for this year is £25,000. The criticism, not of this Government particularly, but of governments generally in Australia, is '. based, not upon the amount of their expenditure, but upon the wisdom of incurring it. There are many persons who have a [great deal to say about loan expenditure, but when pressed they invariably admit that they are not opposed to such expenditure if it is wisely incurred and will give, either directly or indirectly, a return equivalent to or greater than the burden of interest thereby imposed. Many of the schemes that have been launched in Australia are open to criticism on the ground that the expenditure has not been wisely incurred, and that great savings could have been effected if a little foreI believe that the thought had been exercised. In my opinion, the main work of the Development and Migration Commission is to investigate schemes which involve the expenditure of loan money, and to endeavour to ensure that only those are embarked upon which will give the return to which I have alluded. It has established contact with the governments of all the States. Committees have been set up to handle questions of the internal development of the States, and to endeavour to lay down a programme covering a period of years. A number'of schemes have been submitted by different States, and investigated by the commission. It cannot be denied that we shall save money if the best possible advice is obtained regarding the schemes that are submitted. It is not possible for any man to possess a knowledge of, or to have had experience in regard to all the matters related to different schemes that are likely to be submitted, affecting mining, irrigation, agriculture, pastoral and railway propositions, and many other activities. The. course pursued has been that of seeking the advice of technical experts upon technical matters. That, I submit, is the right principle to adopt. Some votes might be reduced without causing substantial harm to Australia. To reduce this vote would be a tragic -blunder, because, in that event, these schemes involving an expenditure of millions of pounds would not be fully and exhaustively examined by a'body of experts and specialists. Some of the schemes under consideration at present are of considerable magnitude. Western Australia contemplates the opening up of some 8,000,000 acres of land and the establishment of over 3,000 farms. The expenditure on that work is estimated at about £10,000,000. Before entering into such a scheme, surely it is worthwhile spending a little money now to",48,Prime Minister S Department
125,Mr Scullin,What was the amount,49,Prime Minister S Department
126,Mr Beuce,"£5,000 .make certain that we are proceeding on right lines. I offer no apology for this expenditure. The item relating to the Fairbridge Farm School is a small one. No figure is set down for the present year, and I do not think that the item was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. The next item . concerns the cost of establishing and maintaining State reception and farm training depots, and the expenditure set down for this year is £14,900. I do not wish to weary the committee by giving the full details of this item. The expenditure consists of a payment of £9,400 to the Scheyville, Training Farm in New South Wales. Up to the present, that farm has mainly been used for training boys brought out under the Dreadnought scheme. The New South Wales Government has now signed the £34,000,000 migration agreement, and the cost of maintaining the farm will be shared by the British Government, the Government of New South Wales, and the Commonwealth Government each contributing one-third of the expenditure. At present the Commonwealth is hearing half of the cost. The amount set down for the Eleho Training Farm in Victoria is £2,500, and for the group settlement training scheme in Western Australia, £3,000; making altogether a total expenditure of £14,900. Under the agreement with the British Government, the States may establish training farms, inside their in which they are to-day. Because of this own areas, and the Commonwealth .and British Governments will each bear one-third of the expense in respect of capital financial assistance to the industry, But and maintenance. applies to the Scheyville and Elcho trainthe interests on the Kalgoorlie fields. , A ing farms. The Victorian farm has been used as a depot to which migrants are taken immediately upon their arrival, in order to keep them out of, and away from, the cities. Western Australia has no training. farm system, but it trains migrants at the group settlements. The expenditure set down for that is £3,000. It should be borne in mind that the Commonwealth is bound under the agreement to provide for expenditure of the nature set out in this item. The next item relates to subsidies to voluntary organizations, such as the New Settlers League. The organizations covered are the Young Men's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Riverview Farm, the Returned Soldiers and other additional -v. efforts. All these organizations are'concerned with the care of the migrant, after arrival here. They make certainthat he is, in effect, all he purportsto be,, and they see that he is properly and effectively settled. This expenditure is wise, .and it would be a great mistake to curtail it I think that I have now covered all the items that the Leaaur of the .Opposition raised. In regard to the Development and Migration .Commission's expenditure, the Leader of the Opposition will see that once we get away from the general argument as to whether we should expend any money at all upon migration, the main point is to centre our attention upon the amount that is to be expended or provided for investment. I have dealt with that subject at some length because I feel strongly that the commission is one of the most valuable institutions in Australia, and, therefore,, it would be a great pity to reduce the vote. This investmentis necessary not only in respect of the £34,000,000 agreement and schemes under it, hut also in respect of many other things. One 'of these is the recent investigation into the gold-mining industry of Australia. Without that inquiry the goldfields of Kalgoorlie would not be in the position investigation we have discovered that the real difficulty lies not so much in granting That arrangement in bringing about an amalgamation of large number of economies can be effected by getting rid of duplication of staffs and power plants,and by dealing with questions affecting' the fields on one common basis. It has also been suggested that the sum of £250,000 should be provided to assist the, industry in respectof new plant, provided that the plant cannot be made in Australia, or can be made here, but only at a much higher cost than the imported article. I shall not say anything about that policy at this stage. I merely suggest that this Parliament would not have been in the position to give a considered decision in respect of the best method to adopt to assist the gold-mining industry, had not the report of the Development and Migration Commission been available. Another example is the settlement of the River Murray Valley. That scheme has been progressing for about twelve years under the supervision of the three states that touch upon the river Murray-Ne w South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. There has been no co-ordination at all among those States in developing and planting their areas. The anomaly must be rectified unless we are to have a repetition of past difficulties. Let me give One illustration. Some three years ago New South Wales established rice-growing on the Murrumbidgee area, and that industry is now able to provide the whole of the rice requirements of Australia. Another State, facing the problem of developing its irrigated areas, and seeing the success achieved in rice-growing in the Murrumbidgee area at Leeton, is now proceeding to put its own areas under rice. The result will be that we shall have an over-production of rice for home consumption. No one has yet ascertained whether there is any possibility of finding an export market. We must get rid -of this lack of co-ordination. At the beginning of the year a conference between the Commonwealth and the States was held at Canberra, and the settlement of the Murray River Valley was discussed. It was probably one of the most successful conferences that we have had. It was realized that there was a danger of the Murray River scheme failing because of the catchment area being destroyed, and the flow of the river diverted. The States agreed to take steps to protect the catchment area, and also laid down a basis of co-ordination. That is not a Commonwealth matter. We have nothing to do with the irrigation areas, but concerned to arrive at an agreement of the River Murray Valley. The problem that we are always faced with is to get some central body that will bring the interested parties together and carry out the necessary investigations. That work is being done to-day by the Development and Migration Commission. It is better done by that body because it is non-political. It has no political complexion at all. I am convinced that Mr Bruce. as time passes this institution will become more and more established in the national life of Australia. Governments will come and go, and very soon the political complexion of the Government which established the commission will be forgotten. The Development and Migration Commission is to-day negotiating with Western Australia regarding one of the biggest projects in Australia. ' The Government of that State belongs to a political party quite different from that with which the Commonwealth Government is connected. It is inevitable that at times, when governments of different political views confer together, the national interest must be forgotten. To-day the Commonwealth Government is really outside of this scheme. It is being considered, on the one hand, by the Development and Migration Commission, and, on the other hand, by the committee established by the Western Australian Government. It is therefore most undesirable that this vote for investigation purposes should be curtailed. The work of the commission is of the utmost value to Australia. I forgot to mention one other item and that is the amount of £2,000 appearing on the Estimates this year as Canberra allowance to the Governor General. This Parliament decided that the Seat of Government should be moved to Canberra, and that the Governor General should have a residence here. When the Governor General is here he must maintain an; establishment, and that, of course, adds to his expenses. So it is necessary to pay him an allowance, unless we dispose of one of the Government Houses in the States. That .1 think would be undesirable. The Government House in Victoria should be maintained. It will we helped! the three States be many years before we shall be able to build in the Federal Capital our perregarding the development manent Government House. From time to time, visits are paid to Australia of a most important character. We had the Duke and Duchess of York here for the opening of Parliament, and recently we have had visits from the American Squadron and the British Special Service Squadron. On such occasions it is desirable that our Governor General should be able to entertain in a manner in keeping with the dignity of his position. Government House, Melbourne, is the only place where it is possible for him to entermy budget speech. The Prime Minister tain on this scale. It would be undesirable, at least until we can build a monumental Government House in Canberra, for us to vacate Government House in Melbourne. The Governor General has been put to additional expense by reason of the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, which should not be placed upon his shoulders. If he is called upon to bear additional expenditure of that description, we shall reach the position that only rich men who can afford to entertain from their private means will be able to accept the position of Governor General of the Commonwealth. I am sure that we do not wish that. It is highly desirable, rather, that we shall be able to invite gentlemen of the calibre that we desire to accept office as Governor General irrespective of their private wealth. The Governor General should be able to maintain his position with appropriate dignity upon his salary and without drawing upon his private means. Consequently this additional vote is proposed. One other matter to which I should refer relates to the expenditure which the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth must incur in the maintenance of his position as its first citizen, and although it is a little difficult for me to discuss, I feel that my duty to my successors requires that I should bring it under notice. The Prime Minister of Australia cannot maintain his position and an official residence upon the salary at present provided for the office; but must meet part of his expenses out of his private means. There may come a Prime Minister who cannot do this without considerable sacrifice, and honourable members must sooner or later give consideration to the fact. If a successor in this office was not able to meet the expenses of the position without sacrifice, I should certainly support some increase in the remuneration of the office. He should not be called upon to provide money from private sources to maintain with dignity his honourable position, and to fulfil the responsibilities and duties of the office as Australia would desire. waited with interest to hear the explanation of the Prime Minister of the specific items of expenditure in the proposed vote for his department to which I referred in stated in his budget speech that that was not the proper place to raise such questions, but he was properly reminded by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that it was in the previous budget debate that he had challenged honourable members to refer to specific items when suggesting that the Government should reduce its expenditure. I am not concerned about where the explanation should be made so long as it is made. It certainly has not been made so far. The right honourable gentleman indulged in a number of generalities in regard to my questions a few minutes ago, but gave no satisfactory explanation of any one specific item that I had mentioned. He said that I had referred only to small items; but I remind him that it is the aggregation of small items that makes the big amount. I criticized the proposed vote of £908 for a liaison officer in London. The Prime Minister said that that expenditure had not been challenged hitherto. My reply is that both the method of appointing this officer and the amount of his remuneration were severely criticized by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) when the appointment was first made. The Prime Minister has not shown that the expenditure is justified. He has said something about receiving valuable information, and has referred to a file that is in existence somewhere. The information and the file should both be made available to honourable members of this House. I am sceptical as to the value of that information. I cannot see any necessity for continuing this office. Surely one of the numerous staff in the High Commissioner's office in London could do this work. The Prime Minister said that the appointment of the financial advisor to the High Commissioner was absolutely necessary, and that this officer had been able to save the general taxpayer large sums of money. The right honourable gentleman has not mentioned one loan that has been obtained at a cheaper price or a lower rate of interest because of the activities of this officer. Let us get down to the facts and avoid generalities. It is. all very well to speak vaguely and solemnly",49,Prime Minister S Department
127,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [5.5],"I haveabout the value of this officer, but we want to know what he has actually done to justify his appointment. I challenge the Prime Minister to indicate one specific entertain, attend certain dinners, and saving that would warrant us in voting the £2,000 for salary and the £250 for' entertainment expenditure to this officer, to say nothing of the £500 which he costs us in connection with the Commonwealth Bank. The next item that I questioned in my budget speech was the proposed vote of £2,500 for advertising in connection with the High Commissioner's office. I pointed out that although a similar amount was voted last year, the actual expenditure totalled £5,548. Why was the vote exceeded by more than £3,000? How many extra Parliaments are we to have inside and outside of Australia? The Prime Minister stated that extra expenditure had been incurred in connection with advertising in certain special editions of London newspapers which were published at the time of the opening of Parliament at Canberra. What was the nature of those advertisements? Copies of them should be made available to us so that we may determine whether this money was wisely or foolishly spent. No member of the Government would have spent money in advertising his own business in special editions of those newsview that we should have an ambassador papers. The Prime Minister also said that we did not advertise Australia enough, yet the proposed vote for this purpose this year is only the same as last year. It is time that lavish expenditure of this kind was discontinued. I also asked why £2,000 was being voted towards the expenses of an official residence for the High Commissioner, seeing that only last year we spent £9,900 in purchasing the lease of a residence for him, and provided £650 as ;the annual upkeep for it. We should not vote both the £650 and the £2,000 for the one purpose. The High Commissioner should not have it both ways. The Prime Minister said that the gentleman who accepted this office required a remuneration of £5,000 in addition to an official residence. If that is so, we should not camouflage the facts by voting the ordinary salary and adding £2,000 to it under the false description of residential expenses. A good deal has been said at different times Mr Soullin. about the necessity for maintaining this position with proper dignity. We are told that the High Commissioner must spend money in other extravagant ways. Seeing that Australia is loaded down with debt, that the Commonwealth and State Governments are showing deficits in their budgets, and that we have more unemployed in the country now than ever before, we should refuse to be soothed by pleasant talk of dignity. There is no justification whatever for this expenditure. Another item that I challenged was the proposed vote of £5,000 for the position of Australian Commissioner in the United States of America. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) pertinently asked whether this gentleman was an ambassador or a trade commissioner. The Prime Minister told us that he was not a trade commissioner. He also admitted that our trade with' the United States of America is unsatisfactory. He went further, and said that next year we should have to reconsider this fact with a view to appointing to the United States of America both a trade commissioner and an ambassador or some such 'officer. occasions that I do not subscribe to the I said a few minutes ago that the whole position would have to be reconsidered from both the trade and general representation viewpoint. amounts to saying that two officers need to be appointed. It is of no use to talk about maintaining harmonious international relationships by appointing trade commissioners. That is not the way to do it. I should not raise any objection to this expenditure if it could be jusified, but I have been fairly industrious in my investigations to ascertain whether there is any sound reason for continuing this office, and have been able to find none. It was a surprise to us to hear the Prime Minister says that the appointee to this office is not a trade commissioner. We should be told exactly what he is and what he does. An item appears in this proposed vote of £2,271 as preliminary expenditure in connection with an exhibition which has",52,Prime Minister S Department

Even yet we do not know where this sum of £2,000 odd has gone. There is shown here a sum of £127,618 for the administration of the Developplanting ment and Migration Commission.

Why, they cannot produce enough fat lambs to feed themselves, and they can get double the price on the home market for what they produce that they can obtain overseas! That was one ""brain-wave."" Another brilliant suggestion was that the Tasmanians should produce strawberries, and sell them in Brisbane. The thing is so ridiculous as not to need comment. Yet we are paying £25,000 for suggestions of that kind. If the commission would justify the spending of this money it should deliver the goods, but it is not doing so. An item of £3,000 placed on the Estimates to cover the expense of preparing special reports by the investigating officers. Special reports, if the term means anything at all, should cover unforeseen items, but no such items are enumerated, and no explanation has been given of this amount, which increases the expenditure from £25,000 to £28,000. There is another item of £14,900 for the establishment of farm training depots in which to train immigrants brought from overseas. We have tens of thousands of young men in Australia now, well trained by their fathers to take up farming, but they are unable to obtain suitable land. There are scores of applicants for every block of land which is thrown open, and yet the Government proposes , to establish farms to train boys and men from overseas. letters every week from practical farmers and their sons inquiring for land. of it. Here is an item of £4,000 for training domestics brought here as immigrants. Where is that training being done, and what is the justification for the expenditure? No answer has been received to these queries. Further, the sum of £11,310 is to be devoted as a subsidy to voluntary organizations for the aftercare of migrants. The Prime Minister has told us that the duty of these organizations is to see that the migrants are effectively settled. I maintain that no such thing is being done as effectively settling the great majority of immiThose grants. These organizations provide two suggestions. most of the immigrants upon arrival with work in the country. When that work "" cuts out"" in a few weeks, or a few months, the newcomers are turned adrift, and nobody is any longer concerned with their after-care. There are more immigrants in the industrial suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney than in the country districts of Australia. Yet the voluntary organizations are drawing subsidies to the extent of £11,310, while the immigrants are walking the streets looking for work. Here is an item for which no satisfactory reason was given, although I asked for one. Why has the salary paid to the Development and Migration Commissioners increased from £9,262 in 1926 to £13,250 in 1928-29? What is the reason for this increase of £4,000? So far as I know, there has been no increase in the number of Commissioners, and if there has,there ought not to have been. was a member of the commission he drew no salary. between 1926-27 and the present time to increase the salary expenditure by £4,000? appointed in Mr Nathan's place, and this man is drawing a salary. member for Warringah justify the payment of £13,250 to the four Commissioners?Unfortunately this amount comes under Appropriation, and we cannot vote against it. can move a reduction of the item of £42,000 odd for salaries, &c, and by that means can protest against the salary payments to the Commissioners. do that, and we shall then see whether the honourable member for Warringah will vote against the item of which he does not approve.

145,Mr Scullin,"Very well, we shallcompleted its work an advisory committee of one man, Senator Millen, was appointed. When he had finished, three other investigating officers were appointed, and they were given £600. All these items were questioned. I do not say that the expenditure is not justifiable, allowance of £2,000, except by saying but some explanation should have been given regarding it. No answer has been given to the criticism that £30,000 was paid last year for royal commissions and another £6,000 for a commission to the Dnited States of America. This Government has spent £36,000 in one year for investigating commissions, apart from the permanent boards and commissions to which it has handed over administrative work. No attempt has been made to justify this expenditure. The Prime Minister calls these matters petty details, although they mean an expenditure ia the aggregate of half a million. The sum of £2,216 was spent on the visit of the Secretary of State for the Dominions, Mr Amery, and the Prime Minister expressed pained surprise that I should raise this matter, because Mr Amery was the guest of the Commonwealth. I take no exception to the visitor being entertained at a dinner at Canberra, but one dinner does not explain an expenditure of over £2,000. ners in Mr Amery's honor. On the samepage as that on which this item appears, I notice that £1,000 is provided for relieving distress among returned soldiers and unemployed. There are not many big dinners for them. I have already referred to the allowance paid to the Governor General, and asked why £2,000 is to be granted to him, because of his having to live at Canberra. I also .inquired why repairs to Government Houses during the year were estimated to cost £26,600. The Prime Minister furnished me with the same answer to the two inquiries. He said that £26,000 was provided for ""repairs, fittings, furniture, lighting, &c,"" at the Government Houses in Melbourne,. Sydney and Canberra. It does not cost the Governor General much more to live in Canberra than bourne. A long story was made about the two years' delay iu handing over the Government House in Melbourne to the State authorities; but the Prime Minister has not attempted to justify the increase in the salary of the Governor General by granting a Canberra that this Parliament ordered the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra. I might mention that it also ordered the removal of a large number of public servants, some of whom are paid as little as £39 per annum to enable them to meet the extra cost of living here. I do not know whether honourable members have a right to discuss all the items mentioned under the Prime Minister's Department. I daresay that if I insisted on my rights I could deal with individual items just as the Prime Minister did. Since he has been in office, he has had a. strong desire to be well informed about international affairs, and he has said that he is much assisted by having certain officers in London in close touch with the British Foreign Office. He mentioned this afternoon that files are kept in the foreign affairs branch of'his department relating to all matters of international moment, and if a change of government took place, the new Ministry could immediately make itself familiar with matters of Imperial foreign policy. I point out that important communications between the British Government and a dominion government on matters of foreign policy are invariably made direct from Minister to Minister, and it seems to me that Australia could be kept as well informed through being supplied with copies of documents by the British Foreign Oflice as by having a special representative there. There should be an interchange of information between the British and the dominion office. This would save a good deal of expense. I notice on one page that the salary provided for the liaison officer in Great Britain has been increased from £882 to £906, but on the opposite page I see that this officer and a clerk are to receive a "" cost of living "" allowance of £312 and a ""livin g away from home"" allowance to live in Melof £165, bringing the total expenditure to £1,383. The Government may ask why",55,Prime Minister S Department

148,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [5.36],"honourable members should trouble about small items such as these, but taken in the aggregate they amount to enormous sums. In matters of public finance we should remember that if we take care of the pence the pounds will take care of themselves. A sum is provided for "" advertising in Great Britain."" I should not mind if that were the only expenditure incurred under that heading, but the High Commissioner's oflice costs between £60,000 and £70,000 although each State has an Agent-General with a staff in London and agencies throughout the United Kingdom. Talk about advertising Australia! The Prime Minister has been twice to the Old Country in four years. Of his colleagues, past and present, the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson), Sir .George Pearce, the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), ex-Senator Sir Victor Wilson, and Senators Sir William Glasgow and McLachlan, have made trips to the other side of the world. Eight of the twelve Ministers have been abroad, as well as Mr Gepp, Chairman of the Developmentand Migration Commission, and Mr Julius, Chairman of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research;they are poor representatives indeed if they have not been able to advertise the Commonwealth. like Australia to be governed from the other side of the world. show that tendency, but all danger of that sort was removed years ago by the early radicals. Reference has been made to the visits to Australia of Mr Amery, Secretary of State for the Dominions, Sir Robert Horne, and Sir Henry Cowan. In addition, the Empire Parliamentary Association assembled in Australia representatives of all the parliaments of the British Dominions. A strong delegation from the -motherof parliaments included Lord Salisbury, representing the British Government, and Mr Arthur Henderson, representing the British Labour party. Prominent bankers, including one of the head men in the Bank of England, have been to Australia in recent years, and now the Commonwealth is to be involved in further expenditure in connection with the visit of "" the Big Four,"" who are to teach us how to run the country. It is time we accepted our responsibilities, as did Australia's political pioneers. They did not search here and there for experts to do their job, but took the responsibility upon themselves. To-day the duties of Federal Ministers are farmed out to irresponsible individuals. Boards and commissions are appointed, and sometimes investigations and reports are duplicated and even quadrupled. The Development and Migration Commission visited Tasmania, and, at considerable expense to the people of that State and the ' Commonwealth, prepared reports which well-informed citizens declare disclose nothing which was not already known. What is the use of republishing at heavy cost information which is already in the possession of Federal and State departments? Many of the reports prepared at great expense of money, time and labour, are either pigeon-holed or thrown into the waste-paper basket. The fact will be disclosed sooner or later that the report of one commission which was travelling and taking evidence throughout Australia for four months has been discarded.and ignored and a body of experts has been paid high fees to evolve a scheme of national insurance for presentation to this Parliament. It is high time that this wasteful expenditure was discontinued. It is all very well to talk of the need for entertaining distinguished visitors and housing luxuriously the Governor General, the Prime Minister, and the High Commissioner, but such expenditure. is not fair to the general public at.a time when thousands of our own brothers and sisters are without even a crust. The halls of Australia should resound with denunciation of the wicked extravagance practised by this Government ever since it has been in oflice. Some of the items on the Estimates amaze me, and I hope that honourable members will avail themselves of this opportunity to thoroughly probe them. The honourable member for Swan ""( Mr Gregory), the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), and other honourable members opposite^ have trenchantly criticized the financial proposals",56,Prime Minister S Department
149,Mr E. Riley,'Some of them would,57,Prime Minister S Department
150,Mr Fenton,"Some people doof the Government. I am waiting to hear more from them. want to let their constituents know of making of the Commonwealth finances the opportunity is presented to them now. Perhaps out of the abundance of their wisdom they may be able to give me some guidance. The honourable member for Henty, who professes to be a student of finance, has gone so far as to apply to the Treasurer epithets for which he might well have been called to order. Looking through the Estimates, I see evidence of the expenditure of many thousands of pounds to obtain information that is already in the possession of Government departments. I wonder why high-salaried officers are appointed with expensive staffs at this time of financial stringency. Despite the fact that last year ended with a deficit of £2,600,000, and that there is a prospect of a further deficit in the coming financial year, the Government is not attempting to make up the leeway, and the Prime Minister lightly glosses over the financial defects pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition. The committee should be satisfied with nothing less than a complete scrutiny and explanation of every detail in the Estimates, so that honourable members may have sufficient knowledge to record an intelligent vote for or against them. The Prime Minister, with an air of omniscience, gave to the committee all the information he considered necessary, but the Leader of the Opposition drew attention to many items, amounting to thousands of pounds, in regard to which the right honourable gentleman had not uttered one word of explanation. Even if the majority of honourable members are satisfied with the Government's management of the finances, I am certain their constituents will not be. I propose.to refer briefly to the High Commissioner's office, the conduct of which came under my observation when I was in London. The first impression of an Australian visitor to Australia House is that the atmosphere of it is not different ship to return spends the time in reading from that of any other London building except the offices of the High Commissioners of other dominions. It certainly lacks an Australian atmosphere. At the the sum of £26,790, which appears in the inquiry counter of the migration office If they one meets clerks who have never visited Australia, and apparently have not read the mess the Government is about it. I say nothing derogatory of Sir Granville Ryrie. Despite his love of inordinate military display, and his tendency to be what a former member of this House called "" a gilt spurred rooster,"" he is, I believe, animated by true Australian sentiments. On that account, I approve of his appointment; but I met only three prominent Australian officials at Australia House, namely, Mr Trumble, formerly of the Defence -Department; Mr Caruccan; and a gentleman in the library, whose name I do not recollect. An Australian is first met by a so-called entertainments officer, whose principal duty appears to be to balance his monocle on the side of his face, and whose chief concern is to get the upper class Australians into English society. He exhibits a remarkable degree of discrimination. Unless one adopts the Cambridge accent, which is affected by one or two honourable members who sit in this chamber-in effectively, in my opinion-on e has no chance of getting into society. I could not help being struck by the deep distress in the voice of this gentleman during the course of a conversation that he was holding over the telephone, because a wretched Australian had attended a King's levee, or something of the sort, in full dress uniform, but had forgotten his sword. The whole assemblage was in a ferment because of the forgetfulness of a "" heathen"" from a distant place called Australia, which this gentleman has never seen. The sooner the office is staffed with Australians who are imbued with the Australian spirit the better. There is a different atmosphere in the office of the High Commissioner for Canada. There, the majority of the employees are Canadian born, and endeavour to instil into callers Canadian ideals. It is no wonder that, when the average unsophisticated Australian encounters this entertainments officer, he or she feels unworthy to enter and take part in the high life of society, and gravitates to the library, is given common sense advice by the excellent official there, and while waiting for the Australian newspapers. I wish to learn the directions in which",57,Prime Minister S Department
151,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [5.58],"estimates for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, is to be spent. I am aware, of course, that investigations have been, made in regard to entomology in Australia. Those officers to whom is delegated the duty of investigating scientific subjects are worthy men, and possess high attainments. Prime Minister to explain the position in regard to the entomological inquiries into the buffalo fly pest, which has taken such a heavy toll of the cattle in the Kimberley district and the Northern Territory. Mr Government must first show a willingMurnane, who is a very capable officer, went .up there, but although he made a lengthy inquiry he was unable to discover a parasite which would destroy the buffalo fly. ""We have been told that the Kimberley horse disease was caused by the horses eating what is known as white wood, and that a remedy for it has been discovered. been in the district for 30 or 40 years and-immodestly , from the point of view of the department-clai m to possess some knowledge of the country, say that horses on the Moola Bulla station, which has white wood growing all over it, are immune from the disease, and that white wood is a special diet with them. These matters ought to be explained by the Prime Minister, who apparently is the only gentleman in this Parliament who possesses a knowledge of the subject. The right honourable gentleman attempted to justify the appointment of the Development and Migration Commission by saying that wonderful results had accrued, and that large sums had been saved, in consequence of its inquiry into the gold-mining industry. I have the greatest respect for the attainments of the chairman of the commission, Mr Gepp; but I point out that this is the age of specialists, and no man, no matter how talented he may be, can pretend to have a general all-round knowledge of a large number of subjects. Mr Gepp's knowledge of other matters may be profound, but of gold-mining he knows absolutely nothing. It cannot be expected, therefore, that he can make a final pronouncement touching the reasons for the decline of gold-mining in this country, and the methods that should be adopted to rehabilitate it. As might have been expected in the circumstances, his summing Sir. A. Green. up of the position has proved most disappointing to those who are acquainted with the industry. A report was called for on the 28th August, 1926, and was furnished to the Government on the 31st May last. Those who are interested in the gold-mining industry expected to be I should like the supplied with a Valuable recommendation. But only two or three proposals have been advanced, and by no stretch of the imagination can they be expected to assist the industry. In any event, the ness to give effect to them. One of the most promising gold developments in Australia has taken place in the Willuna country, which is practically in the centre of Western Australia. A syndicate has been formed, with capital from not only Australia but also London and South Africa. The South Africans are But old timers who have very shrewd men in mining matters. The sum of £200,000 was spent on a pilot plant, not to deal with the ore, but to demonstrate what scheme is necessary to work the immense bodies of ore that arc known to be present. After a trial extending over a period of two years, these men are satisfied that the ore can be worked pofitably. It is now proposed to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds upon machinery, and plans are being prepared of the plant that will be necessary. If the Government will adopt the first recommendation of the Development and Migration Commission, it can assist this proposition. These men have written repeatedly to both Mr Gepp and the Prime Minister, asking that the Government should forego the duty on the machinery if it has to be imported, or bear the additional cost if it can be manufactured in Australia. Such a proposal does not clash with our protectionist policy. If the Australian manufacturer can manufacture the machinery required for the development of this great goldmining proposition, of which there is no parallel in Australia, he will be given the work, so long as the Commonwealth Government is prepared to pay the difference between the cost of the Australian and the imported article. The commission has made that recommendation in regard to new ' gold-mining machinery that may be required anywhere in Australia. I sincerely hope that the Government will announce its readiness to give effect to this recommendation, and that the machinery will be made in Australia by Australian workmenl I wrote to the Prime Minister recently on the subject, and I hope that before I leave Canberra my efforts will he crowned with success. Of the eleven recommendations of the commission, this is the only one worthwhile. There is some reference to special assistance being given from the £36,000 left over from the precious metals prospecting fund. We well remember the passage of that act. The then Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Marr), doubtless filled with enthusiasm and energy, thought that it would assist the gold-mining industry. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. speech I was dealing with the arrangements made at the High Commissioner's office in London for the reception of Australian visitors. High Commissioner himself is an Australian of a fine type, and imbued with the spirit of Australian nationalism; but unfortunately his office is staffed with persons other than Australians. Most of the officers know nothing of this country, and Australian visitors making inquiries there can obtain no reliable information. It is our duty as Australian patriots to appoint Australians to the High Commissioner's office. At present only three Australians, including the High Commissioner, are in that office. The entertainments officer is an absolute scream. He wears a monocle. He was transferred by the late Prime Minister to Australia for a brief period, but he took the earliest opportunity to return to London to mingle with the bright lights of society. This gentleman interests himself in entertaining only those persons who, he considers, are of the upper strata, and by that I mean the social climber. He speaks with an accent reminiscent of Cambridge, which is seldom used in Australia except by one or two members of this chamber. The average Australian visitor is repulsed by this gentleman's haughty manner. The High Commissioner's office is in a splendid position, and it should be staffed with Australians. The Canadian and New* Zealand offices are staffed with officers who ledge ; but I submit that this is an age of were born in those countries, and they therefore are able to give authentic information to visitors. I wish now to refer to entomological investigations, for which an amount of £26,790 is set down. The item does not appear in any previous year know from the Prime Minister what Mr Murnane's duties were when he visited the northern part of Western Australia. He is an excellent officer, but I have never been able to find out the result of his inquiries. I know that his investigation switched from the Buffalo fly pest to the Kimberly horse disease. He told the old-timers there that the Kimberly horse disease was caused through the horses in that district feeding on white wood, a plant which abounds in that part of Australia. It is well known that white wood The grows in abundance on the Moola Bulla station in the interior. The horses feed freely on it, in fact, it is their.staff of life. Yet the Kimberly horse disease is unknown on that station. I understand that parasites were brought out from Great Britain to prey on the Buffalo fly. When they arrived at Melbourne they were found to be of the wrong species, and prompt measures were taken to destroy them. I wish to know whether an effective means has been discovered of countering the Buffalo fly pest. The Prime Minister, in an endeavour to justify the appointment of the Development and Migration Commission, stated that its report on the gold-mining industry contained some very valuable information. I would remind him that this investigation began on the 28.th August, 1926, and the report was in the hands of the Government on the 31st May last. Nothing has since been done to give effect to any of the recommendations of the commission. The Prime Minister said that its report showed that the gold-mining industry did not require financial assistance ; that the industry must fend for itself by the mines amalgamating and dispensing with the duplication of staffs and. plant. Honourable members will agree that Mr Gepp, the chairman of the commission, is a man of considerable know-",58,Prime Minister S Department

When the Prime Minister suggested that no financial assistance was required, I presume that he had at the back of his mind the agitation which has been going on for some time for a bounty on gold. That was not mentioned in the report? I have heard the right honourable gentleman say that it would be uneconomic to assist the gold-mining industry by granting a bounty on production. That could be applied to every industry in Australia in connection with which a bounty is paid. It could be applied to the doradillo grape industry. Most industries in Australia are assisted either by a bounty or by a protective tariff. I suppose that the -Japanese are as shrewd as any other people in the world. To stabilize the currency of Japan, that great empire decided to produce her own gold. Small quantities of gold had been found there, but the ore was of poor grade, and unpayable, so for years that country has given a bounty of 25 per cent, on the production of gold. The report of the Development and Migration Commission suggests-only one real reform, and that is in regard to the remission of duties on mining machinery. It is suggested that if the machinery cannot be manufactured in Australia it should be imported free of duty, and that if it can be manufactured in Australia the difference between the cost here and abroad should be met by the Commonwealth Government. The Wiluna goldmine is the most promising show in Western Australia. The company has already expended £200,000 on a plant to be used in ascertaining whether the ore is payable, and it is on the eve of expending £800,000 on other equipment. According to a bulletin of recent date, the company also proposes to install a plant to treat 40,000 tons of ore a month. There are millions of tons of ore exposed in one portion of the mine. This company has prepared a list of its machinery requirements, and has written asking for information. I trust that the Prime Minister will, in this case, agree to a remission of duty. Mr A. Oreen. The Government has appointed a liaison officer in London for the purpose of in forming its mind on European developments. It is really a semi-ambassadorial office, following on the lines of European custom. Whilei t may be necessary for European Governments to watch the affairs of other countries, that is not necessary so far as Australia is concerned. This officer has little need for informing the Government of what is happening in Persia, Germany, or any other country. We consider that an expenditure of £1,000 is too little for any benefit to be derived from this source. I move That the item ""Liaison Officer {London} £906 "" be omitted. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [8.15] -The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A.

The report, in so far as it affects the Kalgoorlie area, is based upon the report of these expert gentlemen. I do not propose to follow the honourable member into a discussion upon the economic merits or demerits of a gold bounty, but I must correct the wrong impression which he seems to entertain, that I said that there was no way in which financial assistance could be given to the gold-mining industry. gentleman said that he had a bounty on gold in mind. perfectly clear and definite to even the should discuss individual officers on the honourable gentleman's constituents in floor of this chamber.

It was only when we received such a sharp lesson upon the outbreak of the war, and found that at any time we might be involved in a life and death struggle without having any sufficient information on the subject, that we, in common with the other self-governing dominions, felt it necessary to take steps to guard against such an eventuality. It will be realized that it is not sufficient to have simply current information on any serious question of foreign policy. The whole' history of a subject , is needed to enable a sound judgwould agree to any reduction in this ment to be formed upon it . In the last four years we have built up in Australia as complete a set of records on foreign matters as is to be found in any other part of the Empire. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that these records should be made available to honourable members. I can assure him and honourable members generally, that if they desire information on any matter of foreign policy, and apply to the External Affairs branch of my department for it, the fullest particulars will be made available to them.

The expenditure on that agency is extraordinarily low. Mr Voss has been acting in Paris since just after the war, and I am sure that no Australian who has come into touch with him in Paris amount. All Australians, whether they have travelled to Paris for pleasure, or for the purpose of establishing commercial relations, have been received with courtesy, and afforded every possible assistance by Mr Voss. The advice of such visitors would, I feel sure, be to increase this amount rather than reduce it . I was in London in 1926, and had an opportunity of meeting the liaison"" officer who has been referred to in the course of this discussion. I am quite satisfied from what I saw of him, and as a result of the discussions I had with the High Commissioner, that this officer is rendering valuable service to Australia.

If we were to have a discriminating inquiry as to who are the nicest people, and entitled to be received at Australia House and who are members of hoi polloi, the Australian democracy, and should not be received there, I should be sorry indeed to see the honourable member for Warringah constituted the judge. much chance for the honourable member in that case. what I realize. visitors at Australia House would then proceed on party lines.

I have heard this evening that most of the officers employed at Canada House are Canadian born, while many of those at Australia House are English born and monocle trained.

The principle involved possibly affects a very large been in the department for two years. I number of men. Mr Franklin, a returned soldier, was employed in the department for two years, and then was summarily dismissed on the ground that his war service had not been satisfactory. The facts are that this man served in the field for four years and was wounded at Villers Bretonneaux and Pozieres, and surely any unsatisfactory feature of his war service is offset by the fact that he was twice wounded and is in receipt of a pension of £1 Is. per week. I understand that the only blemish on his record is that he was absent without leave for 60 days, but he reported back in France for duty. No fair-minded man would tolerate the administration of the preference to soldiers regulation with such harshness as to regard 60 days absence without leave as unsatisfactory service, disqualifying the offender for public employment. The Repatriation Department did not consider that Franklin's misdemeanor disqualified him for a gratuity and the other privileges given to returned soldiers on their discharge. I brought this matter under the notice of the Chairman of the Public Service Board( Mr Skewes); the only reply I received was that the preference to returned soldiers was confined to persons who enlisted prior to 11th November, 1918, 'and served in the war with a satisfactory record.

That is true; it was not disturbed until he had appeal to the Prime Minister to direct the Public Service Board not to interpret the regulations in such a harsh manner as to cause the dismissal of a married returned soldier with a family at a time when unemployment is particularly acute. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [9.14] I have no knowledge of the circumstances of this case, but 1 shall inquire of the Public Service Board as to the principle upon which it is operating the regulation providing for pn fererice to returned soldiers.""

Those privileges were not extended to his predecessors. In addition to the allowance for the expenses of official residence, he is to receive an allowance of £650 for its upkeep. Those two items are new. I suppose that next year, if this Government remains in power, we shall find still more perquisites attached to the position of H i g h Commissioner.

205,Mr Brennan (Batman) [ 9 . 4 5 ],"IAmerica really represented Australia there. The suggestion is that he is something more than a trade commissioner. When I asked by interjection whether he was an ambassador, the Prime Minister replied-that he was not, and said in effect that it was contrary to the policy of the Government to appoint persons to ambassadorial positions. In the circumstances, I should like to know exactly what duties this officer is expected to perform. One of the most amazing claims made by the Prime Minister was that the retention of this office had some effect cut down public expenditure where it can in maintaining world peace. My reading of history teaches me that the boosting of trade by one country against another has never made for peace, but has frequently had the opposite effect. Most of us have heard of trade wars. It has not been shown, so far, that we are justified in spending £3,000 in-salary for this officer. There has been sufficient time to prove the usefulness or otherwise of the position. I submit that no benefits to Australia have come from the appointment. "" The goods,"" so to speak, "" have not been delivered."" We could begin to cut down expenditure by agreeing to my amendment. It is idle for the Prime Minister to reply to the criticism of specific items of expenditure by generalities. That gets us nowhere. In the critical state of our finances we should not be talking high falutin nonsense about keeping Australia's name before the public. Australia is on the map, and we should endeavour to develop her resources in a practical way. Then, in due time, she would become a centre of attraction, and it would not be necessary for her to hang on to the coat tails of old-world, civilizafactures, the position from our point of tion. This is an item upon which the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) could show his desire for economy. He and some other honourable members opposite have talked a good deal about cutting down expenses. I suggest that the time has arrived to cease talking and begin voting. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) has also had a lot to say about economy. Perhaps he, remembering the homely advice that he must have had at his mother's knee, to the effect that if we look after the pennies the pounds will look after themselves, might well look after these few pence, to wit, £3,000. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) is also a financial reformer and he may give us his vote. There would be nothing to he ashamed of in voting with the Labour* party to secure some substantial economies. So far honourable members on this side of the committee, being in a minority, have not been able to work their will in these financial matters, but with a clear conscience and in a good cause they intend to persist in their endeavours to be done without ill-effect to the general"" community. It may be quite true that the Commissioner in the United States of America has gathered a distinguished social circle about him, but so far as I can learn he has done nothing to foster Australian trade or to improve Australia's standing in America. Consequently I confidently ask honourable members opposite who believe in economy to vote for my amendment. support the amendment. So far six different persons have held this office, and none of them has been able to make a success of it. Our trade balance with America is on the wrong side. We are importing a great deal from America, but sending very little there. I noticed in a Melbourne paper last week, that although sultanas are £61 per ton in Australia they , are only £45 per ton in America. America is a primary producing country. Her methods and machinery are thoroughly up to date, and we have very little prospect of developing a big business with her in primary products. When it comes to secondary manuview is still worse. In these circumstances it is a waste of money for us to appoint a trade commissioner. Such an officer is not needed simply to assist Australian visitors to find their way about the United States of America, for there is a bureau in New York which can do infinitely more for visitors from Australia than an Australian Commissioner can do for' them. We have no Commissioner in the United States of America at the present time, and Australia is losing nothing in his absence. If it is not necessary to",69,Pairs
206,Mr West (East Sydney) [9>53],"I have a commissioner there now, why not cut out this item altogether? Perhaps the Government is keeping the position open for one of its disappointed supporters. The last commissioner, Sir Hugh Denison, made an elaborate report suggesting that the office should be turned into an ambassadorship, so as to give him a glorified position-somethin g wholly at variance with Australian sentiment. Even the Prime Minister apparently did not believe that there was any need for such an ornamental oflice. The Government would be very wise not to involve Australia in this unnecessary expenditure. The High Commissionership in London is a very different thing from the position of commissioner in New York. Here is a chance for honourable members on the other side to join with us in preventtion which the Prime Minister-the only ing the wasteful expenditure of this money at a time when the country is facing a deficit of £2,600,000. Why do we need a commissioner in the United States pf America? The Americans do not want our trade. They are a self-contained community, and I hope that we shall try to emulate them in the high standard of living which they have obtained. [10.5] -It is instructive to notice how these motions for reductions are following one another to-night. So far as I can understand it, the attitude of honourable members opposite is that Australia should have no representative anywhere overseas.. It was suggested first of all that the liaison officer attached to the Foreign Office was quite an unnecessary person. It has been moved that the finanoverseas should be able to do justice to cial adviser in London, Mr Collins, who is a very able financier, should be withdrawn from Great Britain, or at least that his salary should not be paid. Part of the allowances for the High Commissioner were to be cut out, and Australia's representative in Paris was not to be paid. coming closer together. I was astonished Now it is proposed that the Australian representative in the United States of America should also be done away with. I suggest that the total amount which it is proposed to save by these means does not exceed £10,000 a year. The amount on the Estimates for the financial adviser is £2,000, the allowance for the High Commissioner £2,000, and the amount for the representative in Paris £975. additional sums being voted on this occasion. muneration for the Australian Commissioner in the United States of America is put down at £3,000 and £2,000. At the present time no such oflicial exists, and unless one is appointed there will he no expenditure under this head. I admit that the High Commissioner's salary is not included in the sum of £10,000 which I have mentioned, nor yet is the cost of the lease of his house. It remains true, however, that for about £10,000 a year we are obtaining informaperson who can know its worth-ha s told us is of the highest value. As our representatives in America we have for years had men who have ranked among the leading citizens of Australia. The High Commissioner has been getting allowances which enable him to entertain on a proper scale. It is known to every one in Australia, except those who do not want to know, that it is extraordinarily difficult to get suitable persons to accept these positions. Do honourable members opposite seriously suggest that we should send to other parts of the world representatives who could not afford to carry out their duties in. a manner which would do credit to Australia ? Are they to receive entertainment from the countries to which they are accredited, and not return that hospitality? It is essential that any one sent his position, and to the country which he represents. It is particularly important at the present time that we should be represented in other countries. Everybody knows that the nations of the world have, during the last few years, been to hear the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), whom I have always regarded as an advocate of peace, suggesting that we should cease to be represented in the United States of America.

When that commissioner was appointed, the one justification for the appoinment was that he would represent the commercial interests of this country. It is denied that he is an ambassador, and no one can say what he is. One would think that honourable members opposite were not Australians. In what way has this country sponged on Britain? has taken up arms it has been done to assist Britain. It has stood to its obligathat on every other item that was chaltions and has sponged on nobody. It is time honourable members opposite displayed an Australian sentiment, instead of forgetting their own country and always looking across the seas. If we wish to preserve the silken thread that binds us to the British family of nations let us encourage sound sentiment. The commissioner to the United States of America was appointed as a trade commissioner, and when we ask the Government to justify the appointment we are told that he is not a trade commissioner. It is not proposed to fill the vacant position for six months. If this officer is of use to Australia, can we afford to leave the position vacant for so long? Does the honourable member for Boothby( Mr here and £3,000 there, but they have Duncan-Hughes) imagine that the representative of Australia in the United States of America would be invitedto take part in discussions there on matters of peace? gest that. member twitted the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) with betraying the principles of peace for which he stood in moving for a reduction in this item. I invite the honourable member for Boothby to endeavour to justify his vote to increase large salaries, thus causing ever-mounting expenditure. justify the Canberra allowance of £2,000 for the Governor General, who spends only a few weeks in the year here, while public servants who have to live here continuously receive an allowance of only £39? Can he justify the expenditure of over £26,000 for furniture, fittings and upkeep of the Government Houses, when £70,000 has already been spent in additions to Yarralumla, in view of the deficit and the reduction of expenditure on public works which has thrown thousands of men out of work? The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) invited me to join him in voting to strike out the item relating to the commissionerto the United States of America. I regret that I cannot accept his kind invitation. When the loan estimates were under consideration I voted against two items, and I then said lenged I would oppose the expenditure unless the Government could justify it. In this particular instance I am satisfied with the explanation given by the Prime Minister. I take leave to doubt the sincerity of the desire for economy expressed by honourable members of the Opposition, in view of the fact that to-day the trade of Australia is being held up and dislocated by a handful of supporters of the honourable gentlemen opposite, without one word of protest from them. members talk about cutting out £2,000 nothing to say against a section of their followers who are causing Australia losses running into over £1,000,000. -The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has assured us that, if any proposed expenditure cannot be justified by the Government, he will honourable vote for a reduction in the items. I wish to help the honourable member to vote according to his conscience, because I know how sincere he is in matters of this kind.

I visited the office in New York when the Commissioner was there, having several matters to bring under its notice, and on every occasion Mr Dow was the officer with whom I had to deal. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Bruce, S. M . Duncan-Hughes) must realize that whatever fripperies are considered necessary in the Old Country, they can he dispensed with to advantage in the United States of America. The representative of that country never used to present himself at Buckingham Palace in court dres3. The people of that democratic country are not impressed by useless displays of finery. They admire plain men like Abraham Lincoln, the rail splitter, and Garfield, the canal boy-gian t intellects that have come from the ranks of the workers. On several occasions, when Parliament sat in Melbourne, the honourable member for Boothby voted against increases in the invalid and old-age pension on the ground of the expense involved.

I propose to justify the amendment hy a review of the tremendous growth that has taken place in the expenditure of this department. In the Estimates for 192425 the sum of £63,000 was provided. Subsequent Estimates contained the. following provision:£ 1925-26 .. .. .. 03,000 1020-27 1027-28 .. 102S-20 It will thus be seen that this year's proposed vote is more than double that for 1924-25. As the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has pointed out, the expenses are approaching such an excessive figure that we should draw the attention of the Government to the seriousness of the position and demand that a halt be called. If ever there was a time for the reduction of a vote dealing with immigration matters, it surelv is the present, when we have such a large army of persons in Australia who are unable to find employment or obtain the necessaries of life. I feel that I am acting in accordance with public feeling in the Commonwealth. The people are becoming alarmed at the tremendous sums involved in the administration of, and the investigations conducted by those who to-day are in charge of migration matters in the Commonwealth Excessive expenditure is being incurred not only in Australia, but also in London. We have to wipe off the very heavy deficit referred to by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) in his budget sneech, and the outlook is not so promising as we should like it to be. I therefore, commend to the committee the proposal that this vote be reduced by £50,000. Such an action on our part would be a practical demonstration of our desire to effect economies and put right the finances of the country. wish to discuss one or two items in connection with the Development and Migration Commission. This body has been investigating a number of problems in [265] Australia, one being the problem of unemployment. It has been stated by honorwealth Government has been responsible for bringing assisted migrants to this country. From time to time this charge has been levelled against the Govern* ment, and it has always been refuted. The fact is that assisted migrants are being brought here by the Commonwealth Government at the request of the State Governments.

I mention that fact to show that the Labour Government of New South Wales was responsible for bringing miners into this country to add to the unemployment on the coal-fields. true. The honourable member is out of order. true, and it must be a very unpleasant, and strong pill for honourable members opposite to swallow. Recently the Development and Migration Commission investigated the dried fruits industry. Its report on that industry has been of great value to the growers, and they are trying to give effect to a number of the commission's recommendations. I suggest that an investigation should also be made of the wine industry. Recently the wine bounty was reduced, and members who opposed that reduction stated at the time that a critical position would inevitably arise. Unfortunately that position has arisen. It is therefore the duty of this Parliament to give the growers some relief. ThisI think might best be accomplished by the Development, and Migration Commissiou making a thorough investigation of the",75,Prime Minister S Department

237,Mr Parsons,"The statement isindustry. At the time of the reduction of the bounty it was prophesied that the export of wine would cease. I find from information supplied to me by the Prime Minister last week that the export of wine for the three months ending the 31st August last year was 2,032,766 gallons, and for the corresponding period this year, 227,762 gallons, and most of this was contracted for before the bounty reduction took place. The Berri distillery in South Australia has 300,000 gallons of wine unsold. Mr Hugo Gramp, of Messrs. G. Gramp and Sons has informed me that he cannot sell a gallon of wine. The co-operative distillery at Griffith, in ment. New South Wales, has 70,000 gallons of wine for sale and cannot sell one gallon. member is discussing a subject that is berepeat what I said previously. During yond the scope of the item before the comthe time that the Lang Government held mittee. item of £25,000 for investigation. I consider that the wine industry should be investigated by the Development and M i gration Commission, and I am giving my reasons for that. honourable member reserve his remarks until the Customs Department is under consideration. is in a grave position. Millions of pounds have been expended in settling returned soldiers on the river Murray and elsewhere, and unless some assistance is given to them they will be ruined, and their blocks abandoned, and the consequent loss to the Commonwealth will be enormous. I was not present in the chamber during the early part of the remarks of the honourable member for Angas( Mr form household duties. The GovernParsons), but I gathered from what I heard that he accuses Mr Baddeley, an ex-Minister of the Government of New South Wales, of being responsible for bringing into Australia a number of miners, and in that way adding to the unemployment on the coal-fields. The -honourable member has falsely accused a gentleman who is unable to defend himself. member for Angas is untrue. Mr Baddeley was Minister of Mines he went to England and advised the miners there of the bad conditions obtaining on the coal-fields of New South Wales. He visited other countries and obtained the latest information on coal-mining with a view to improving the position of the industry here. Neither he nor the Labour Government of that time was associated with the immigration policy of the Commonwealth. I advise the honourable member for Angas to be sure of his facts before he again attempts to make a vile accusation against a prominent member of the New South Wales Parliathe enlightenment of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) I shall office 1,243 miners came to Australia as assisted migrants, and Mr Baddeley, the then Minister for Mines, and Mr Lang, the Premier, endorsed the nomination papers of those miners. They came out here under the State migration policy, and their advent necessarily helped to swell the unemployment on the coal-fields. I wish to refer to the item providing £4,000 for training domestic servants. It has always appeared to me that girls and young women should naturally be able to undertake domestic duties. We might just as well put on the Estimates a sum of £1,000 for teaching boys to learn cricket and football. Every boy knows how to play football, just as every girl should know how t« perform the ordinary domestic duties of the household. This expenditure is not justified. The whole proposal is ridiculous. I had eight daughters and every one of them naturally learnt how to perment should not spend a large sum in training young women in domestic work.

245,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Minsaid then. The figure which should hare been used in comparison with the expenditure for the year 1924-25, is not £76,000. I spoke at some length about the £25,000 set down for ""Investigations."" There are additional amounts here which are not comparable with the original expenditure. I have indicated the views of the Government, and it is now for the committee to express its opinion. I advise the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) not to make a big point during his election campaign of the folly of bringing properly-trained domestic servants to Australia, because if he does he may find himself in a diffiamendment. cult position, (hie of the greatest needs of the wives of our outback settlers is domestic help. The object of this training is to ensure that the girls who come to Australia shall be capable of performing ordinary domestic dnties. There is no suggestion that training shall be given in the higher branches of domestic asked a question a few days ago of the science.

The reply which I received to my 81 question was to the effect that bricks were sold to private citizens at the commis18 sion's kiln for £5 5s. a 1,000, and not £6 5s. a 1,000. That would create the impression that the retail price in Canberra Riley, E. is only £5 5s. a 1,000. I obtained a copy Scullin, J.
