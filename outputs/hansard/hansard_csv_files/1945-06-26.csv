It is just over two years -since I have had any leave, and my friends ii nd myself have seen units come and go, and still we seem to be kept on hero. I don't want you to think I am complaining, but I do feel that leave could be arranged, as other chaps around and about us seem to be able to get away on leave drafts. Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Army state whether the practice of granting leave to troops in New Guinea has broken down? Why should a member of any unit in New Guinea have been without leave for 23 months? shortage of shipping, difficulty is experienced in giving leave to men from New Guinea on the scale decided on by Cabinet, but I was not aware that men had served in that area for such a long period as a year and eleven months without having had any leave at all. If the honourable member will supply to me the name of the individual to whom he has referred, and tell me tlie unit with which he is connected, I shall take up the matter with the Acting Minister for the Army and ascertain whether any relief can be afforded. Br. GAHA -A t the outbreak of war, a shipping passenger service operated between Hobart and Sydney, but it was necessary to discontinue it in the interests of the war effort. In view of the fact that there is now no direct air service between Sydney and Hobart, and as compliance with my request would not prejudice any private company, will the Government consider immediately instituting a daily air service between Sydney and Hobart via Canberra and Flinders Island, as such a service would fulfil an urgent public need, and at the same time provide an improved air service to the Australian National Capital and demonstrate the Government's capacity to give a first-class air passenger service to the Australian people? there is no direct shipping service between Hobart and Sydney, but there is a fairly frequent air service between Sydney and Hobart via Melbourne. There is also an air service which touches at both Flinders Island and King Island en route to Launceston and Hobart. In view of the original suggestion made by the honourable member, I shall have it examined, in order to find out whether a service of a satisfactory kind could be provided on the lines desired by him. But I point out that services already giving full satisfaction could not be interfered with, without serious consideration being given to the matter. of the Minister for Air been drawn to press reports of an accident at Geraldton to an aircraft on the civil service of Western Australian Airways?

It would not be advisable to broadcast information as to weather conditions over the whole of the Australian continent, although it may be possible to do so in respect of areas far removed from any sphere in which Japanese aircraft can now operate.

If it is possible for me to improve the education of anybody in this country or abroad, I shall be only too happy to do so. Information say whether it is correct, as reported in to-day's press, that the Australian National Films Board proposes to obtain a chief production manager from overseas, and, if so, does he not think that that is a reflection on Australian professional men? Are there not sional men capable of doing this work, instead of having to bring a man from overseas? Is the Minister aware that there is a general complaint by profes sional men generally that standards of remuneration in Australia are too low, and that the policy of various governments seems to be to ignore the claims of local men and to appoint persons from overseas to professional positions in this country ? newspaper paragraph on which the honourable member's question is based. The engagement of an executive officer to the Australian National Films Board and a producer to work under his direction involves considerations that do not arise in any other branch of film production in this country. The Government desires to bring to Australia for a limited period two persons to teach Australians the technique of documentary film production. .So far, no documentary films have been produced in Australia, and, therefore, it is necessary to obtain the services of persons with experience in that sphere of activity. When they have finished their work here they will go back to the country from which they came, and their places will be taken by Australians. It is not a matter of bringing people here to fill permanent positions. that they shall go back; but the proposal is that they shall be engaged only for a short period, at salaries which will attract the best persons available in such countries as Canada and Great Britain. The production of documentary films should not be confused with the making of films for theatrical purposes. In the latter class of work many Australians are experienced, but, as yet, Australians have not the knowledge necessiary to perform the work that is proposed to be undertaken by the Australian National Films Board. In the steps that it has already taken, the Government has acted on the advice of competent authorities, and the honourable member may rest assured that the results will be satisfactory. considerable concern among property owners of moderate and small means because of the depreciation of wooden buildings in Queensland owing to a shortage of paint.

In any case, the Government would be entitled to break its promise, and I say that on the authority of many prominent British statesmen and others who have never supported the Labour party.

I Therefore, it ill-becomes gentlemen of the same political beliefs to accuse the or the Government of sinning in this way. I Honourable members opposite have said from that the.Labour party was responsible for It is ridiculous Australia going off the gold standard and that the Government should take firms action to restore it . I sincerely trust Parliament that Australia w ill never return to the gold standard, which, as the Acting to Parliament and, in fact, Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said, -is a hollow, meaningless, sham. Gold Therefore, the protests may be a convenient medium for paying Among the protests international debts or for carrying on external trade, but it is of absolutely no -value to our internal economy. We They ought to say very ought to leave our gold in the ground. banking. Many lives have been lost in digging it out of holes, and more have been lost in putting it back into other holes. The general When Mr Theodore was Treasurer of the Commonwealth he brought down a b ill providing for a fiduciary note issue, he has not been which was passed by this House but We have rejected by the Senate. It was looked upon by the Government's opponents as promises. a terrible measure. They claimed that notes should not be issued without some real backing. The truth is that there never has been any real backing to our note issue. A t the best of times, the .banks have held in gold not more than 33 per cent, of the total value of our currency. When the present Australian High Commissioner in London, Mr Bruce, was Treasurer in the Lyons Government he introduced a bill for the transportation overseas of our gold reserve. would have removed from the face of our currency the lying promise to pay in gold, on demand-, the face value of each note. The then Speaker of this House called me to order for using iicli words, but, although they : were not parliamentary, they were true. The great bulk of the Commonwealth's gold reserves was in bar form anyhow, and could not have been exchanged for notes. Tn any case, only one-third of the currency issue could have been redeemed. When I. asked the then Treasurer what backing was to be used in place of gold, he answered, "" British sterling "". British sterling is another myth. The only true backing to our currency is the wealth producing capacity of the people. ' There can be no other substantial backing to any currency. In fact, 97 per cent, of our currency is in the form of "" cheque pounds"", and that is backed mostly by the mortgaged properties of poor people. When Mr Theodore was Treasurer there was violent opposition to a measure 'providing for the exportation of £5,000,000 worth of gold to meet certain Commonwealth obligations that had fallen due in London. On that occasion the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) and the late Mr Lyons were running about with their hands in. the air deploring the proposal. Mr Lyons came out of the party room into the lobby and said, "" I declare to my God that T will never be a party to transporting irold out of tbe country. The nation will be ruined; its credit will be gone "". But not lone after that gentleman became Prime Minister a bill was introduced by Mr Bruce to transport all of our gold overseas, and neither the right honourable member for Cowper nor Mr Lyons voiced any protest: They said nothing about the danger to our overseas credit. There was a time, I believe, when the Government of the United States of America said that it did not want any more gold. It had too much of it. in vaults. been left in the ground in the first place. The Government was well advised in introducing this bill. I wish it had done so I then asked whether he sooner. The Opposition's attitude to this measure reminds me of the days of the Scullin Government, when the Senate brought Sir Robert Gibson before it to ask him whether it would be safe to export £5,000,000 worth of gold. His answer to the question was clear. He said, "" Yes. So long as the Parliament accepts the responsibility of reducing the amount of gold backing to the note issue the transaction will be in order'""'. That gold was exported, and later the Lyons Government exported the remainder of our gold, and nobody worried about it. Not many people knew how much gold we held in Australia, and fewer cared whether it was sent out of the country or not. The masses of the people have never been able to obtain sufficient money to provide themselves with the things which are necessary for decent living conditions. There is no need for anybody to worry about this bill. It is a good measure, and I hope that it will be the means of providing cheap money to the primary producers and others engaged in worth-while productive work. We have been told that the bill can lead to inflation. That is a matter of theory. One positive result will be the assisting of our primary and secondary producers, particularly the small men, to function successfully, which is essential to the prosperity of the nation. They w ill not receive financial assistance unless they provide security, but, so long as their security is worthwhile and the work in which they are engaged is important, the cheaper they can borrow money from the bank the better it will be for the nation.

73,Mr Martens,"It ought .to haveboard. The town of Gordonvale, which is now in the Kennedy electorate, but was then in the district had no branch of the Commonwealth Bank. On behalf of a number of people in the district, who desired that a branch of the bank be established there, I made representations to the Commonwealth Bank authorities, only to receive the stereotyped reply that ample banking facilities to meet all reasonable requirements already existed in the town. That, reply was given despite the fact that tbe only banking facilities in Gordonvale at the time were a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, in the local post office, and agencies of two nrivate banks -I think the Bank of New South Wales and the Queensland National Bank. I then got in touch with Sir Ernest Riddell, tbe then Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and arranged for an interview. Riddell called Mr Armitage, the present Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, into the room. I told them of the banking facilities which existed, in Gordonvale and emphasized that the two private banking agencies operated only on two days in each week, and then for only two hours each day. I pointed out that there were a big sugar mill and a number of fairly large businesses in the district, and that the existing banking facilities were not at all adequate. After further conversation, I suggested that Mr Armitage should visit, Gordonvale to ascertain the facts. My suggestion was tage confirmed what I had said. Thereupon, Sir Ernest Riddell said that the Commonwealth Bank could not establish a branch at Gordonvale until it bad ascertained whether tbe two private banks which had agencies in the town were prepared to establish branches there. They then established branches which still remain. No branch of the Commonwealth Bank has been opened in that town. That has happened in other places also. It is idle to say that a person with an account at one bank can easily transfer it to another bank. monwealth Bank has refused to make advances to men who have asked for financial accommodation until such time as the local manager got in touch with Mr Martens. the banks with which they had previously dealt. On numerous occasions branch of Herbert, managers of the Commonwealth Bank have told prospective customers that, although they believed that advances to them would be justified, they could not make them available unless the private banks with which they had previously dealt refused to do so. In many instances, branch managers of the Commonwealth Bank have recommended to managers of private banks that advances should be made; and if those private institutions then agreed to make money available, the Commonwealth Bank took no further action. That policy is wrong. I should like to see a branch of the Commonwealth Bank established in every town in which the Governor of that institution thinks a branch should be established. I do not favour a decision being made by a board which takes into account During our talk, Sir Ernest. the effect that the establishment of a branch of the Commonwealth Bank would have on private banks. In my opinion, this country owes very little to its private banks. If the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to make money available to people who need it. at rates of interest which are lower than those charged by the private banks, and if the private banks come into line and reduce their interest charges, they need not fear that they will be nationalized. No one is anxious to nationalize the banks, because that would mean purchasing their assets. I believe that an expansion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank would not seriously affect the men now employed in private banks, because men with their training and experience would be taken over by the Commonwealth Bank. Their services would be of value to the community and I trust that they will be treated fairly, but I do not believe that banking is such an intricate science as some persons would have us believe. I hope that the Commonwealth Bank will in future be the institution that its founders intended it to be. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) said that under this The Combill all that a person would have to do would be to ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for so much money and he would receive it. That is nonsense. When the late Sir Denison",25,Bankingb Ill 1945 Second Reading
74,"Acted Upon, And In His Report, Mr Armi","Miller was Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, he told a deputation that, if the Parliament would accept the responsibility, he was prepared to make money available for constructive purposes as freely as it was made available during the war of 1914-18 for purposes of destruction. I firmly believe that if money can be provided for war it can be provided in peace-time to construct assets of value to the nation. Men of the calibre of Sir Denison Miller can do these things if Parliament accepts the responsibility. Robert Gibson was Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, he was called to the bar of the Senate where he said that if the Parliament would accept the responsibility, the bank, could make money available for various purposes. In my opinion, the responsibility for such things should rest with the Parliament; it should not be vested in any other authority. I believe that "" finance is government and government is finance "", and that those who control thefinancesof the country also control its government. Any person who has studied the history of the "" old lady of Threadneedlestreet"" knows that Disraeli told the Governor of the Bank of England on a number of occasions when the Government of Great Britain wanted money, "" Go away and make the necessary arrangements. money"". During the last two or three hundred years', large sums of money have been borrowed by the British Government from the Rothschild family. In the aggregate hundreds of millions of pounds have been borrowed from members of that family, but only a. small proportion of it has been repaid. That money was obtained because wars had to be paid for. No one will claim that the cost of the present war is being met by taxes extracted from the people. Money for war purposes has been released in Australia through the banks, particularly the Commonwealth Bank. If money can be made available in war-time for purposes of destruction, it can be made available in peace-time for reproductive works which will constitute a national asset. Surely no one will argue that money cannot be provided after the war to build homes for the people, to establish irrigation schemes, to supply electric power to the community and for similar purposes. Surely such undertakings as the locking of our rivers to provide water for irrigation purposes, and the harnessing of falls for the generation of electric power, are matters for which money should be forthcoming at low rates of interest. Unless this legislation means' that such things will be done, it will be of little value. I believe that the proposals of the Government will be beneficial to Australia, and When the late Sir that if money is released to local governing bodies, big industrial concerns and other authorities for build.ing homes and constructing works of a reproductive character it will be of great benefit to Australia generally. If we are to have in this country people willing to fight for it because they believe in it, the better their living conditions the better they will fight. I sincerely trust that they will not have to fight, but I have no illusions. This war, like that of 1914-18 and all other wars down tbe centuries, has been fought to save democracy, and for the establishment of a new order, but, now that Germany has been defeated and the war against Japan is receding farther from Australia and nearer Japan, the attitude of honourable gentlemen opposite, despite their earlier brave promises of a better democracy, is, "" We need not worry We must have the about a new order to any extent ""[Quorum formed.} [4.16] The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens), like other honourable gentlemen on the Government side, said, in effect, that this bill did not make for the nationalization of banking. -Order!

As honourable gentlemen opposite have said repeatedly, it puts the complete control of banking in the hands of the people. Therefore, under their own policy, they claim that they can socialize industry by controlling the banks. We have been saying that ever since the debate on the Commonwealth Bank Bill and this bill started. The Labour policy continues2. "" Nationalization of banking "". 3. ""The Abolition of the Commonwealth Maiik Board"". The Bank Board is to be abolished when (lie Commonwealth Bank Bill, which we have already passed, becomes law4.

There we have the complete policy of the Labour party with regard to banking under the heading "" Socialization of Industry"". gentlemen opposite say that this bill is not intended to nationalize banking, 1 take it that they are talking in the wider sense and mean that it is intended not only to nationalize banking, and that, indeed, under their own platform, it is intended to socialize industry completely. I place on record that fact so that there .shall be no doubt in the public mind as to what is intended under these bills. I do so because of the various denials of honourable gentlemen opposite of what we claim will be done under this legislation. had attempted to socialize Australia, said, This being the policy of the Australian "" We do not intend to do it just because we Labour party, all that was needed to -ire at war . . .

I ask the House to note that no I ask honourable members to take notice mention was made of a banking policy of that, because, in my opinion, it was in the policy speech of the Prime a definite attempt to mislead the public Minister( Mr Curtin). The Australian by a vague promise as to the GovernLabour party federal conference was held ment's intention, and by failure to get Mr Harrison. in Melbourne in December, 1943-that was four months after the last federal general elections. It gave the Government firm instructions to proceed with the party's banking programme. Tbe immediate steps laid down by this conference were(1) That the provisions of the National Security (War-time Banking Control) Begulations be resolved' into legislation. That is being done under these two bills(2) That the legislation secure(o) That the Commonwealth Bank is in complete control of the banking system. Again honourable members will note that that is aimed at in these bills(6) That the Commonwealth Bank be subservient to the Government. Under a direction from the Australian Labour party conference, these things are to be brought about under the two measures ' now before Parliament. So that there shall be no doubt about the authenticity of this direction I state my source of information as The Official Beyort of Proceedings of lQlh CommonThere you have the complete set-up: the policy of the Labour party, which aims at complete socialization of industry; a direction given by the Australian Labour party conference that that Therefore, when honourable policy shall be given immediate effect; and, in Parliament, two bills introduced to give legislative effect to that policy. Honourable members will remember the controversy that raged around the "" No socialization"" pledge of the Prime Minister at the last general elections. The Sydney Morning Herald, on the 1st May, 1943-and I direct attention to the fact that that, paper was giving at that juncture the maximum support to the Labour party-said Mr Curtin, denying that the Government restraints and adjustments as we make will made only because they arc necessary effecn uiaiidate from the people. important also to place on record that on the 12th May the Sydney Morning Herald saidShortly after Mr Curtin hail made this statement That is the statement to which I referred, that there would be no socialization of industry in time of warMr Ward, then Minister for Labour, said in Western Australia that banking and insurance should be nationalized if Labour had control of both federal Houses after the election.

The article continuedWhen this statement was referred to Mr to the danger of handing over too much Curtin, he replied that it had no Cabinet sanction. Asked whether the Government would, if returned to power, consider itself bound for the next three years by the programme which would be defined in its policy speech, Mr tive in time of war. During an emerCurtin said that it would. That was clear and unequivocal. It is equally clear that no proposnls to interfere with the Australian banking structure were included in the programme defined in the Government's policy speech. Endecd, there was no indication in the policy speech that the banking structure would be altered during the life of the present Parliament. Therefore, when the people of this country cast their votes at that election, they were entirely unaware of the Government's intention in regard to banking. The direction was not given to the Prime Minister until four months after the elections, prior to which the right honourable gentleman had stated unequivocally that no attempt would be made by his Government to do other than implement the programme outlined in his policy speech, and that, nationalizationor socialization would not be undertaken during the war. That was the assurance of the Prime Minister of this country, and there could not be any higher pledge in the political field than that; but the promise has been hroken It is deliberately by the Prime Minister and his supporters. H ad the people of this country any suspicion that the Prime Minister's promise would not be kept, they would have refused to return the Labour Government, just as they refused at the recent referendum to hand over certain powers to the Commonwealth. The introduction of this legislation, despite the Prime Minister's promise, may be considered smart politics by honourable members opposite; but is it honest? I suggest that it is not honest; it is a political confidence trick in the worse sense of the term. I s it any wonder that the people of this country view w it h suspicion any statement of a political nature Of course I am. made by the Government? I am not concerned with any declaration by the Acting Prime Minister, or by any other honor ah e member opposite, of the Govern1 ment's intentions in regard to this legislation. I am concerned only with the powers which these bills embody, and I am sorry the by whom they are likely to be exercised. I agree with all that has been said by Opposition speakers in regard power to the Executive. I am not so foolish as not to realize that it is necessary to hand over great powers to the Execugency, a government must exercise many economic controls, and must even im.posi: industrial conscription, in a modified form at least. But because of the effect of such controls on"" the natural expansion of industry and the civil freedom of the people, they should not be retained for one moment longer than is necessary. This bill is designed for peace-time purposes and under the National Security Act, most of the powers which it contains are already in the hands of the Government or may be exercised by the Government if it so desires. Therefore, if parliamentary institutions are to continue, we, as members of Parliament, must consider very carefully what powers we hand over to the Executive to be exercised in time of peace.

81,Mr Harrison,"should people of this country furiously to think before granting to any government the power sought under this bill. Make no mistake; the power embodied in this bill is complete. It w ill enable any government to change our entire economic and industrial way of life. Indeed, it could change this democracy of ours into a highly socialized state. I have already quoted the policy of the Labour party in regard to the socialization of industry and banking. I s it not the intention of the Government, directed by the Australian Labour Party Conference, to socialize industry, first by assuming complete control of the financial institutions of this country? Clauses 16 to 22 of this measure, which l i m it the funds private trading banks may lend, are symptomatic of the control that is likely to be exercised over borrowing. Borrowers who are not able to secure from the private banks the financial accommodation that they require-the assets of the private banks have been frozen at the 1939 level, or in fact, 25 per cent, below that level because of the depreciation of the value of the currency w ill be forced to go to the Commonwealth Bank. The policy of the trading banks in lending the limited funds which will be left to them, is restricted by clauses 27 and 28, thus completing the control. Before we pass legislation aimed at tbe strangulation of the trading banks and the demolition of the entire structure built by them, we should consider whether or not these institutions are essential to our financial system. As all honourable members are aware, a royal commission inquired into the monetary and banking systems of this country and reported to Parliament. Extracts from the report of that commission have been read from time to time in this chamber, [ndeed the Government claims that this legislation is based largely on that report. Chifley), who was a member of the commission, dissented from paragraph 669 of the report which I am about to quote, but that does not make it any less forcef u l . It statesThe view of the Commission . . . is that the most desirable banking system in the present circumstances of Australia is one Mr Harrison. cause Parliament and the which includes privately-owned trading banks. The system which we contemplate is one in which a strong central bank regulates the volume of credit, and pays some attention to its distribution. We are of opinion that the adoption of our recommendations will place the Commonwealth Bank in that position. We are satisfied to have the distribution of credit to privately-owned trading banks, working foi profit, but regulated in the manner indicated in our recommendations. A strong central bank, publicly owned, and not dominated by the desire to make profit, will exercise the necessary control over the activities of the trading hanks, aud the organization of these banks on a profit-making basis will conduce to efficiency while the area of choice afforded to borrowers will be greater than if all banking were nationalized and brought under one control. We think that in this way the national interest will best be served. A f t e r making an exhaustive inquiry into the financial system, the royal commission's report declared beyond any douibt that trading banks are essential in Australia. The report also contained the recommendation that the powers of the central bank should be made stronger, and that it. should exercise control on a non-profit basis-it should be the "" big brother "" of the banking system. I find no f a u l t with that suggestion, and if honourable, members are true to their interpretation of the royal commission's r e port, they w ill agree. The opinion of the royal commission concerning trading banks has been underlined by the choic? that industry has made of the banks in which to make deposits and from which to obtain loans. In December last, the Sydney Morning Herald published a statement showing the aggregate of assets and liabilities of nine trading banks. It revealed that the deposits for the twelve months ended October had increased by £74,000,000, while those ol the Commonwealth Bank for the same period had increased iby only £14,000,000. Clause 48 effectively bludgeons local governing bodies into submission, bin it is noticeable that in the past they have chosen the private banks for their business. The huge excess of deposits The present Treasurer ( Mr in private banks over those in the Commonwealth Bank shows where the confidence of the trading community is reposed. The flexibility of trading banks is preferred to the rigidity now exercised by the Commonwealth Bank in its trading relations. According to all indices in the trading community, the private banking system appears to be satisfactory, and that backs up completely the royal commission's question: If trading banks are satisfactory, why change the system? . The only reason I can find for the change is the direction given by the sixteenth conference of the Australian Labour party that the policy of socialization of industry should be implemented. I shall not traverse all the clauses in the bill, because there will be opportunity to deal with them fully in committee. The control of borrowing is dealt with in clauses 16 to 22 and clauses 27 and 28. ft appears that the special account mechanism provided in clause 18 enables the Commonwealth Bank to limit f r iending of trading bank funds to pre-war levels. I have already pointed out that as money value has altered, those levels would be 25 per cent, or 27 per cent, less than present-day values. That means that, the business of many borrowers will be diverted to the Commonwealth Bank. According to sub-clause -1. and 2 of clause 27, however, the Commonwealth Bank will authorize advances by the banks only in conformity with the Government's current policy. The sub-clauses provide( ] . ) Where tlie Commonwealth Bank is -<atisfled that it is necessary or expedient to tated the strike were merely warned thai do so in the public interest, the Commonwealth Bank may determine the policy in relation to advances to be followed by banks and each bank shall follow the policy .so determined. (2.) Without limiting the generality of the last-preceding sub-section the Commonwealth Bank may give directions as to the classes of purposes for which advances may or may not he made by banks and each bank shall comply with any directions so given. fn each case the penalty imposed for the contravention of those provisions is £1,000. If the bill means what it says, then, under tbe conditions laid down, loans for special purposes may be made by the Commonwealth Bank to special classes of borrowers. For example, a special class of borrower might, be a trade union-suc h as one of those constituting the conference which gave directions that this banking policy should be enacted. "" barrel "" of clause 27. With the other "" barrel"" the Commonwealth Bank will be able to "" bring down"" those classes of borrowers who can get , advances from trading banks, and the trading banks will not be able to resist any interference. Recently, the Minister for Labour and National Services( Mr Holloway) stated, in reference to the strike of certain employees of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited in Melbourne, that it was time the company was brought under control. If a direction were given to the trading banks forbidding further advances for the purposes of sugar processing, the control visualized by the Minister would become effective. "" sugar "" at all! bers opposite may contend that what 1 have stated is not the intention of the Government; nevertheless the power is contained in the bill for such control to be exercised. In the light of the Government's policy, and the directions it has given the Government will certainly exercise those powers. Who would have thought that the Government would have used its war-time powers to penalize employers? Recently, however, because a mine-owner obeyed the law, his coal mine was taken over by the Government, and the mine deputies who precipiif they did not resume work within a certain time they would be prosecuted. They were allowed to work on a holiday which fell on a Monday after the Government's warning had been issued and for which they received double pay-bu t they resumed their strike on the following day in spite of the fact that that mine was then under government control! Who would have thought that the powers possessed by any responsible governmeni would have been exercised in such an illegal and unjust manner? In the light of that event, it is only logical to assume that when the powers contained in thif bill are placed in the hands of the Government it will exercise them also witb equal injustice. By exercising control over borrowing, the Government will be So much for the first able to take to itself power which the people at the last referendum denied to it.

83,Mr Harrison,"Honorabl e memCommonwealth elections, but on the contrary gave the assurance that his party, if returned to power, would not nationalize or socialize an industry in time of war, in that respect repudiating a statement that had been made in Western Australia by the Minister for Transport ( Mr industry, than there are in a country Ward). Although no mandate was sought or given, the Government now proposes to nationalize banking, and thus take Australia a long way towards socialization. Individual liberty is to be circumscribed, because the Government will be able to insist that an industry which seeks financial accommodation shall undertake to give preference to unionists in its employment. man should write fairy stories. obviously, does not understand the nature of the power that will be given to the Government by the bill. Does he deny that socialization of industry is a plank in the platform of the Labour party, that four weeks after the last elections the annual conference of that party directed the Government to legislate in that way, and that that policy is being given effect in the banking bills? Correct answers to those questions will show whether or not I am right. Clause 13 is designed to permit the Commonwealth Bank to assume control of private banks after they have been financially weakened. The machinery for that purpose is complete. [ have said that the Commonwealth Bank will issue directions; but the Governor of the bank will himself be directed by tbe Treasurer, who is a senior member of the Government, and, in consequence, there will be political control of banking. T have endeavoured to show that nationalization of banking will do more than merely enable the Government to control financial institutions. Its aim is to socialize industry. There is one other matter that exercises my mind, and it should exercise tbe mind of every other honourable member. What effect will this legislation have upon the introduction of foreign capital for post-war development, and unon migration generally? The object of a migrant is to peenre greater opportunities in tbe country to which'he proposes to migrate. Therefore, if the opportunities are greater in Australia than in other countries, migrants will be attracted here. That is fundamental, as well as logically sound. I cannot visualize greater opportunities in Australia under government control of finance and the threat to socialize that is controlled almost exclusively according to the principles of private enterprise. The Commonwealth Statistician's figures show that in Australia there are 525,000 government employees and 1,250,000 employees in private enterprises. That number of government employees is a fairly high proportion in a population of 7,000,000. What would be the prospects of a migrant who obtained government employment, which implies the stifling of free enterprise, initiative, and all the other qualities which make for better citizenship and a degree of independence? Could a migrant view with equanimity the prospect --f his employment being controlled by the Government? What opportunity will there be for a man of ability and enterprise? honourable member must deal with the bill. which I am referring is closely related to the bill. The whole of tlie financial, industrial and economic structure of this country is to be altered. I consider that, I am entitled to discuss the possible effects on our overseas markets, foreign exchange, and the variety of other subjects which are related to the national economy. Surely the population of Australia is a vital factor; and if it is likely to be affected by this legislation, are we not entitled to draw attention to that fact? From the nationalization of banking will emerge a government-managed industrial structure, and a policy of jobs for political supporters. Therefore, a migrant would have little opportunity to make progress in this country unless he became an active political supporter of the party in power. The Government is even insisting that ex-servicemen shall join unions before they will be entitled to employment. How much more would that apply to migrants, who, it is claimed, would undermine the labour structure.",31,Bankingb Ill 1945 Second Reading

87,Mr Harrison,"The matter toLot us now consider the position of a man who has capital to invest. Is he likely to come to Australia? From 1930 to $14,000,000,000, mostly from Europe, was received into the United States of America. It has been pointed out to me that bad Australia received of that sum a proportion commensurate with its population, the amount would have been £220,000,000, which is equal to three times the total amount of shareholders' funds in all the trading banks. I understand that the total output of the Australian steel industry-the industry^ of is about 1,500,000 tons. pansion in five years of the steel industry of the United States of America, resulting from the great flow of refugee money into that country, was more than forty times the total Australian production. Surely that should give honourable members food for thought! Will we not markedly prejudice the development of Australia and the expansion of our industries by preventing investment, and scaring away foreign capital as the result of our control of the currency? Surely we should consider the attraction of not only migrants but also foreign capital 1 The one cannot be attracted without the other. Under the control of finance and banking, the tendency will be to scare away investment. attempting to prove that the expansion of the American steel industry during the war has been due to the use of refugee money. That is a fallacious argument. ing facts. America gives every encouragement to investment. We should attract capital by the means that it adopts. investment capital in the last five years.

Further proof of it is given in addresses over the air from most of the capitalistcontrolled broadcasting stations and in the speeches made in this Parliament by members of the Opposition parties. From wherever the political agents of vested interests are found assembled tirades of abuse and unjust criticism are hurled with ever increasing bitterness against the Labour party. The immediate objective of this campaign, of course, is to prejudice and inflame th<= minds of the people against the Labour Government. In Australia we have now reached an important phase of our social and political life, when we must determine definitely, for many years to come, whether this community shall continue to progress on sound democratic lines, or be soon overwhelmed by yet another period of exploitation by the forces of reaction and conservatism.

93,Mr Puller (Hume) [6.1],"I-since the most critical period of the war, when the responsibility of saving the nation from destruction devolved upon a Labour Administration. The Government has shown judgment and foresight, and has displayed a determination to give effect wherever possible 'to the democratic policy since embodied in the Atlantic Charter, which has been the noble objective of the Labour movement. Should this bill be rejected, there is nothing surer tban a re-occurrence of the depression experienced a comparatively few years ago. When a so-called depression overwhelms the community many people lose all that they possess-'businesses , investments, homes, jobs, everything. Poverty and misery stalk the land. Incomes are reduced, or cease altogether. There are fewer people to buy the products of industry, and industry will not produce what it cannot sell. Unemployment is rife, and many people who believed that their position was safe find that their security has vanished. Many elderly people who have taken the precaution to ensure for themselves a reasonable income in the evening of their lives become dependent on the old-age-pension in order to keep body and soul together. Youths reach manhood without obtaining employment. Young people desiring to marry are unable to do so. Women become aged before they should have ceased being young. Little children suffer from malnutrition. That is a euphenistic way to describe semi-starvation. A few days ago I heard the honoraible member for Balaclava ( Mr White) say that, in 193S, only 10 per cent, of the people of this country were unemployed, but how can that statement be reconciled with the following comments by the author of a booklet entitled Money, the Question of the Age:During the 1937 federal election, Mr W. M. Hughes, then federal Minister for Health, said: "" The function of government is to govern for the good of the governed"". is an answer to the question, "" Have we good government?"" tion and our industrial years ago, the present condition of the people may have reflected good government then, but thi6 is 1938, not 1018. Our real standards of living have not improved in that time. On the contrary, they have worsened. You would hardly find an ill-nourished child in those days, but what is the position now? Mr Fuller. In an address to the Millions Club a few months prior to those elections, Mr Hughe* stated that 40 per cent, of the 2,000,000 children in Australia, of an under-school age. were suffering malnutrition; 800,000 children were in a state of ill health due to the lack of nourishing food. If the present bill does not become law, Australia will return to the dark days of the depression, when factory machine? rusted, wheat rotted in the silos, and fruit was buried. Our standard of health, once our proud boast, then deteriorated to that of a third-rate people. Yet there was no shortage of materials. The people still had the will to work and were in dire need of the products of the farms and factories. It was a financial depression. All depressions are man made, and they must be man-cured. The community was short of nothing bui money. Business people could not sell goods, because the people did not have enough money with which to buy them. After all, what is money? Apart from the spinelessness of governments iu financial matters, which has strengthened the hand of the banker, his power over the community arises from the very faults' which cause depressions. It is not surprising that the bankers themselves refuse to correct them. From the community's point of view, the chief faults of the banking system arise from the fact that it releases money only as an interest-bearing debt. Nobody ever gets money from it on loan in any other way. Not only is the principal, which must be repaid, a debt, but the money required to pay the interest is also in the first instance an interest-bearing debt to somebody in the community. We are expected to pay back in principal and interest more than the sum issued. We are set the task of trying to borrow ourselves out of debt, -but that cannot be done. Therefore, it is essential that this bill shall be placed on the statute-hook. Mr C. S. Sheperd, chief stipendiary Their condition magistrate of Sydney, when retiring in September, 1936, made an interesting On our standards of producstatement from his desk at the Central power of twenty Police Court. In an interview with a representative of the Sydney Sun, he statedThe principal cause of crime, great and small, is poverty. That is the big thing which 26 years on the bench has shown me. In nearly every case I have handled in that time there has been the one great reasona man has done something because lie had no money. Kill poverty and you kill crime. The most tragic cases 1 have ever had t'j handle-the ones that move me most-ar e those of the men who never had a chance. Brought up in a criminal environment aud chained by poverty, they go astray, but the fault is not altogether theirs. Whilst our wealth and the capacity to -create even greater wealth-the things man needs for his sustenance and happiness-hav e increased enormously, the standard of living of the people as a whole has not been raised in keeping w i th that increase, but has actually declined. Another article which I propose to quote shows the need for the transformation of the Commonwealth Bankf r o m a bankers' bank to a people's bank. It statesIn 1912 the Commonwealth Bank was formed under the Governorship of Sir Denison Miller, on an overdraft of only £10,000, and no other backing except confidence in the Australian people. Its profit to 30th June, 1938 (including Note Issue), was £33,594,949, ana this was returned to the Nation as its absolute property. In 1924 the Bank was effectively strangled (this means Dead) by the Government in office, and the Bank was changed from a People's Bank to a Bankers' Bank. Prior to 1924 Sir Denison Miller, Governor of the Bank, financed the East-West Railway out of the profits of the Bank, built the Perth Post Office, assisted tbe farmers of West Australia, and prevented a depression in Australia in 1920; also financed fruit industries to the extent of £11,500,000, and financed Australia during the last war for £350.000,000. The Bank also found £4,000,000 for Australian homes and lent £9,360,000 to Local Government bodies for constructional work. It paid profits to the Commonwealth of £3,000,000, and by 1924 it made £4,500,000 further profit available for the redemption of the debt of the Commonwealth. On the 25th November, 1938, an attempt was made to complete a 15-3'ear plan to deprive the people of Australia of the power to control the money supply of this country by introducing the Commonwealth Bank Act Amendment Bill. The plan was t.i sell the Bank's debentures to private interests. This plan was defeated by the upsurge of public opinion and the outcry and protest of the electors. If the Commonwealth Bank had not been as effectively strangled as it was in 1924 and had been permitted to function as it did at the commencement of its career, Australia would have been helped over the Years of Depression a» it was helped over the war period (191-11918). Many prosperous business firms woul.l have been saved from ruin and somewhere about one-third charity. Neither would all the people have to submit to the ruinous debt and taxation burden imposed upon them to-day, for Sir Denison Miller said at a function in his honour"" I have found 350 millions for war, and I would find 350 millions just as easy for the act of peace if called upon t<do so."" To-day, the Commonwealth Government with a majority in both Houses, has the powei under Section 5.1 of the Constitution Act tireinstate the Commonwealth Bank to function under the original charter, and to release tin people from the dictation of the private bank ing monopoly and their counterparts of Debi and Taxation. That is what is proposed in the bill. I believe that this legislation w ill be a beacon light showing the way towards the haven of social security. I compliment the Treasurer on the vast amount of work that he has devoted to its preparation, and I proclaim that I am mighty proud to be a supporter of the Government which has produced it . It will prove to be an instrument whereby future generations will secure freedom from want to such a degree that other nations w ill emulate our example. We shall help to mould the new world of the future which, I hope, will be free from fear. [5.18] -This bill is rather important and I have no doubt that the Government is anxious to rush it through the committee stage and have it placed on the statute-hook. The Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini), who is usually in charge of the measure, is temporarily absent in order, I suppose, thai he may return refreshed to the fray in committee and tell us about the bill, even though his remarks may be confined to one statement, namely, that "" the clause means what it says"". The honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) produced some familiar arguments, wbich are as false as they are old. He said that the construction of the East-West railway was financed by the Commonwealth Bank. If the honourable gentleman is interested enough, I shall supply him with a brochure setting out tbe correspondence between certain people in Sydney and the Commonwealth Bank, in which the bank stated emphatically and categorically that it did none of the thing which the honourable gentleman has alleged that it did. The East-West railway was paid for out of .revenue and loans. The rate of interest on the loans, and the amount which",33,Bankingb Ill 1945 Second Reading
94,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"was provided annually from taxation, are set out in the brochure. The bank states without equivocation that it provided not one brass farthing towards the cost of the work. able member says. that is what the bank says. Furthermore, the bank also states that it did not provide any of the war loans of the last war. It acted as the agent of the Commonwealth Government, at a fee, in raising loans from the public. That is true. It is time that some of these ancient lies were nailed down. Honourable members who support the Government should not be entitled to make such misstatements, whether deliberately or otherwise. I hope that they do not do so deliberately, but if their knowledge of the history of Australian finance is to be gauged by their misstatements, their ignorance of Australian history-and recent history at that-is of such a nature that they are not qualified to occupy seats in this chamber. The objective of the Government in introducing this legislation is clearly to place all banks, and probably all banking business, under the control of the Commonwealth Bank. That means, as bas been argued and later admitted, that it intends to place the banks under the control of the Treasurer. Under the political set-up that exists to-day, the Treasurer is responsible to a very powerful, though sometimes recalcitrant, caucus. It is interesting that the bill contains no definition of "" banking business"", although it refers to "" banking business "", "" general banking business "", and "" any banking business"". ought to step off on the right foot by telling us exactly what it means by "" banking business "". When discussing the Commonwealth Bank Bill, I referred to the position of the stock firms of Australia, and of some of the co-operative societies which are lenders and borrowers of money, and which operate with cheques, accept money on fixed deposits and conduct current accounts. As this bill stands, it is too dangerous to be allowed to become operative. If it be passed in its present form, it will contain absolutely no definition of "" banking business "", and the Minister assisting the Treasurer may speak truthfully when he tells us, in the committee stages, that the clauses mean what they say. They will mean exactly what the Minister wants them to mean. Without a definition, the various references to "" banking business "" as the Government considers fit. When a term is defined, limitations are immediately placed upon it. By defining it, certain boundaries are laid down and certain matters which will arise will fall outside those boundaries. For this reason, I want the Government, for once in its life, to make a clear statement of what it means by ""banking business "". The next matter of grave concern is the new order under which all banks, other than the Commonwealth Bank, will operate when the bill becomes law. I have studied the bill very carefully for the second time within the last few days, and I have noticed that certain restrictions will be placed upon the private banks. I do not apologize for speaking for the private banks. Some of them are Australian institutions and some are partlyowned overseas, but they all furnish a service which the people of Australia appreciate, as they have shown by the extent to which they have placed their business with them in preference to the Commonwealth Bank. native. where they have an alternative, they go to the private banks. Consider towns where branches of the Commonwealth The Government Bank and the private banks are operating side by side. Mount Gambier, in my electorate, one of the few places in South. Australia outside Adelaide where the Commonwealth Bank has a branch, has six or seven bank branches. I am sure that the business done by the Commonwealth Bank in that place is much smaller than that done by any other bank. change their accounts because the private banks have a stranglehold on them. honourable gentleman ought to confine his attention to reading about Goldilocks",35,Bankingb Ill 1945 Second Reading

I know enough about the banking system to be able to assure the honourable gentleman that there are plenty of accounts which the trading banks would be quite happy to hand over. The fact is that the customers are not anxious to leave the trading banks and go to the Commonwealth Bank. I shall now refer to the most outstanding things that will happen to the trading banks under this legislation. Under -clause 27 the banks must conform to the Commonwealth Bank's policy. That is one of the most important items. Special war-time accounts will become permanent .accounts with the Commonwealth Bank, -and the private banks will not be able to withdraw their money except with the consent of the Commonwealth Bank. The lodgement of special deposits-that is, new profits-is provided for in clause 20. ""Foreign exchange must be delivered to the Commonwealth Bank on demand, according to clause 23. The trading banks will be prevented, by clause 28, from investing in Commonwealth, State, or local government securities, or in any other security listed on -the Stock Exchange. They will be forced to submit to exchange control by -clause 29. They shall cease to pay gold, -export it or hold it, under Part IV . They -shall pay interest by Commonwealth -direction. In other words, the rates of interest will be fixed by the Commonwealth Bank. That is laid down by Part V. They shall render certain statistics, which they do not render to-day, under Part VI . The compilation of these statistics will be a very onerous and diffiever, and also for the protection of deposicult job, because it is laid down that, in certain cases, the banks will be allowed a period of six months in which to prepare figures. That allotment of time is a clear indication of. the nature of the information which the Government will demand, and. of the difficulty of the job imposed on the banks. It is reminiscent of the task of extracting information from some Ministers. It is supplied to us in time, if we are patient. though. T speak feelingly about the information wealth bank, or indirectly through rewhich the Minister gave to me last Tuesstrictions which it intends to impose on day night. The banks shall refrain from tbe private banks. doing business with the States and local governing bodies, and they shall submit their affairs to the examination of the Auditor-General. They shall supply' unlimited information at the discretion of the Commonwealth Bank, on any subject under the sun, under clause 50. They shall not sell out, reconstruct, or amalgamate with any other bank, under clause 51. They shall hand over unclaimed money to the Commonwealth. This money does not belong to the Commonwealth, it belongs to the people, who, in their wisdom or otherwise, have seen fit to lodge it with private banks. The Commonwealth now demands that such money shall be handed over to the Treasurer, and is good enough to say that, after a certain time, it will become part of general revenue. agree with the Minister. They shall also submit to any regulation which so far has not even been thought of.

106,Mr Archie Cameron,"This billThe next thing that strikes me is that every trading bank will be placed on the horns of a dilemma. First, the trading banks must conform to Commonwealth banking policy, and, secondly, they must disclose their inner business, and the affairs of their customers, to a competitor which the Parliament has ordered to take their business from them. I am reminded of the advice given by an old Scot to his son who was about to leave home to make his own way in the world: ""Go out and get money; get it honestly if you can, but get it "" . That is virtually the instruction that is given to the Commonwealth Bank in this bill. First, it. instructs the Commonwealth Bank to go out and expand its activities; and then it instructs the private banks to submit everything in their possession to the inspection of a competitor which the Parliament hag ordered to expand its business. provided for in a bill which was passed during the temporary absence from the chamber of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). The honourable member will find that provision in the Commonwealth Bank Bill, and a similar provision is contained in the present bill. in any bill that has come before us which enables the Commonwealth Bank to interfere with the customers of other banks. the attention of the honourable member for Batman to clause 50 of this bill, which reads50 (1.) Every bank shall furnish to the Commonwealth Bank such information in respect of its business as the Commonwealth Bank directs and every person who carries on any banking business in Australia shall furnish to the Commonwealth Bank such information in connection with his banking business as the Commonwealth Bank directs. Penalty: One thousand pounds. (2.) A direction under this section shall not require information to be furnished wit h respect to the affairs of any individual customer. excludes relations between customer and banker. honourable member for Batman was once H Minister, and he is still, I believe, a lawyer,' and therefore he should know that the Commonwealth Bank will need to know certain things about foreign exchange and foreign currencies and that the only way in which it will be able to get that information in certain instances will be by having information concerning the financial affairs of the persons witb whom it will be dealing. There will be no other way to find out, and so it is clear that nobody will be protected. But let me get back to the dilemma in which the trading banks will find themselves. ber himself is in a dilemma. may be a new experience for me, but not for the Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini). Having laid down that the Commonwealth Bank shall have the power to direct banking policy, that the private banks must conform to that policy, and further, must lay bare their financial soul to the Commonwealth Bank and the Auditor-General when ordered to do so, the bill provides, also, that if, in spite of those handicaps, the private banks do make a profit, every penny of that profit shall be placed in another special ' account with the Commonwealth Bank at the amazingly low interest rate of 17s. 6d. per cent. I come now to the other horn of the dilemma: If , as the result of tlie banking policy dictated by the Commonwealth Bank, the private banks fail to make profits and get into "" Queer-street"", as some honourable gentlemen opposite have reminded us happened to certain banks in 1893, the Commonwealth Bank will come to their rescue. Bank will look after them both ways. most amazing to find that should these private financial institutions, as the result of incompetence on the part of the Commonwealth Bank, get into financial difficulties, the Commonwealth Bank is to be the custodian of their affairs. Why should the Commonwealth Bank, which will cause their losses, be selected to save them? The task which this legislation imposes on the private banks is another case of an angel in Heaven trying to boil a pot while the devil pours water en the fire.

116,Mr Archie Cameron,"It isHome Security that the competition which the private hanks will have to meet will not be fair competition, because the Commonwealth Bank will not have to bear the same burden of taxation as is imposed on the private banks. Mr AJfcCHIE CAMERON-That is a point which the Minister might elaborate in a later speech. profits of the Commonwealth Bank must go into Consolidated Revenue. does not affect the matter at all, because the Commonwealth Bank is a government institution. If the Government were to lay down that 100 per cent, of the profits of the Commonwealth Bank were to be paid into Consolidated Revenue the position would not be affected in the slightest problem arises, because, according to degree. Nor would that interfere with the capacity of the Commonwealth Bank to get business. There can be no comparison between the Commonwealth Bank, which is under no obligation to pay taxes, and the private banking institutions, which must pay them. Take, for instance, the effect of land tax on them. The Commonwealth Bank does not pay land tax, but the amount paid as taxes by the private banks for their properties in Sydney alone would amount to a considerable sum. If the Commonwealth Bank had to pay taxes on its valuable properties in Martin Place, Sydney, and elsewhere, the position would be very different. The bill also provides for the compulsory lodgement with the Commonwealth Bank of moneys belonging to the private banks. The delightful word ""lodgement"" either means acquisition or that the private banks will make compulsory loans to the Commonwealth Bank. I am not a lawyer, but I should like the one or two distinguished lawyers who sometimes sit in this chamber, but at the moment are distinguished by their absence, to consider one or two things about this bill. I want to know whether this compulsory lodgement of surplus funds is a loan, or amounts to acquisition. If the lodgement is to be a loan, where does the Government get its authority to require the banks to make compulsory loans? I have read the Commonwealth Constitution carefully, and although I am not a lawyer I claim to understand it as well as most people on the land do. I know that section 51 of the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth to acquire property on just terms, but I do not know of any provision in it to compel people to lend to the Commonwealth on any terms. If there be any right residing in the Commonwealth Government to compel people to lend anything to the Government, 1 submit that that loan must be on just terms. I suggest that the compulsory lodgement of moneys with the Commonwealth Bank at 17s. 6d. per cent, interest would not be considered just terms if the matter were submitted to the High Court for adjudication. Similarly, if the money is to be acquired, another the Constitution, the Commonwealth Government may acquire property only on just terms. I should say that ""just terms"" would involve the Commonwealth paying a reasonable money price for any property which il acquired. If money is compulsorily acquired from a person how is it to be paid for on just terms? That is a question which I ask the financial genius at the tableI refer to the Minister for Home Security-to answer. The Constitution clearly contemplates the acquisition of property, and the payment for it in money. If acquisition is what the Government has in mind in this legislation, I do not see how it can pay for Australian currency with Australian currency. If overseas currency, such as dollars, lira or marks, were acquired, I could understand it being acquired on just terms, because foreign currency could be paid for in Australian currency, either justly or unjustly. But if Australian currency be acquired I do not know what would represent acquisition in just terms. "" If the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?'"" That is about how this needs to be put. If it can be paid in any other medium than money, I should like to know what it is. Does the Government propose to acquire money from the banks and compel them to take something else in exchange?",38,Cameron No Will Form A Dragnet Which Can Be Used

119,Mr Archie Cameron,"Thatbills. t reasury-bills at "" five bob "" per cent, or .something like that. I point out to the Minister assisting the Treasurer that the bill does not provide that, as a condition to their being licensed, the private banks shall pay their surplus funds into the Commonwealth Bank; it occurs only as the result of the banks' operations undeT the licence. I think that is an important point, too. If the Government laid it down that the only terms on which it would allow the banks to operate were that they paid in surplus funds, that part of it would stand, I believe, on entirely different ground. I do not think it would get over the compulsory lodgement argument even that way; nor 11o I think it would get over the argument that could be raised in regard to restraint of trade, which also is something which the Commonwealth has no right to impose upon anybody. However, f leave that aspect for the time being in order to ask the Minister assisting the Treasurer whether he can clear up the lodgement issue? It appears to me that lodgement is a penalty on success imposed on a competitor and that it is an act in restraint of trade and, furthermore, an act in restraint of investments. I do not know exactly where the Commonwealth stands in that regard either. The Privy Council not long ago decided a case in regard to freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse as between the States, and I am afraid that something of the f-flme sort may arise raider this policy. ThenI want to know from the Minister -issisting the Treasurer whether the lodgments of profits imposed on the banks [p. if lawful, to be applied to stock agents who do banking business. If the Government has the right to say that a bank, because it comes -under the first -schedule to the bill, shall, if it makes a profit, deposit that profit with the Commonwealth Bank, logically it has the right to say to every stock agent, cooperative society, or other organization or person dealing in money, accepting money on fixed deposit, and engaging in other monetary transactions which result in profit, "" You must lodge that extra profit with the Commonwealth Bank "". member mean to say that we should widen the bill? not asking that the bill be widened. I am asking why tbe stupid, provision is put in a.t all. There is an old saying which even the Minister assisting tbe Treasurer should understand, """"What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander "". there is another saying, which rather cancels that out, that when things are different they are not the same. means what it says it does not mean that at all. The next thing I want is a definition of the term "" sterling "". I thought I understood what sterling meant until a High Court decision was given in Melbourne not long ago. I formed an impression of that decision. Lawyers may be able to correct me. It was an insurance case. The court ordered that the man concerned was to get the £1,000 concerned in the ense in Australian currency, although the term used in the policy was ""£1,000 sterling"". That is a rather sltrange thing. a hie member .mean by "" sterling "" ? currency or, as would rather appeal to the honourable member, British currency. English and Australian currency had the same value at one stage, but Australia went off sterling and our money depreciated in terms of sterling, so that £108 in Australian currency was required to buy £100 of sterling. The rate of exchange rose so that it took £133 Australian to buy £100 sterling. To-day we pay £125 Australian to buy £100 sterling. That High Court decision is important.

131,Mr Archie Cameron,"A debttlie policy were expressed in sterling, and tlie High Court ruled that sterling meant Australian currency. It is not for me to question the reasons why the High Court came to that judgment, but, as one who is concerned for the export industries of Australia, both primary and secondary, but much more the primary than the secondary, may I say that this decision could carry with it very great consequences. Consequently, in committee, I intend to ask the Minister to say whether a clause will bo put into the bill to declare that sterling means British currency and not Australian currency, so that we shall know. Australia are carried out with Australian currency. bill refers to sterling. ""What does the i\finister mean by sterling? honourable member. means English currency, as I took it to mean before the High Court decision, that should be put into the b ill . so that every producer, particularly every exporter, in this country shall know exactly where he stands in regard to the value of Australian currency and the difference between it and English currency. That is a question which I think the honourable gentleman will have handed up to him by primary producers' organizations before very long, if he is not careful. The last question with which I wish to deal is one to which I referred before, but I wish to refer to it now in a different way. It is the power granted to the Commonwealth Bank in regard to the control of gold prices. It appears to me that the Commonwealth Bank is authorized by this bill to acquire gold, because it is said that the Commonwealth Bank is to he the only authority to buy gold in Australia. Well, if the Commonwealth Bank is buying gold, I remind the Minister that the Constitution lays it down that tbe Commonwealth may acquire goods or property only on just terms, and the terms on which gold is to be acquired are not to be the price fixed by the Commonwealth Bank. In times past the Commonwealth Government has had no price-fixing powers whatever. The price has had to be the world market price for gold, not some lower price decided on by the Commonwealth Government through the Commonwealth Bank. 1 am not going into the points which I could raise about the taxation of gold at present. I heard other arguments on that in this chamber in 1939, and very interesting arguments they were. The right honourable member for Darling Down; ( Mr Fadden) will remember the first Gold Tax Bill, which was rejected by the Senate, and, perhaps, a certain Minister might have been less happy if we had not done a certain thing here. But thai is history, although it is very important. I want to know whether the Government thinks it has the right to acquire gold except on just terms, because I argue that the Commonwealth Government cannot lay it down in this, Or any other bill, that the Commonwealth Bank is to be able to be the only buyer of gold, and then argue, at the same time, that buying under those conditions is not compulsory acquisition. No man is compelled to go out and mine gold, but there is on the statute-book the Gold Encouragement Act and alongside that the Gold Tax Act. I remember when the Gold Encouragement Act went through this chamber. Under it we paid a bounty of £1 an oz. for all gold mined. The Government goes on another tack now, and lays it down that in future the Commonwealth Government may declare the Commonwealth Bank as the only goldpurchasing authority in Australia. In times past the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Government have had no price-fixing powers whatever. The only price at which gold could be acquired from a person was at the world market price. It can only acquire it at lower prices now because there is no free market for gold to-day. The power of collecting half, the increment on gold, for which the present law provides, that increment being based on the £9 an oz. purchase price, will depend entirely on the price-fixing power of tbe Commonwealth. In time of peace it does not have that power, and, therefore, its power of collecting 50 per cent, of the so-called increment over £9 an oz.",40,Cameron No Will Form A Dragnet Which Can Be Used

135,Mr Archie Cameron,"If he will go by the board. So, on this question of the acquisition of gold, tbe Coniuionwealth Government w ill do well to examine the limits of its powers. That is the list of my complaints about this bill. It is a very interesting and a fairly long list of complaints about matters that are not clear and which will have to be cleared up. I have a feeling that this bill did not receive quite so. much consideration as it should have received, f t has been attended to, no doubt, by a number of gentlemen who know a lot about banking and finance and how the world should be run. In the words of Omar Khayyam they wantTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire, Remould it nearer to the Heart's Desire. The Government is trying to do that n this bill and will have as much success as Omar would have had in his day. There are certain things which the Commonwealth Government cannot do. One, of course, is its desire to use this legislation as a means of controlling all industry in Australia. socialize it ! The Australian Labour party thinks that as long as it has control of the financial institutions of Australia it can wreck or reconstruct everything in the Commonwealth. The Minister is an honourable gentleman with those ideals, who has moved in the metropolitan parts of Australia country all my life. Minister does not sound like it , and certainly does not look like it . I put it to him, as a man who knows the cities of Australia, that before you can erect a fine, big new building, you generally have to get hold of an old one and knock it down. The Government is trying to knock down the private banking institutions of Australia. The blow it is dealing, in my opinion, is directed not so much at the banking institutions as at their customers. Whati t is attempting to do is to tell the people where they shall bank. It is doing so, whether legally or not I do not know, but certainly immorally, unino rally or amorally in regard to the States and local governing authorities. There are certain sovereign rights which the States of Australia still enjoy, and certain sovereign precautions which they are still obliged to accord to local governing authorities, which function under their authority. Whatever may be the legal position, this is one of tbe most miserable efforts that I have ever seen devised to avoid what should be the straightforward procedure. There is nothing honest or straightforward about a clause which says that a bank shall not conduct business with State Governments. That, too, is not a term of the licence. The Government proposes . and then to license unconditionally every trading bank named in the first schedule. I contend that it has no right to go in fox underground, doubtful methods of attempting to circumscribe the right of other authorities of Australia by imposing limits on the banking institutions. That is not its function. It is too much to hope that in committee this Government, with a huge, unthinking majority, will insert in the bill improvements which is right: should be looked at for the benefit of the community. The bill will go through with as little consideration as was given to the Commonwealth BankB ill that preceded it. I tell the Treasurer and those behind him that he has not heard the last of this bill. As a matter of fact, he has not heard the first of it , because fourteen months hence somebody will say from that table, "" The gates are open to the people "". The not have one representative then. Minister need not worry about that. The more he and his colleagues come into my electorate, the greater my majority will be. I am prepared to go to any part of my electorate accompanied by any member of the Ministry. It might be in the interests of the political life of this country if , at election times, all candidates for each electorate stood on the same public platform.

Sitting am pleased to have the opportunity to associate myself with this important measure, which, I am sure, w ill have a wide influence on the life and development of this great nation. In my view, all other legislative enactments pale into insignificance by comparison w i th the financial bills now before the Parliament, because all social reforms and developmental activities are dependent largely upon the success or failure of our financial institutions. In the course of this debate we have heard the views of leading experts on finance quoted by many speakers. case against this legislation, honourable members opposite have spared no effort in their search f a r and wide for suitable quotations. I shall not assume the role of an expert on finance, but shall endeavour to deal with this measure in the light of my own practical knowledge of two of the greatest primary producing industries of this country, namely, the wheat and wool industries. Any one who has a personal knowledge of the struggles of the pastoral and agricultural industries in this country, w ill welcome the effort by this Government to restore f u l l power to the Commonwealth Bank. I shall refer briefly to the reports of royal commissions set up by the Governments of Western Australiaand Queensland to inquire into the wool industry in those States. Since 1906 I have been closely associated with the pastoral industry of Western Australia. I know of its difficulties and of its successes. I know the dreadful conditions that have been endured by pastoralists during devastating droughts. In 1939 the Government of Western Australia appointed Mr Fyffe, Surveyor-General of that State, as a royal commission to inquire into the condition of the pastoral industry, which at that time had just passed through six years of the worse drought in history. To demonstrate the great influence which the banking institutions had In the upon that industry, I shall quote paragraph 508 of the royal commission's report, which statesThe staggering effect of the drought is emphasized by the above figures. Not only did suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. station owners, starting in 1035 with 5,500,000 sheep, lose 4,182,000 in the five following I years (which was very greatly in excess of five years' normal losses), but their natural increase was 3,137,000 sheep below that which they should have obtained according to the average derived from pre-drought experience. That passage shows clearly the position in which the pastoral industry was placed as a result of the drought. I turn now to the financial .position. In paragraph 734. the commissioner saidMany pastoralists have not been able to carry on without financial assistance! and each year have submitted budgets to the banks and firms for sums for the working and maintenance of their stations. They have Been the previous debt which they had incurred increasing at, perhaps five or five and a half per In supporting their cent, interest calculated half-yearly, and haw reached a stage when they are entirely dependent on the secured creditors. Paragraph 773, which relates to interest charges, saysMany protests were heard during the course of tlie Commission's inquiries that the practice"" adopted by the financial institutions (including the stock and wool-broking firms) of debiting interest half-yearly, and if unpaid thus including it for the calculation of iuteresl on the daily balance or other system, was not warranted, having in mind the rates of interest charged, and the extreme adversity which s great many of the pastoralists had suffered during the drought. In some extreme cases this hue been avoided by only charging interest on unpaid interest on an annual basis where the debtor is suffering severe financial hardship. I quote those passages to demonstrate to honourable members the difficulties associated with the development of our primary industries. The commissioner, whose report I have quoted, did not have any Labour leanings, and his findings must be regarded as impartial. A long exhaustive inquiry was made, and the report sets out clearly the condition? which were found to exist. I come now",42,Cameron No Will Form A Dragnet Which Can Be Used

The report of that commission confirmed exactly the findings of the Western Australian commission.

It was suggested that the Commonwealth Therefore I submit confronting Australia in a way that will RecentlyI asked the Treasurer ( Mr among other things, that more than Chifley) whether the Government would be willing to appoint a delegation of representatives of all parties in this House and send it to the Kiniberley district to inspect and report on the prospects of development there. The long undeveloped coast-line of ""Western Australia, with its meagre population, must stand out as a menace to the nation. Vast areas of good country are awaiting development aud crying out for attention. The problem of water conservation must be tackled in a genuine manner. There are those who say there is nothing wrong with Australia's financial system; that it has operated fairly and in the interests of every one. If that is so, why are flood waters allowed to rush out to the sea year after year without any attempt being made to impound them? As Henry Lawson wrote in "" The Storm is yet to come ""The rain comes down on tlie western land And the rivers run to waste, While the townsfolk rush for the special tram In their childish, senseless haste, And never a pile of a lock we drive But iv few mean tanks we scratch, For the fate of the nation is naught, compared With the turn of a cricket match. If water was properly conserved there would be an adequate supply to meet drought periods; but the difficult experience through which the country has just passed is a glaring reminder of the fact that no genuine effort has been made to provide an adequate water supply. If people can borrow money at a reasonable rate of interest for settlement and development purposes Australia will thrive. If that assistance is not given, however, some other nation will come and do what we have failed to do. Murmurings and warnings have been heard recently to the effect that our white Australia policy is breaking down. Every Australian would be prepared to lay down his life in defence of that policy, but it will be impossible to maintain that ideal if the country is not developed and fresh industries are not founded because financial assistance and encouragement are lacking. I remind members of the Opposition that when the Fyffe report was submitted showing, [125] 5,000,000 sheep in Western Australia had perished because of the drought, the Commonwealth Government then in office -consistin g of members of the Opposition parties-di d nothing to revive or assist the pastoral industry in that State. Yet members of the Opposition tell us that theirs was the Government that looked after the interests of the man on the land. That Government did so while big firms such as Dalgety and Company Limited, Elder Smith and Company Limited, and others fleeced the men on the land by way of exorbitant interest charges. I repeat my confidence in this measure. If any advantage is to be gained by the control of the banking and monetary systems it should be applied to Australia's development. If it is left in the hands of a few bankers who would rigidly control industries, the congestion in the cities will increase and sparsely populated areas will be furthe depopulated. One has only to travel through the country to be impressed by its great possibilities, but nothing has been done over the years owing to the neglect of the non-labour governments. Soon after I entered this Parliament I met one of my former school teachers and while discussing finance I said that the banking system was somewhat intricate and difficult to understand. She replied, "" Never make that admission again; the banking system is the most simple in the world. It is only those who have created a false atmosphere of difficulty who lead others to believe that the control of our monetary system is intricate and hard for the average man to understand "". She was a wise woman and after I gave further study to the subject. I found that the monetary system was not so involved or shrouded in mystery as those in control of it would have the average man believe. The trouble has been that many people have been given the idea that banking is a subject for only the learned to handle, and, therefore, it has been left in the hands of a few to administer. These, in turn, have exercised a control over the individual from the cradle to the grave. The proper persons to control finance are the elected representatives; one reason beii.jr that they are compelled to go to The people every three years to secure their approval or rejection. It has been 'suggested that if the right to make decisions on banking policy now vested in the Commonwealth Bank Board were placed in the hands of the Treasurer, such right would be taken away from highly trained persons and given to some one who would not be able to discharge such a responsibility. I know of no person in Australia better qualified or entitled to make such a decision than the Treasurer because he is responsible to this Parliament, and if he errs then Parliament errs and tbe people will pronounce their judgment. I have received many protests about this bill which were obviously inspired by banking interests. A parcel containing 50 typewritten slips bearing the words, "" I protest against the Government's BankingB ill "" , and signed by the making provision for and in relation to the persons protesting, was sent to me. I discarded them all and made no reply to the people who sent them. When the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr (a) the buying, borrowing, selling, lending Harrison) was citing certain names the other day, I noticed that the name of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was not among them. I refuse to allow anybody to dictate to me or to tell me that I should say yes or no to any proposition. I am the elected representative of the people of Kalgoorlie and I am responsible to those people for my actions-no t to any individual who desires to put the "" third degree "" on me although that has been attempted more than once, but without success. As a member of the Labour party, I am proud to have played some part in placing this legislation on the statute-book. It is vital to the country, and if any benefit is to be gained by the control of banking, then that benefit should be shared by all and not by a chosen few. I have listened with great interest to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson). I suppose no member of this chamber knows more about the "" wide open spaces "" of Australia, or the trials and troubles of the man on the land, the curious uncertainty of the climate of this Commonwealth bringing thereby drought and flood; of diseases among stock, or the difficulties of living on tbe land, than he does. I am sure the honourable member will agree with me that because of these things the most flexible banking system of which human ingenuity can devise is required in Australia. The bill contains clauses which are by no means flexible, but rather lend rigidity to the country's banking structure. These clauses probably could only be equalled by the full implementation of the pre-war gold standard. I refer particularly to Part. III . of the bill which deals with foreign exchange, and to clause 29 which provides(1.) Where the Governor General is satis fied that it is expedient so to do, for the protection of the currency or of the public credit of the Commonwealth, or in order to conserve, in the national interest, the foreign exchange resources of the Commonwealth, he may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act. control of foreign exchange and, in particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for or in relntion toor exchanging of foreign currency. including the fixing of rates ot exchange; [li) any dealing or transaction having the effect of a purchase, borrowing, sale, loan or exchange of foreign currency: (o) the taking or sending out of Australia of gold, Australian currency or foreign currency; id) requiring any person who has power to sell, or to procure the sale of, any foreign currency to sell, or procure the sale of, that foreign currency as prescribed; (e) the taking, sending or transfer of any securities to a place outside Australia, including the transfer of seen rities from a register in Australia to a register outside Australia: (/) the prohibition of the importation or exportation of goods unless a licence under the regulations to import or export the goods is in force. That clause envisages the strictest exchange control which any country has ever embodied in any banking legislation. Let us consider who was responsible for instigating this kind of extreme rigidity. If honourable members will turn to page 1117 of the minutes of evidence given before the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, they will there find a record of the evidence given by Mr L. G. Melville, Economic",43,Cameron No Will Form A Dragnet Which Can Be Used
145,Mr Abbott (New England) [8.28].,"Adviser to the Commonwealth Bank. Referring to the economic system of Australia, Mr Melville saidTo make the problem simple enough for practical purposes we must select one factor in the economy and attempt to fix it, at the same time endeavouring, as far as possible, to make every other factor in the economy adapt itself to the fixed factor . . Having regard to the necessity for Australia to trade on friendly terms with other countries, her need for overseas capital, and the convenience of traders and financiers, it seems best in her case to fix the exchange rate and adapt the economy to that fixed rate. That means that any ill wind, any drop of price levels, which occurs outside Australia, must be instantly reflected in the Australian economy by reason of the very rigidity of the exchange rate. We know what happened during the great depression because of the attempt to maintain in this country parity first with gold and then with sterling, and the re-invigorarion of the national economy when the exchange rate was driven from parity and rose to what one might describe as its equilibrium level, to cover the difference between the purchasing power of sterling and of the Australian £ 1 . Throughout his evidence, Mr Melville adhered to the point that there must be a fixed and rigid exchange rate, around which tlie Australian economy must be made to revolve. He quoted an extract from a book by Professor Gustav Cassel, of Sweden, On Quantitative Thinkingi n EconomiesIn order to reduce subsequent disturbances to a minimum, care should be taken that this rate corresponds as nearly as can be ascertained to the purchasing-power parity of the currencies concerned. If tbe internal economy is fixed at a purchasing power parity with other countries currencies expressed by rates of exchange, and the purchasing power parities of other currencies suddenly alter, with rate such as Mr Melville proposed and to implement, there would be imported into the internal economy, which would have to share in them, the whole of the troubles of the outside world. Mr Melville further saidThe fixing of the rate of exchange as an objective of monetary policy does not mean that the rate selected should be maintained at all costs. Yet he would maintain it , at a heavy cost. He went on to sayThus, with a fixed rate of exchange, a sudden increase or decrease in prices, a cessation of foreign tendings, or the production of a substitute for one of the principal exports may require a sudden and substantial change in nominal wages and in fixed charges, such us interest, commissions, fares, and freights. If this sudden change is impracticable for economic, political, or social reasons, then there is no alternative to the selection of a new rate of exchange. But the rate of exchange should not be altered arbitrarily or for unsubstantial changes in the economic environment. In particular, there is no case for a depreciation of the currency when, as at present in Australia, there has been selected and maintained unaltered for some years a rate which permits an expanding production for export at a profit to the producers, and when there is reason to believe that the maintenance of the rate will make it possible for all but a small proportion of the population to find employment. It may be that some change in the layout of employment in Australia is necessary to give full work at existing wage rates. This change, however, is more likely to be hindered than aided by a depreciation of the currency. If , in these circumstances, a fall in London funds threatens a depreciation of the currency, the solution is clearly to be sought in a contraction of credit. Therefore, he admitted that he would carry back into the Australian economy all the disasters that might occur in the outside world. A t page 1135, he was cross-examined13Y TUB CHAIRMAN -You r suggestion is uot to make a stable exchange the end, but only a sort of working hypothesis?-Yes, I think we should think in terms of a stable exchange for all ordinary occasions. Until you find there is some reason why you should make nn alteration?-Yes, an overwhelming reason for an alteration. Although he said that he did not propose that the attempt should be made to keep the exchange rate stable in all circumstances, there is not the slightest douibt that he would maintain it , at very great cost, with a readjustment of internal an inflexible exchange values in Australia which would be even more severe than that which Professor this legislation will endeavour Copland, the present Economic Adviser to the Government, put into force in the great depression. Other evidence on the exchange rate was given by very high banking authorities. I shall first quote what Sir Alfred Davidson, of the Bank of New South Wales, said in reply to the evidence given by Mr Melville. Sir Alfred Davidson and the Bank of New South Wales forced tlie breaking of the exchange rate in 1931, when it rose rapidly from. £115 to £130. The royal commission found that no single factor in the whole of the depression had been more responsible for infusing life-blood into the community, and easing clown the unemployment rate, than had been the depreciation of the Australian currency in relation to sterling. Davidson said in evidenceMy first fundamental criticism is that he appears to have been led, through a knowledge of the factors which preclude a precise monetary policy being carried out according, to mathematical principles, to accept unquestionably a monetary policy which has the specious merit of being simple. This policy, namely, the maintenance of si rigid exchange rate, has been proved through experience over a great number of years in most countries of the world, to be generally im'omputihlc with the steady progress of internal economies and the absence of marked fluctuations. It closely resembles the maintenvient to the wider economic needs of the ance of a gold standard, the fundamental weaknesses of which 1 have stressed in my previous evidence. He went on to speak of the effects which this rigidity would haveThus, it is reasoned that, in order to secure the maintenance of the official rate of exchange fixed by the central bank, complete control of the proceeds of export is necessary. That would mean complete regimentation of an individual's funds. Whether he sold his wool locally, or shipped it overseas, he would not be allowed to buy what commodities he liked overseas, or even make the proceeds available to an importer. Sir Alfred went on to sayThe artificial prevention of the development of nn outside market will lead to the bureaucratic determination of a pricenamely the rate of exchange. The market will (.hen have no right of a,pj>eal but must accept the .ir.bitru.rv decision of the Commonwealth Bank. That has been borne out again recently. A cable published in the Sydney Morning IJerald to-day, stated that the Federation of British Industries, commenting on the Bretton Woods plan, had said in regard to the rigid fixation of exchange ratesThere are recognized rules by which reliable rates can then be established, it states, and the only test of a true equilibrium rate of exchange between two countries engaged iu international trade is practically the test of trial and error. Mr Abbott. Sir Alfred Davidson pointed out thatjustifiable and necessary depreciation of the currency might be left too long because of the possible addition to costs of government arid the fear of the central bank that it would get out of control. That was demonstrated most strongly in .1931. He continuedThis may cause the monetary authorities Sir Alfred to shirk action for a long time when a calamity confronts Australia. He went on to criticize Mr Melville for other views which he had expressed in regard to this matter. Professor Hytten. a graduate of the University of Tasmania, also contradicted evidence given by Mr Melville. At page 1238, speaking of the exchange rate, he saidThere can be no one guide to the. fixation of the Australian exchange rate. The chief thing to be remembered is that the rate must not be kept stable just for the sake of stability, but that exchange stability should he subsercountry. Internal stability is far more important, and if that should happen to mean changes in the rate from time to time, these must be undertaken. Later, he saidIn the long run international trade is lnurf likely to be increased by making internal stability tlie first consideration than by rigid adherence to a given exchange rate. All those who have read reports of the international discussions at Bretton Woods, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, and the United Nations Conference on International Organization, at San Francisco, w ill agree that the argument most consistently advanced by the Australian delegates was that there should be the highest degree of employment in every country of the world. The Atlantic Charter and the Mutua l Aid agreement, envisaged the greatest possible international trade. I agree entirely with Professor Hytten, that if we are to have prosperity and f u l l employment, it is infinitely better not to worship a fetish such as a. fixed exchange rate, in conjunction with which the whole economy must be maintained. Another interesting feature of Part III . of the bill is that it appears to be completely contrary to certain of the provisions of the Bretton Woods monetary agreement, embodied in the white paper containing the discussions from the 1st 10 tlie. 22nd July, 1944, issued by the Parliament of the Commonwealth in 1944. Mr Melville, in a general review of the proceedings, saidWe could vary our exchange rate, without the approval of the fund, provided that the change, together with all previous changes, whether increases or decreases, did not exceed 10 per cent, of the initial par value. If we consent to the Bretton Woods agreement, Ave shall be committed to a rigid exchange variable only to the extent of 10 per cent.; not quite so rigid as that envisaged by the bill, but still very rigid. Paragraph 22, which is headed "" The Ban on Exchange Control"", statesThe other major obligation which membership of the Fund would place upon us is not to im|K>sc exchange control except to prevent capital movements. Import restrictions, however, are permitted and could be used to reduce the drain on our external funds, although they would have this effect only after the lapse of some time after they had been applied. Ff that be correct, it means that a good deal of the clau.se will be ultra virestor what the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has said with regard to the treaty-making powers envisaged under the Constitution. This rigid restriction of the movement of the foreign exchange rate seems to run contrary to certain clauses of the Bretton Woods agreement. I shall put before honourable members certain points with regard to the exchange rate and its incidence on primary production. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) has referred to difficulties which producers suffer. From 1929 to 1932 there was a colossal fall of the prices of primary products. At no time during 1931 or 1932 did I ever receive more than 10s. a head for f a t sheep sold on my property. As soon as the depreciation of the exchange rate came, the Australian price level for exports improved. more than the action taken at that time. What, did the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems say in that regard? statedThe movement in the exchange rate in January, .1931, was one of the major contributions of monetary policy to recovery in Australia. At paragraph 554 the commission statedIn the belated movement of the official exchange rate to 130 in January, 1931, the initiative was taken by the Bank of New South Wales. By that time, the Commonwealth Bank should have realized tlie value of exchange depreciation as a means of meeting an emergency, and have raised the rate to a height -which would have restricted imports and maintained exports. I believe that that action was one of the most powerful factors in the economic recovery of this country. There is the greatest possible danger in putting a clause like this into the bill, for it is like a dagger pointed at the hearts of the people when world prices are falling, if we are locked with rigidity to sterling or with the rate of any foreign country. Sub-clause 1 of clause 39 provides that the Commonwealth Bank may, with the approval of the Treasurer, make regulations (a) making provision for and in relation to the control of rates of interest payable to or by banks, or to or by other persons in the course of any banking business carried on by them; (/J) making provision for and in relation to the control of rates of discount chargeable by banks . . . The royal commission, in its report, realized that there was a great necessity to control interest rates charged by banks to borrowers. Three methods were suggested by the commission. One was that the rates of interest should be controlled by the central bank operating in the open market in government debentures and bonds, and buying them in if it wanted to make the credit structure more liquid. If , on the other hand, it was desired to restrict the credit base of Australia, the method to be adopted would be to sell securities on the open market, and bring back cash into the central bank and immobilize it for the time being. The commission Nothing helped Australia recommended the fixation of interest rates on deposits with the trading banks, so that there would be control of the average margin between deposit rates In paragraph 551 it and the rates charged to borrowers. The third method related to the competition of the central bank with the trading banks as an adjunct to its central banking powers. The royal commission instanced how the Commonwealth Bank had brought down the rate of interest on pastoral advances in New South Wales to 4^ per cent., when the ruling rate at that time had been much higher. There were some three pastoral firms in New South Wales which banked with the Commonwealth Bank, and all that the latter bad to do was to say, "" We will advance funds to you for your clients at 4J per cent."". On the evidence given to the commission, it was shown that the money which they borrowed was lent to their clients at the same rate of interest as was paid for it . Their profit arose from the fact that they obtained commission from the sale of their client's stock and wool. To lay down a rigid rate of interest and say that no bank is to be allowed to advance money at a higher rate would cause certain borrowers to be refused accommodation by the .trading banks. The bill does not provide that a bankshall lend money to any borrower. The bank may say to some borrowers that they are not as credit-worthy as others and they may wish to charge a slightly higher rate, but those borrowers would get a lower rate of interest from the banks than if they obtained their accommodation from a money lender who had three golden balls hanging over his door, from whom the lowest rate of interest obtainable would be about 48 per cent, [ f , on the other han.l, they paid a rate of interest equivalent to that operating under the cash order system, they would be charged approximately 100 per cent. If they went to a long-term lender through a solicitor, they would probably pay a good deal more than they would have to pay a trading bank. Thousands of people in the Commonwealth to-day have had to pay comparatively high rates of interest for the money that they have needed for the projects which they have undertaken, and which might not have been regarded as credit-worthy by a bank, yet by their hard labour they have made those projects entirely successful. Paragraph c of sub-clause 1 of clause 39 provides that the Commonwealth Bank may make regulations providing that interest shall not be payable in respect, of(i) any amount deposited with a frank, or people. This clause would l i m it classes with any other person in the course of any Mr Abbott. banking business carried on by him, and repayable on demand or after the expiration of a period specified in the regulations. That provision shows that whilst those who drafted the bill may have obtained university degrees, they lack a practical knowledge of what is taking place in the community. I particularly draw attention to the evidence given before the royal commission by Mr Bloomfield, of the MutualL if e and Citizens Assurance Company, Sydney, who said that his company accepted deposits on seven-dny terms. He added that in 1926 thf deposits amounted to £1,147,000, and in 1927 the total was £1,428,000. People were able to get 2 per cent, on that money, and the effect would be to force down the rate of interest. There would be a tendency on the part of gas companies, depositing funds there, for instance, to reduce the price of gas to the consumers owing to the savings made. This system was having a beneficial effect, but brcansp a gentleman had rigid ideas about placing f u l l control in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank, this excellent seven days' market has been cut out, despite the fact that it was of great service to the community. Turning to Division5 of the bill, which iclaics to advances and investments, wo find that clause 27 provides(I.) Where the Commonwealth Bank it. satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the public interest, the Commonwealth Bank may determine the policy in relation to advances to be followed by banks and each bank shall follow tlie policy so determined. Penalty: One thousand pounds. (2.) Without limiting the generality of the last preceding sub-section, the Commonwealth Bank may give directions as to the classes of purposes for which advances may or may nol be made by banks and each bank shall comply with any directions so given. Penalty: One thousand pounds. That provision is typical of the desire for rigidity in the banking structure of Australia and is a monument to the vanity of the economic advisers to the Government who drew up the bill. They always set themselves up as having superior wisdom and even a sort of divine guidance, by which they can tell us what is most advantageous for the of borrowers. The bank could say that there were too many, borrowers of a certain type although they might be more Much that was said when the Commonefficient producers than some others.

A similar state of affairs is being created in this country by continued attacks on the private banks. Everything harmful that has happened during the last twenty years is attributed by some people to the influence of these institutions. The private banks are blamed for the depression, and financial institutions in other countries are said to have caused the present war. The bill sets out what can be done with the private banks, but. I should like to know what the Government intends shall be done. It is clear from the bill that in a country which we believe is capable of great development the banks are to be brought to the position in which they were on the 3rd September, 1939, and are to be pegged there indefinitely. Their assets are to be frozen as at that date. I shall say a few words in support of the private banks. surprising. bers opposite were sincere they would give to the private banks credit for what they have done, instead of blaming them as they do. I do not claim that banks are philanthropic institutions. institutions. banks and their managers have done much for the development of Australia.

Everything will be assessed on the worth placed on the asset by the manager who does not want to lose his job. I should have had a long hard struggle unless the local bank manager had not very often backed me financially far in excess of the value of the asset that I had to offer from time to time.

The prohibition of expansion of business, among other things, will mean that in the course of time managers of the Commonwealth Bank branch in country towns, being the only bank managers there, as undoubtedly is the intention of this bill because the private banks must be squeezed out, will be financial autocrats and, if they do not like the way in which clients conduct their businesses or do any of the things for which men may dislike other men, they will be unable to continue in 'business.

The merchants, having fewer purchasers dismissed some of their employees. They, in. their turn, could not patronize tbe butcher, the baker and the milkman. So the viciou? circle went round. That was the reason. It was not a local depression; it was world-wide. Perhaps the proposals now taking shape in the councils of the world will end the fear of depressions, but nothing can be done by local action in Australia itself. Therefore, when honourable gentlemen opposite interject, "" Remember the depression "", and, by inference, express their belief that by the manipulation of the currency they will end depressions, I tell them that, with this bill in force, the next depression, if one does occur, will be worse than the last, because it will affect, not only those who will lose their jobs, but also, if the banking system i . e used as is implied by the interjectors, those with savings in banks and life insurance companies and all kinds of people with fixed incomes, the value of which will depreciate as the result of the",52,Cameron No Will Form A Dragnet Which Can Be Used

I will not examine this bill clause by clause, because that has already been done, but I do sincerely ask the Treasurer not to treat this measure in committee in the arbitrary manner in which the Commonwealth Bank Bill was treated. ""When amendments are moved, even from this side, which do not directly cut across policy and which improve the measure, I ask him not to dismiss them with a wave of the hand but to give them serious consideration. surer) [9.24] -in reply-The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) asked the intentions of the Government in bringing down this legislation. That can be stated in a few words. The intention of this legislation is to ensure that very low rate of interest. the banking system of this country shall work in the interests of the people as a whole. It has been planned in such a way as to ensure that final authority as to monetary policy of the country shall rest with the Government, which is responsible to the Parliament and to the people. No longer will we leave the control of the monetary system of this country in the bands of individuals with no special training, whose interests are personal and material and are associated with ""big business "". The intentions of the Government are plain. I do not propose to traverse the ground that I traversed in my second-reading speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill, because I am quite sure that honourable gentlemen do not want a tedious repetition of previous arguments. I do propose, however, to reply to the tirade of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) about interest rates. I do not think that there has been anythina; better for the primary producers of this country than the control of interest rates under National Security Regulations. trolling interest rates. The right honourable gentleman either was not here or did not listen when I spoke. thought worth listening to about interestrates. One of the greatest abuses, both before and during tbe depression, was the exorbitant interest rates charged by the private banks of this country. In the last war the interest rates charged on treasury-bills issued to finance war expenditure constituted one of the greatest financial scandals that this country has ever seen. Compare the interest charges on treasury-bills to-day to those charged then by the private banks. not overlook the fact that the Government gets deposits from the trading banks at 15s. per cent. gentleman knows well that if there had not been an increase of deposits by the private banks with the Commonwealth Bank the Commonwealth Government would still have issued treasury-bills at a beginning of the war the rate was not so low as now, but I do not think it was ever more than l £ per cent, and it was never more than If per cent., even in the earlier stages of the war, whereas, in the last war, the rates charged on treasury-bills were as high as 6 per cent. However, I did not rise to go over the same ground again, but to answer one or two points raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and one or two points raised by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). One of the point* raised by the Leader of the Opposition was in relation to clause 27, under which. . . . the Commonwealth Bank may determine the policy in relation to advances to be followed by banks and each bank shall follow the policy so determined. That clause states specifically that thf Commonwealth Bank is not entitled to interfere with advances by the private banks to individuals. If the right honourable gentleman looks at the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Bankins; Systems, T think he will be satisfied. I also invite the honourable member for New England to take his mind back to that commission's operations.

180,Mr Chifley,"I admit that at thesystem of Australia was all right. After examination, however, they became con\ inced of the room for great reform. The honourable member for New England was one of those who could take an impartial view at that time, but I am afraid that his association with politics has rather tainted that impartiality. That could not he said of me, because I had already been associated with politics. So he can say that I was influenced by political considerations I have always favoured the reform of our banking system. Bitter experience during my membership of this Parliament prior to the setting up of the royal commission confirmed all my worse fears about the manner in which the banking system could operate. On the question of controlling the general policy in regard to advances, the commission recommended that the Commonwealth Bank should advise ns to the general terms of advances, but should not interfere with rhe granting of particular advances. Not only should the bank itself have power to control the volume of credit, but also it is essential in the economic interests of the country that it should have a voice in the distribution of the volume of fredit, ihe general policy of advances. The honourable member will recall that this matter was the subject of a great deal of consideration by the commission. AsE said previously, certain private banks were encouraging people to engage in an avenue of primary production which later was shown to be completely uneconomical. This led to grave financial disaster and to a prejudice against certain forms of primary production. 1 r.ny frankly that the bank itself could not decline to take action to prevent extreme inflationary or deflationary tendencies in the economic life of the community. That is the general opinion of all those who have studied the principles of the control of banking. The honourable member for New England claimed that certain economists have been associated with the preparation of this legislation. I remind him that there were not many economists associated with the inquiry by the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, yet that body came to the very clear decision that a great deal of reform was required in our banking structure. has not accepted those recommendations. stantially accepted. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) raised certain points in regard to clause 28. He spoke of the private banks being able to purchase securities, and suggested that under this legislation, they could not purchase shares on the stock exchange. The right honourable gentleman admitted himself that it was not the practice of the private banks to do that, and pointed out that the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank would have power to purchase shares. I dealt with this matter previously and indicated that the Industrial Finance Department was designed to assist certain classes of industry. The only point I wish to make now is this: The word "" securities "", I am informed, is not deemed to cover shares. The Leader of the Opposition also spoke about the mobilization of foreign currency. This measure gives to the Commonwealth Bank power to deal with any excess accumulation overseas of trading bank funds. The Leader of the Australian Country party referred to the mobilization and exchange agreement which was in operation some time ago, but that agreement only gave the bank power to acquire exchange to service debts overseas. The Government does not regard that power as sufficient. It is generally recognized by the United Kingdom and by other important overseas countries, that power to control foreign exchange must be wider than that. The Leader of tbe Opposition referred also to pastoral companies. This matter bears some relation to what was said by the Leader of the Australian Country party, namely, that there was no definition ef "" banking"" in the bill; but neither is there a definition of "" banking '* in the Commonwealth Constitution. It seems to me that the matter could only be decided finally by the High",54,Cameron No Will Form A Dragnet Which Can Be Used

I recall that when the commission was meeting, in a building in Collins-street, Melbourne, a building society had on exhibition a notice inviting deposits of money, and offering a higher rate of interest than that then being paid by the trading banks. Organizations such as that arc actually engaged in some phases of the business of banking. They accept deposits and make advances, but of course they do not carry on general trading bank business. Some pastoral companies are in a similar position. It is quite a common thing for a pastoral company when it receives money on behalf of a client, to retain that money and to pay the client interest upon it. I do not suggest that these companies invite deposits from the public; but certainly they do accept deposits, and in that sense they take part in the business of banking. Licences are issued automatically to institutions engaged in general trading bank business, but the other organizations have to be investigated to ascertain whether or not they actually carry on any banking business. Then they may be either exempted, or given authority to carry on their activities under certain conditions. We had some experience of these institutions, largely in regard to interest rates, in the administration of the Banking Control Regulations. I refer to this matter because we on this side of the chamber believe-I have no doubt the belief is shared also by honourable members opposite who have overdrafts at their banks-that the rate of interest is a very important matter. Under the Banking Control Regulations the Commonwealth Bank, in consultation with myself as Treasurer, has clone its best to ensure that interest rates shall be kept as low as possible without doing a grave injustice to anybody. Obviously, if interest rates were forced down suddenly, trading banks holding deposits for, say, twelve months or two years would suffer a proMr Vhifley. The insertion in the portionate drop in their deposits, .and, therefore, could sustain grievous financial harm. That has not been done. Carefully balanced judgment has been used in regard to this matter, and as soon as The it is seen that a reduction of interest rates is giving financial benefit to the trading banks over a period, then automatically advance rates are forced down. That system has been of substantial advantage to people who have bank overdrafts or loans. It has affected the whole interest rate. Honourable members will agree that the interest charged by the banks has a very important bearing on interest rates on money lent by private organizations such as pastoral companies and trustee companies and, in fact, upon the whole interest structure of the community. For the sake of the primary producers themselves the honourable member for New England should be one of the first to support a policy which has brought interest rates down to their present level, and I hope, will force thern even lower. I made was that pastoral finance companies were within the terms of the bill. The Treasurer agrees with that? organizations as well. I have given reasons why these institutions have been included.

190,"Mr Chifley""","The Leader of thecompanies. The honourable member for New England now asks whether cash order companies are covered. I must confess that the Government did not have in mind such matters. The honourable member for Richmond expressed great sympathy with people who suffered in the last depression, but added that it 1 could not have been rectified in Australia because it was a world-wide condition. This country's financial policy, therefore, according to the honourable member, in common with those of others, contributed to the world depression, which affected the price of primary products. In my reply to the second-reading debate on the Commonwealth Bank Bill, I stated that the control of monetary policy cannot alone cure the economic ills from which any country might suffer, but it is a most powerful economic weapon to prevent a deflation such as occurred in the years 1.929-30. If other countries had adopted an enlightened economic and financial policy they could have played their part in preventing that depression. The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems made it perfectly clear that although it did not believe that monetary policy could have relieved or prevented the depression, a different form of monetary policy in 1929 could have done a great deal towards mitigating it. Does any honourable member deny that if some action such as the issue of treasurynbills had been taken in the earlier stages of the depression, instead of too late, there would have been a tremendous lessening of the depression, despite the prices obtained for our exports? Government and the design of this bill, in conjunction with the Commonwealtb Bank Bill is to prevent further depressions. No one who has given any thought to financial policy, or who bad any association with the Premiers plan could help but admit that the policy followed in 1929 was wrong. The honourable member for Richmond stated that the government of that day did all that it could to prevent a' depression, but it was hindered by eight men who were not responsible to any one in Australia. any depression of the currency. trolling the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks prevented the seven governments of Australia from having any voice in determining financial and economic policy. They were beholden entirely to seven or eight members of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and who were never responsible to the people. I have recently been looking into the way in which they were appointed. They did not submit themselves for selection or election to any body except the Cabinet and the general managers and boards of private trading banks, whose business it is to make a profit, irrespective of what happens. could not make a profit out of the depression. somewhat facetiously-bu t the statement contains an element of truth-that people who lend money for the purpose of making profit are like a man who lendsan umbrella on a fine day but who asksfor its return as soon as the rain begins to fall. That is an excellent illustration,, and it is true of any money-lending institution. I am not charging the trading banks with dishonesty. It is the business of a bank manager to makea profit for the share-holders, topreserve the solvency of his bank and maintain the confidence of his customers. No matter what the national interests might be those are his dutiesas a paid officer of the bank.

It is better that risks should be taken under a national financial system in the interests of the nation's Holt, H . E. welfare than that thousands of people should starve or be maintained on a miserable pittance. It would be better to keep them engaged in useful and productive work. Honourable members may go on living in the dark ages of banking if they choose, but throughout the world there is a growing belief that ihc control of finance is safest when it is placed in the hands of the elected representatives of the people. Only recently General de Gaulle intimated that the national control of finance in France was a matter of prime importance requiring immediate attention. I do not care what reason is given-whethe r it is cupidity or stupidity-the financial system of this and other countries has been operated purely for the purpose of profit and with a total disregard of the interests of the masses.

Clause7 (Banking business not to be carried on without authority). the Opposition) [10.5] -This clause provides that a body corporate -shall not -carry on any banking business in Australia unless it is in possession of an authority in writing, or, in effect, a licence. Clause8 provides that the Treasurer niay receive applications for licences and may grant or refuse them. So far as I can see the bill contains no provision whatsoever for an appeal against a decision of the Treasurer to refuse a licence. In my second-reading speech I referred to this point, and also -brought to the notice of the Government the position of the great, pastoral finance companies that operate in Australia. The Treasurer agreed that such companies are -covered by this bill. The reason for that is to be found in the expression "" any banking business "". At one stage I was puzzled by the absence from the bill of a definition of "" banking business"", the point referred to hy the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), but on reflection and on consideration of the English statutes dealing with the subject, I can appreciate the Government's difficulty. It would not be easy to define "" banking business ""A definition might narrow the matter far more than was anticipated. It is quite clear, however, that the pastoral finance companies carry on some descriptions of banking business, such as, for example, the receipt of deposits, the provision of some kind of cheque service, or some other financial operations assofiated with banking. Provision is made in the bill that licences shall be issued as a right to the trading banks and that is proper, because they are very great concerns, and it is in the interests of the people that they should be allowed to continue their operations. Under this measure the pastoral finance companies, however, have no right to a licence. If the Treasurer were to say, tomorrow, to any one of half a dozen pastoral finance companies in Australia, which have made advances of perhaps £30,000,000 to our rural producers, ""3 decline to grant you a licence "", that company would have no right of appeal against his decision. When the Parliament gives to the Executive of the day, as it is doing in this bill, the power to grant or refuse licences, or authority to carry on business which, without such licence,, could not be carried on, provision should \<o made also for an appeal against the refusal of a licence, particularly as the refusal might be quite arbitrary, for no rules governing the granting of licence? are being laid down. Clause8 makes it quite clear that a body which does not possess a licence may not continue thai part of its operations for which a licence is necessary. I am sure that some of my colleagues of the Australian Country party could not regard the refusal of a licence to the pastoral finance companies as of assistance to the man on the land Leader of the Australian Country party) riO.10] I agree entirely with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies).

It w ill be remembered that I drew attention to the report made by the Payne Commission in 1939, after it bad conducted an investigation of the Queensland wool industry. The relevant portion of that report is""Vell worth repeating. In paragraph 184, it statedThe wool brokers also act as bankers for -their grazier clients. Liberal financial accommodation is granted on the security of holdings and current advances are made on stock niortgages and wool liens. The wool brokers then allure with the banks the financing of die Queensland svool industry. Under this measure, those concerns will bave to apply for authority, and the Treasurer will be empowered to grant it cither conditionally or unconditionally, or arbitrarily to refuse it . The democratic procedure would be to have the right of appeal. With all due respect to the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), the Leader of rhe Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), it cannot be claimed that all pastoral companies conduct banking operations. nccept, and never have accepted, money on deposit. They make loans, either out of their own funds or from money borrowed from the banks. Wharton's Law Dictionary defines "" banker "" asA person who receives the money of his customers ou deposit and pays it out again in a manner agreed upon. The definition in. the Internal Revenue Act of the United States of America isEvery person, firm or company, having a place of business where credits are opened by the deposit or collection of money or currency. Subject to be remitted or paid upon draft, eheque, or order, or where money is advanced or loaned upon stocks, bonds, bullion, bills of exchange or promissory notes, or where stocks, bonds, bullion, bills of exchange or promissory notes are received for discount or for sale. The Oxford English Dictionary has this definition of "" bank "" The establishment for the custody of money received from, or on behalf of, its customers. Its essential duty is the payment of the orders given on it by the customers. The implication of those definitions seems to be, that a bank is an institution which receives money on deposit. Some pastoral firms in Australia at one time gave cheque-drawing facilities to their clients, such as are given, by a bank, but the evidence given before the Royal Commisson on Monetary and Banking Systems made it plain that as f a r back as 1936-37 such services by pastoral houses were rapidly disappearing. The Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) w ill agree that probably not more than two or three pastoral firms in New South Wales now follow the practice. are only two, surely the point is a good one? good one. I am merely putting the other point, that it would be entirely wrong to claim that certain pastoral firms transact banking business. They should not be prevented from carrying on their legitimate business, and they should not be forced to apply for a licence. The point made by the Leader of the Opposition, and supported by the Leader of the Australian Country party, applies only to certain houses which may be doing a form of banking business and may desire to have a licence. Thei n Certain of them do not sertion of a provision protecting those companies that I have in mind, from being penalized by being forced to obtain a licence, is both necessary and desirable. clue deference to the submission of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), I submit that there is a f u l l right of appeal. The .authority for the granting of the licence conferring the right to carry on banking is the Governor General, who is the highest authority in the land, higher even than the courts. There w ill be nothing to prevent any institution from re-applying from time to time, submitting fresh facts and adducing additional reasons for the granting of the authority. That would be in the nature of an appeal to the Governor General. It is not within the province of the courts, particularly the H i g h Court, to deal with the issue of licences giving authority to carry on business. The province of the courts is to interpret the law, and to deal with disputes between litigants. If it were to grant licences, that would be an entirely new procedure.",59,Paths

There is no reason why authority should be vested in either the High Court or any other outside body. [10.17] I agree with the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) ; but his point might be investigated a little further. By passing clause 6, the committee has already agreed that, after the commencement of this act, only bodies corporate may engage in banking business. If the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini) has a look round the capital cities, he will find that banking business of some kind is carried on by bodies that are other than corporate, in some instances by persons. I am very doubtful whether the Government is seized of the full implication of what it is enacting. MaybeH is, and does not care. From its point of view, the arguments of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) may be excellent, namely, that appeal may be made to rhe Governor General, who has already refused to grant a licence. It should not go down in the records of this Parliament that the Governor General handles such matters; they are handled by the Ministers who advise him, and he merely holds a courtesy position in respect of them. The decision rests with the Treasurer, and is dictated by the seventy-odd Labour members of this Parliament, of whom the honourable member for Reid is one. The knowledge of many of my friends opposite in regard to banking and pastoral matters is somewhat meagre. Matters such as' this should not be passed over lightly. The whole question is, what are the rights of certain people? Businesses that have been conducted for a long time are involved. If the argument of the honourable member for Reid is accepted, it stands to reason that a business may be closed down for lack of a [126] be an licence and its owner will have to pull political strings in order that tbe Treasurer may agree to, and the GovernorGovernorGeneral ultimately issue, a licence. But what is to become of the customers of such a firm while this gentle process of persuasion is proceeding to a successful or some other conclusion? The Government has not given the matter very much thought. This is more a rough than a ready way of achieving a political objective. The real objective of the Government, unstated in the clause, is to force banking of all forms into the Commonwealth Bank. If , by acts of misjudgment, certain persons and firms are prevented from carrying on banking business, such conduct will not be likely to endear the Commonwealth Bank to them. The Treasurer may think that immediately a business is closed down, the persons involved will rush off at great speed to lay their worries at the door of the Commonwealth Bank. Under this proposal they are much more likely to go in another direction. Little consideration has been given to this matter, unless we proceed on the assumption that the Government intends to close down their business. -Claus e 7 provides that a body corporate shall not, at any time after the expiration of six months from tbe commencement of this part of the bill, carry on any banking business in Australia, unless it is in possession of an authority in writing granted by the Governor General to carry on banking business. For eaih day during which the. contravention continues the penalty is £5,000. Paragraph 403 of the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, statesPastoral finance companies borrow on overdraft at certain times during the year when their customers' demands are at the maximum. They do not usually seek deposits from the public but accept them from their ow-n -customers. Paragraph 104 of the report reads as follows:Short-term or seasonal advances are made usually to pastoralists or farmers who will use the services of the companies. These advances are made sometime before the produce is sold, and are generally used by the primary producer as working capital.",60,Paths

212,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [10.21 J.,"The total amount of seasonal advances outstanding varies considerably during the year, usually reaching a peak in tlie third quarter, and falling to the lowest point during the first three montlis of the year. [ point out that the third quarter is the period of the year when the producers are put to the maximum expense, because the shearing then takes place. In the last two or three years Australia has passed through a period of unprecedented drought, and in the months immediately ahead the primary producers will need assistance from banks, pastoral companies, or stock and station agents to enable them to restock their properties. Yet this clause states that a body corporate, unless it has an authority in writing granted by the Governor General, shall not at any time after the expiration of six months from the commencement of this legislation carry on any banking business in this country. If a stock and station agent is to be regarded as carrying on a banking business it will be necessary for him to apply for authority to do so. If a pastoral company or a stock and station agent felt doubtful as to whether the necessary authority would be granted, the interests of many primary producers would be seriously prejudiced. That uncertainty cannot be tolerated, because the next few months will be all-important to' the producers. The uncertainty will be increased by the fact that a penalty of £5,000 is to be provided for each day during which the contravention continues. The report of the royal commission stated that in 1936 the total of outstanding loans made by pastoral companies in Australia was not less than £25,232,000. That shows how great a part the pastoral companies, and particularly the large wool-broking firms, play in the financing of the wool industry. Overseas businessmen who have visited Australia have been surprised at the readiness of these companies to grant financial assistance to the producers. It is possible for a client, whose standing in the community has been investigated by a pastoral company, to obtain finance running into an amount exceeding the value of his wool-clip, without even being asked to furnish his signature to a document. Treasurer is now present, I shall re-state some of my points. Because of the Mr Hutchinson. severe drought conditions which this country has experienced during the last two or three years there will be many claims on pastoral companies and stock and station agents for financial assistance. They will be dealt with according to the standing of the applicants. Undoubtedly, these companies will be called upon to provide a great deal of finance in the near future, hut if they are uncertain as to whether they will be granted an 'authority under this clause the consequences may be serious indeed. I hope that the Minister will explain the meaning of this most important clause and particularly that he will say whether or not it includes stock and station agents. kind of business in which they are engaged. If they are engaged in banking business, the clause will apply to them. advance money on bills, will the clause cover them ? bodies the clause unquestionahly covers them. particularly wool-broking companies which make advances on wool or stocksecurities on which the trading banks do not usually make advances. If the clause refers to them they may have to wait for six months before they can get an authority to carry on an important phase of their business. Any uncertainty as to their obtaining an authority might have serious results. trolled by the Banking Control Regulations. These people know exactly where they stand. regulations have been incorporated in this bill and will have the effect of law when this bill is passed. by regulations will not be covered by the bill. that this legislation will supersede any As the of those regulations? that it is a matter of common sense.

The honourable member's time has expired. I hope that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) w ill accept the suggestions of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). ro the next clause. must be read together.

Should they not apply for an authority, or should they be refused an authority, Miid afterwards continue in business, they will be subject to an exceedingly heavy penalty. Pastoral finance companies are responsible for the financing of numerous graziers and farmers; the total amount involved runs into many millions of pounds. important, part of our financial system, and should any of them be refused an authority considerable dislocation, amounting even to chaos, may result. Those who will suffer most w ill be tbe primary producers who do business with them, because they w ill be compelled to -seek financial accommodation elsewhere, fn that event, they w ill be able to turn only to the Commonwealth Bank, because under other provisions of this measure 'he private banks will be prevented from accepting additional business. The Commonwealth Bank, therefore, will be in a position arbitrarily to refuse to make -tdvances to them. I point out that the Governor General may not only refuse rn grant an authority but he may also at any time revoke an authority already given, apparently without reason. In practice, that means the Treasurer will have that power. I submit that this clause is a very powerful one. There should, be some right of appeal, either by a bank or by an institution. The Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr. Lazzarini) w ill see what I am referring to if he examines clause 8, which should be read in conjunction with clause 7. relates to the power of the Governor General to revoke the authority of any The two clauses body corporate. That means that the Treasurer of the day may wipe out of existence overnight any banking concern without right of appeal. People have the right to appeal to as high an authority as the H i gh Court against the decisions of the Taxation Department, of which the Treasurer is the political head, but banks or corporations have no right of appeal against an authority being refused or revoked and are completely at the mercy of the political head of the As the honourable Treasury. Under any system of fair play or any system which has respect for the institutions which we have set up to give all' sections of the community service there must be a tribunal of some sort to which they may appeal. A special judicial committee set up to handle such appeals may solve the problem, but the recognized, tribunal to which such appeals should go is undoubtedly the H i gh Court. A licence could be revoked because of political animus of the Treasurer against These companies form an a particular bank or company and it would simply have to take it . applies only in cases where banking business has ceased. be revoked conditionally or unconditionally. I hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Australian Country party. It in no way cuts across {he political principles of the Government, if its intention is to give a reasonable degree of justice to all parties concerned.

Without their aid, pastoralists would not have been able to contend with the vicissitudes of life in the way of drought and other setbacks. We need to have some definition of "" banking "". We know what banks have to do under this bill, but are companies, which make advances to pastoralists, banks? We have not yet received from the Treasurer ( Mr Trading banks get a licence as a Chifley) a definition of "" banking"". I think honourable members will agree that those companies have carried pastoralists for years, specially in periods of drought. If they are not 'to receive authority to carry on, they may have to go out of business and those to whom they have made advances without any security will also be in difficulty. There is nothing in this bill to ensure that such firms shall receive licences within six months. I know people whose applications to build even a verandah have been held up for nine months. nothing to do with this clause. to the Treasurer to make it clear whether the institutions mentioned come within the definition of those carrying on "" banking business treated as banks, and a permit is not to be issued to them, a great injustice will be done not only to them but also to the primary producers in the far outback who have suffered severely in this drought and will have to be carried by the companies with further advances, also unsecured, in the hope that eventually they will get back what they have loaned. the Opposition) [10.48] -As the Trea-urer ( Mr Chifley) is present, I take leave to put the position very briefly before him. Clause7 deals with the licensing of the banking businesses and uses the expression "" any banking business "". As the right honourable gentleman will recall, in clause 10 a distinction is made in terms between a person who desires to carry on "" any banking business and a person who desires to carry on "" the general business of banking "" in Australia, and it is for that reason that the right honourable gentleman has already agreed that clause 7 does cover such bodies corporate as pastoral finance companies, which carry on some banking business. The point which has been raisedand in relation to it the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has foreshadowed an amendment to clause 8-is this: should there not be an appeal against the refusal of the Treasurer to grant a licence to some company placed iu that position? right. Companies like pastoral companies will not get, a licence as a right. It may be refused, or, having been granted, it may be revoked, .and there is no provision for appeal. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) took the view that to provide for some appeal to the High Court in a matter of this kind would be quite unprecedented, but there again I remind the Treasurer that clause 53 provides that, when a trading bank has been convicted of a breach of this proposed statute, the High Court, consisting of not less than three Justices, is to have the right to determine whether the Commonwealth Bank is to assume control of the business of that bank, so that the procedure of having some form of appeal to the High Court constituted of at least three justices If they are to be is already recognized in a rather similar clause later in the bill. picked it up. member for Richmond has said, this is not a matter which touches the real principles of this legislation. No matter of real Government policy is involved. It is merely a question of whether a business, or some concern which may have very far-reaching operations, should depend upon a single administrative discretion. I suggest that the Treasurer report progress, and give some consideration to the desirability of providing some kind of appeal. If he comes to the conclusion that an appeal is desirable, he will have ample opportunity between now and when the bill comes before the Senate to amend the legislation accordingly.

However, I am prepared to examine certain points that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( I l r. Menzies) before the bill goes to the Senate. Under the Banking Control Regulations, pastoral companies have not been licensed. The Government believes that there should be some power of direction iver those institutions. Generally speaking, they could I suppose be covered by licences but that has not been the practice provided that the companies concerned .agreed to some general principle in regard to conditions. We must keep in mind the general policy in regard to advances. It is indicated in the existing regulations, many of which will be replaced by this legislation. There has not been any complaint from the pastoral -companies about the general administrative control. will operate in peace-time, after the operation of the regulations has ceased. that. I have already made the point that in both peace and war the general policy in regard to advances should be a matter for direction and supervision by the Commonwealth Bank. From an administrative point of view the position in peace-time will be the same under this legislation as exists now. These companies will be exempt from licences under certain conditions. Interest rates can be controlled under another section of the banking legislation It would not be fair to impose restrictions upon banks conducting general trading business and to -exempt other institutions engaged partly in banking business. Honourable members opposite have accused the Government of not being solicitous of the welfare of the trading banks, but here is one instance in which it is protecting their interests. I shall examine the points that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposilion before this measure reaches the Senate, although I am not hopeful that any change will be made. I repeat that, in my opinion, the fears expressed by honourable members opposite are quite unfounded. Leader of the Australian Country party) [10.55] -When speaking on the second reading of this measure I asked whether wool-broking firms and hire purchase organizations would come within the scope of clause 7. I pointed out that certain wool-broking institutions which are now carrying on banking business are included, whereas hire purchase organizations are not. On my interpretation of the clause, I cannot see how one can be included and the other excluded. Clause7 providesSubject to this Act, a body corporate shall not, at any time after the expiration of sH months from tlie commencement of this Pan. carry on any banking business in Australia unless the body corporate is in possession m an authority in writing granted by tbe Governor General under this Part to carry on banking business. The discounting of promissory notes i;. .certainly part and parcel of banking business, and if the obvious interpretation of the clause be correct, hire purchase and cash-order companies would come within the scope of the provisions as being bodies ^I quite understand carrying on banking business. They do not carry on general banking business, hut they certainly discharge other functions which are within the general functions of a banking business. I cannot setwhy hire-purchase companies which discount promissory notes are not included. member wish them included? The people of this country have the right to know which organizations are included and which are excluded from the provisions of this measure. The merits or demerits of the inclusion or exclusion of certain organizations is not the point at issue. honourable gentleman that in the framing of the legislation it was not intended to include those organizations, and 1 thanked him for his suggestion. -The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said that .this clause applies to pastoral companies.

247,Mr Abbott (New England) [10.58].,"I do not know whether or not the Treasurer intends that these organizations should be licensed. Then, of course, there are stock and station agents, many of whom accept money on deposit, and finance their clients. Clause1 providesSubject tn this act, a person other than a body corporate shall not at any time after the expiration of six months from the commencement of this part, carry on any banking business in Australia. . . . Pastoral companies are rendering a considerable service to many primary producers in this country. If they are to be prevented from carrying on as at present, quite a lot of pastoral activity in the Commonwealth will be tied up. Then we come to the question whether an organization discounting promissory uotes, &c, is a banking institution and will have to be licensed under this legislation. Por instance, importers buy 60day wool bills on sight on London, at a small rate of discount. Are these people to be prevented from carrying on their business? In my opinion, licensing should apply only to institutions giving a full time banking service. There seems to be no end to the organizations which may be included if that principle is departed from. I am not raising these matters as bogies. They need investigating, but I do not think the Government has ever considered them. member and I took a great interest in the pastoral companies years ago. that time we have learned a good many things.

Apart from employees of the Department of Information, how many journalists arc attached to Ministers and departments and what is the total of their salaries? 2. What is the total annual cost of publicity, apart from the Department of Information and loan publicity, for Ministers and departments? 3. Why is it considered necessary to secure additional puhlicity officers for the Department of Post-war Reconstruction in all States? The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. 29; £18,730. Of tlie numiber of journalists employed eleven are engaged also on administrative duties. 2. £33,440. This figure includes the total amount of salaries shown in I above. In addition, the sum of £40,000 has been allocated under the Food Control vote for publicity for the period August, 1944, to June, 1945. This has been provided for the purpose of increasing the production of meat, milk, eggs and other commodities for which the demand is greater than the supply, stimulating domestic production of \ ogetabIes, eggs and r poultry, and attracting labour for peak periods -A publicity emphasis during recent months has l»oen on the need for increased cereal production.

The necessity for the appointment of additional publicity officers to the Department of Post-war Reconstruction in all States is due 1944. 1945. work of the department and the steady stream of detailed and general inquiries proceeding from all parts of the Commonwealth. In 69 84 order to meet this demand and the needs of 57 80 the various newspapers in the capital cities 31 78 on specific issues it has been found more 9 effective for a publicity officer to carry out 7 this work on the spot rather than from 1 5 Canberra, where f u l l knowledge of local con3 ditions and interests is not readily available. The work of public relations officers of this department includes the distribution of departmental publications of a general nature and in particular the distribution of material to and the general organization of discussion groups. Tliere are already upwards of 10,000 of these groups operating throughout Australia. Day-to-day inquiries from organizations and individuals concerning the problems of reconstruction can only be handled efficiently and with satisfaction to the public if there is a full-time officer in each capital city with a general and detailed knowledge of the Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice1. Has his attention been drawn to a rejiprt tabled at the meeting of the Queensland Wheat Board at Toowoomua on the 12th June, in which it is stated (a) that 80 per centum of replies received from wheat growers in that State showed dissatisfaction with prices which had ruled, particularly during the past two years, and pointed out that increased costs had not been compensated for by proportionately increased wheat prices; (6) .that practically all replies received referred to the uncertainty and interference under Commionwealth control, and that, in particular, tlie quota system of payment to growers for wheat delivered was generally condemned; (c) that there are indications that the wheat area would be expanded if permanent certificates of registration and licence were granted to genuine producers or if small growers with land available for expansion were allowed to increase their basic acreages; and (<i) that until a price is declared which covers a number of seasons, growers will not have that sense of security which must be the first essential in laying a proper foundation for any primary industry if it is to survive as of production in iproceasing plants.

What was the average price realized on bagged basis f.o.r. ports for such exports? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The continuance of these regulations is considered essential to ensure that spare parts for tractors are allocated as a first priority to the Army and Royal Australian A i r Force who * reas. 2 to 5.

Total expenditure to the 29th May, 1945, on Commonwealth vegetable farms in North Queensland was £102,574. This amount includes capital expenditure on establishment of the projects, including farm buildings and accommodation for workers, machinery and farm equipment, irrigation facilities, &c, in iiddition to materials, fuel, &c. Much of this total is non-recurring expenditure which was necessitated, in order to bring quickly into the large scale production of vegetables some extensive areas which were not previously equipped tor such production.

272,Mr Beasley,"On the 22nd J u n e theThe Ministerf o r Supply and Shipping has examined this position and has supplied the following answer:Up to date 154 vehicles have been declared surplus in Tasmania and 131 of these have already been sold, the majority having been sold to primary producers. In addition to these, ten 3-ton trucks released in Victoria have been sold to essential users in Tasmania. The Commonwealth Disposals Commission is continually reviewing the question of distribution in order to ensure that all parts of the Commonwealth receive a fair share of the vehicles available. If additional stocks do not become available in Tasmania arrangements will be made to release additional supplies from the mainland. upon noticeWill he have an immediate review made of the pay-as-yjou-earn provisions of the income tax law, to ascertain whether producers in drought-stricken areas are being inequitably treated through being compelled to meet an unduly high provisional tax based, not on present, income, but on that, for the previous year? In cases where it is obvious that, because of drought conditions, a large proportion of the provisional tax will 1 I refundable, will the Treasurer, in consultation with tlie Commissioner of Taxation, endeavour to devise ft formula whereby such provisional tax will be reduced by the appropriate amount of tbe ultimate refund? promise to the right honourable member, I. have inquired into the position, and [ am of the opinion that an amendment of the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to the imposition of provisional tax is not. necessary. I point out that taxpayers carrying on business are in practically the same position this year as would have applied if the old system of taxation had continued to operate. Under the old system, a taxpayer would have been required to pay tax this year on income derived by him during the year ended the 30th June, 1944. visional tax for this year is an amount equal to the tax that would have been imposed on the taxable income of the year ended the 30th June, 1944. The main difference between the two systems is, of course, that if a taxpayer suffers a loss this year, the provisional tax paid by him will be refunded next year. This would not h:ive been the position under the old system. The Commissioner of Taxation has power under the act to grant extensions of time for payment of tax or to accept payment by instalments if he is satisfied that the circumstances of the case j u s t if y such action. The Commissioner has instructed his deputies to defer payment of the part or whole of the provisional tax payable for the year ended the 30th June, 1945, where primarj ' producers establish that their taxable incomes for that year w ill be substantially less than their taxable in comes for the preceding year, provided that representations are made by the taxpayers concerned and their financial of payment is warranted. asked the Treasurer, honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. Harrison) asked a question, upon notice, concerning the amount of recreation leave granted to members of the 7th Brigade, as compared with an Australian Imperial Force brigade. An interim reply was furnished on the 5th June. The Acting Ministerf o r the Army has now supplied the following In accordance with my additional answer:Tlie comparison of the leave position ol the 7th Australian Infantry Brigade and an original Australian Imperial Force brigade serving in a similar area is as follows:7th Australian Original Infantry A.LF.

274,Mr Cklfley,,72,Australian Army 7 Th Brigade Leave
275,Mr Dedman,"On the 30th May, theTbe leave position in the original Australian Imperial Force brigade referred to is the more favorable, because many members were granted their total period of accrued recreation leave when the brigade was last on the mainland as * complete unit. The normal procedure is to grant a maximum of 24 days' leave to membersgranted leave under the quota system, by which a certain percentage of a. unit may be on leave at a time, but when a whole unit is relieved and returned to the mainland of Australia this maximum is not normally adhered to. TheS Mitry Brigade will depend on whether complete units arc relieved and returned to tbe mainland for leave and also on.the operational situation at the time the leave is granted.

A permit was issued not because tbe factory had received an order from the Royal Navy for £10,000 worth, of tubular chairs, but because the applicant company was engaged in. manufacturing various high-priority prr* ducts,' and because the existing facilities"" available to the company, while sufficient for the manufacture of tubing, are most inadequate and cramped for the production of manipulated tubing.
