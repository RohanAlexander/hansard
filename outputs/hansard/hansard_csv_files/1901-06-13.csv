Five honourable members having risen in their places. Question proposed, tion has been lodged against tlie return of the honourable member for Fremantle; but the petition does not comply with the requirements of the West Australian Act. The honorable member was elected by 2,800 votes, the next candidate on the poll being Mr. O'Byrne, with something over 1,800 votes; and then came Mr C. E.Jones, with over 400 votes. The last candidate on the poll, who obtained only 104 votes, has lodged a petition against the return of the honourable member who headed the list. Qualifications Committee sitting 1 I want the House to deal with this matter. If the petition is referred to the Elections and Qualifications Committee, the honourable member for Fremantle, who was elected by such a large majority of votes, will be put to a very greatexpense, and, sofaras we can judge from his action, the person who has lodged the objection must regard it as a frivolous one, because he has not complied with the requirements of section 146 of 63 Victoria, No. 20, the West Australian Act, by making the £ 5 0 deposit required thereby. TheA c t provides that no election return shall be disputed except by petition, and that no petition shall be noticed, and no proceedings taken upon it , unless it is signed by a candidate in the election in dispute, and each signature attested by two witnesses whose occupations and addresses are stated.

20,Mr Conroy ( W E R R I WA ),"I have to Western Australian law requires, as does tlie law of every Statei n the Commonwealth, that a deposit shall be paid by any candidate opposing the return of a member, and that procedure ought to have been followed in this case. There is no reason why it should have been departed from. The petitioner was not next on the poll to the honourable member who has been returned, nor was he even the third candidate. He was fourth on the list, and, out of 5,000 votes, he polled only something like 104. In defiance of the Western Australian law on the subject, this House is asked to increase the expense which the sitting member must have incurred by compelling him to 'go before tlie Elections and Qualifications Committee. The fact that the petitioner has not paid a deposit is also strong evidence tion whether the petition should or should that he has no belief in the justice of his case. Otherwise his deposit would have been forthcoming, because it is not forfeited unless the petition is dismissed as frivolous. As a candidate, tlie petitioner must have been perfectly aware of the state of the law. No two persons could be found to sign a petition and to support the facts alleged against the return of the successful candidate, as required ""by the law. On these grounds, I do not think it is right that the honourable member against whose return the petition is lodged should be made to incur further expense. that Mr Adcock may not urge that the section relied upon by the honourable member for Werriwa has not been amended or repealed ? doubt about that. honourable and learned member that the deposit required by the law has not been made 1 to fair play from this House. have correctly stated the facts : and I submit that it is competent for the House to deal with the matter forthwith. for inquiry by the committee. of order. There may be a great deal in what the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has stated; but is it a proper thing to have the petition debated in this House before it is investigated by the Elections and Qualifications Committee ? Although there may not be a standing order on the subject, it is in accordance with the natural principles of justice that the petitioner should have a hearing, free from any possible influence that might occur through a debate in this House. I suggest the propriety of stopping any debate if it is possible to do so. the question before the House is simply that this petition be referred to the Elections and Qualifications Committee. On that motion it is fully competent for any honourable member to advance reasons why the petition should or should not be so referred. It would not be right to restrict debate so long as it is confined to the quesnot be referred to the committee. of course, does not know what is alleged in the petition. We do not know whether it is even in order. If the petition be out of order what right has it to come before the House at all ? Why should it be here ? I agree with the honourable member for Bland that we should not discuss a question that is subsequently to be the subject of consideration by the committee. But how does, the petition come before us at all if it beout of order ? I should be glad if you, Mr. Speaker, would explain the procedure in reference to petitions, and how it is that if, as alleged, the petition is not in order, itcomes before the House at all. ad visable that as a question of law is involved the Attorney-General, and not I , should answer the honourable member's quesproof has the tion. on a point of order, ask a question t If the= petition formally complies with the rule as. to general petitions presented to the House, is it not in order to receive it t The question of its formality according to the local law of Western Australia is one for the' committee to determine, but as long as the. petition complies with the general ruleregarding petitions presented to this HouseI submit that it is in order. the petition complies with the electoral law, and that will be settled by the committee. offered to-day, since we have adopted draft?",16,Pacific And Eastern To A Petitio N Against The R E T U R N Of A

But the petition was presented in tlie way that has been previously described, and when we had no standing orders and no rules of procedure. Therefore, I have to rule that it is now duly before the House. ral) -It is scarcely necessary to answer in detail the questions raised by the honourable andlearned member for Werriwa, but it may be desirable to point out that, assuming the case he has put to be correct, there can be no possible objection on our part to remitting the question to the Elections and -Qualifications Committee. If Western Australian law, as the honourable and learned member assumes, governs this petition, there is no doubt the committee will have a very easy task in disposing of it . The whole question is whether the Western Australian law is to hind us in dealing with petitions of tins particular kind; and that question surely can be very much better settled by the committee, which will have time to consider it, than by this Housei n an impromptu -debate. leaning,and express no opinion upon the subject, but one objection of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to the course ' proposed to be taken is on the score of expense to the petitioner. There need be no expense at all if the Iionorable and learned member's contention be correct. The committee will not require to call before it even the honourable member against whose return the petition is lodged in order to settle this preliminary question of law. The committee can decide that for itself if necessary. If the contention of tlie honourable and learned member be correct, he appears to have deprived himself, if I may say so, :of his own argument. If his contention be not correct, it will be of the greatest importance and value to this House to have determined in some degree, at all events, how far and in what manner electoral petitions of this nature and in this form are to be dealt with. We have a committee in whom we all have confidence. Thatcommitteewilldo no injustice, and will take care that it involves no honourable member in any unnecessary expense. pointed out by the Attorney-General, and as the honourable member affected is not Hkely to incur any expense, I have no reason for further objection to the motion jection to offer to this proposal if it be clearly understood that the Elections and Qualifications Committee will make a preliminary report on the question of law; but there may be some doubt as to whether the committee should not take evidence. There should really be an instruction to the committee to take the course suggested by the Attorney General unless the committee will themselves undertake to do so. what will be done. desire to be persistent in regard to this matter, but it will be well for the House to have some information with regard to tlie aspect of the case which has been suggested. Suppose, for instance, that a petition were lodged against your return, Mr Speaker, or against mine, and there was no deposit accompanj'ing the petition, it being presented in a form which carried no consequences to the petitioner, would a petition Of course I can indicate no of that kind get as far as the Elections and Qualifications Committee 1 Clearly, it ought not to do so. it that if a petition is presented to this House, and formally complies with the standing orders regulating petitions, it must be entertained. I take it also that this petition being properly before the Housei t must be referred to the committee on disputed elections. Though the committee may decide that the local, law of Western Australia does not legally apply, they may decide that they have no absolute power with regard to the petition-that though the local law does not apply, they will not on general grounds entertain a petition which does not comply with that law. The committee may say that inasmuch as if the local law did apply the petition should not on other grounds be entertained, it should be dismissed, and they may refuse to take evidence upon the facts set forth in the petition. as they like and the House can afterwards deal with their report. that the local law does not apply, the question of disputed elections still rests entirely with the House.

I throw out this suggestion because it may be that the committee will hold that local law does apply or that it does not apply; and if they hold that it does apply, perhaps tliey might be inclined to go into evidence upon the question. say, without committing myself to any expression of opinion on the legal aspect of the case, that all possible expedition ought to be made in connection with the matter. The Western Australian representatives are not very numerous in this House, and there is no saying when they may require every possible vote. In addition to that, the electorate of Eremantle has been totally unrepresented up to now; and if it should happen that this petition is irregular, a hardship will have been inflicted upon Western Australia and upon the people of Fremantle, inasmuch as the member for the constituency has been improperly kept from taking his sent.

I move That the words ""and by"" in line 2, and also the words '' in Parliament assembled "" in line <t, be omitted, o The point was raised by the honourable and learned member for Corio whether the words "" in Parliament assembled"" were really necessary. the Attorney-General would not consider the suggestion which I made to substitute "" the Parliament of the Commonwealtli"" for "" the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia."" The striking out of the words "" in Parliament assembled "" is logical, but it does not help us regarding the dead-lock provisions. Those words may really have a significance in regard to a dead-lock or referendum. In tlie case of a Bill coming to the Governor General from a joint sitting of both Houses, it may be said that the Parliament was "" assembled,"" but if it comes from a referendum, Parliament would not have been "" assembled,"" and the retention of the words here would show that there was a distinction. Let us suppose that there was a dead-lock between the two Houses. There is a provision in the Constitution that if the Senate does not agree to a B i ll passed by the House of Bepresentatives after a certain period, that Bill can be referred to the people notwithstanding such dissent. If the people endorse that B ill it would not have been passed by tlie Parliament assembled, but under a special provision which finds a place in the Constitution. There is really some sense, therefore, in the retention of these words. But the better way on the whole would be for us to say : "" Bei t enacted by tlie Parliament of tbe CommonI m o v e wealth."" If we wanted to show that a B ill had been passed upon a referendum it eould be expressly stated in the preamble to the Act itself. the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that his proposal is entirely an alteration of phraseology.

71,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"I suggest topoint Unit he has been discussing.' The honourable and learned member asks us to use in the enacting clause of the Bill the shortened phrase which is given i u the Constitution, instead of the enacting words employed here. The Constitution says that "" The Parliament"" shall mean "" The King, Senate, and the House of Representatives,"" and we merely repeat the definition of "" The Parliament"" instead of repeating the words "" The Parliament."" It is, therefore, only a question the Attorney-General and the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. If we have an amendment of the Constitution on a referendum, neither the Attorney General's phrase nor the honourable member's phrase will be suitable. Personally, as a matter of taste, I think that there is more dignity and more of a sonorous ring about "" The. King, the Senate, and the House of Representatives,"" than there is about "" The Parliament."" That, however, is a matter entirely of personal opinion. I would suggest that we shall need to have different enacting words when other circumstances arise, and there is really nothing dividing the two parties now as to the technical effect of the two forms of enactment. with the argument of the honourable and learned member for Corinella that this matter resolves itself into a pure question of taste. I share the opinion of the honourable and learned member that the form we have employed sounds more like the old form with which we are all familiar, and has more dignity about it than has the phrase suggested by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. BILL. Sir WILLIAM LY NE (Hume^-Minister for Home Affairs) I move That this Bill be now read a second time. In moving this motion I should like to say first that I think An Honorable MEMBER -The B ill has not been circulated yet. Sir WILLIAM LYNE Yes ; the Bill of sound of phrase between has been circulated for some days. An Honorable MEMBER It is not in the chamber. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It appears to me that the civil service as it is now constituted under the Commonwealth will be to some extent different, and if I may say so more difficult to deal with than it could be under any one State. We all know that we have been accustomed for some years to have Public Service Boards. A t least, that has been the case in New South Wales, and I think in the other States with one or two exceptions. I have no doubt that honourable members of this Parliament, and also the people of this community, expect some such provision in the Bill which I am now submitting, but I am submitting it in a form somewhat difI am strongly in accord ferent from that of any of the Bills that have been before honourable members on previous, occasions. I wish to point out that in my humble estimation the working of some of the Public Service Acts in the States has not been as satisfactory as it might be. The system was instituted with a view if possible of removing the semblance of political influence. But I do not think that it is a good thing to substitute for that influence social influence, in regard to which neither Members of Parliament nor the public can exercise any control. No one is more favorable than I am-and I speak for the Ministry-to the As the amendments removal, so far as it can be removed, of the source of the trouble which is given to Ministers by the applications which are made to them by those who wish to get into the public service, i have had a great many years experience of Ministerial office, and I know that years, one of the greatest troubles of a Minister was the number of applications he received from persons who wanted to get into the public service. Half one's time was taken",21,Audit Bill
72,Mr Deakin,,22,Second Reading
73,Mr Deakin,"up i u replying to these applications, which in most case3 had to be refused. That trouble has not been altogether removed in New South Wales by the appointment of a Public Service Board-and 1 refer particularly to New South Wales, as I am not intimately acquainted with the working of the Actsi n force in the other States-because the public will not understand that Ministers cannot now make appointments to , the public service, as they used to do in times past. But I have known cases, and I have heard of others, in which influence has been brought to bear to obtain the appointment of outsiders from a source which is more dangerous to tlie community than either -parliamentary or Ministerial influence; because Members of Parliament can deal with Ministers, and the electors can deal with their representatives, while the insidious influence to which I refer is most difficult, and almost impossible, to deal with. It is for this reason that the measure which I have introduced differs in some respects from that of similar Acts now in force in the States. of the States where there is in force an Act for tlie administration of the public service there are three Public Service Commissioners. I propose, however, to throw the whole responsibility upon one man, and have provided for only one commissioner, who, I hope, will be a good man. I may say that at the present moment I have not the slightest idea as to where I am to obtain such a manI mean that I have no one in my mind. Mr G. B.

Sir AY1LLIAM LYNE T believe that it is not too much. However, that is the sum which I propose shall be paid, but if honourable members think that we should go higher, I shall not object to it being increased. But after the statements which were made last night about the absence of economy, and the recklessness shown by the Government, I begin to feel that one has to be fairly careful before making any proposal to pay a salary of more than £100 a year. MrA . McLEAN A very healthy feeling too. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I wish it to be understood that, personally, I am not in favour of low salaries. WheneverI have employed any one I have not given him low pay, but I have expected good work. WheneverI have had the opportunity to do so, I have given the public servants under me good wages, and I have expected to get good men. In this case I expect to get a good man, and whether I think that in most we pay him £1,500 or £2,000 a year is of little moment so long as he gives satisfaction. The commissioner will have to deal with the servants of the Commonwealth in the six States, and that makes it , if I may use the words, more difficult and more intricate to provide for this control than if all the servants of the Commonwealth were in one State. I propose that there should be inspectors under the commissioner, and I have inserted in the Bill the words-no t exceeding six-thoug h possibly two inspectors appointment will be able to do the work for some time to come.

78,Sir William Lyne,"Perhaps theSir WILLIAM member will keep an open mind on the subject 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE as the honourable member does. 1 have also made the Bill a little more elastic than is the New South Wales Act. I mean elastic in the sense that if it is necessary for the Governor General to step in-and Governor General means Governor-Generali n Council -h e is empowered to do so; but he must submit whatever action he has taken to Parliament for approval, and let Parliament decide whether it is right or wrong. I have done that for this reason. The Public ServiceA ct of New South Wales has created many anomalies which have caused great trouble in connection with the working of the departments. important matter which I tried to alter concerns the manner of dealing with tlie heads of departments. The New South Wales Public they first entered upon their duties, appointed sub-boards, composed of men whose positions were on a low rung of the departmental ladder-me n who were simply clerks-and sent them round the departments to spy out what was being done, and practically to spy upon the heads of the department's. The result of that system was, .that for a time the public service was fairly knocked to pieces, and the heads of departments had no control over their officers. The system was altered somewhat by the last administration, because we compelled the Public Service Board to send their communications in reference to a department through the uncler-secretary of that department. Formerly, the first intimation that an under-secretary would have that any alteration was to be made, in his department was by a notification from the sub-board, or perhaps by receiving some information from officers of his-own department. It is impossible, however, to keep up the efficiency of the public service, unle33 the heads of departments are given control over the officers of their departments; and, for that reason, in this BillI give the permanent heads of departments more power than has* been given to them in some of the State Acts. An honourable member last night said in reference to the Estimates then before honourable gentlemen, that, in his opinion, there were signs of the trail -of the American system of appointing officers to go out with the political authority nothing of that kind in the Bill, and my colleagues and myself are absolutely opI always do; just posed to allowing the measure to beeven tinged with the suspicion of the possibility of that happening under it . The position of gentlemen who have been appointed secretaries to the Ministers was referred to last night, and there seemed to be a misconception about it . I , therefore, wish to inform honourable members that these officers will enter the Commonwealth Public Service, and having done so, will be subject to all the pains and penalties attaching to the position, and will be under the orders of the commissioner, the inspectors, and the permanent heads of departments. There is no cause for beOne very lieving that any of these officers will go out with his political heads; and I might again refer to the position of an officer to whom I referred last night-that of my own Service Board, when secretary-wh o has been private secretary to three or four Ministers in succession in New South Wales. I cannot see that there! is any necessity for an officer leaving the service because his Ministerial head is changed, unless perhaps he took an extreme part in politics. If I might give advice to any one in such a position, I would say keep away from any extreme expression of opinion on public matters. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The Premier himself suggested that it would be desirable* that the secretaries should retire with the Ministers whom they served. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not hear what the Premier had to say, but from what I heard of the debate afterwards I knew that a misconception existed. planation, but I do not understand the situation as well now as 1 understood it before he spoke. that after I havefinished, the honourable member will understand all about this matter. I want to say a word about the other appointments which were referred to last night. Those officers will also enter the Public Service of the Commonwealth. If honourable members will refer to page 2 of the Bill, they will find the term "" officer"" defined asAny person employed in any capacity in the Public Service cf the Commor.wealth, whether appointed or transferred thereto, before or after the commencement of this Act.",23,Second Reading

80,Sir William Lyne,"Well, I am sureAnd under that provision those who have been appointed to carry out the , work which we have had to do since the 1st January will enter the Public Service of the Commonwealth like any other officers, and their positions will be subject to any alteration or re-arrangement of duties that the Governor General, at the instance of the commissioner, may approve of. The Bill is divided into five parts-the first part deals with matters of administration, the second part with the division of' the public service and appointments, the third part with internal administration, the fourth part with life assurance-thoug h I do not know why a division should have been given to that subject, because it is only a small matter ; while the fifth part comprises miscellaneous provisions. Mr Baucis SMITH Bill substitutes life assurance for pensions. Sir WILLIAM ! LYNE -Yes; but I will deal with that matter presently. I propose to refer to these divisions as they occur in tlie Bill, without going into too much detail, because I do not think that it is wise to go too much into detail in regard to the provisions of a measure which has been circulated amongst honourable members for nearly a fortnight. MrV . L . SOLOMON -But we have been kept pretty close at work here during that fortnight. We have not had much time to read this Bill. sioner and inspectors are appointed for seven years ; but the commissioner is placed over the inspectors, as he should be, and the inspectors are to carry out such work as the commissioner may direct. Besides that, the commissioner and inspectors are placed in positions in which they practically cannot be interfered with by the Governor General or the Ministry unless they do something wrong, as enumerated in one of the clauses. If any wrong is clone, the Minister can only suspend. If Parliament is not sitting at the time of the suspension, within seven days after Parliament sits the Minister must lay on the table of the House a report on the matter in question. If Parliament is sitting, the Minister must at once lay on the table of the House notice concerning the suspension. The notice must lay on the table of both Houses, and if within 42 days it is not confirmed by Parliament the inspector or commissioner is reinstated in his position. It was originally proposed to make the term ten days, but I felt that it was not a proper thing to curtail the time so severely, and I have therefore altered it to 42 days. If the Minister wishes to take action he must do it within that time. man in suspense a long time. Sir AV1LLIAM LYNE -The object is not to keep tlie man in suspense, but to prevent the possibility of the Minister being blocked . from dealing with tlie subject within a certain time. It is an easy thing for some members in some Parliaments to prevent a Minister from dealing with a subject, because he has to give certain notice, which would take a day or t w o ; and if the matter were blocked for the ten days, which is the term originally proposed, the man might improperly go back I suppose that the to the position he held. The general administration of the service is placed in the hands of one commissioner, assisted by six inspectors; but I want to impress this upon honourable members : That tlie inspectors are under the immediate orders of the commissioner, and they are to exercise the powers he directs and delegates to them. NowI come to the internal administration of the different departments. The administration is to be conferred upon bhe permanent head. It is a matter to which I was referring just now. If honourable members will look at clause 12 of the Bill they will find that it provides as follows :(1) The persons for the time being holding the several offices specified in the second schedule to this Act or any office which may be prescribed either in addition to or in place of any of such offices shall be permanent heads of departments/ (2) The permanent head of a department shall be responsible for the general working of such department, and for all the business thereof, and shall advise the Minister in all matters relating thereto. The clause does not mean that the permanent head is to be allowed to do exactly as he likes. The Minister must look to see that the work of the permanent head is properly done. I have inserted the clause after the experience I have had of the public service of New South Wales. We have sometimes had the head of the department fighting with the commissioners, and feeling that he has been oppressed by them. We could not have the work done as it should be done under such conditions. We have had that kind of thing happening in many cases in New Soubh Wales. A great deal has been said",24,Mcmillan The Honourable Which Appointed Them But There Is

82,Mr Mccoll,"The Minister keeps thein reference to the Government not having applied to tlie public service of tlie Australian States for under-secretaries. withstanding the criticisms which have been made, I may tell honourable members that I applied to the Public Service Board of New South Wales for an under-secretary to the Treasury, and was not able to get . such a man as I wanted for the service of the State. The position has not yet been filled up-or , rather, the man who is wanted is not yet there. Sir cult position. Sir WILLIAM LYNE that the position is a difficult one to fill; but I mention this instance in order to show that men who grow up in the public service have a tendency to get into a groove, and if -1 could put my finger on a good business . man outside the service and choose him to direct and organize a new department, such . as tlie Prune Minister's, the -Treasurer's, . or my own, I would far rather take such a . man, if he were really a good and powerful . man, and had not been brought up in the .public service. That is not a reflection in tlie slightest degree upon the public service, because I believe that the public service of Australia is as loyal and good a one as it is possible to find. A t any rate I speak for the civil service of New South Wales. anything to the credit of the service. because I am referring to work entirely different from that which the public service has usually had to do. WhatI have said is no reflection at all upon the public service. It is intended to appoint a permanent head for each department. The so-called permanent head will be the head of the central department, wherever it may be located. But when we have our own Pederal capital, as I hope we shall have, the central-place for the permanent head of the department will be that capital. He will reside there. But to get over difficulties that may arise, if we allow tilings to remain exactly as they are now, I propose that there shall be a chief officer in each of the States, because I recognise that we must depend to a large extent upon those who have been the permanent heads in the various States for carrying on the work in those States. The chief officer of each department will be in a special class, and will probably be the man who has been in tlie past the head of his particular department in his own State. Por instance, in New South Wales, Notthe chief officer of the Post-office will be Mr Dalgarno. I do not know the names of tlie chief officers in the other States; but the object is to have a responsible officer in the .various States, and to throw a great deal of responsibility upon his shoulders. ' He, as I have indicated, will be called the chief officer under the permanent head ; and the permanent head will be the under-secretary to the Minister. Honourable members will of tlie various departments are mentioned I acknowledge as secretaries. It is also proposed to give the chief officers power to deal with certain minor offences that cannot be dealt with in the ordinary way. But, though these officers will deal with the offences, a recommendation for the final dismissal of an officer will in every case come before the GovernorGenerali n Council. I wish to emphasize the point that under clauses 51 and 52 of .this Bill, and under section 84 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act, there is a provision to make it quite certain that no trouble shall arise with regard to transferred officers, and that all the rights that accrue to those officers who are taken over from the various States will be respected. not saying tically a repetition of the words of the Constitution 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE It ' is practically, though I do not know whether these words are the exact words bf the Constitution. by putting the provision in this Bill? Sir WILLIAM LYNE It will show to the public servants that we are not unmindf u l of their rights, and of the way we are directed by the Commonwealth Act to deal with them. We have taken over a number of servantsfrom the States, and have not yet had time to decide how many of those officers are required ; but these clauses are inserted in tlie B ill to assure to them that their rights will be respected. requires us to do everything that this clause itself says, and no further enactment is required. Sir WILLIAM LYNE We could not do what is necessary except under the Constitution; but I thought the public service might have been of opinion that, without some such provision in the",25,Mcmillan The Honourable Which Appointed Them But There Is

87,Mr Mccay,"The Commonwealth A ctBill, we were losing sight of that section in the Constitution Act. They now have the assurance that the point has not heen overlooked. If the inspectors are found to be not all required, tlie number of them may be reduced, and power is taken by the Governor-Generali n Council to transfer them at the same rate of salary to another office in the public service. But in this partorian Act. Honourable members will find ticular clause, an amendment will be required upon the Bil l as it stands. An inspector may also be suspended for the same causes us oificers in the special division, and may be treated in the same way as those officers. Clauses -40 and 41 provide for that matter. Buti f there were no such provision as I have just referred to with regard inspector from his post, we should not know what to do with him, because we could not apply every provision that would apply to other civil servants to . an inspector. an amendment which I shall move at the proper time. It is intended that the commissioner shall make a report to the Minister every year. That report is to be laid before the Parliament of tlie Commonwealth, and is to cover the whole working of the departments during that time. The Governor-Generali n Council may take upon himself the responsibility of refusing to adopt the recommendation of the commissioner in some cases. But we have one clause in this Bill, which is also to be found in the Public Service Acts of the other States, providing that where no one can be found in the service suitable for u vacant office or for a special appointment, a> man may be brought in from outside to occupy that post In addition to that, the Governor General has power, as I have just said, to refuse the recommendation of tlie commissioner or the permanent head at any time if he thinks that in the interest of the service it'is the proper thing to do. The refusal must be submitted to Parliament, and the Government must take the consequences. Thab is the point I referred to at the onset, when I said that this Bill is 'more elastic so far as the Government is concerned bhan are bhe public service Acts already in existence. It has, however, been held by legal opinion in New South Wales that there is an inherent power in the Government to do anything it likes over the head of the commissioner. Then we come to the divisions of the public service. Our plan divides bhe service inbo four divi-. sions:-The special division, bhe professional division, bhe clerical division, and the general division. If honourable members will turn to the 3rd schedule of the Bill, bhey will find particulars with regard to the clerical division. This classification is taken from the Victhati n the clerical division no one can enter the service except at the very foot of that division at the salary of £ i 0 a yearthat is to say, if he be over 16 years of age and under 21. after we have established bhe service t to removing an unnecessary meantime bhe present officers retain their positions, with all their rights and everything connecbed therewith. Clauses 17 and 18, especially the latter, provide for the paymenb of officers in the special division "" exI have therefore prepared cept in the case of officers paid at a specified rate by virtue of any Act."" The officers in the special division, with these exceptions, are to be paid "" such salaries as may be provided in the annual Appropriation Act."" Clause 18 provides thatIn the professional division and general division (except in the case of officers paid at a. specified rate by virtue of any Act) the officers shall be paid such salaries and wages in accordance with such fixed amounts or scales as may be prescribed. In the New South WalesA ct every salary is put before Parliament, unless it is a statutory salary. This would mean that the Executive. Government, on the recommendation of the commissioner and bhe permanenb head, would fix bhe salaries generally, and that the individual salaries would not be submitted to Parliament at all. for that? to the fixing of salaries, but I think it desirable to provide that the salaries shall all come before Parliament. It was only yesterday that I discovered this omission, i hold that all salaries except statutory salaries should come before Parliament; that is the practice in New South Wales. The special division is the division including the permanent heads and the chief officers. Those officers are brought from other positions in the service, climbing up as they show qualifications for appointment to the higher offices. There is power in the Bill",26,William Mcmillan I T Is A Diffi See I N Schedule 2 That The Permanent Heads

I have tried to keep each department byitself; that is, unless under very exceptional circumstances, we prOvide that Government shall not go all over the service, and take a man out of one particular department to put him over the heads of officers in another department, who are looking forward to being able to climb up to the higher positions for which they have qualified. I have seen the ill effect of the alternative practice in other States. Of course, there is power for the Governor-Generali n Council to make transfers from other departments in exceptional cases, but these transfers must be on the recommendation of the commissioner and the permanent head. sistent. The Government have stated that they believe in men coming into the service from outside, and yet they now say that men shall not go from one branch of the service to another. Sir WILLIAM LYNE and under this Bil l there is power to go outside the service for special officers. outside the service on occasions, it may be advisable to go to other departments of the .Commonwealth ? and it can be done under this Bill. Buti t is not to be done as a common practice, which is tine thing I desire to prevent. Mr 'BARTON -Does the honourable member recommend transfers from one department to another ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE .specially by the Governor General. stance those in the service, or from outside, who may be placed at the head as chief 'clerks and chief officers, and who may be enabled to climb up under this clause. An officer will have the opportunity of advancing from £ 4 0 a year up to £600 a year as a clerk, and probably would make a good chief officer, though he might not make a good permanent head. It is in such cases ""that we may require to get men from out'side. I have heard expressions of opinion 'from those who know more about the schedule of tlie Victorian A ct than I do. That schedule, I understand, was drafted about '1893, and recommended as tlie salaries of the 'Victorian officers. Exception has been taken to that schedule, but I. am informed that a commission made inqiiiry some two years ago, and again recommended that the schedule should stand. The reason I refer to this is because I have no doubt we shall have difficulty in dealing with the various States having regard to the average salaries in those States. I have tried to obtain a comparison of those average salaries, and I find that in New South Wales under secretaries and heads of departments receive from £92 0 to £1,010 a year; in Victoria, £ 7 5 0 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 ; South Australia, £ 5 5 0 to £ 6 0 0 ; Queensland, £ 5 0 0 to £75 0 ; Western Australia, £ 5 5 0 to £65 0 ; and Tasmania, £500. That accounts, I think, for the exception taken last night in regard to various It is a little inconsalaries it is proposed to pay. Honourable members who have been accustomed to see lower salaries paid in their respective States must not forget that we who have come from New South Wales have been accustomed to higher salaries, and that is probI did say that, ably the reason for the divergence of opinion in this matter. It will be seen that New South Wales is considerably higher in those classes of salaries than are other States. An Honorable MEMBER -On e State is a great deal more important than another. I will deal with presently. In New South Wales chief clerks receive from £55 0 to £ 6 0 0 ; in Victoria, £ 3 0 0 to £ 4 8 5 ; South Australia, £ 3 2 0 to £ 4 2 5 ; Queensland, £ 4 5 0 to £ 5 0 0 ; Western Australia, £350 to £450 ; and Tasmania, £25 0 to £280. It will be seen that there is a vast difference in this It can be done respect between Tasmania and some of the other States. As to accountants, I believe that Victoria pays higher salaries than any of the other States, for while in New South Wales this class of officer receives from £ 4 0 0 to £550, in Victoria the salary paid is from £ 4 8 5 to £750, while in South' Australia the figures are from £32 0 to £420, and in Western Australia from £30 0 to £500. I have' not been able to ascertain the salaries paid to senior clerks in Victoria and South Australia, but in New South Wales this class is paid £400, in Queensland from £25 0 to £300, in Western Australia from £29 0 to £ 3 7 5 , and in Tasmania from £ 1 5 0 to £200.

Under this schedule, if a clerk comes into the service at nineteen he can rise rapidly to a salary of £ 1 4 0 at 21 years of age, while it takes five years to do that in some of the States. So that really this Bill will not provide such a drag upon the lower men as some honourable members seem to imagine. I refer to this because I think it will be necessary for the commissioner and inspectors to recommend officers in the various grades in the various States. In Tasmania, for instance, there would no doubt be an outcry if a salary were paid there equal to that paid in Victoria or New South Wales to an officer doing practically the same work, although not so much of it as in the latter States. That might be the case in some other States, and I think the commissioner would require to be guided very -much by the amount of work that has to be done so that he may grade the officers and [recommend salaries equivalent to the -amount of work-no t lifting tliem all up to -the higher position, nor reducing all to the lower position. most unfair.

II is only a matter of form and is here simply because it is a copy of the schedule in the Victorian Act. The matter may be dealtI believe more with in committee.

Por instance, in New South Wales, there are 10, in Victoria 35, and in Queensland 15 civil servants in the Defence departments.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have given the number we have taken over, but I cannot estimate what number we are going to have in connection with other departments. For instance, in dealing with public works, such as customs houses, post-offices, court houses, and Victoria, too, 1 other necessary buildings, we shall require to have, at any rate, a staff in each State. It seems to me that is the only proper way in. which to carry out these works, and that will increase the number of civil servants.

AVe have had an experience in the State of New South Wales with our superannuation fund that we do not want repeated in the Commonwealth. It seems to me it was a mistake to commence the insurance in the way we did in that State, because the system has practically broken down, and I do not know how much money the State will have to find to pay the public servants what is justly due to them.

I can very easily make inquiries, however, and I think I know something slightly. However, what I wish to point about life assurance. I know that certain things have to be endorsed on the policy when it is being dealt with. The Bill provides for eighteen days' holiday a year to officers for purposes of recreation, and, in case of illness, leave of absence up to twelve months may be granted, and six months' further leave may be given without pay where necessaiy. But, of course, this leave is given on the recommendation of the permanent head of the department, and I do not think, therefore, that the power is likely to be abused in any way. Furlough can also be granted to an officer after twenty years of service to the extent of twelve months-si x months on f u l l pay and six months on half-pay. To an officer who has continued in the service for at least ten years, and who was over 30 years of age before being admitted to the service, leave of absence may also be given on f u ll pay. Of course, this leave is in addition to the usual holiday. There is a provision here, too, which is a very stringent one. It enacts that no officer is to engage in any other reLYNE -Which clause munerative employment without the express sanction of the Governor General. I do not wish to weary honourable members by going I think that is into further details which can be dealt with in committee. I have attempted to give My intention was to keep a general outline of the Bill, and to compare it with State Acts, and I feel sure from the expressions that I have heard from those who have read its provisions, and also from some public servants regarding minor amendments which do not touch the principles laid down, that we have in this B ill a foundation upon which we can create and carry through a good Public Service Act which will work well under the peculiar circumstances of all the States. worth.)I think the honourable gentleman the Minister aware in charge of tlie B ill has given a very fair outline of its provisions.

137,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"Public Service Bill, is "" what should a good public service be ? "" In the first place we must recollect that, although we do not want to have political influence unnecessarily introduced into the public service, it is a political institution, and that we cannot apply to it the same rules that we would apply to the ordinary affairs of life. A t the same time, to make it thoroughly effective, there should be, in its discipline and in its origin, the most complete business administration throughout the whole. There are two opposite dangers to which the honourable gentleman has very properly referred. There is no doubt that the Act in New South Wales-which , I may say, was the result of an absolutely rotten system that had been followed for years in that Statelike tlie returning swing of the pendulum, was the result of a reaction, and it was a drastic piece of legislation, the full purport of which was scarcely under'stood when it went through Parliament. That legislation went far beyond the intention of Parliament itself. do not believe, and I quite agree with the honourable gentleman, that we should give to any man, or body of men, absolute, complete, autocratic jiowers in dealing with the departments of State. A t the same time, we cannot shut our eyes to the other extreme, and I am rather afraid that this Bill, if it is not carefully amended in committee, while seeking to give a cer'tain amount of control and power of inspection to the commissioner and his inspectors, will practically, if we are not very careful, nullify the whole of that principle. hold'that there are essentially two parts in tlie public service that we must recollect. When we have created it-and it is well to take a simple department as an example, as if tlie whole of the service were one department-w e place at the head of the department what is called a permanent head. ' In the case of the Commonwealth, where these sub-departments will be distributed all over Australia, we place a chief officer over the head of the different branches. Now there is no doubt that we ought not to enact any provisions in this Bill which will interfere with the disciplinary work of the head of the departments. We create our departments to the best of our ability under the commissioner and under certain rules and regulations of a particular Act, ""but when once that department is set going, 'the Whole discipline of it should be entirely under the control of the permanent head. But on the other hand-and there is a defect in the Bill here-al l changes, removals, alterations, and creations of new offices or such offices should be clone entirely on the report and advice of tlie commissioner. Of course, naturally the commissioner would not do what the commissioners did in New South Wales absolutely ignore, as in many. cases I know they did, the recommendations of the permanent heads of the departments who had been in tlie service of the country for years. In many cases the commissioners treated those permanent heads almost with contumely. I do not think that anything could have been worse than the way in which the commissioners went about their business, and it was only because I felt that they had a ver}* delicate task to perform, and that there was undoubtedly a drastic work to be done, and because I feared that any discussion in Parliament would weaken their necessaiy authority, that I refrained I from referring to it when the matter came up in the House. They had a difficult and a delicate task, but I think they discharged it in a way which neither Parliament nor tlie Government intended. I find, on referring to this Bill, that in two very important clauses there is no reference whatever to tlie commissioner. If honourable members will turn to clause 35 they will find this provision. The Governor General may from time to time(a) create a new office in any division in I any department on the request of the permanent head thereof ; or (b) abolish ony office in any department; or (c) raise or lower the classification or grading o£ any office, the duties of which nave been materially changed ; or (d) transfer or promote an officer from the professional division to fill a vacancy in the clerical division, if such officer has previously been in the clerical division, andconsents to such transfer or promotion ; or (e) transfer or promote an officer from the professional division or clerical division to the special division. I find there is no reference to the commissioner in that clause. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I wish to explain to the honourable member that I have that clause marked, and that I intend moving an amendment upon it. most important mattersto be clone, without",32,William Mcmillan I T Is A Diffi See I N Schedule 2 That The Permanent Heads
138,Sir William Mcmillan,"There areany reference to the commissioner. I. think there might have been a clause referring generally to that officer. Clause5 refers to him, and I think it might have embodied some provision conferring his general powers under all possible circumstances in connection with this Bill. In Clause 71 the same tiling occurs again. Here we have regulations. I do not see in tins clause it may be owing to my rapid and ineffective leading of it-an y reference to the commissioner. stand that the principle of the Bill is that we create a commissioner. The Government think that one man is sufficient fortius purpose, but, that, as the Commonwealth administration extends all over Australia, lie must have a number of inspectors to assist him in the performance of his work. I do not object to that, because it is a matter that will come under review in committee. But at present I do not object to the principle of one commissioner. An Honorable MEMBER -There w ill be sub-commissioners. Sir WILLIAMM c M l LLAN , Yes , there Minister may attempt. Therefore I feel will be sub-commissioners just as a bank would have sub-inspectors in the different States. That is a sound business principle. But whilst we do not want to ignore the Minister or the head of the department, I do say that, in the first place, if the Commissioner is to be of any use at all, he must be a live institution under this Bill. Sir WILLIAM LYNE member would not say that the provision is wrong, that if a recommendation is made by the commissioner it need not be acted upon by Parliament ? """" Sir WILLTAMM c MILLAN want apparently to create a principle of control and advice and of real power for the safeguarding of the public interests of the country, the safeguarding of Parliament, and the safeguarding of Ministers themselves, in oreler to see that the service does not become unwieldy, and that it is always effectiveI do not want to appear to carry out that principle, and then by some clause insidiously put in I do not use the word in any offensive sense-to whittle away the very power of the officer who represents in this Bill the principle of inspection, report and control. Coming to another matter, allusion has been made to the red-tape influences that affect. I men in the public service, especially in the clerical branches. That influence affects them just as, in a large business, if you. keep men at certain mechanical work, they become in mid-life practically fossils. Therefore there must be some means of not"" merely going to other brandies for efficient officers, but of going outside the service. Take the position of the permanent head of the Treasury. It may be well enough-as has been said to me, when I had the honour of dealing with these affairs-to have a public officer who knows the innumerable I underActs and technicalities, and all that sort of thing. Indeedi t is necessaiy to have an officer to keep the Minister right in such matters. But you want to have at the head ' of such a department in the first place a. man of large general information, businesscapacity, and knowledge of tlie world; and, in the second place, it is essential, acting under statutes, and in connection with public service requirements and the in terests of the State, that you should have a man, who, while not dictating to his Minister, can be safely relied upon to put his hand to no improper act, no matter what the that this provision is not a wcalcness, but a necessity, and it may possibly have to be exercised very often in the interests of the. public. A t the same time upon the otherprinciple I feel strongly-that it is the duty of the Minister to exhaust the public service of Australia before he makes an outside appointment. The provision for an exB u t the honourable amination, to insure efficiency, is of course, a proper principle in this Bill. Then there is a small point which I have noticed, with regard to the divisions of the service. We are to have the special division, the profesI do not sional division, the clerical division, and the general division. The clerical division, the professional division, and the general division are terms which are all reasonable, and must be used ; but the term "" special division "" does not mean anything in particular. IfI might suggest another word, I think "" administrative "" would meet the case. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not mind. "" administrative division"" gives the clear idea that you are dealing with men in the higher ranks of the service-no t mere; mechanical servants,, but men who have to think and act for themselves--of course,, under proper control.

Althoughi t is not the business of this House to discuss insurance, I also feel strongly that it is to the advantage of the Commonwealth to make provision not only for its servants in their old age, but also for their widows and children. I believe that life assurance will be the salvation of the people in the future, and a remedy for a great many things that we are trying to secure by other more questionable methods. Of course, this is essentially a Bill for committee discussion, if we decide that the main principles of it are fairly correct. A question that may give rise to some debate is that of appointing one commissioner, with a number of subordinates as inspectors, instead of a board. That is a very difficult question to decide. The principle in regard to a board is that, although you have a chairman, still in all matters where opinion is divided, the majority rules. Sir WILLIAM LYNE plan because of the distance of most of the States from the seat of Government. A board could not very well deal with any 'matter without the assistance of a staff, just as one commissioner would need a staff. . I am strongly in favour of one man taking all the responsibility. If you had a board of three members, they would require to have a staff, because they personally could not visit each of the States. one principle of this Bill which renders' that provision not such .a matter of necessity. I refer to the absolute independence of this commissioner, subject of course to Parliament. I take it that he is to be in the same position as the railway commissioners, the Judges, and others occupying similar positions in the States, where it is necessary, not merely to give some kind of permanency to the officer, but to secure him from political influence and improper political control. I made one or two notes of the speech of the Minister, but I do not think I need refer to them. The Bill is made up of the best parts of the Public Service Acts of the States, and a great deal of it consists of provisions which under any circumstances would need to be introduced into such a measure. I may say in conclusion that the only question which it seems to me we have to consider is, first, whether the principle of having one commissioner instead of a board, isa proper one to adopt, and secondly, whether it is a reasonable principle to try, at any rate for the present. In committee we must provide that the commissioner shall not be an autocratic person like the Public Service Boardi n New South Wales, able to ride rough-shod over Minister, permanent head, and every one else, but at the same time he must occupy that position of absolute power and control which is necessary for the efficiency and economy of the public service. general policy and principle of this BillI think there can be no quarrel. Personally, I strongly approve of having the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth free from political control. We have had some experience of that kind of control in most of the States of Australia, and in Victoria we are particularly familiar with the evils of the system. For the most part, the policy laid down in this B ill is that adopted in the Victorian Public Service Act, with this difference-that I have adopted this whereas in Victoria we have a board consisting of three commissioners, with a secretary, the proposal of this Bill is to have one commissioner and some assistants, who will practically take the place of the commissioners who form the Victorian board. But underthe Bill the commissioner, and the inspectors will do what should have been done hy the Victorian board. Under the original Act in Victoria, the Public Service Board was specially enjoined to make inquiry into the various departments of tlie service -to inquire as to the work being done by the several officers and to make reports upon the work of the several departments of the State service. The board did this at the initiation of the Act, but they have never done it since. It is because it has not been done that anomalies have crept in which have led to innumerable Bills being presented to the Legislature, by creating numerous grievances and general dissatisfaction among the. members of the service. Under this BillI see that that fault is going to be remedied, because the Bill provides that the inspectors must make periodical examinations of all the departments. They must inspect the work actually being -done, and not take it on hearsay from the heads of",34,William Mcmillan I T Is A Diffi See I N Schedule 2 That The Permanent Heads
142,Sir William Mcmillan,There is,35,William Mcmillan I T Is A Diffi See I N Schedule 2 That The Permanent Heads
143,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"With tliedepartments. several branches of the State service and see the men at work, make themselves familiar with what is being done, aud report to the conmissioner-wh o is supreme under this measure-wha t particular office individual men are holding, what is the class of work they are doing, what positions they are fit to hold, and give him other information of that kind. the very salvation of an efficient service lies in the fact that there must be periodical examinations of the work done. Under this system the men will be fairly treated and ' their work properly valued, and they will no longer have to complain because no notice is being taken of tliem. I direct attention to the fact, however, that perhaps too much power is given to the permanent heads of departments, notwithstanding thatthecommissioner is to have such very great powers himself. The permanent head is the .man who is to exercise great powers over the working of the departments, the distribution of officers, the salaries they are to receive; and he is to make recommendations for promotions, additions to salary, and things of that kind. Sir WILLIAM LYNE that comes through the commissioner. tion in saying that it will be found, particularly in the case of entry into the service, that a man cannot get any increase of salary unless the permanent head recommends him for an increase. £1 0 each in one year, and after that he is at the mercy of the permanent head of the department. head of the department does not recommend him, he may remain for years at £ 6 0 a year. I do not think that is fair. I take it for granted that if a man passes the necessary examinations, on the face of it he should be good enough to proceed in his order towards promotion in the service. If not, it should not be at the sweet will of the permanent head to say whether he shall get an increase or not; but specific reasons should be stated having regard to his deficiencies why he should not receive an increase. If he gets through the probationary j>eriod successfully, there should be automatic increases of his salary. his work will be made by the inspector, whoever he may be. I approve of the They must go into the principle of competitive examinations for men entering the public service, because it is possibly the best that can be devised. It puts men on their mettle, and although we all know that a mere clerical! examination is not the best test of a man's fitness for a post, it is the best test that, can be devised for the right to enter a service of this kind. One other matter I I believe wish to speak about is in regard to the distribution of officers, which will be largely controlled by the inspectors. It will be within the knowledge of men who have had some experience of the Victorian public service that regulations have been drawn up in this State which have actually been a violation of the Public ServiceA c t itself. I cannot at the moment recollect many instances, but I can cite one. Some time ago regulations were made as to the penalties that may be imposed upon prisoners lodged in the gaols of this State. These regulations were drawn up by the Governor in Council, and they enabled certain things to be done which were not in accordance with the spirit of the Act. Then, again, the Public ServiceA ct of Victoria said that seniority No t as to salaries; was to be considered as one of the first qualifications for promotion, while, as a matter of fact, in the regulation drawn up by the Public Service Boardi t was made the last consideration. My view is that when a promotion is to be made the senior man in the service, provided that he has the ability, . should get the position. I do not think power should be given to a permanent head to override the senior man, and appoint a junior, who may be a relative or a friend, or may have what the Minister for Home affairs has described as "" social influence"" behind him. The list of senior men should be exhausted first; and if the permanent head cannot recommend the senior man, he should be bound to supply specific reasons as to the noneligibility of the senior man, for his recommendation of some other individual for the post in question. It should not be at the discretion of the permanent head to say what should or should not be done in regard to a promotion of this kind. In the first place seniority should be considered. I would not place it Of course the appraisement of altogether above merit, because merit must tell in these matters ; but, when men have entered the public service on equal terms, and",35,William Mcmillan I T Is A Diffi See I N Schedule 2 That The Permanent Heads

146,""" Mr Hume Cook","If the permanenthave in the first instance proved their fitness, the senior officer should have the first chance of promotion, and should not be passed over just because the permanent head is inclined to recommend a junior officer. ""With regard to transfers from one department to another, I should like to say that, in the higher offices of the service, it is to a large extent a mistake to allow too easy a method of transfer. A man has, perhaps, become a very valuable officer in the Customs department, where he has occupied an honourable and onerous position, and he may, for the sake of a few additional pounds j>er annum, seek to obtain a transfer to the Post-office; but when he arrives at the Post-office he will probably find himself in the position of having to be coached and instructed by juniors as to how his -work is to be done, and it may take him years before he thoroughly understands his new duties. ral instances of that kind in New South Wales. in Victoria also. We have had men who possessed special, qualifications in a rjarticular department transferred to other departments of which they knew practically nothing. The proper method of treating men whose long service and merit it is thought desirable to recognise is to give them additional salary, if they worth it, and the department where they are useful, rather than permit them to go to another department, where, as I have said, they will have to be instructed by juniors as to how they shall do their work. That being so, it will be wise to make transfers easy only in the three lower divisions-Nos. 3, <t, and 5-leavin g men in the higher divisions not so free to obtain transfers, except under special circumstances, and where the needs of the Commonwealth require that it shall be done. There are some provisions in this Bill as to dismissal from the service; but, as far as I am able to see, there is no machinery for appeals. I can see no provision under which a civil servant will have the right to appeal to any high authoruy. Surely that is a mistake. Surely the Ministry did not intend that it should be so. When they take the matter into consideration, I am sure they will admit the ordinary justice of the civilservants' demand, that a man shall have some tribunal to which he can appeal in the event of his dismissal, or retirement, or anything of the sort. Provision is made for courts of inquiry to be held, but it seems to me that the arrangement is a rather cumbrous one, since it necessitates the institution of a new court for every trumpery case. I should prefer to have a permanent court of appeal, so that a civil servant who felt aggrieved might know that he could take his case before some impartial and judicial body with thefull knowledge that it would receive attention, and that justice would be done. ticular whether it be inside or outside the department. Perhapsi t would be better inside the department; but, at any rate, some court of appeal should be provided. Such a court would make it unnecessary for civil servants who have grievances to come to Members of Parliament, and we should get rid of the nuisance of being continually waited upon by civil servants wanting promotions or transfers, or something of the sort. I speak upon this matter from a large amount of experience. 1 formerly represented in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria a constituency which included two large departments of the State, and I have had rather a large experience of civil servants. to retain them in honourable member stop it ? a proposal which I think will assist very materially in getting over the difficulty.

There have at times been suspicions-whic h in some cases almost appear to be justified, though I could not prove them-that civil. servants have had reason to believe that favouritism of the worse .kind has taken place. against in the Bill.",36,William Mcmillan I T Is A Diffi See I N Schedule 2 That The Permanent Heads

Sir General has been hard at work on Bills ever since the Government was formed. General doing all the Government work ? Sir attend to the drafting of a great many measures -week, but it is perfectly clear to me Attorney-General has done a great deal of work, and I should say he has been in a very unpleasant position indeed. ber not think it is time he changed his tune and left off finding fault ? the right thing I shall not find fault. As an instance of the undue haste that has been made, I can clearly show that the draftsman has not had time to consider this measure. If there is one thing incumbent on Parliament, it is to shorten its measures as much as possible, and to draw them simply, so that anybody may be able to understand their provisions. But what do we find? In the first part of the Bill, in what are called the interpretation provisions we read, "" ' Governor General' means ' the Governor General with the advice of the Pederal Executive Council.'"" The other day there was introduced an Acts Interpretation Bill, which was brought forward for the purpose of shortening Bills, and in that Bill, clause 18, we find(/) "" ThoGovei'iiof-Qoneiul"" shall mean the Governor General of. the Commonwealth, or the person for the time being administering the government of the Commonwealth, acting with the advice of tlie Executive Council. That is a definition with which I have no quarrel whatever, but, having enacted that definition, I ask where is the necessity for the definition in the Bill before us. "" Governor General"" was inserted advisedly ance, and I should like to know whether in this Bill, because the Public Service Bill is ---he Minister for Home Affairs has noticed not law yet. I considered tlie point no the point. Would the effect not be to [70] later than last week, and the draftsman advised that the definition should be left in the Bill until the Acts Interpretation Bil l had been assented to. The words may be struck, out desired, but they can do no harm. It was four or five clauses put into the Bill, which all have the effect of lengthening it . When we find mistakes like that in the first part of ' a Billi t shows there has not the House ought to be most careful to see that measures are not introCOOK -I s the Attorneyduced until honourable members have had an opportunity to consider them. Some Parliament should sit every day in the that the more an honourable member knows of parliamentary business the more he sees that Parliament ought not to sit more than two or three days a week, and, that the other days should be devoted to the consideration of Bills which are likely to be introduced; even the sessions might then have to be prolonged. If measures were not rushed through, and full opportunity was given for discussion, the session would necessarily occupy a longer time, but the result would be much more to the benefit of the people. It is almost impossible for us to take up a measure introduced in this hurried way, and seriously discuss its principles. In the Bill before us there is only one principle to which I should like to refer, and that is the principle of life assurance. There is this to be said of the proposal of the Government, that every man who comes into the service will thoroughly understand what will be required of him. I do not know whether the provisions contained in clause 45 have been put before the board of any life assurance society, but in clause 44 sub-clause («) we read(c) the payment to him, if he retires from or ceases to be a member of the Public Service before attaining the age of sixty, years, of a sum of money equal to the whole amount of premiums paid by him to the company or society, unless he elects to continue paying the premiums on his policy, and . .

""We are now going to the root of the administ ration of this new Commonwealth, and, if it be true that whatever, is best administeredis best, it becomes of vital importance that we should look well to the principles on which'we establish our public service. There is no doubt that the public service is growing,not diminishing. Tlie tendencyi n every countiy, and above all in Australia, is to increase the number of persons who are engaged in the service of the public. to say-speakin g from my own experience-that there is more of the time and of the energies of Members of 'Parliament flittered away in considering, discussing, and dealing with the grievances of public servants than is spent upon any of the higher problems of parliamentary life. I think 1 can appeal to honourable members to bear me out when I say that it is simply lamentable to -see how, owing to a badly administered public service, we find the energies of some who are regarded as most promising Members of Parliament absolutely frittered away, and the principal part of their time absorbed in looking after the grievance of this little post or of that little post. I need not give absolute details, but when an honourable-member who is busy with great questionSj such as we have to face in the first session of the Common^ wealth Parliament, is visited by people who want a billet as cleaner of a house or sweeper of an office, and has his time taken up in hearing requests of that sort, the positionis indeed a lamentable one. I do not findi n this Bill, although it seems to adopt the routine prescribed', by the-Acts of the different States, any attempt to grapplewith the difficulty. Of' course, in all administration there-must be grievances, and theremust be hitches, but I am thoroughly conv-inoed that by applying the experience of England, America, and Australia, we could devise methods by which Members of Parliament would be enabled to give more of their time to high issues, and less of their timeto these miserable questions which a proper business man could deal with if he were put in a position, of control and given a free hand. I find in this B i ll that, there are one or two honest attempts to grapplewith these difficulties, but tlie measure is not sufficiently venturesome in striking out a new course for the'guidance"" of this House. The public service is increasing;, and'the problems of Uie-public service-must increase. Sir WILLIAM LYNE We have taken over about 11,000 officers. I gave' the figures. 1 taking over more and more functions. It is not for me to say that this is right or that it is wrong. But we have to face the fact that tlie Government is becoming more and move concerned in businesses and in working out undertakings; and, perhaps, eventually-it is not for me to prophesyall of us will become public servants.

I was applying my attention, in tlie argument I have just advanced, to a vacancy in an office, the usefulness of which is admitted. The question is : who is to fill such an office ? With regard to the lower grades of the public service, it may be well to have more or less promotion by seniority; but in the case of the higher work, the man who has spent his life in the service, and has never had the responsibility of initiation put upon him, is not the man to take charge of a large department. You want a man of energya man with commercial ideas and experience; a man who is in contact with the work-a-day world, and who has had to deal with"" men. will find in the public service men who will go diligently to work at the office at ten in the morning, and stay t ill four in the afternoon-me n who are most exemplary in their family life, who go to church regularly, who never read tlie newspaper in office hours, and never get off the office stool when there is work to do. They are good men, but they are not the men to whom to entrust the initiation of new departments. We are starting a new Government machinery in Australia, and we must make it the best we can have. The public service problem is really the greatest problem we have to face, and yet to-night we have the smallest attendance of members that we have had since this Parliament commenced its deliberations. we are taking over the old machinery-the Customs department, the Defence department, the Post-office department, and so on. ance of the obligations which arise from taking over the old servants of the States. But I am looking forward a bit. I admit that we shall have difficulties in replacing what is effete aud old by what is fresh and new; but I want to have our hands kept free, so that the reforms we initiate may have their inevitable result, by filling vacancies with men who will make the public service of the Commonwealth healthy and sound. is not my intention to occupy very much time in discussing this B ill ; but I look upon it as a very important measure, and we ought not to be in too great a hurry to It must be created rush it through. It appears to me that the pendulum is inclined to swing a little too much in the opposite direction to that in which it has hitherto swung. I recognise fully that under the old system of automatic increases in the public service a great many anomalies have arisen; that in some cases there are round men in square holes. Buti t is only in regard to the heads of departments, or in the case of men who are well advanced in years, that you can say that this is a drawback. AVhatI am afraid we are doing by means of this B ill is to make it possible to penalize the thousands in older to cure the few. I am not particularly concerned about the men at the head of departments, because my You experience in life is that they can very well look after themselves. It is those on the lower rungs of the ladder whom we have to be more concerned about, and notwithstanding what has been stated here to-day, that a youth going into the service at sixteen years of age may be receiving £160 a year by the time he is twenty-one, I am afraid that while there is such a posibility there will not be many instances of tlie occurrence. The only thing that is guaranteed to the youth who enters the service at sixteen years of age, or even at twenty-one \ ears of ager because the age for admission to the clerical division is from sixteen to twenty-oneis that he shall receive £40 per annum to commence with, and that inside twelve months he may obtain two £ 1 0 rises, bringing his salary up to £ 6 0 a year.

236,Mr Poynton (South Australia),"I tsee anything in tlie Bil l which insures any further increases. It is true there are certain provisions by which an officer may be drafted from one division to another, examinations taking place from time to time for the purpose ; but he must be one year in a class before he is entitled to be moved, and, so far as I can read, there is no assurance given that he may not be five or even ten years in the one class before he is shifted. The automatic increase stops at £ 6 0 , and I would ask the Minister whether some consideration ought not to be shown to those who have not the opportunity to show special ability in the first few years of their service-whethe r there is any necessity to apply the drastic rule of doing away with the automatic increase when a man receives the enormous salary of £ 6 0 a year. I should offer no objection to stopping the automatic increase at £160 a year; but to apply it to the smaller salaries would make considerable hardship possible. It is considerably more difficult for the men in the lower grades of the service to bring themselves under the notice of the heads of their department than it is for one who is well up in the service to do so. There are worse things than political patronage, with all its evils. There is the insidious system of departmental favour, which cannot be dealt with in this Chamber. We can deal with political favouritism, and I would sooner take the risk of political patronage than allow the much worse evil. Promotion from one class to another is permissible. Is not that where favouritism would come in. Are the heads of departments so absolutely free from bias that they will be any better than ourselves in the matter of shoving along particular friends? Before the Bill leaves this ChamberI hope something will be clone to protect the low grade officers who receive up to, say, £160 a year. In the limited time. I have had to examine the clauses dealing with offences I have formed the opinion that they are almost unworkable. Considerably more power ought to be given to the heads of departments, because, if I read aright, all the power they have in cases of irregularities or neglect of duty is to give a reprimand, and then, if the offence deserves something more, there is to be suspension. offence there is dismissal.

I am quite sure there are several honourable and learned members on the Treasury Benches who with their legal talent could make a very fine defence indeed out of those words.

263,Mr Poynton,"I do not think it isMi-. PIESSE (Tasmania) I will deal first with the point the member who has just resumed his seat dealt with in the last part of his remarks. I hope .that the question of the automatic increases in tlie proposed fift h class,, will -be definitely settled. Although the words of clause 21 are absolutely clear, bhe inference that might be gathered from sub-clause (4) is bhat it is intended that the increases should go on. Subclause (4)is as follows:No officer shall until he has been ab least twelve why the .man who serves his .countiy, and months in a subdivision of a class in the clerical division be promoted to a higher subdivision thereof. The inference might be that, having been twelve months in a subdivision, an officer would get promoted, and the exact meaning of the clause should be made clear. thing very dreadful may happen, though I hope not, which will make ib necessary for us to curtail our expenditure, but it ought to be an understanding that officials who enter the service at £ 4 0 a year shall have before them, within five or six years, the possibility of receiving £ 1 6 0 per annum, which is the maximum in that class. Eveni n the poor babe of Tasmania we have managed bo give increases every year to officers of bhat class. I do not remember, even in the times of depression, a year-thoug h there may have been one in which-men receiving under £ 1 5 0 did not receive their increases. There is a great difficulty even then, even when these increases are given, because there are many men of mature years who have the responsibility of families on them who do not rise to a position where they can get more than 150 or £ 1 6 0 per annum. That is one of the difficulties of the civil service, and I do not know how it is to be guarded against if men will enter with that prospect, in view. It is one of the things we do not like to see in a civil service, where men have to maintain a certain position, dress respectably, and live in a particular way. Still, it is right bhab bhose civil servants should have before them the prospect, in five or six years, of reaching bhe standard. Mr ""V. L . SOLOMON -Whethe r they deserve it or not. them within the service if the)' do not deserve it, and if they are in the service and are undeserving they should be discharged. We should not have a man in the service in receipt of lower wages. manent soldiers £ 4 0 a year. -that statement is quite a true representation of -tlie case. I think that the soldiers get rations and clothes besides their allowance, and bhese bogebher represent far more than £ 4 0 a year. Of course, the soldier -has always received less than other servants of the community. I do-not know why it should be-so. .1 do not understand has in case of emergency to risk his life, should be paid at such a low rate for his services, but I think that what I am urging should be well considered, and bhat some arrangement should be made so that these automatic increases shall be given. Another Somefeature of bhe measure has been alluded to by the honourable member for Bourke. Whilst we are providing to a great extent for the regulation of tlie service we are not providing sufficiently for the ventilation of grievances. Thab is bhe reason why members of the Legislature are so often appealed to. If we could devise some system by which members of the civil service could appoint representatives-eithe r as departments or with bhe whole of bhe service divided inbo territorial divisions-to sit as a board, empowered to investigabe grievances, I bhink ib would relieve honourable members of the great necessity of listening to complaints from civil servants, and -of acting for bhem. I understand bhab this principle has bo some extent been recognised in bhe railway services of New South Wales and A ictoria. r the railway service of Victoria. the Victorian system. W it h us it works very satisfactorily. civil servants is the opportunity to get justice. If they feel that they are not being justly dealt with by not being given promotion, or for any other reason, they ought to have the means of seeming redress. If they were allowed to elect their own representatives, they would have the best opportunity possible to obtain redress. I am not prepared to go inbo anj' detailed suggestion in amplification of what I have already said, except to observe that ib might be desirable to have boards representing deparbmenbs of bhe civil service.

269,Mr Piesse,"What we want to give toenough to be entitled to a board, and there are other departments which would have to be grouped if my suggestion were adopted. On tlie other hand, it might be found better not to confine the board to bhe representatives of one deparbmenb, and insbead of taking the departmenb as bhe basis of organization, to divide the civil service territorially. should divide it into States. We should rather, so far as it is possible, the idea of. States in the consideration of matters affecting the Commonwealth. notice that many honourable members speak here as if they had to represent State interests only. To some extent I admit thab we have bo represent State interests, but to a much larger extent we ought to regard ourselves as representing bhe whole of the Commonwealth, and as speaking here for the good of all. Therefore, we should not recognise further than is absolutely necessaiy in matters of this kind the division of the continent districts it seems to me might be defined, and within these districbs members of bhe civil service should be allowed to appoint a board to which might be referred questions with which it might seem desirable that such a body should deal. It might even be well on some occasions to allow the civil servants to speak their minds upon the matter of appointments. mean to suggest that they should be allowed a controlling voice, but they might in the first instance be permitted to suggest names for the consideration of the commissioner or of the inspecbors. I do nob know whebher bhat would meet the views of the honourable member for Northern Melbourne, who expressed himself in favour of'giving a freer chance to men who might not be of senior rank to rise in the service. Such men would possibly be known among the public servants in their own locality, and they might, therefore, geb a chance to have their claims recognised by the voice of their fellow servants them and recommending them. Of course my tbe that the Ministry will consider some such proposals cannot be embodied in the Bill. It would seem to offer a way out of the difficulty that honourable members have felt in the past. If honourable members were able to say to civil servants when they approached them with Mr Pietee. "" Y o u have your own board, who will listen to your grievances, and who will take them up if they are worth taking up,"" I bhink they would be freed from some of the unpleasantness that has hitherto attached itself to their position. In introducing this Bill to the notice of the House bhe Minister for Home Affairs referred to the question of I do not say that we the different salaries paid in the several States for the same office. I am aware eliminate thab in one case a difficulty has arisen on account of a superior officer of equal rank I with an officer in another State getting a salary which is not equivalent to his ; bub I do not think that officers of the same rank in different States should necessarily be paid the same salaries. The salary paid to an officer should bear some relation to the responsibility of his particular position. If he happens bo be in a State where there are larger interests to be guarded, he should receive a larger salary than the officer in another Sbate who holds the same into States. Convenient rank, but whose responsibilities are not nearly so great; but I regret to notice that there is a tendency to regard civil servants in the same class as being entibled to the same emoluments in every instance. I do not think bhat such a rule should be observed, and I clo not suppose that it will be observed when we have settled down, and things get into proper running order. In the particularI do not instance I refer to, bhe Minister, who is not sibbing in this House, had to negotiate with the officer aggrieved, and to make his position as nearly as possible equal in salary to bhab of an officer in another State in order to satisfy his demands. That ought not to be so. The importance and responsibility of the office should govern the amount of salary to be paid. Clause 17 provides that the salaries in the special division shall be blio.se provided in bhe Annual Appropriation Acb. I presume bhab bhat Act will govern, where necessaiy, bhe question of salaries generally. It might come to pass thab there should be a reduction in salaries under cirspeaking for cumstances of stress. I hope that will not occur, but we ought not to give civil remarks can only be taken in servants to ""understand that they have an light of suggestions. I trust inalienable right to the salaries mentioned whether in any schedule. All the States have had to face this question of a reduction of salaries for a time, and I think it ought to be understood by civil servants that they will be under the necessity of accepting such a reduction if it becomes necessary at any grievances, time in the history of the Commonwealth to enforce it. In clause 28 there is power givenI do not suppose it is intended that it shall be exercised in the literal way in which it is there stilted-to the Minister to appoint boys of any age. The sub-clause provides.Nothing in this sub-section shall be taken to prevent tlie appointment of boys of any age to be message boys or junior messengers. I presume that the Ministry will agree that the boys should at least be 13 years of age before they receive an appointment. governed by regulation. an excuse in the Bill for appointing children in every individual case. under 13 or 14 years of age. In clause 33 think that tlie mere return of the there is power given to the Government premiums paid would meet every case where of the Commonwealth to make terms with it is desirable to give a retiring allowance. the Government of a State for the performRegarding clauses 43 and 44, which deal ance of any of its functions by an officer of with life insurance, I understand that the the Commonwealth ; and there is provision Minister for Home Affairs intends giving made for determining the rate of payment to the House further information as to the be made by the Government of that State, probability of companies undertaking all the and also for any matter that may require to risks which are involved in the acceptance be adjusted with regard to the performance of of the terms of those clauses; I refer the work or service. clear provision made for retiring allowances. who are retiring.

Power company can very well calculate the value therefore should be provided, that where a of tlie risk it is undertaking. Clause 51 State has to pay a retiring allowance the seems to be rather a doubtful one inasmuch Commonwealth should pay a part of such as what it seeks to provide is much more allowance in proportion to tlie salary received enacted in section 84 of the Constitution from the Commonwealth Government. member is referring to officers transferred This matter, however, is more fully dealt who are not in transferred departments. It shall be lawful for the Governor General, at allowance shall be shared between the the request of the Governor in Council of a State, State and the Commonwealth, and I think to authorize and cause any work or services to be it would be undesirable to re-enact in performed for the Government of such State; this Bill any portion of that provision. and the Governor General, by agreement with the Governor in Council of a State, or otherwise, If we do anything in this matter we should may make arrangements for determining(ti) The rate of payment to be made by the circumstances, what portion of the retiring Government of a State for the performallowance shall be met by the Government ance of such work or services ; and {Ii) Any matters which may require to be by the Government of the State. adjusted with regard to the performance of such work Or services.

I believe that there are cases frequently arising where it is advisable to secure the retirement of an officer from the public service, and the only way very often to accomplish this is to allow the officer a certain amount to retire upon. There is no provision in this Bill for the payment of such amounts. It would be far better to have a general scheme of upon which these allowances could be made, than to have to I do not But I do .not see any especially to the risk of providing for men 7 Act.

275,Mr Piesse,"No doubt this is so ; butbe no question hereafter of the basis on which the matter should be calculated. We have already enacted in the Constitution that officerswho aie transferred with the transferred departments shall have this provision made for them ; but it does not appear to have been clearly provided for in the case of officerswho are taken over, but who are not employed in transferred departments-officer s who are taken over individually to fill positions under the Commonwealth. It is not set forth on what basis their retiring allowances or pensions shall be paid, asbetween the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of the States. I hope we shall beable to perfect this Bill, because it is really one of the most important, if not the most important, Bill we are likely to have to consider in relation to the future of the Com>monwealbh. To establisha civil service, so as to have the men contented and rendering good service to the State, and to start that service so that there shall be as little v political influence iu regard to appointments as possible, is a work which will be beneficial not only to ourselves, but to all who come after us. unfortunate circumstances that have to be faced by an honourable member who speaks somewhat late in a debatethat many important points to which he wished to draw the attention of the House have already been well and satisfactorily dealt with, and it will, I think, be found that 1 am not one of those who reiterate observations which have been already made by other honourable-members. But I may be permittedto refer to one or two subjects to which allusion has been made by those who have preceded me, and on which, considering the important principles underlying the Bill, honourable members individually may desire to express an opinion. For myself, I should like to say that I think tlie Bill' is an earnest and honest effort to deal witha gieat subject in a business-like fashion. The intent tion of the measure is to place the civil service insucha position that it will bean honourable and desirable thing for any citizen to become a member of it . That is an object we should desire to attain: I am distinctly of opinion that theunderlying principle of the Bill, which is that its operation shall be free fromj>olitical influence, should be thedominatingidea of any such measure. I quite agree also that the appointment of one single commissioner, upon whom will rest the responsibility of carrying out this measure in its spirit and in its letter, is a good idea. In my judgment it is better to have a responsible, capable man to undertake these duties than to have a divided authority. I quite recognise, that it will be difficult and will require great consideration to secure the sendee of a competent commissioner, but I have no doubt that an officer of tlie kind desired will be discovered, who will fitly and fully discharge the obligations pertaining to his office. In an interjection I made when the Minister for Home Affairs was explaining the Bill, I said thab while £1,500 is a considerablesalary, I hoped that the Ministry would not tie themselves down to that amount. I hope also that Parliament will not tie bhe hands of the Government by limiting bhembo £1,500. The firsb essential consideration is, that for bins important office, tlie services of the most capable, impartial, judicial-minded man obtainable should be procured. That should be the dominating consideration-; because in the hands of that commissioner bhe happiness of a large number of our citizens must resb. I hope, boo, that while every consideration will be given to the question of how to obtain bhe best class of man for the position ofcommissioner,theinspectors whom it is proposed to appoint, who will have important-obligations-devolving upon them, and whose influence for good or evil will be considerable, will be carefully chosen. The chief officers of the departments will also have great obligations resting upon them. But, while it is inbended-bo conserve the rights, positions, and privileges of the higher officers of bhe service, I am firmly persuaded that the Minister will, at the same time, desire bhab bhe privileges and possibilities of progress of the numblesb clerk will receive bhe same careful consideration as bhose of officers in the higher grades. I am persuaded, as has been so ably suggesbed previously, bhab ib will be necessary to have some means ofappealing from any decision, in order that any. member of the-servicemay be-able to vindicate his positionand obtain justice, if he thinks liehas been unjustly treated: The whole spirit of the Bill"" is intended to give a feelingof confidence and security to the members of the sendee, so long as that",51,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled
276,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"It is one of thesecurity is justified by their merits. If we wish to do justice to the public service of the Commonwealth, we must recognise the necessity of getting out of the ordinary rut which has become a by-word in connection withmany officers of the State services ; we must get the men to believe that they are members of. a live service, where the application of their own energies and abilities is the'only means of progress. The mere automatic progression of men through the various stages of promotion, as life goes onj has a. bad effect upon the men themsel ves. There are men who will never get on of themselves, and such men. probably will always be the majority in the servicej but for those who are prepared to apply their intellects and their time to the service of theSbate there ought to be the fullest facility and opportunity for getting bhe reward which ib is bhe desire of Parliar ment to give them. the automatic increases should go on also ? automatic increases to some extent, but such increases seem to me in the main to bring about an indifference on the part of men who have not the incentive to more vigorous and energetic service which they otherwisewould have. I would wish to feel, in connection with this public service, that we are going to apply to it bhe ordinary rules and customs in every day business l if e ; that is to say, that it is not simply a case where a man having once secured a* footing: may feel that he has very little incentive to progress, but that, just as in bhe oubside world, his progress in the-service -will depend upon his own efforts. But we must have from the commissioner, and those-associated: with him, judicial and impartial consideration of the questions coming before theni; and proper oversight and discrimination, so that justice may be done. should find proper and just consideration in ibs ownplace I quibe recognise all the difficulties thab will face blie Ministerand the officers who will support him ini the administration of this measure, in consequence of the diversity, of conditions existing in the various, SbatesI am prepared bo believe that nexb session bhe Minister will have to come to Parliament audi ask. for assisba""nce bo rectify various anomalies that the obligations of this measure will bring bo l i g h t For myself, I think, as I have already said, that there should be a proper court of appeal for officers of the servicewho are discontented. The suggestion that men. should have their ownrepresentatives, upon bhe. courb of appeal deserves consideration .. I do nob de1 sire bo deal with a number of other matters, which will bemoreproperly considered in committee, when we shall have bo deal wibh bhe B ill clause by clause-; bub I may be permitted to say that one of the existing anomalies is the discrimination which it is proposed to make between male servants of the Commonwealth and female servants. I venture to hold the opinion, in considering the demands made by some women for the extension of tlie. franchise bo them, that as soon as woman gets the right to vote, she will not be: content until she has removed the disparity of remuneration which now exists. If she performs equal services, I see no logical reason why woman should nob receive equal salary with men. ""Why should you place men and women on a different footing in that respect? You are doing I think there ought to be woman a great injustice; and I hold that when woman gets the right to vote-and probably this Parliament will grant it to her-sh e will insist upon being, placed on the same footing as' men. I do not say that I advocate bhis, because I believe it is a tremendous injustice to men that women should be competing wibh them for employment to bhe extjpnb that'they do now. Women are baking away from men bhe means' of livelihood which they, as heads of families andbreadwinners, should have paying them equally for equal services. If you pay thenii equally, therei3 no injustice to the men, because themen, if they do betber work, will be employed in preference bo women: absolutely inconsistent. If you employ a Seniority woman, she is ceitainly entitled to equal pay with a man;, and bhat is one of bhe inconsisbencies which exists in.connection wibh the policy of those who advocate giving women, a vobe. In regard to the question of life assurance, it has been, pointed out bhab bheprovisions of bhe Bill require -reconsideration: Within the civil service itself, therewill bea sufficiently large number of employees to provide funds for the. future; if the payments are placedupon aproper actuarial basis. There are examples of that, practice in the ' 'various banking institutions, where systems",52,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled

280,Mrs Knox,"The present position isof retiring allowances and .compensations for men suffering any temporary trouble or disablement are provided for. I am of opinion that it is a good thing that we are taking up this matter. I trust that this B ill will not be hastily rushed through the House, but will be carefully debated. The questions involved in it require the most thoughtful consideration, clause by clause, in order that we may see that all classes of civil servants receive justice and consideration, and that no injury is done to any portion of the service. My only hope is that the Ministry will agree, after honourable members have addressed themselves to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, to allow us to have further time for digesting the valuable information which has been brought to bear upon the question to-night. The whole subject should be re-considered in the light of that information. The Bill is excellently conceived, on sound business lines, and I hope that it will receive thoughtful consideration and be applied in a business-like way. Bill will ever come before this Housei n regard to which every individual member will feel more absolutely free than the measure now under consideration. If we may gather anything from the speeches already delivered, there is to be a total absence of party bias in respect to this Bill. The reason for this is perhaps to be found in the fact that the public service are a very strong class numerically, and a numerically strong class is always entitled to sjjecial consideration from Members of Parliament. But, sir, I desire to believe that the attitude of honourable members towards the Bill is based upon higher and better grounds than that, and that the House approaches the question in a spirit of treasonable consideration, believing that one of the great and vital essentials of any civilized State is a competent and contented public sendee. Of course, the public servants themselves did not make this Commonwealth, nor did they create the machinery for its working ; but they are the working bees within the hive who may be said to run the machine; and it is incumbent upon us, as representatives of the people of Australia, to see that these working bees, as I have termed them, work under legislation that not only makes competent aud good work possible, but, so far as may be, compels it . Now, sir, the Minister of Home Affairs, in introducing this Bill, and the honourable member for Wentworth, in following him, referred to the Bill as a measure made up of clippings from other Acts of Parliament bear upon the public service. And so it is. The Bill is made up from various other Public Service Acts; but I would rather describe it as being, a judicious selection of those portions of the Public Service Acts of the States which our experience has shown to be worthy of being copied. In dealing with this, our first Pederal Bill, we should endeavour to make it such a Bill that each and every one of the other States will endeavour to emulate it, and to, as far as possible, bring their public service legislation into unison with it . I do not desire to enter upon a dissertation in regard to the various clauses, but underlying the B ill there are certain vital and great principles. The first great principle of all appears to be that ib is absolutely essential bhere should be no political influence. Thab opinion has been stated by almost every member who has spoken on this occasion. Our experience in New South WalesifI may. be permitted to make reference to ib-ha s been, -wibh regard to the non-political control of the deparbmenbs of bhe public service and bhe railways, that time after time various members have started on a sort of "" scalp hunting "" expedition, and have delivered serious and acrimonious speeches against the Public Service Board and the Railway Commissioners. But the result has always been the same. Although some of the charges may have rested on a substratum of truth, and although it is perfectly true that now and again there may have been faults in the administration of the departments, the Parliament of New South Wales has always starbed back wibh horror and dismay from bhe albernative, a reburn to political influence. There can be no doubt that the view taken by the Parliament of New South Wales will be the view taken by the Pederal Parliament of Australia, and we look bo bhe legal members of bhe House-and I feel bhere is a heavy responsibility on themto see that we laymen are not misled, and that political influence is absolutely destroyed by the Bill. I do nob desire bo be capbious. I have only one end in view-b o geb the best Bill we can, a Bill which will be worthy of us and worthy of what we believe will be the important functions of the federal public service of Australia. There is another",53,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled
281,Mr Ewing (Richmond),"Possibly nopoint to which I would like to make reference, although it may be regarded as a detail. The Bill must be so framed that no man shall enter the service who has not a sane mind in a sound body. I think it was the honourable member for Bourke, and also the honourable and learned member for Wentworth, who pointed out that it was possible by a system of examination to test men who desired to enter the service. I am prepared to concede at once that the only way to test what may be called comparative intellectual ability is by examination, and though not a perfect way, it is still the best we have. But other things approaching anything like equality, I should be almost inclined to put physical vigour tlie physique of a man-first , and to choose a healthy candidate rather than a weakly one. Wei n this century are rather inclined, with our wonderful labour-saving appliances and inventions, to under-estimate physical strength; but if there be one thing that is fundamental in dealing with this matter, it is that every man who enters the service shall be a strong and healthy individual. I do not want to enter into a dissertation as to whether literary men are inclined to be feeble, though, of course, the question of literature lies very close to our public service work. makes a suggestion of the kind, the names' of Stevenson, Gibbon, Prescott, and a number of others occur in the minds of men accustomed to reading. Great and important work has been done by weakly men, and their names at times have been written large in English literature, dealing -with the question' big and large, the work of the world, both in business and in literature, is done by healthy men, and the best work of the public service, generally .speaking, will be done by healthy men. In regard to tbe great and vital question of health, there is no man in any Parliament of the world to-day, who has been there a little while, who does not know men of brilliant abilities and great powers, whose physique was not such as to enable them to stand the hurly-burly of those turbulent assemblages, and who, therefore, soon left public life. Every man who succeeds in public life is possessed of strong physique, as may be seen by a glance at the front benches on the Government side of this House. Josh Billings, it may be remembered, on one -occasion, speaking on this subject said that [71] a good reliable set of digestive organs-h e used a homelier phrase-wa s worth any quantity of brain. If any person chooses to look round this Assembly he will not, perhaps, find an absolute verification of those words, but he will find a verification of the statement that to succeed and live long in public life a man must be possessed of physical power and a considerable amount of good health. I hope, therefore, that,' before we have done with this measure, we will make it perfectly clear that in the public service we require men of sound health. There is one more question to which I would like to refer, and I ask the House to bear with me for a moment while I endeavour to emphasize it. From the statement of the Minister for Home Affairsi n introducing tlie measure, and from tlie temper of the dpbate last night-wit h regard to which there can be no mistaketake it that we are going to absolutely destroy political influence. But we must be careful that we do not permit what is almost as pernicious an influence to spring up, namelybureaucratic influence, or what might be called departmental favour or patronage. You must guard carefully against that. I sympathized with the honourable member in charge of the Bill the difficulties of his The moment one position. The' honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Wentworth have said that we should run the Commonwealth public service as a business concern. That is absolutely true in this sense, that in no case should competent men be working under incompetent men. There should be no system which destroys men's imaginations and brings about the sort of ossified intellect which we are accustomed to believe is sometimes found amongst public servants who are not in our own electorates. The honourable member for Wentworth pointed out a special difliculty in regard to dealing with the public service as a business' concern, and he might have gone a little further. The essence of the matter is that 'the merchant or successful man of business -the lawyer or solicitor-is placed where there is one great principle obtaining1 the principle of the survival of the fittest Such a man has one customer, the public,' which knows nothing of political exigencies -and nothing of individual relationships. He -has to cater for the public, and the best man wins. 'Buti n the public service there is"" no competitor; the public service stands alone. I ""understand the difficulty which besets the Minister with this Bill. 'He has to endeavour by internal arrangements to create inside what is virtually a watertight compartment that competition and life, without which the public service is not complete, which is found in tlie hurly-burly of the world. We talk breezily about the destruction of political influence. one of us shouts as though we would almost lift the roof, and you, Mr Speaker, and others, in addressing electors, are accustomed to the promulgation regard to a pure and competent service. always a little bald-headed man in front, who keeps cheering those great but that very man meets you round the corner with the pressing request to have his promising boy put into the public service.

Thoseare the points which I consider essential in the Bill. In the presence of the lawyers of the HouseI approach this question with aconsiderable amount of temerity, and I Each and every would like them to tell us exactly-and I am sure the Minister for Home Affairs wants what ideas he can get-the position in which tlie commissioner will stand under of theories in the Bill. learned friend finds a difficulty, what diffisentiments, culty must the question possess for me 1 In New South Wales the Act is tabulated, and a list given of the duties which fall to the lot of the Public Service Board.

285,What Mr Ewing,"Honorabl e members willso that we may know exactly what we have clone with the Bill when we have finished with it. In clause 23 it will bo seen that regulations are to be made for examinations. I should' like to insist on the word "" competitive"" being used, but that is simply by the way. These regulations are made by the Governor General; and I have said perhaps enough to establish the difficulty that is in my mind with regard to the question of political influence. In regard to minor matters, such as that, for instance, referred to by the honourable member for Parkes, I do not think any of us would care to see the term "" inspector"" used, but would rather sec the head man called "" administrator "" or "" commissioner,"" and the other officers called "" sub-commissioners."" matters, but they do not appear to be of vital importance at the second-reading stage. Honourable members may accept a Bill which may be right in general principle but in which there, is much that is wrong in detail, and therefore I am placing before the House the amendments that suggest themselves to my mind. The Minister in charge of tlie Bill says-and I know the honesty of his intentions-that although the Governor General will make the regulations, they will really be made by the chief commissioner. stated that the regulations will be made by the commissioner. Take, for instance, the case of the secretaries to Ministers, of whom we heard so much last night. Supposing that after the Bill is passed it turns out that political influence obtains, and we find that a man we have chosen and placed in a high position is really a tool of the Executive. In such a case, what would be the use of sending on to him for discussion any question in which the Ministry is vitally interested <' Mr G. B. EDWAKDS -Parliamen t has its remedy. is in Parliament long enough he will know what parliamentary remedies mean. will discover how easy it is with a majority to apply that majority to a bad cause, and he will one day form one of a majority that will be applied to a bad cause. I should like, finally, to enforce one point. When the time comes for the House to determine on the salary of the chief commissioner and his inspectors-by whatever name we may call them-we shall be told that they must be men of gieat ability and absolutely trustworthy, and that we must give them large salaries. But if we give those men large salaries, let us give them responsibilities . commensurate with their salaries. If we employ good men, let us endeavour, as far as we can, to give f u l l responsibility, and let us place them in such a posi* tion that Parliament and the people will get value for their money. Of course, in a civilized community one has to trust somebody, and we get rid of the suspicion which belongs to more barbarous peoples. But there is one tiling I am not prepared to trust, and that is departmental, or rather political interference, with the public service of the country. I do not desire to say anything further than that I hope the There are a number of other lawyers in tlie House, who have f u l l knowledge of these matters, will give us eveiy assistance. I sometimes think that the lawyers who come to this House at £ 4 0 0 a a year are the most patriotic men who are returned to Parliament. It is a horrible and terrible thing to say, but that is my opinion. I see around -me men on both sides of the chamber-attorney s and barristers-whos e time to a large number of tliem is worth £ 4 0 or £ 5 0 I beg those honourable members' pardon, I mean guineas -o r 100 guineas a clay. Why on earth If that is so, it ought to be these men, who are supposed to be bubbling over with selfishness and living as a parasitic class on the communityj come to Parliament I do not know. It is not pure love, however, and there may be some other reason for it, of which I know nothing. But to every able lawyer who looks at this Bill carefully, it is simply like shelling peas, and every one of tliem has a special responsibility to place us right in regard to its provisions. I hope we shall find that the lawyers of the House will discharge their obligations to their fellow members and to the country. oppressed by the weight of the responsibility thrown on the shoulders of myself and my He brother lawyers in this House, but I feel also that the committee stage is the proper stage at which to' endeavour to discharge that responsibility. W it h regard to tlie Bill itself, I presume that on the second reading debate it is our duty to draw attention only to the broad principles-so far as they occur to our minds-that we wish to present to the House. I should like ; to say at the beginning that I recognise.",56,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled

287,Mr Isaacs (Indi),"I feel terriblyin this B ill a well-intentioned effort to deal with a very difficult subject, and to deal with it upon very broad lines. would like, also, to remark that I appreciate the drafting of the Bill. It is easy to follow tlie mental course pursued by those whose responsibility it has been to give directions in its framing. trouble the House at this stage with a few observations upon what I think are important matters. the four divisions into which the civil service is to 1 e di vided, theclericaldivision is the only one that is to have definite statutory classification and salaries. With regard to the special division, the secretaries, chief officers and other officers put into it , will depend entirely on tbe decision of this Chamber in dealiug with the Appropriation Bill. mendation of the commissioner. tion is given it is for this House to determine from year to year what the salaries shall be. With regard to the professional division I understand that their salaries and classification are to be determined by regulation. Sir WILLIAM L r i r i i also should be voted by the House. That is done in New South Wales. the prima"" facie intention of the Bill. W it h regard to the clerical division, in respect of winch we are expected definitely to say in this measure what their classes, subdivisions, and salaries shall be, I take up this position-;-rathe r differing from that of my honourable and -learned friend for Tasshould understand definitely what their rights are to be. I recognise that circumstances may arise when it may be necessary to deal in some exceptional manner witli public servants, but that ought not to be contemplated in this Bill. Public servants ought to know, like any other contractors with the State, what are their rights. I certainly cannot recognise the position that these rights are only tentative, and, that civil servants are to understand that we are making provisions to which we may not intend to adhere. On the assumption that we are laying down certain definite lines, T would draw attention to the fact that some provisions are introduced which are at variance with that position. If I were a public servant, I should feel that I had not any very definite rights under this BillI as to the tenure of my position. I shall pojnt out why. In the first place, passing from the doubtful nature of the tenure, and dealing rather with the arrangement of the Bill, I wish to say that I recognise in the I shall only provision regarding promotion, that the Victorian system is t« a large extent adopted-that is, the long automatic step by I recognise that in step system. I sympathize very strongly with what f e l l from the lips of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, in regard to the desirability of granting automatic increases to some of the lower paid officers. I think we might grant such increases up .to tlie fifth class. U n t il we reach the maximum of the fifth class, which is a little over £ 3 per week, we might fairly say that officers should rise step by step through the various subdivisions of that class, and that this right should only be taken from them through misconduct or any other demerit after it had been proved in the ordinary way. In close juxtaposition to the provisions as to promotion, I see a new subclause, embodying a new principle, and one which may be of great service to the State, but which is capable, if badly administered, I think that they of working great injustice. I find that, notwithstanding the ordinary provision that no officer is to rise more than a step at a time, in sub-clause (8) of clause 21, power is given to promote any officer from any class to the next higher class on the reconimendation of a permanent head, the approval of the Minister, and the nomination of the commissioner, although he may not have served even one year in each subdivision of the class from which he has been promoted. I recognise that there maybe cases of exceptional meiit that should be treated in this way, but it is a power to be jealously safe-guarded, because nothing is calculated to dishearten the service more than to. find juniors promoted over the heads of seniors, 'without, as may seem, apparent good cause. It is a power to be very sparingly used. It should be very carefully exercised in administration, and care should be taken that the idea is not allowed to generate that any favour may be expected by officers in its application. It is provided that a copy of every recommendation,approval, and nomination is to be laid before Parliament. I suggest that not only should such recommendation, approval, and nomination be laid before Parliament, but",57,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled

291,"Mania, Mr Piesse","that public servantsthat the reasons for this exceptional treatment should also be laid before Parliament. In this connection clause 27 provides that where there is no person available in the public service capable of filling tlie position to which it is proposed an .appointment shall be made, the Minister can go outside of the service. No doubt such a power ought to exist, bub here again I say that the public servants who are doing the drudgery of the States should be regarded as the first body to be looked to. It is only right when prizes exist, that the rank and file should be able to look to securing those prizes if they honestly deserve them. this clause ought to be regarded as a very exceptional one indeed, and one to be sparingly used, as I mentioned before. at the present time in Queensland, 'Victoria, and New South Wales. entering upon a very much larger field, and while .1 do not suggest that the clause should be eliminated, I draw attention to it because it includes a very useful and perhaps a very dangerous power. Reference has been made to a principle which finds embodiment in the ""Victorian Railways Act, and, however defective that principle may have been in its operation, it must be remembered that, to a large extent, it was an experiment which I consider was worthy of trial. That principle was to allow representation upon the inquiry board which has to deal with the position of any officer -representatio n out of the class in .which such officer found himself. It has been suggested that there should be a permanent inquiry board. apprehend, by this Bill that there shall be a permanent inquiry board, because I find that in sub-clause (d) of clause 71 power is given to the Governor General to make regulationsFor constituting in any pnrfc of tlie Commonlines, and therefore cannot be baken as a wealth, or for any locality or department in any locality, boards of inquiry. I am inclined, upon reading this, to tlie opinion that boards of inquiry are intended to lie constituted even before the necessity for using them exists. If that is not so, it should be distinctly stated. There is warrant in clause 40 for thinking that that may not be the case; but I should like this matter to be made quite clear before would not give them vested interests in the Bill passes from this House. But their offices ? while the Bill makes provision for guarding the rights of officers by providing that every officer may rely, before he is reprimanded, fined, or dismissed, upon having ai certain course of procedure gone through, and while his position is not to be taken from him without due cause, this Bill contains a clause which allows every one of these safeguards to be swept away. Clause 57 readsNothing in this Act shall be construed or held to abrogate or restrict the right or power of the Crown to dispense with the services of any person employed in the public service other than the commissioner and inspectors. The power conferred by In other words, the provision gives power to the Crown to regard the whole of its servants as holding office ""during pleasure,"" and enacts that if the Ministry wish, they can dismiss any man, and he will have no legal right to object to it . 8 tbe honourable member will findthe same thing. member for Northern Melbourne points out that sub-clause (5) of clause S contains a similar provision. It reads as follows :If in the opinion of the commissioner the services of any officers in excess in any department are not likely to be required in any other department the Governor General may call upon such officers to retire from the public service ; and every such officer so called upon to retire shall retire accordingly. That provision is fairly strong, but nob nearly so strong as the clause to which I have called attention. ""Under clause 57, without the interposition of the commissioner, and without the report ab all of the permanent head, it is within the political It is contemplated, I power of the Government of the day to dismiss any officer, and he has no right of redress. I think that is too strong a power bo confer. Ib exisbs in bhe New Soubh Wales Acb and in bhe Canadian Acb; bub bhe Canadian Acb is on totally different guide at all.

Let us either say that we will leave the matter absolutely in the hands of the Government, or let us give a reality to these provisions which guard the rights of public servants. Why give them exceptional rights if in a , general business they would not get them ? learned member for South Australia will be able to discuss that point.

But, whatever it is intended to mean, I would ask that the meaning of the clause be made clear. I find in clause 37 that a principle is adopted which is worthy of very careful consideration. It is intended thab for every class in every department there shall be an examination. Apparently bhe examination is not to be a literary examination. It is not bo be an examination for which every man may qualify himself : but ib is bo be an examination of a special kind, specially It is a matter of contract. adapted bo the particular class of the particular department; because it is to have reference to the work to be performed by the"" department, and to be upon the subjects a knowledge of which would increase bhe efficiency of bhe department. It is difficult, as ib seems bo me, for any member of bhe service not engaged in bhe particular class in question to do that work. There may be classes to which this observation would not apply: but there musb be other classes to which it will apply, and I see there a great possibility of shutting out thousands of men in every department from any chance of getting into the other departments. They may be shut out because they have nob had opportunities of qualifying themselves for bhe examination, it may be bhab bhe principle thus laid clown in the Bill is absolutely right, but at present I am not convinced of bhe propriety of it. These are considerations which are very important I .purposely refrain from sroins into what I mav call bhe committee aspects of the measure, such as questions ot wording and drafting : bub what I have dealt with are bhe. large principles which strike me, and which are to a considerable as strongly. extent outsidfe those considerations which have been bouched upon by other honourable members.

308,Mr Tudor (Yarra),"There are one or-upon bhe Bill ab bhis sbage, more particularly concerning not bhe clerical or professional divisions, bub bhe general workers who are included under bhe terms of the measure. Whilei t is specified how the members of the clerical and professional divisions anay rise in the service, no provision is made -whereby members in the general division of the public service can be promoted from one class to another. It has been a great fault in many measures similar to this which have been brought in. in the various States that the general workers have been thus neglected. In ""Victoria, as I am well aware, we have had married men working in the public service for £ 6 0 a year. MrO ' MAI . LEV honourable member for Tasmania, Mr ployed in any department of the CommonO'Malley, that it is a disgrace, and it is one that I hope will not be perpetuated in bhe 'Commonwealth service. There are several clauses in this Bill to which I take exception, and I will at once direct attention to them. The honourable and learned member for Indi objecbs to sub-clause (2) of clause 27. J hold the opinion that that clause must be altered, though not perhaps in the direction that he thinks. We have had examples in V ictoria, where the effect of a similar clause in the Public Service Act has been that it has prevented men of ability from obtaining -certain positions in particular departments, whilst other men who have been longer away from theirtradeor calling haveeasilyobtained positions as inspectors of those trades. Indeed, the longer a man has been away from -a trade, and, consequently, the less he knows about it, the more easy it has been for him to obtain the position of inspector. That is a stabe of things that should not be permitted under any measure such as this. On the creation of any new office, 1 should prefer to see the appointments thrown open to the best men obtainable, whether inside or outside bhe civil service. Ib has been said that this is a practical and business measure, and that we should not take a man from one branch of the State service to another, provided wo can get a man of greater ability from outside : and I think that the principle that should befolio wed is to get the ablestmen -obtainable into the service of the Commonwealth. In clause 28 bhere is a prohibitory provision which will prevent men over the age of 40 years from being appointed to the service. I think that is a wrong proposal. Why .should we say that when a man has arrived at the age of 40 years he is absolutely useless to the Commonwealth 1 I could understand that provision if it were also provided in the Bill that we were to pay pensions to men on retiring from the service at the age of 60, or at any other age : but, as there is no such provision in the Bill, it should be perfectly possible for men, at any rate, up to the age of 50, to obtain access to the departments. There are men at present working as temporary hands who would be prevented by this Bil l from obtaining permanent appointments. Thab should nob be so. In clause 34 bhe conditions governing temporary employment in the civil service ore laid down, but in addition to this proI t is a disgrace. vision, there should be a clause inserted to I quite agree with the provide bhab men who are temporarily emwealth, shall receive at least the minimum wage paid to the permanent men. I referred last night to bhe case of a man employed in bhe Commonwealth service at 5s. a day for temporary work, when the minimum wage for permanent men doing that particular work is 6s. a day. Jf a temporary hand is doing the same kind of work as a permanent man, he is entitled to at least the same minimum pay. In addition to that, the temporary employees should be entitled to the gazetted holidays. The permanent men in the departments receive all the gazetted holidays, a half-holiday per week, and their annual leave. The bemporary men have none of bbese privileges. All I claim for them is that at least they should receive bhe half-holiday per week and bhe gazebbed holidays. I am quite willing that they should not have annual leave, and I am perfectly aware that under the terms of this Bill they would not be entitled to it, because they are not allowed bo be employed for twelve months in that status. The honourable member for Bourke has raised tlie point that men who are dismissed from the service for any cause should have the light of appeal. I agree with that contention. I also urge that the appeal Board should be representative to some extent of the class to which the appellants belong. If they are in the clerical branch, there should be a member' of the clerical branch of the service of the State to which the appellants belong sitting upon the Appeal Board. In regard to insurance for State employees, I hope that provision will be made for insuring public servants by the State. We should not attempt. to make",60,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled

When the Government compel persons joining the service to insure, bhey should undertake that insurance themselves. Under clause 53 I notice that rent is to be charged for quarters, in cases where any person may be compelled bo use for purposes of residence a building belonging bo the Commonwealth. It is quite possible that in the Commonwealth service we may require men to work in out-of-the-way and distant places. Por instance, in the post office service, we compel men bo go inbo bhe interior of South Australia bo attend to the telegraph line. These men, under this clause, may be compelled to pay rent for the quarters they use in the interior, but when . we compel men in bhe discharge of their duty to go bo out-of-the-way places, far removed from civilization, we surely should not make a charge to them for the buildings they occupy under such circumstances, f notice this point because the line repairers on the Victorian railways are compelled to pay rent for the miserable huts or tents bhey use when discharging their duties in the country. needs to be carefully considered before ibis passed. Clause 18 says that in the general division the officers shall be paid salaries or wages in accordance with a fixed amount or scale that may be prescribed. I hope to see something pub inbo bhe clause bo bhe effeob bhat no male in the employment of bhe Sbabe shall, after five years service, receive less than £ 1 0 5 per annum. That is a poor living enough for any adult male, and I do not think there will be much objection on the part of the House to inserting such an amendment when we arrive at the proper stage. AVe are all aware that the subject of bhis Bill is a difficult one, and I trust that the effect of the measure will be that we shall bring into existence for the work of the Commonwealth a public service that will be beneficial to all Australia. think any apology is required from an honourable member who wishes to speak upon an important and far-reaching Bill like this. There is a tendency on the part of honourable members of a modest turn to curtail their utterances rather than prolong the debate. Buti t must be remembered that we are having submitted bo us in bhis House ab bhe present time a large number of Bills, any one of which would makeasufficienbfigure-head in a speech from the Crowni n any State Parlia=ment. We are asked to deal with what I call bho the very fundamentals of Government in a series of Bills, all of which are presented to us in a few days. I make no apology for speaking to this question, because we have here a Bill by which many thousands of bhe people of bhis counbry will be affected; and I cannot help feeling that it is a matter of great importance, not only to those thousands of people, but to the whole community of Australia, who, to a great extenb, by bhis measure will be bound by something in the nature of a contract with the civil servants. We are practically framing a scheme by which the positions of thousands of people in one of the most important services of the country are going to be determined. AAe have bo realize that in T this, as in all contracts, there are two sides to the question.. AVe are here as the representatives of the people in the fii-st place, to see bhab bhis arrangemenb, which is to stand between the people and its public servants, will guarantee to the state a due performance of cerbain .work that is necessary in the interests of bhe Commonwealth. This clause We have, on the obher hand, bo see bhab we build up a service in bhe employinenb of bhe Commonwealth, not upon parsimonious lines, but in harmony to a greab exbenb wibh bhe sorb of arrangemenb that is made between the great commercial concerns of the country and their servants. A t bhe same bime we have bo see bhab bhe arrangemenb we make will lead bo bhe establishmenb of a service which will become an attraction to the most intellectual men in the country. I have no hesibabion in saying bhab I have on several occasions, as a Member of Parliament and as a Minister of the Crown, had to deplore bhe unwillingness of parenbs bo pub bheir sons inbo the public service of New South Wales.

311,Mr Bru Ce Smith,"As we pointedthe neighbouring State is the sound and wise one. Whether that is or is not the case, I hold that we should be guided to some extent by the experiences of the mother country in this matter. Compai'T ing great things with small, we know very well that when a inan enters the public service of Great Britain, he can see ahead of him a passible peerage; because it is not an uncommon thing for the permanent head of a great public department in Great .Britain to be raised to the peerage when he becomes old and retires with honour from the' occupation of a lifetime. I am afraid we cannot , Offer any prize of that sort in Australia; but, at any rate, we want to make our public service attractive. We should make it attractive to the best men in the country. Tlie prizes at the heads of the departments, and the salaries paid, should be of such a character that the young men who go to our universities, and who take their degrees, shall feel attracted towards the public service as a profession ; and, though he begins at a salary not lower than that which would be paid by one of the various banking institutions of Australia to a clerk, the .young civil servant should always know that, by good conduct, and by making an effort to distinguish himself, he may rise through a series of grades, and reach, if not a peerage, at any rate, the leg of mutton on the top of the greasy pole. I am quite sure the honourable gentleman in charge of this Bill will not only nob deprecate, but will encourage any observations that honourable members may choose to make, because he knows that the second reading of a, Bil l like this-is a matter of course, and that any observations that are made are in the nature of suggestions, not only to him, but sometimes to ourselves. I say thab because, in bhe process of thinking out this question, one's mind is drawn from one side to tbe other by certain great principles which the Bill contains. 1 confess that the subject of administration, looked at in an abstract way, has always had great attractions for me. 1 have ever taken great interest in trying to discover some of the great principles underlying the science of administration as it appears in connection with the great public departments of England, where, perhaps, £100,000,000 of money are being wielded. I took great interest, for instance, in the administrative work of that master of administration, the late Mr Eddy, who was imported from . England to undertake the organization of the greatest branch of the public service of New South Wales. I prefer to look upon this Bil l as a sort of standing arrangement thab the Parliament of the Commonwealth is about to make between its servants and ibs people. Wbilsb on bhe one hand we must see that the terms of this arrangement are such as will secure to the people a due performance of the work contracted for, and clue payment for bhat work, we must also see that the public service of the country is placed upon such a level that it guarantees a provision and a life's occupation for the best men the country can produce. The Ministeri n charge of the Bill thought fit in one portion of his speech to point out that the primary object of the Bill was to substibube political influence for social influence. nob sav that. the words down. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I said that political influence was bad enough, but that social influence was worse. we will bake ib bhat the honourable gentleman pub ib in thab way. He gave, as an illustration, the condition of things in New South Wales, and he mentioned that the extreme form of non-political patronage had been adopted i u tliat Sbabe under ibs Public Service Act. He went so far as bo say that it did not work well; but I do not think ib was quite fair to give to this House, in regard to New South Wales, only one illustration, and that an illustration which suited the honourable gentleman's argument. Another service in New South Wales, namely, the Bail way service, can be quoted as a most splendid illustration of the successful working of non-political patronage. that is a different thing; it is differently constituted. genblemen does nob see a parallel bebween bhe bwo services, 1 am afraid I cannob help him. Of course, bhe services are differently constituted. But what I want to point out to bhe House is that the honourable gent einan gave as an illustration of the nonsuccess of the non-political patronage system the Public Service Board of New South Wales, and then he was silent. He said that because.",62,William Lyk B < I Want To Keep Minister Would Run The Risk Of Being Hauled

335,Mr Bruce Smith,"Mr Eddy. Heshowed greater regret or greater grief at the death of Mr Eddy than did the men employed in the railway service of that State. I do not want to be eonsidei'ed at all provincial in dealing with one State, but we are told that history is philosphy teaching by example. We look naturally to the country in which the system of non-political interference has been tried, aud we cannot look to New South Wales without feeling that while on the one hand, under certain conditions, the non-political system has been a failure, it has ou tlie other hand, been a remarkable and splendid success. There is really a lot to be gained from the experience of that State. one of the objections to a politically managed public service is that Parliament is frequently ^occupied over questions of ^detail in connection with the grievances of individual members of tbe service. the nuisance extends beyond that. is a well known fact that under a politically managed public service, questions of such a character as to make public life almost impossible for men who have other occupations thousands to honourable members. not wish to do so, but I could quote instances in New South Wales in which during the political management of the public services, business men, merchants, and professional men were compelled to give up political life because of what I might call the inundation of their offices and homes by men seeking situations, complaining of having lost situations or of disrating, or trying to get relatives into the service. system, which I strongly advocate, we save the time of Parliament, and of members, and although it may seem a very remote sequence, we give encouragement to a better class of men-at occupations of their own-to come and take a part in the political life of the country. The honourable' member for Wentworth out very properly that there were two extremes here. There is the extreme case of non-political management, and the other extreme case of political and I understand the ideal which he wishes to see brought about is a sort of moderate between the two. For my part I have no desire to see the thread of connection between Parliament and the public service completely severed. It is quite certain that we must have a Minister in Parliament who Mr .Bruce Smith. is responsible to the popular representatives for the management or mismanagement of the public service of the country. On the other hand we do not want cross purposes to arise such as have arisen recently in England between LordWolseley and Lord Lansdowne. That is a case very useful as illustrating the underlying principle of administration. In one of the greatest services in England, we find quite suddenly, that the man who was supposed to be permanently at the head, had been enjoying or suffering under such very limited jurisdiction that it is not at all unlikely we shall find' hereafter that very serious consequences in South Africa, were I have mentioned that the result of either maladministration or unwise administration in the mother country. On the other hand we do not want the other extreme of political patronage, and I hope that when the Bill comes out of But committee it will be in such a state that, It whilst we shall have retained Ministerial control so that the Minister will be able to explain everything and anything, that takes place, we shall have escaped the trammels of political management, and relieved Parliato follow come by ment and its members from the curse of I do which I have already spoken in detail. I am now dealing with general principles only. The honourable gentleman dealt with the question of the salary of the commissioner, and I had forgotten' for the moment that in the Bill only one commissioner is recommended. The honourable gentleman told us he thought the sum of £1.500 was a fair remuneration for such a man. and went on to say that he By a non-political was going to get an excellent man for the position. I would like to ask the honourable member whether he thinks be is going to get such a man-no t in the service for, of course, he could get a man in the serviceall events men who have but whether he thinks he can get a man out of the service of the type he has described in rather glowing language for £1,500 a year. pointed This is really a matter of detail to be considered in committee. But I should like to say that I differ entirely from those politicians who are under the impression management, that we can manage all our great departhim to say that ments and our great positions of State on small salaries. Honourable members know compromise very well that in the larger institutions in Great Britain, there are men who receive from £5,000, to £10,000 a year, and are considered cheap at that. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -What is the country's income. to do with the matter. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It has, because we ence is very different from mine if he cannot afford to pay more than a certain recommends that whenever anything examount. that it is a question of the amount of money shall be made a sort of bone of contention involved in the service which you are between tlie two sides in Parliament. appointing this man to manage. Prom time to time men are found receiving immense salaries, but the salaries are a to hear the honourable and learned member mere fleabite compared with the immense say so, because I was a little surprised that amount of money involved in the services a man of some administrative experience which they are managing. A t the present should have made such a suggestion. time there are under-secretaries in New South Wales receiving £1,200 a year, where exceptional treatment had been and the Minister for Home Affairs accorded to any officer of the commontells us that we are going to get a comwealth by way of promotion the reasons for missioner, who is to be over a very large such treatment should be laid before the number of under-secretaries, and who is to House. control the whole public service of Australia for £300 a year more than they are getting, what I understood. I was perfectly right or for the same amount as we get a County in thinking that the honourable member Court Judge for in New South Wales. The advocated that in any exceptional case the honorable gentleman is talking in a way which matter should come before Parliament. I think will not be endorsed by the House. hope that when the Bill leaves this House' As illustrating the great value which is it will be so framed that Parliament will placed upon a specialist's services, did we not be troubled with such questions.

346,Mr Bruc E Smith,"Not even when IMinister for Home Affairs said that the commissioner would be required to make a report to Parliament periodically. I have no objection to that principle, but I see very strong indications of what was figuratively called by an honourable member opposite the "" t r a i l of the Minister"" all through the Bill. Honourable members will notice in the Bill a very frequent reference to the Governor General, which under the interpretation clause means the Governor General in Council. Every honourable member of this House who has had the honour of being a Minister of the Crown will know that when that very big phrase is boiled down it very often means the under-secretary of the department of one of the Ministers. In the first place it means the Minister, because where the Government has plenty of business to transact the Minister brings up his minute to Cabinet. All the other Ministers bring up their minutes, and every Minister is so anxious about his own minute that very often he does not give that attention to those of his Ministerial colleagues that he should do. Then there is a sort of esprit de corps amongst Ministers, which makes them accept on unimportant questions the dictum of the particular Minister concerned. goes before Cabinet, is adopted as a matter of course in many cases, and then is transmitted to the Executive Council. The Governor does not go into these matters in any great detail, and consequently we find that the opinion of the Minister becomes by this process of evolution the opinion of the Governor in Council. In cases where a Minister has an under-secretary in whom he places very great confidence, he will sometimes accept the suggestion of the under-secretary, and make it his own, with perhaps insufficient examination. In that way in a great many instances the under secretary's recommendation ultimately develops into the much more formidable entit)' of the dictum of the Governor in Council. this Bill a very large number of cases in which matters are left entirely to the Minister. Sir WILLIAM LYNE Minister when we get into committee. In my opinion this Bill leans much more to the system of political patronage than it does to the non-political system. It is very mixed, because in some cases matters are left entirely in the hands of the Minister --that is to say, in the hands of the Governor General in Council--whils t in other cases they are left to the commissioner. Tn one case 1 notice that the head of the department is put into communication with the Minister without tbe commissioner being mentioned at all. When the Bill gets into committee I shall make a modest attempt to'produce as nearly as possible an approach to the non-political system, for the reasons which I have given. The Minister for Home Affairs has referred to an abuse which arose in New South Wales by reason of the Public Service Board delegating certain inquiries to a subordinate boaid. There is no doubt that an abuse of that sort did take place, and it is one that we shall do well to bear in mind. The Public Service Board of New South Wales delegated some of their inspection .to certain of their subordinate officers. Those delegates went into the different public departments with a ferret-like disposition, and actually made inquiries _ as to the private movements of the heads of those departments, without those heads knowing that they were there. Thusi t came about that the heads of certain departments, without ever Thusi t is that a minute having been consulted, found that action had been taken by the Public Service Board on the strength of the reports of those delegates. We should do well, at all events, to avoid such an abuse. But the fact that such an abuse took place does not constitute any reason why we should denounce the system of non-political management, because it is merely an excrescence that we can get rid of without touching the body of the institution. I think that this is a very opportune time to consider what should be the principle of administration in a huge department of this sort.

My honourable friend is too far gone. It is a new thing to see a Government in this country having the courage to introduce into a Bill this element of private enterprise. The Government practically say "" We are not going to bother ourselves with all this insurance business; there are plenty of corporations who are conducting this business well, and at a lower rate than we could do it for as a Government. These corporations will not be subject to political influence, and they will give you value for your money. All we require is that you shall obtain a policy which will secure to you and to your family certain results in tlie event of your dying, or, in case of your retiring, will give you back all the money you have paid in . "" But, while I applaud this action, I think the Government should have some sort of ""say"" as to the character of the ' particular insurance companies in which these policies may be taken out. I do not wish to individualize at a l l ; I can only say that there are insurance companies which I should not like the civil servants of this country to depend upon. On tlie other hand, there are insurance companies and societies which are strong enough to bear the strain of a plague through the civil service. I think that by-and-by, perhaps, tlie Minister might find it desirable to put into one of the clauses the names of a number of approved insurance companies. nor in Council1 would then have to give a guarantee of the solvency of these insurance companies. question. I think not. There are only one or two more observations I wish to make. There is a phrase in the Bill which is used with regard to some very important officers, who are called inspectors. I have no fault to find with the etymology of that word, but its associations are not such as to make it acceptable to the service. The use of the word "" inspector "" suggests a certain kind of spying out in regard to the details of the offices of the public service. There are plenty of other words which would serve the purpose better. Theofficialski question might be called "" sub-commissioners."" That phrase would convey some sense of dignity, and it would make it clearer that the officials were not supposed to act as spies, or to search out the conditions of the service in such a way as would make their presence uncomfortable to tlie other officers. get rid of the fact 1 but sentiment has a great deal to do with this life, and the associations of the word "" inspector"" are such that one should consider the people in whose interests this Bill is being passed. I therefore think that it is just as easy and satisfactory to use a phrase like "" sub-commissioners,"" and I should recommend the adoption of thatphrase instead of the word "" inspectors."" I have spoken to the Minister on the question of rotation, and I should like to mention it to the House. Honourable members will notice that in the schedule certain officers are placed in different classes ; there is a first class, a second class, a third class, and so on. These classes again are graded according to subdivisions, and the rotation of the subdivisions is just in the opposite direction to the rotation of the classes. A man who is at the top of the civil service is, very properly, in the first class, and his number cannot be altered, but if you had six subdivisions in the service and wished to create a seventh, you would, under the present arrangement, have to alter the rotation of the numbers of the sub-classes. It is not a matter of much importance, but I should say that the subdivisions should run in the same order as by the Goverthe principal classes; and just as we say of a ship that she is "" A l , "" so we should say of a civil servant who has attained to a But the Government high position that he is "" 1st class, 1st division.""

He deprecated the introduction of women in the civil service of this country. I want to cross swords with him on that subject. I think that so long as we-compel women to pay land tax, income tax, and rates, and so long as we make them amenable to the laws of our land just as the men are amenable to them, they have an equal right to have their say in the making of those laws, and an equal right also to compete with us men in the offices of State for the management of those taxes. the side of those who woidd allow women to enter into these employments. women do the work of men they should receive the pay that men receive. The honourable member for Kooyong said that the breadwinner should be the only person allowed to compete for these places. The honourable member has been more fortunate -o r shall I say more unfortunate?-in ' his acquaintance with the other sex .than I have been; because I have met a very large number of estimable women who have been breadwinners. They have had neither husbands, nor brothers, nor fathers to sustain them, and have had to be their own breadwinners. My own impression is that we should open the doors for the employment of women as readily as we do for men. We should accept their services as readily as we do those of men admit them to Parliament ?

I have an idea that But I would these things should cut both ways. The honourable and learned member knows that every public servant can to-morrow leave the service if he chooses. There is no Commonwealth ; and if a man were asked to enter into such an obligation, I am sure every sensible public servant would .refuse.

It sometimes happens that, though .originally a man had the mental machinery which should have fitted him for a higher office,, after having served the Government for many years he is found to be unfitted for it . Because the In bhab case, bhe Minister, who knows facts with which the outside world is not familiar, is bhe besb judge as bo whether there is a suitable man in the service for an office which may be vacant* and if the Minister thinks ib is necessary bo choose a man from outside, Parliament has no right to interfere with him, except in cases of marked political influence. honourable and learned member who has just resumed his seat need not fear for one moment that he has wasted the time of the House.

391,Mr Salmo N (Laanecoorie),"I think thewitVi the main principles of the Bill, which have already been dealt with at some length, and which I feel sure will be debated at further length. convinced that the best means we can adopt to secure a contented service is to have a well-paid service, and in order that we may have a service commensurate means, it is necessary that it should not be an overcrowded service. We should-have such a service in numbers just-as large as is necessary to the effective discharge of the work of the Commonwealth. undoubtedly would tend towards tlie overcrowding of the service, and consequently towards the sweating of the employees, as we have seen in more than one of the States. I agree with those who say that in their opinion the more pernicious influence is the social influence. dictated simply by a desire to gain an advantage, and it carries no responsibility, whereas political influence does carry some slight responsibility in every case. So that there is a difference between the two; but I would like to see both influences removed if possible. As to promotion in the service, that should, in my opinion, depend almost entirely upon merit. I would like to see a departure from the cast-iron method of transferring men from subdivision subdivision, classes. There ought to be some means devised-not Bill-whereby transferred to subdivision, but actually from class to class at the will of the whereby public servants, who bring under the notice of their immediate superiors the capacity they possess to do the work set out, the ability they evidence in the discharge of their duties, and, above all, the loyalty they show to the interests of the State, shall receive reward in the way of promotion. -Concerning the provisions of increment that have been laid down here, I am of opinion there should be added at least two which we in Victoria have known as ""long service increments."" There are in the service of the State at the present time a large number of men, who through no fault of their own, but entirely through lack of opportunity, have not been able to receive the promotion and preferment doubtedly is their due. Year by year they occupy the same position and draw the same salaries ; but their obligations are increasing, | Mr Salmon. or should be increasing, and they find that what was sufficient to keep them while they were in one state of life is In the first place I am not sufficient with their added obligations. Under these circumstances they will have an opportunity, if still found .to have the necessaiy capacity, of having some addiwith our tion to their income other than that which would have come merely from seniority. Then* I think there ought to be some provision for the right of appeal to bo exercised by public servants. There is no provision Political influence in the Bil l worth calling a provision to that effect, and I think a public servant who is stated to have committed a wrong, to have neglected his duty, or to have been guilty of a dereliction of duty, should have an opportunity to appeal against the decision of the permanent head of the The social influence is department. As to clause 39, to which attention has been drawn by the honourable member for Corinella, I am of opinion that public servants doing exactly the same work in different parts.of the Commonwealth are entitled in some instances to different compensation. A system of tropical allowances should be adopted where men are sent from southern States to, say, the northern part of Queensland, to carry on exactly the kind of work as that in which they have been to previously employed. There should be some and eventually into other system by which these men should have an allowance for the necessary expense incurred the means proposed in the in travelling to a distant part of the Commona public servant may be wealth, and especially for the discomfort not only from subdivision resulting through a transfer from a temperate climate to one of a more tropical character.
