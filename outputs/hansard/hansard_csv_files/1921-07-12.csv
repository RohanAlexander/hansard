W ill the right honourable gentleman say whether this is a fact? W ill he say what the difficulty is, and whether it cannot be removed ? honourable Sir JOSEPH COOK It is a fact, and steps have been taken to remove the obstacle at the earliest possible moment.

40,Sir Joseph Cook,"(B y leave.)the members of the Commission with the exception of the honourable member for an addendum or separate report signed by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Eyan) and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). I understand that there is a third report to come from the houorable member for Franklin. I am informed that it has been presented, but it has not yet reached me. When it does, I shall be glad to present, it to the House. I move That the 'papers be printed. On the motion for the printing of these papers, I should like to ask for some information from the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook). An interim report was made some time ago, I think very early in June. It was a unanimous report, signed by all the members of the Royal Commission, and was presented with the object of having work immediately resumed at Cockatoo Island. Apparently, nothing was done in connection with that matter until, I think, Monday last, when some little work was recommenced at the island: commenced there last week. some little work taken up. My point is that the purpose of the interim report was to have work resumed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard at the earliest possible moment. That purpose was stated in the report. I should like some statement from the Government as to when operations will be in full awing again, and whether those operations will involve the re-employment of all the men who were so summarily dismissed from the works at Cockatoo Island. This is a matter of very grave importance to the men who were employed there. WhilstI do not wish at this stage to initiate a debate on the whole question, because I have no doubt an opportunity will be given to debate the-subject later on, and of dealing with, the subject-matter of the various reports from the Royal Commission, I think it is due to us, and certainly due to the employees who were dismissed, that we should have a statement at the earliest moment as to what are the intentions of the Government with regard to the re-employment of the whole of the men who were dismissed. Prime Minister endeavour to have the reports printed and circulated amongst honourable members at as early a date as possible? ing Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.21] -That is what I wish to do. Whatever delay has occurred in the resumption of operations at the Dock has not been due to anything the Government have done. It has arisen, in the very nature of things from the transfer of control from the Navy Board to the new Shipbuilding Board; and, as the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) will recollect, that was a definite recommendation by himself, amongst others, in the interim report. The recommendation was that the work to be resumed in connection with the new programme should be carried out by the Shipbuilding Board under the terms of its appointment. I understand that the new Board has taken over the Dockyard, and that has involved a valuation of plant and a consideration of the relationship of that plant to the one at Garden Island and naval requirements. Several ticklish questions have had to be considered, and they, no doubt, are causing the delay. I have been urging the Board to recommence operations ever since the interim report came to hand. As to whether all those men who were irnfortunately discharged will resume work, I cannot say. There is work to be done, and there is a Board to do it, and that is all that I can say. The sooner they get to work the better I shall be pleased. Question resolved in the affirmative.

He has been very plain about it ; but if the powers given to this body are properly drawn, and if the personnel of the Board itself proves to be satisfactory, I think it may, in the present kaleidoscopic condition of affairs, contribute a very useful service to the mercantile community, to Parliament, and to the Government. Now, as to the proposed functions. I think, as elaborated in the Bill and explained by the Minister, they are wisely drawn, and cover a very desirable and necessary scope. may be fruitfu l of much good, and, so far as I am able to judge, of no harm. All this is in unqualified a'pproval of the measure. I have mentioned certain reservations which are in. my mind, and I propose now to deal briefly with them. There are at least three features of the Bill which I think, on reflection, would suggest themselves as worthy of amendment. The first is the clause, or rather the clauses-becaus e several of them are related-whic h deal with the Minister's powers. number 15, under which the power is technically given to the Minister to "" take action,"" to use the words of the clause, upon the recommendation of the Board. The Minister, when his attention was drawn to that phase while he was submitting the Bill for its second reading, announced that it was not the intention of the Government, in bringing the Bill before Parliament, to give the Minister legislative authority or to impose on the Executive any of the powers of Parliament. was to leave. the Minister's power exactly as it is now. only a layman, and although laymen, Bill itself confers that power. after some experience of Parliament, either as Ministers or members, do acquire a certain proficiency in interpreting Acts of Parliament, that proficiency is not accepted unanimously by the lawyers in the Chamber or in the community, and I therefore do not propose to dogmatize on that point, but my impression is that, if the Bill finishes as it now stands, a Minister reaching after power may discharge legislative authority, either of a negative or a positive kind, which I think this House would decline to give. might be able to raise or lower the Tariff duties ? much, but I have selected from clause 14, which is the power and function clause of the Bill, certain things which he may be able to do, notwithstanding the Minister's statement of intention. My honourable friend in charge of the Bill will, Properly used, they of course, exonerate me from suggesting any sort of impropriety in his mind, or that any attempt would be made by him, after his assurance to the House, to exercise powers which might be technically conferred upon him. The powers which I think might be exercised by the Minister without impropriety, as clause 15 now stands, are, for example, those contained in clause 14, sub-clause 1, paragraph d. This provides that ""The Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters:The vital clause is The necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties, and ""-the n these words, to which I draw attention-""the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties."" If the Board, under this compulsory form of reference, which is obligatory on the Minister, had the question referred to it , generally or specifically, as to whether certain existing duties should become deferred ones, or certain deferred duties should be still further postponed, and submitted, after inquiry, a recommendation in that direction, the Minister, under clause 15, could give effect to it.

But I would hesitate to give power to postpone existing duties. for a moment as one that does not matter so much, and one already covered by other forms of enactment, I suggest to the Minister the necessity for altering clause 15, either to make the legal meaning clear, or to remove a doubt, 'to use his own phrase when introducing the B ill , so that that kind of function cannot be discharged by the Minister without Consulting with Parliament. powers should be conferred on the Minister by the B ill than he already has? liament will authoritatively, in deliberately-worded sections, give him. more. been complained, and I think with conI f the Customs Tariff siderable reason, during the war and before the war, in a large number of Legislatures functioning as ours does, thab the tendency of Executives is to gradually encroach on the powers of the Legislatures.

Already honourable members are being told, to cite one case, that the relationship between the duty on leather, which is the finished product of the tanner, and the duty on boots, which are the finished product of the bootmaker, has been wrongly established. AlthoughI happen to have been acquainted with this industry, and to have served considerable time in it in my earlier days, I frankly admit that I am unable to reconcile the statements made to me. I have not been able to pay sufficient attention to the subject to enable me to say whether the bootmakers have had a bad deal and the tanners an over-generous one. or whether things are all r i g h t : but I would readily consent to such a Board as is now proposed, if properly functioned and staffed, not desire any reporting to Parliament the exact effects in this particular case, eliminating the Of course, it has often element of self-interest, and contributing",25,Paper

I come now to the constitution of the Board. I believe that the Minister has acted wisely in recommending that the chairman of this body shall be an administrative officer of the Customs Department. very fortunate in having at least one officer-and I think more than one-wh o is well fitted to discharge this important and onerous task. I shall not . embarrass the Minister by mentioning names, but I do not think that he -will experience very much trouble in selecting for the post get the right men for the sake of the fees. an officer who will command the confidence of this Parliament, and when itB members know him, the confidence of tlie mercantile community as well. The other observations which I propose to make upon the question of salaries may, perhaps, influence the Minister to alter I know what, in my the figure which he has put against this officer's work. I am, however, most concerned with the position of the other two. members of the Board. After havbeen able, since the measure was brought before the House, I do not think that the Minister is going the right way to secure the proper sort of colleagues for .the chairman of the proposed Board. I do not think that the honourable gentleman will get the best men upon this Board for fees of £5 5s. per day. AlthoughI believe in the proposal, I am not prepared to vote for a scheme which will the B i ll one provide part-time men for the discharge of this important work, at least during one the first three or five years. I do not. know whether you, sir, have acquainted yourself during recent years with the is a matter of salaries which are being paid to good men by big mercantile houses in all parts of Australia, as well as in other communiHowties. We cannot get the best men for £1,000 or £1,500 a year. During my association with the present Government we invited applications for an office, the filling of which involved the possession of commercial qualifications and organizing power, and with a salary of £1,500 a year offered, we were six months endeavouring to get somebody whom we regarded as qualified to fill the position. I would far sooner see the Minister confer upon the Governor General in Council power to pay any fees which are necessary to secure the best brains for this work. I believe that a review of the industrial and manufacturing circumstances and possibilities to-day is so important that it would be profitable for the Minister to pay £2,000, £3,000, and even up to £5,000 a year each for the services of two I think that the country is good men. I would more confidently hand these large powers of research and recommendation to a body composed of such men than I would to the body which the Minister proposes to create.",27,Paper

Even after the Tariff Board has lived and died he will retain his associaadvised to reconsider the penalty which tion with the Public Service of this counshould be imposed for a first offence as try. But the position is altogether different when we call a man from outside to serve the Commonwealth in a special capacity for three or five years. The very best men should be obtainable for these positions; they should be free even from the suggestion of prejudice, of preconceived ideas, and of self-interest. Parliabeen committed. ment, then, would be justified in giving to the Board the largest powers that the Minister desires to confer upon it. The only other question upon which I probably speak of that in a minute or desire to speak relates to the penalties two. which are sought to be imposed by the Bill. These penalties start at clause 22. penalties. There it is proposed that a fine of £500 shall be inflicted upon any person who were arrainged for an indictable offence, has been served with a summons to attend the jury having regard to the fact that if the Board and who fails, without reasonthey brought in a verdict of guilty, he able excuse, to do so, or to produce documight be fined £500, might be tempted to ments, books, or writings which are in return a verdict of not guilty. his custody. Clause 23 makes a fine of a reasoning which all juries might be £500 imposable upon a man who refuses persuaded to adopt, as no doubt the to be sworn or to give evidence. Under Aoting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr clause 24, the number of days upon which Ryan), who has so frequently appeared he continues to thus infringe the Act are held to constitute separate offences. to be wilful and to fall within these particular clauses, he could be fined £500, and, if he remained recalcitrant for ten days, he could be fined a further sum of £5,000. Clause 32 sets out that any person who inflicts injury upon a witness shall be guilty of an indictable offence, imprisonment for one year. Clause 33 provides that any employer who dismisses an employee for anything which he has said before the Tariff Board shall be liable to a fine of £500 or imprisonment for a year. Some of these penalties seem to be too Draconian in character; I suggested a few and without pausing to argue them at length, I suggest to the Minister that our experience in various parts of Australia is that the more severe the penalties which are inflicted the more difficult does it become to secure convictions. Thus, there is a very real danger that in our endeavour to impose heavy punishments we may overreach ourselves, and thus permit of the escape of guilty men. The Minister would be well against the penalties which may be inflicted for recurring offences, and also the advisableness of encouraging Courts of summary jurisdiction to extend, not sympathetic, but fair consideration to the accused, and to the circumstances under which the offence is supposed to have other side to that matter.

The Board's special duty should be to give the closest and most direct attention to the operation of the Tariff.

The only action which the Minister can take for the purpose of imposing new duties, increasing or reducing duties, is to introduce a measure for the purpose, which must be passed by Parliament in the ordinary way in order to bring about any alteration of the existing law in this regard. As, however, the.honourable member for Balaclava has raised, the point, and laymen, apparently, have interpreted clause 15 in the same way, it might be desirable in Committee to. accept such an amendment of the clause as may be necessary to remove any doubt on the subject. the words, "" take action "" the words, "" as provided by law."" has been raised as to the intention of the Minister under this clause, there will be no harm in making his intention more clear. to do that. the Minister will be impressed with the necessity of confining the Tariff Board to the Trade and Customs Department, so that it may operate as a part of the Department and may be in a position to utilize the services of the vast staff of officers associated with it. Such a Board should be capable of splendid work, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will be sufficiently fortunate to secure the right class of men to constitute it. During the debates on the TariffI referred, time after time, to the necessity for absolutely correct and..up-to-date in-i formation regarding our industries. This was admitted time and again by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) and by other honourable members.

I ask honourable members whether they do not consider it call attention to the somewhat of an anomaly that after we have imposed the most drastic taxation, through the Customs, which must, considerably increase the cost of living and make' it extremely difficult to develop our great undeveloped areas of country, the Minister should-now come forward' with a proposal for the appointment of a Board to collect the information which -this House should have had at its disposal before it dealt with the matters which have occupied its attention during the last three months?

In the boot making industry there may be many small requisites which can be cheaply produced abroad in that way and used with advantage by our manufacturers. Their use may enable us to build up a large export trade in boots, and this will give a better market for our -hides, and provide much business for tanneries and kindred industries. To say that Australia can be altogether self-contained is absurd.

Executive Council. the Minister, for what may appear to him good and sufficient reasons, may hold back any report. As to the constitution of the proposed Board, it seemed to me when I first thought of the matter that there might be appointed to it a representative of the Chamber of Manufactures, a representative of the primary producers, and a representative of the consumers; but then it occurred to me that it might be said that the representative of the primary producers was a political representative, and on that ground the Labour party, might ask for representation, although the members of the Labour party are a section of the consumers. Finally, I concluded that what is needed-is an absolutely non-political Board; one whose members would not be connected with any political organization. We should have a Board of which the Government could say to Parliament, ""We believe these gentlemen are capable of collecting the most complete and unbiased information it is possible to obtain, and to advise the Government accordingly."" The Minister( Mr Greene) argued that the presence of a departmental head on the Board would enable many matters to be dealt with more conveniently and would facilitate the administration of the Tariff. A Board such as I suggest could obtain the fullest information, and it should get every assistance from the Customs Department. complaint were made of anomalies in the Tariff the Board would ask the Department to send some official to explain the probable effect of any alterations that might be suggested. In this and other ways the fullest assistance of the Department could be rendered to the Board, and the necessity for having a departmental officer on .that body would be obviated.

I object to, and it? is the duty of this House, a duty which we owe to the people who sent us here, to urge upon the Government the necessity of bringing down something that will ""have some real effect in the directions I have indicated. This Bill does not purport to have any such effect. It is mere make-believe. What is the use of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) talking about the inquiries that the Board may carry out, or -the further powers of inquiry that he will give them, if no further power is given to the Minister, or there is no further enactment by Parliament itself, which will make in those two directions ? It may be said that there is some constitutional difficulty in bringing about what I choose to call ""New Protection"" for short. It conveys an idea to many of the public-perhap s not strictly accurate-bu t we will call it "" New Protection."" There is nothing in this Bill, then, that makes in the direction of New Protection. The Minister said to me, when I was speaking on the Tariff, that I knew there was a constitiiT tional difficulty in his way in including provisions such as I desired in the Tariff Bill itself. I recognise that difficulty. That difficulty is contained in section 55 of the Constitution, which provides that;Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of Customs or of Excise, shall deal with one subject of taxation only; but laws imposing duties of Customs shall deal with duties of Customs only, and laws imposing tiuties of Excise shall deal with duties of Excise only. I understand that, for that reason, the provisions to which I have referred could not be contained in the Tariff Bill itself, but the measure which is now brought forward does not contain any provisions of that nature. Then, do the Government, or does the Minister, propose to bring forward any measure that will have the effects to which I have referred? member suggest that there are no conjority of the Court in that case was that stitutional difficulties in the way of doing the Commonwealth Parliament could not, those things? Mr Ryan. there are no constitutional difficulties. There is a decision of the High Court of Australia, in what is known as the Harvester Case, where a majority of the That is the prinCourt held that duties of Excise could not be imposed if there was some indirect purpose, such as that of securing proper conditions in the industry; but I think any one who has followed the trend of recent decisions of the High Court of Australia will come to the conclusion that, if that matter were again submitted to them, probably they would give a decision in a directly opposite direction, and would hold that the object or purpose for which the provision was made could not be taken into consideration in interpreting the plain words of the Statute. is a good tipster. for Grampians quite realizes that many of the earlier decisions of the High Court of Australia in the direction of curtailing the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, or interpreting the Constitution in a narrow way with regard to the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, have been upset. ber indicate what rule of interpretation the High Court has laid down which leads him to that belief as regards the taxing powers of the Constitution? for Darling Downs does not expect me to enter into a. legal argument here upon the matter. I will put it this way, that the' rules of interpretation that have, re* cently been followed by a majority of the High Court of Australia lead me to believe that their decision in respect of such a measure as that I have mentioned would be different from the existing decision on the matter. something in the Harvester Case where Parliament sought to do by an Act what it could not do? by means of a< measure imposing a duty",38,Paper

Without passing any undue strictures on the work recently done in this House, I feel bound to say that we have turned out, not the most complete and effective protective schedule, but a piebald affair which, especially towards the latter end, is more black than white.

Honourable members can talk all the nonsense they like concerning the possibilities in ' a country such as Australia, with a population of only 5,000,000; but those who say that a high Tariff is good for the farmer are exaggerating the position. A high Tariff in a country fully developed, and with -an enormous population, might be of advantage; but in the Commonwealth, the fringe of which we have not'yet developed, it is ridiculous. In the Commonwealth 53 per cent, or 54 per cent, of the population reside within the city boundaries, and high protective duties which are justifiable in other countries are absomuch of their education would have to be lutely unwarranted in Australia. We can protect certain rural industries, such as dairying and fruit growing, but the great staple products-whea t and wool-ca n have no protection. If the Board carries out the functions proposed, the real facts will be submitted to Parliament periodically, and the primary producers will know where .the money goes. The great body of consumers, who ought to have some assistance and consideration, will also be able to learn whether the prices they are being charged are just or otherwise.

The Treasurer will also be asking for Supply, so that the House will have an ample opportunity of debating the whole matter fully at a more opportune stage. I would very much like, before we have any discussion in connection with repatriation,to have before us the full report of the Public Accounts Committee, so that if mistakes have occurred we may be able thoroughly to understand what they are. A paragraph appeared in the Age this morning concerning land purchases. The Minister should try to find out, as early, as possible, what truththere is in those statements in. regard to purchases of land that have increased so wonderfully during the past few months. If they are correct, some drastic action ought to be taken in regard to those responsible for such purchases. As I recognise that the Minister should get a validating Bill of this sort through before we adjourn, I am prepared to allow it to pass all its stages without comment. "" I quite appreciate the force of the contention that the second reading of this Bill may not be a fitting opportunity for a general discussion on the question of War Service Homes; but, on the face of it, it affords a very suitable opportunity for the discussion of the standing and former Commissioner for War Service Homes. I have not the pleasure of even a casual acquaintance with the late Commissioner, and do not profess to be well informed on the matter, but I have had the advantage of having a statement of the case, from the point of view of the late Commissioner, placed in my hands, and T say that that statement is of a kind, in my view, to merit a very serious answer from the responsible Minister. I gather from the terms of this Bill that the late Commissioner was suspended or relieved of his office in March of the present year, after operating for a considerable time, as one may put it , ultra vires, as an uncertificated insolvent. Now, after the expiration of a still further number of months, the Minister arrives in hot haste to inform us that it is of the very highest importance that a Bill validating. everything the late Commissioner did while he was still purporting to act as Commissioner should be passed without delay. Why this urgency? portant that the acts of the gentleman purporting to be the Acting Commissioner, who is still in that position, should be validated. levancy of that contention. The Ministry first appoint somebody to act as Commissioner, whom they now discover to have been ineligible for that purpose after he had been working for two years, and after he has been relieved of his office for four or five months they count it a matter of great haste that the person who is acting as Commissioner should have his position recognised and validated by this House, since he>could not correctly be an Acting Commissioner if there was no one properly constituted as Commissioner I take this opportunity of saying that it is due, not only to Lieut -Colonel Walker, but to the country, to know whether justice has been done to him. If he has been relieved of his .duties for what I have already described as the severely technical reason that he was an uncertificated insolvent, and if he was made an uncertificated insolvent while he was still on active service, tlie first thing we ought to do, before we proceed to validate what he has done, is to validate his re-appointment as Commissioner for",62,Second Reading

We should not dispossess a man of his office and discredit him in the eyes of the world by reason of an absurd technicality, which could have been very easily got over by a short legal enactment. If , on the other hand, there are genuine and more deep-seated rea. sons why Lieut -Colonel Walker should be deprived of his office, then, in like manner, the country should be informed how it comes about that the Ministry, in making the choice of a man to fill one of the most responsible and'important offices in the Commonwealth, came to appoint a person whose qualifications cannot now be disclosed to the general public. I do not propose to pass judgment on the wisdom or unwisdom of discontinuing Lieut -Colonel Walker's appointment. have not the facts before me, but I do know that Lieut -Colonel Walker has made out a primd facie case which ought to be publicly answered. The introduction of a B ill of this kind, which is designed to deal with his administration, and with the regular appointment of his successor, would have presented a very suitable opportunity for telling us something about the real facts of Lieut -Colonel Walker's appointment, and of the discontinuance of his office. . Like other honourable members, I do not know Lieut -ColonelW l » a K e r -competent to judge of his value or worth as a Commissioner, though I do know some of -his acts with which I do not agree. Lieut -Colonel Walker, however, has taken trouble to compile a statement of his case. Before dealing with that I may mention that Lieut -Colonel Walker makes certain allegations here which, apparently, can be borne out by correspondence as truth f u l. I do not know what is behind the mind -of the Government in this particular matter. would naturally come to the conclusion t h a t Lieut -Colonel Walker did not have the capacity for the job, and that some excuse or reason was sought to discharge him, and that by discharging him under a pretence or excuse the Government protected itself.

D. Millen approved of Lieut -Colonel Walker's appointment: on 6th March, 1919, Lieut -Colonel Walker was appointed Commissioner by the Governor General; and on 14th July, 1919, the bankruptcy was annulled. Lieut -Colonel Walker's prepared statement contains the following:In March, 1919, tlie position of War Service Homes Commissioner was created, and l/iciifc -Coloncl Walker, an applicant for the Bank, Brisbane, also a copy of the wire position, was appointed. On the 25th February, 1D19, the Comptroller of Repatriation sent from Mr Cupples on the 26th February, n. wire to Mr Cupples, the manager, London Bank, Brisbane, as follows:-""Lieut-Colone l -Tames Walker under consideration for Housing Cominissionorsbip under Soldiers' Homes Act.

Walker's statement goes onThis wire Mr Cupples confirmed by letter dated 28th February, 1919. On the same day, Licut -Cplonel Walker interviewed the Minister, Senator. Millen, w.ho produced a wiro from Mr Cupples, and Lieut -Colonel Walker explained to Senator Millen the facts ^concerning his bankruptcy. At the close of this interview, Senator Millen informed Lieut -tiolonel Walker that lie would be appointed, and confirmed his statement by a. letter to Lieut -Colonel Walker written the same day. Lieut -Colonel Walker was appointed to the position of Commissioner on the 6th March, 1919, and remained in that position, administering that Department until 11th March, 1021. The appointment was made by the. Governor General, and it is clear that at the time of such appointment the Minister who was responsible to the Governor General was aware that Lieut -Colonel Walker was .an uncertificated bankrupt. The statement then goes on to set out the letter from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers) to pointment was. null and void. Frankly, I do not know Lieut -Colonel Walker. I know nothing of his case except what has been, put upon record here. ""But, in order to clear up a doubt which exists in my mind, and in the minds of other honourable members, will the Minister be good enough to secure a copy of the wire which was sent by the Comptroller of .Repatriation to Mr Cupples, manager of the London 1919, and a copy of the letter forwarded by him to the Comptroller of Repatriation upon the same date? If the honourable gentleman will do that, I shall be very pleased. Now that the Minister has made certain allegations which make it appear that Lieut -Colonel Walker has contradicted himself, I think that the latter should make a frank statement to the members of this House, .either by means of a letter or through the newspapers, in order that we may know exactly where we stand. If necessary, it is up to hiin to sign a statutory declaration backing up his circular to honourable members, or else to withdraw the whole thing.

Even the men who declared Lieut -Colonel Walker bankrupt affirmed that he had [401] committed no offence.

I want to make it quite clear that when it came to my knowledge that Lieut -Colonel Walker was an uncertifi-cated insolvent, I got in. touch with the -Crown Law authorities, who, in turn, got into direct communication with our 'Crown Law authorities in Queensland, in order to obtain confirmation of the statement, and when this was obtained I immediately communicated with the Leader of the Government and my colleagues. AISO communicated with Lieut -Colonel Walker. I called him to the Commonwealth Public Offices and put to him the ""position as disclosed by the investigations. He admitted the statement as to his insolvency, but said that information on 'the files would show that "".Minister for Repatriation !E. D. Millen) was aware of the :fact at the time of his appointment. Before declaring null and void the appointment of Lieut -Colonel Walker, I ssaw the telegram from, the Comptroller, -and also the reply of Mr Cupples, and, instead of terminating his appointment, "" I gave Lieut -Colonel Walker leave of ab-senee, with the undertaking that no -action would be taken to remove him 'from his position until he saw the Minister for Repatriation on his return.

That 'is on record, together with the tele.grams; and that information will be laid before the House, when honourable members will have a full opportunity of debating the whole question. I idid not feel in a position to recommend Ahe. re-appointment of Lieut -Colonel Walker; but there will be a ful l opportunity, as I have .said, to discuss the matter.

I , therefore, presume that the the Senate agrees to the passage of the Bill.

The Minister is absolutely wrong in suggesting that those who have spoken from the Opposition side of the chamber have addressed themselves to the. question as the friends of Lieut -Colonel Walker, and he would do well to dissociate himself from that suggestion. I have already said that I have never met Lieut -Colonel Walker, and that he is not an acquaintance, much less a friend, of mine. I address myself to this matter entirely as to a public question of interest and i m portance. able member in mind, and, so f a r as he is concerned, withdraw what I said. drawal.

The Minister, by the introduction of the B ill , proposes to for t i fy the position of the Government in regard to the things done by Lieut -Colonel Walker while purporting to act as W a r Service Homes Commissioner. curing their own position, b u t they are taking all sorts of care not to give Lieut Colonel Walker the coincident opportunity to cure his, or even to state his case. Suppose the Souse were to say, 1 "" We shall not allow the Government to validate its position unti l it permits Lieut -Colonel Walker's position to be discussed "" ? The two matters should go baud in hand. As we have been asked to put the -whitewash brush over what the Government have done, we should be'given an opportunity to consider whether L i e u t . Colonel Walker should be reinstated. express no opinion on that point: but there should have gone together a frank statement cf the circumstances of Lieut Colonel Walker's appointment and the termination of it and the proposal to validate what he did, the two things being inter-related. It is now, and not during a general and very wide discussion of the War Service Homes administration, the general bungling of the Government] that we should consider the special case of Lieut -Colonel Walker, which, by the step further. I am not prepared to allow terms of the B ill , we are really invited the B ill to go -through unless we have the[402] to consider. In my view, Lieut -Colonel Walker's successor is, possibly, as able a man as was ever appointed to an administrative position in this State. The interjection of the Minister( Mr. Rodgers) makes the position worse than it was. I resent the sneering manner in which he spoke of the "" friends of Lieut -. Colonel Walkeri n this chamber."" mean to speak sneeringly. PerhapsI used the wrong word. resent the implication conveyed. I have never spoken to Lieut -Colonel Walker, and would not know him were he in the gallery. I only had his written statement, and it was on that that I spoke to-night. The position is a remarkable one. Steps were taken to advertise extensively the position that was vacant. Many applications were received, the office being one of the most important that could be filled by any Government, I am aware of t h a t ; because the War Service Homes Commissioner was to handle millions of. pounds, and to deal w i th huge contracts. He was to have one of the biggest jobs in Australia. The Comptroller of Repatriation received the applications, and took steps to have inquiries made about the applicants. He should have known what the Government The Government are proposed to do, and should have informed himself of any bar to an applicant's appointment. Bankruptcy is a disqualification that attached to this appointment, not only under the terms of the War Service Homes Act, but, generally, as it attaches to all appointments to the Public Service. Y e t we are told that the Comptroller of Repatriation did not bring under the notice of the Minister the fact that there was this disqualification.
