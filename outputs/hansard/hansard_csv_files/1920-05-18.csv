3,Mr Hughes,"When the Bill is inBEET SUGAR. the Government to take control of the sugar produced in Victoria from beet, and, if so, will that be done by regulations under the War Precautions Act? tion put its case before me, and in reply I pointed out that at present prices the Government is losing Â£14 per ton on the sugar it is supplying to the community; but I promised to do what I could. I have not yet had an opportunity to put the matter before my colleagues. Probably the Government has no power except under the War Precautions Act to control the production of beet sugar, but we could control it under that Act until its expiry, which must come about within a certain period after the declaration of peace. At present I can only say that the Government will consider the matter. We are desirous of helping, not of crushing, the beet sugar industry, and I sincerely regret that, after eight years of encouragement by the Government of .Victoria and the Commonwealth Government, the total production of beet sugar in .this State is the paltry amount of 1,400 tons. pus shortage of coal in South Australia, a number of industries there may have to close down within the next few weeks. May I , therefore, ask whether the Government cannot, under the circumstances, try to supply coal so that these factories may be kept open? raised last week, when I said that I would see what cpuld be done to make freight available. At least four Commonwealth vessels arc now carrying coal, and I have been conferring with the Manager of the Commonwealth fleet as to the extent to which other vessels could be made temporarily available. Of course, our vessels, like private vessels, are under contracts to load cargo. At the Premiers' Conference, which meets at the end of the week, an opportunity will be given .to discuss the matter, which I recognise to be of very great importance. morning's newspapers that large sums of money are being expended in purchasing machinery for an arsenal, and works of a similar character. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will prevent the expenditure of large sums of money in this direction until Parliament has approved of the carrying out of the work. spur of the moment whether Parliament has or has not approved of the establishment of an arsenal, though I hardly imagine that it would disapprove of such a thing. Without an arsenal we might as well say to the nations of the world, "" Come in, brothers, and take our appointed place."" The material to whioh the honourable member refers was offered to us by tiie British Government at prices so much below cost that we felt that it would be absurd to refuse it ; but, of course, the transaction could be cancelled, because there has not yet been delivery. I shall see that when we are discussing the Estimates, the fullest information is made available to honorable members. Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the released Inter-State shipping from Government control, during the last four or five weeks, has not reached nearly the volume of coal deliveries that were current during the period of control, the Government will ask the Inter-State shipping companies to do their best, at least, to keep up to the facilities in this regard provided during the control of Inter-State shipping by the Government? think I may be permitted to remind honourable members that this House almost went on its knees every day, hut the Sabbath-whic h is the best day of all for such a purpose-to ask that, for God's sake they should have no more of Government control.

Debate resumed from 14th May (vide That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. debate last week was remarkable for the fact that only one of the speakers, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks), declared himself in favour of the Bill.

And he ridicialed that part of the agreement relating to freight on crude oil at current rates, also that portion having reference to the amount of capital to be invested in the business. He stated that the Â£250,000 which the Government have agreed to put into the business, and the Â£250^000 to be invested by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, will not be more than sufficient for distribution expenses of the oil business in Australia. The company have taken up land at Fremantle, and have also mads arrangements for land in Port Melbourne for the erecthing in the agreement providing that these tanks shall go over to the refinery company.

35,Mr Tudor,"The best speech madefor storage, but until we have in formation' on this subject we ' shall have no idea how much it will actually cost. pany may charge what they like, and no doubt they w ill do so. We have been told that crude oil has increased in price all over the world. Petrol Commission's report, the price in the United States of America at present is 6 dollars per barrel, and I understand a barrel contains 42 Imperial gallons, making the price about 8d. per gallon. If we can get the crude oil to Australia, not at 8d., but at 6d. per gallon, the 200,000 tons w ill , at 240 gallons to the ton, cost us about Â£1,200,000. Now on the question of freight, I may inform honourable members that the Anglo-Persian Company are the only people who trade in the Persian Gulf, and, according to the Petrol Commission's Report, they are charging more than Â£ 1 5 per ton freight from Adaban, in the Persian Gulf, to the United Kingdom, and as the distance to Australia is as great, if not greater than, to England, they are not likelv to charge the Commonwealth less. ' The Prime Minister has stated that he will alter that portion cf the agreement relating to price, and that the rate for crude oil will be the same as that charged to the British Government. But the British Government are not buying crude oil at all. British Government are the Anglo-Persian Company. vernment hold more than one-half the shares in, the company, but it is not likely that they would fix the price f.o.b. Persian Gulf, and then sell it to themselves after refining. If we discover oil in Papua, are we likely to fix the price f.o.b. there? The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) will bear me out when I say that these house-to-house transactions are always a source of trouble to the Customs Department with companies having establishments in Great Britain or other countries and Australia. Therefore, pany would not be likely to fix the price for crude oil in Persia. Crude oil varies in quality During the war it was found that the produot of one of the other Combines was' in f i nitely superior for explosives to that obtained from the Persian Gulf. We have The Anglo-Persian Combeen told that 80 per cent, of the toluol used ' for explosives manufactured by the Allies was made ' from , the Sumatra o i l , and the verdict, According to the of the men "" over there "" was that had it not been for the Combine w h i c h 1 the Prime Minister has denounced as "" for e i g n"" making available this product for high explosives, the Allies would not have won the war. That is the position. During the war we spoke of those who fought with us as our Allies, and of those who were against us as the enemy. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) apparently tried to confuse the issue by making it. appear that the Shell Oil Company was a foreign corporation, and, therefore, worthy of any ill-treatment to which' we chose to subject it . working on purely business lines. the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is not in business merely "" for the goiod of its health "" or for the benefit of the country. It is in this enterprise for what it can make out of it . the Imperial Oil Company. in exactly the same position. I urge that we should have further information upon this subject, firstlv, because the agreeThe ment would commit us in respect of too long a period, and, secondly, because of the amount of money involved. Let us I know the British Goassume that the crude oil to-day is worth 6d. per gallon, or 25 per cent, less than the American crude oil is worth to-day, according to the report of the Petrol Commission. That Commission was appointed by the British Government. It was not in any way connected' with the oil trade, and its report was denounced by the trade in Great Britain. It proved that the value of crude oil in America at the present time is about 8d. per,gal r Ion, or 6 dollars per barrel, and it is said, that the price is going up. Taking the value of the crude oil at 6d. per gallon j we have a total of Â£1,200,000 in respect of the annual supply from Persia. If we the Anglo-PersianO i l Comallow freight costs at Â£ 1 5 per ton, or less than is being charged the British Government at the present time, we have in respect of the 200,000 tons an expenditure of Â£3,000,000 per annum, making a total",26,Robert Best I Raised Certain Tion Of Storage Tanks But There Is No

41,Mr Tudor,"The whole of them areof Â£4,200,000. five years we should have a total of Â£21,000,000 period we discovered oil in Papua, and they started to work it. The company's ten years' operation in Papua would represent, in respect to the cost of the oil, Â£1,200,000 per annum. Freight, at Â£7 10s. per ton-or charged between Persia and the United Kingdom-would per annum, making a total of Â£2,700,000.

Those companies which for many years have exercised a monopoly over this essential to our welfare, and which this cruel poses to crush, have appealed to the great heart of the trading companies of Australia, who buy their oil from them and can buy it from nobody else, and these traders, between the devil and the deep sea, have rolled up and sent sixpenny, and, in some cases, shilling, telegrams to honourable members of this Parliament, urging them, in the name of God, to stay their impious hands. When I heard the honourable member the other day-and this is the second time. I have heard him-put up his plea for private enterprise, I was amazed. If I did not know the circumstances in which he finds himself, bereft of any argument, I should be appalled; but, as it is, I am merely' amazed. crush these companies, without which the Allies would never have won the war.

The honourable member hasspoken very harshly to me this afternoon about my attitude towards foreign companies. He has suddenly developed a. tenderness of heart -towards the foreigner, Curiously enough, that seems a trifle inconsistent, coming from the lips of a Protectionist who first taught me to slip from that narrow footpath of Free Trade upon which my in fan t feet were firmly placed. I remember in the bygone days, when I was a convinced Free Trader, the honourable member coming forward with an absolutely appalling proposal, amounting, in effect, to about 40 to 60 per cent, duty on hats. In this instance, ifc is ea""sy to I have always liked the honourable member, and while, as a matter of principle, I was a convinced Free Trader, yet when he put these hats before me, I fell, and Government provoted for his hats; I was prepared to crush at one fell blow the Austrian, the American, and the Englishman. What more could I have done to show that when it came to a choice between Australia and the rest of the world, I was for Australia? But now, when it is proposed to set up a. refinery in this country to refine o i l , the honourable member says "" No. Let the StandardO i l Company and the "" S h e l l "" group flourish in America or Holland, or wherever they are located."" The honourable member has no ground for his feet to stand on. Let me take his points, one by one. He wants more information? He does not want more information. H is trouble is that he has too He says, "" You propose to much. He knows the facts. What are they? These companies, ever since they came to Australia in the dawn of the petrol age, as I have termed it , haveexploited it to the last penny. Not a trader in Australia dares to raise his voice against them. One trader wrote to me the other day, marking his letter He says that the "" private and confidential,"" saying that he had been told to attend a meeting, and* But what has at that meeting everybody had to sign this protest, to which reference has been made. He signed it . He had to do so, but he said, ""I want to tell you that if you can get this agreement through, and the Anglo-Persian people are prepared to supply my wants, they can have my custom."" This amazing activity of the companies throughout Australia against the Bill is the best argument why we should support it. We are asked to support an Australian industry, but the honourable member wants more time to support it. I have heard him get up and advocate the establishment even of such an exotic industry as the manufacture of matches in this country. He never lacks an argument as to why ani industry should be established and encouraged here, buti when it comes to something that is vital to the very existence of the Commonwealth, ho wants more information. have seen a whole Tariff bundled through the House with less information. orable members will have an opportunity knowledge on a Tariff very shortly, and there will not be one item in it on which honourable members will not want more information than is required in regard to this agreement. The honourable member, leaving the safe and pleasant path of generalities in which a man may wander at will, incurring no ill consequences, has committed, himself to a certain particular of the Bill. He says, for example, that a monopoly will be established in this country. I have already said in the plainest possible terms that this will not be so, but he himself has said it in more emphatic terms this afternoon. He said that the point that struck him more than anything else in the speech of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) was that the amount of capital these people were to put into the industry, together with that put in by the Commonwealth, would be insufficient to create a monopoly, because it would not supply one-half of the capital necessary for that purpose. Furthermore, it has been observed by honourable members on both sides of the House that not one-half of the petrol, kerosene, and lubricating oil remiired in this country can bo supplied under this proposal. Therefore, the Australian market will be -open to the whole world. the first answer to the honourable member's statement. upon as good terms as ever, excepting that it will now have a competitor inside AusMr Hughet. tralia, who, at any rate, will be some protection to us against that combined influence of commercialism outside to which we have been exposed so long. The honourable member also said something about freight. He affirmed that the Anglo-Persian Company will be able to make huge profits out of its freight charges, and he mentioned Â£1,200,000 in this connection. crude oil aÂ£ 6d. per gallon. would be more than the value of the oil. The honourable member affirmed that the value of the crude oil is such that we cannot even bring it here and refine it locally. He said that we cannot even do that, because the raw material would be too exI pensive, and the freight would be too heavy. But he did not say one word Honabout the freight upon refined products. Does he think that these gentlemen bring of displaying their amazing their refined oil products here for nothing, and distribute them to the people as a gift from God? He said that the Anglo Persian Oil Company was charging Â£15 15s. per ton freight from somewhere in Persia to Great Britain. I do not know where he got his figures.

Buti t does not follow that what that Commission says is true. ister prepared to say that its report is not true? would interest the honourable member I would not mind doing so. As a matter of fact, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company carries its own oil, in its own steamers, and it consigns that oil to itself and to nobody else. It does not carry oil to Great Britain for anybody else; it does not carry any oil except in its own ships, and it carries no oil but its own. What benefit it derives from charging itself Â£15 15s. per ton freight upon that oil, I leave it to the honourable member to determine. But this has no relevance whatever to the point under discussion. If the AngloThat is Persian Company is likely to charge too much by way of freight, we may then The world can enter get freight wherever we are able to procure it .

The honourable member stated that the Commonwealth will have no voice in the matter of the price at which oil will be sold here. I do not know why he said that in face of the amended schedule, which distinctly sets out that "" The refinery company shall sell its oil products at such prices as are fair and reasonable."" agreement does that provision appear?

The late Sir George Reid said that about us. meeting at which he says this matter was discussed, the honourable member affirmed that certain alterations had been made in the agreement. He was annoyed that they had been made, because they cut the ground from under his feet; yet he now says that he cannot see them anywhere in the agreement.. What am I to do to please him? When I make alterations in the agreement they do not suit him, and he cannot find them. The honourable member, in speaking of this bowelless combine, which in its utter disregard for foreign companies is going to crush them out of existence, rather overstepped the limits of accuracy, because it is set down in paragraph 14 of the bond that the protection to be given to the refinery company is contingent upon its selling oil at a fair and reasonable price. When it ceases to do that, the protection accorded to it wholly disappears. I wish that a similar provision could be applied to all kinds of protection-ever y item of the Tariff. I do not think there is one honourable member who would cast a vote against a proposal of that sort. When local manufacturers or traders, whoever they are, exploit or take advantage of the community under the protection given them, there ought to be some kind of punishment, and that is here provided for under the provisions of this agreement. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) is very much 'concerned about Papua. He says he is not quite sure who owns the oil in that Possession.

What are the great points we have to decide? The first is, whether we shall 'have an Australian from exploitation. We have ample in company or a foreign company herewhether we shall have oil refined in rate, as we should be able to get from a Australia or outside Australia, whether Select Committee, which can hope for in we shall give work to our own people or formation only from one of two sources. to the foreigner.

To me, it is a question of the safety of the Commonwealth in making an agreement which will have a vital influence on perhaps one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has shown by his remarks that he has not taken the trouble to read the one document where he can get information on this subjectI mean the report of the Petrol Commission, which dealt w i th these matters ini Great Britain lately.

From one of the greatest monopolies in the world. In spite of everything that has been said, the Anglo Persian Oil Company does control the Refinery Company.

Whilst the Commonwealth retains the majority of the shares, it can elect only its own three directors, while t h * other four, comprising the majority of the board, are elected by the company. against the second reading of the B ill , and not in favour of the appointment .of a Select Committee. MrM c WILLIAMS if the honourable member will allow me to make my own speech in my own way. The Commonwealth Government has been fighting a Combine. If honourable members look up the speeches of the Prime Minister and the then Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton), they w ill see bow bitterly they resented the attempt made by the Inchcape Shipping Combine to crush the Commonwealth line of steamers. Inchcape, who controls that Combine, is the man who represents the British Government on this Combine. cape combine entered into an alliance w i th the Morgan combine to control the shipping of the world. Who can say that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, under the presidency of Lord Inchcape, w ill not enter into a similar combine here with the Amerioan oil companies to control Che oil supplies of the world ? Sir JOSEPH prevented from doing that. Mr Mc WILLLAMS company a majority of four on the directorate, and say that if oil is not being sold by it at a fair and reasonable price, the door of the Customs House will be opened to admit competition. It is reasonable to argue that Lord Inchcape, who has engineered in Great Britain a combine with an American shipping trust7-may, in Australia, engineer another combine with the American Oil Trust. What condiWe have been told of a tions in the agreement would prevent him from doing that? Clause Sir ,JOSEPH COOK -The conditions in the agreement with the parent company, and the conditions in this agreement, would prevent it . Lord Inchcape does not control the parent company. The honourable member holds him up as the controller of the whole concern, but he is Competition from not that. MrM c WILLIAMS The agreement with the parent company has no bearing on the question. The Petrol Commission has shown that the rate of freight-no t that charged to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but that charged to the British Government-is Â£ 1 5 10s. We know, of course, that the oil is carried in tank steamers which cannot take return cargo, so that a profit has to be made out of vessels that travel one way empty. that the question before the Chair at the present time is that the B ill be referred to a Select Committee; but we are really I shall be glad having another second-reading debate, after the motion for the second reading of the B ill has been carried. Honourable members may not continue a discussion in the nature of a second-reading debate, nor may they, refer to notices for the amendment of the schedule to the B ill , which have been distributed, and of which I have just received a copy. These cannot be discussed u n t i l the B ill gets into Committee. They do not come before the House at a l l. MrM c WILLIAMS Y o u are more The Inchfortunate than I , Mr Speaker, because I have not seen the notices of amendment to which you refer. I regret that you did not an hour ago make your discovery of the character of the debate, because I am replying to statements which fell from the Prime Minister. of the Prime Minister's speech was an COOK -He is statutorily argument against the reference of the B ill to a Select Committee, on the ground that Y o u give, the he had endeavoured to meet objections raised during the second-reading debate by drafting certain amendments which, would be proposed in Committee, and in cidentally, he referred to some of those amendments.

MrM c WILLIAMS to learn/ that a reply is not allowed to any statement that may have been permitted. of latitude is always given to a Ministeri n charge of a B ill in the explaining of its provisions, and when, during a debate, suggestions have been made for the improvement of a B ill , the Ministeri n charge of it is entitled to indicate what he proposes to do to meet those suggestions. That is what I understood the Prime Minister to do. He may have been led by interjections to go more fully into matters than he would otherwise have done; but it would certainly be irregular to allow now a general disoussion on proposals which will properly come up for discussion in Committee of the whole House, and which can there be discussed in every detail. -order arises out of a statement from the Chair. you are m error. ber may not canvass in that irregular way the decisions of tlie Chair. MrM c WILLIAMS ruling , Mr Speaker. The statement of the Prime Minister that the only information that could be obtained by a Select Committee would be the evidence of interested parties is at variance with what I know. My object in pressing for a Select Com.mittee is not to hear what may be said by the representatives of the American Oil Trust-if I were on the Committee I would not want them to be summonedbut to get the evidence of experts. This agreement has been drawn up, presumably, by the persons whodrew up the -shipping agreement and other agreements under which the Commonwealth has been so unfortunate. agreements, the Commonwealth has been ,let down badly, and has lost, I think, most of the cases that it has entered into. It is not clear what the agreement means. If , as the Prime Minister has stated, the Commonwealth is to be the sole arbiter of the price at which oil shall be sold in Australia, the monopoly which some of us fear will be prevented; but there is a yet greater monopoly to fear. The extent to which this company will control discoveries of oil in Australia and its Territories has not been made clear. It is new to me them at all. You have been told that half-a-dozen times. MrM c WILLIAMS I have discussed A certain amount the matter with persons whom I regard as experts, and who, though not in terested in this arrangement in any way, are distinctly favorable to it , and they say that the extent to which the company will dominate operations in Papua and German New Guinea is not clear. I think that it ought to be made clear. some one, who is not named, but who is favorable to the B ill , is not clear about the effect of the agreement, does not carry us anywhere. MrM c WILLIAMS I have not the permission of the person whom I have in mind to give his name before the House; but I ask honourable members to remember On a point of orderthat we are tying up the industry for fifteen years, and that an adequate supply of oil is essential, not only for city industries and pleasures, but also fOT I merely wish to say that rural occupations. I welcome the introduction of an oil refinery into Australia; An honourable membut there are certain doubts in my mind whioh I wish to have cleared up. I do not wish to .place our oilsupplies in the I accept your hands of some outside combine, especially in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is now fighting a shipping combine, which is trying its best to strangle our line of Government steamers, and whose chairman has entered into an alliance with the Morgan 'Shipping Combine of America to dominate the shipping of the world. As this man is also at the head of the concern with which it is proposed that we should enter into an agreement for the supply of oil, I dread the effect of his influence on our oil supplies. Lord Inchcape controls the biggest combine in the world, the Shipping Combine that beat the -British, In regard to all these American, and Australian Governments. It is now fighting our Commonwealth line of steamers, and causing them to come out here half empty. It is. doing its best to prevent them from securing a ton of cargo. Therefore, it is our duty to see that the Commonwealth does not again enter into a contract fatal to its interests. I shall vote for sending the B ill to a Select Committee. No harm can be done by a short delay.",36,Robert Best I T Is In The The Leader Of The Opposition And To Take

In deed, the Imperial authorities were indiscreet in placing upon the directorate as one of their representatives a gentleman having such interests, and we would be indiscreet, also, if we were to accept Lord Inchcape in the character of a guardian of our interests, seeing that at the same time he is doing his utmost to break up another Australian enterprise, namely, our shipping. mittee should particularly inquire into three things-int o Lord Inchcape's association with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; into the matter of the inferiority of their crude oil; and with respect to who shall fix a fair and reasonable price.

I desire to make clear my own connection with exploration for oil in Papua. When, in 1916, I was appointed Minister for External Affairs-the Department is now known as that of Home and Territoriesone of the first matters to which I directed my attention had to do with prospecting for oil in Papua. There had been a great deal of dissatisfaction concerning these activities, and I , personally, shared in that dissatisfaction. The fact in respect to oil investigations has been quiries I discovered that up to that stage we, had expended about Â£60,000 in exploration work, with a return of about 2,000 gallons of oil. That was very poor, of course; but at least it indicated that there was oil in Papua, although it did not determine whether or not it was there in payable quantities. It was still considered that scientific and practical investigations might discover payable dethe representatives of two separate syndicates waited upon me to ascertain whether private enterprise would be allowed to prospect for oil in Papua. So far as I was concerned, I said ""Yes."" One of these gentlemen represented a Californian company, and the other a local syndicate. Both concerns were apparently in a position to conduct exploration work on a practical basis. I went into the matter very thoroughly, and formulated a scheme which provided for the prospecting to be undertaken in such a way as to secure the Commonwealth Government in every conceivable direction. The information at my disposal was insufficient' for me to know whether the oil was likely to be struck in the form of a continuous stream, or lode, or in A Select Comreservoirs. In either case, however, I had arranged that there should be areas of 5 square miles allotted, and that every alternate area should be held by the Commonwealth Government, so that we would be protected, no matter whether the oil was discovered in lode formationthat is to say, in a continuous canal -o r in subterranean reservoirs. I set forth that the Commonwealth should have' first call upon all oil produced, and that the price should not exceed 3d. per gallon, which would amount",40,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Wade S Connexion With The Oil Fields In

I am opposed to the motion to refer the B i ll to a Select Committee, because it is of vital importance that this great question of discovering oil should be.settled as soon as possible. We must find oil deposits in the Commonwealth territory. It is almost criminal on the part of honourable members to take any action, either here or elsewhere,.that will lead to delay. No sound reason has been-advanced to justify the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this matter. We now have all the safeguards that are necessary, for this afternoon the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) told the Leader' of the Country party ( Mr Mcwilliams) that if he were not satisfied with the Ministerial interpretation of the clause relating to the price to be fixed for crude oil-and the Prime Minister's interpretation is backed UP by the opinion of Sir Robert Garram, who does not make many mistakes-the n the Government are willing that the clause shall definitely state that the Commonwealth shall fix the price. What more can we ask? And is it not better to be associated with a company that belongs to the Empire? Commonwealth Government take entire control of the whole business? what happens when Governments go into ventures of this kind. We have been fooling about in Papua for a long time without any definite results. We want experts, and we cannot expect people like those connected with, the Anglo-PersianO i l Company to go into this business for the good of their health. establish a commercial concern. history of the company shows that it is comprised of men who understand the business, and, as I have just said, it belongs to the' Empire. Consequently it is inexpedient to do anything that is likely to lead to delay. The appointment of a Select Committee would mean delay, and for that reason I intend to support the Government. listened attentively to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) this afternoon, and came to the conclusion that he was entirely governed by sentiment, due, no doubt, to the fact that for the last f o ur or five years sentiment has entered so largely into all Government undertakings. But the time for that sort of thing has passed. Our financial position is such that sentimental considerations must be put on one side. We must endeavour to do something practical. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has moved to Tefer the B ill to a Select Committee, for the purpose of eliciting further information with regard to the agreement, and during the debate this afternoon, by a marvellous piece of conjuring, the amended schedule was placed in honourable members' hands. I was so surprised and annoyed that in speaking plainly I gave utterance to words at which you, Mr. Speaker, took offence. It is not in my nature to insult anybody, but I think the circumstances warranted a strong statement. I am informed, on credible authority, that the Anglo-PersianO i l Company's crude o i l is not a first-class article, or at least that there is better. And, moreover, I believe that the Anglo Persian Company draw their chief supply from wells that are not under the protection of the British flag, so that it is possible that foreign Governments may be in a position to place an embargo on the output. fer to? We know one. Those who are interested in this matter halve written to me on the subject, and in interviews with me have made statements which, I think, warrant honourable members in giving more mature consideration to this agreement before it is ratified. I .can understand the Prime Minister's confidence because of They want to the environment in which he has moved * The in Great Britain during recent years. But he appears to have lost sight of the fact that he is now in Australia, and that we are dealing with what is purely an Australian matter. If this agreement is heaven-born, then mot much harm can be done if it is scrutinized by members of a Select Committee, to make sure that it contains nothing that is likely to be detrimental to Australian interests. I do I not know whether members realize their position as representatives of the people.' I regard myself as a trustee of the public interests, and as such I want to make sure that this agreement is quite in order before I attach my signature-for I regard my vote as my signature-in ratification of it .

The determination of what i9 a fair and reasonable rate to charge for anything depends upon whether one is a buyer or a seller. We ought to have more information on this subject. If the company fixed upon exorbitant freights, it seems to me that under this agreement we could not object to them, and that the Government would be powerless to take action if it were dissatisfied with the way in which the oil was shipped to the refinery It is all very well to say that we could use our own steamers, b u t the wells from which the oil is at present being obtained are in other countries over which we have no control, and we might not be permitted to use our own vessels. The schedule to the B ill is so f u l l of anomalies that it might well be described as "" A Schedule of Anomalies for the most part Telling against Australia."" We ought to exercise the greatest caution'in accepting an agreement involving, as this does, a gigantic financial deal and binding us down for fifteen years. We have no idea what Australia's future oil supplies may be. The whole position is so uncertain that there ought to be no hostility to the proposal to appoint a Select Committee to ascertain who are the moving spirits in this enterprise, and whether a better agreement could not be drafted. If these oil people are the monuments of perfection they claim to he, and are so anxious to help Australia, they have nothing to fear from the appointment, of a Select Committee. I received this morning the following telegram from Sydney: Ait meeting of New South Wales oil trade hold Sydney to-day, following resolution passed:-""In view far-reaching effects of proposed agreement between Commonwealth Government and Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the oil trade-som e thirty firms-urge s upon members the necessity of the matter being referred to Select Committee of the House for further serious inquiry on behalf of the oil trade."" received a copy of that telegram.

The right honourable gentleman adduced no argument in favour of the ratification bf the agreement. In effect, what he said was that, as Lord Inchcape, the Duke of So-and-so, and several others were connected with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and they were such jolly good fellows, we ought to sign the agreement. I hope that honourable members will not be influenced by sentimental considerations, but will deal as practical business men with this question, which is deserving of the best that is in them. The Prime Minister, in supporting the agreement this afternoon, suggested that it was loaded with benefits for the Commonwealth, and in his enthusiasm he waved his arms as wildly as if he were conducting a musical entertainment.

It would be unnecessary for the Committee to go to the United States of America to prosecute its investigations. examine the agreement with the object of ascertaining whether it was in the best interests of Australia, and would inquire as to who were concerned in the enterprise.

Hughes) stated that the Government would have to continue the policy of assisting and developing the Australian shale oil industry. I fear, however, that by the establishment of this enterprise we shall practically extinguish the whole of the shale oil companies now operating in Australia. The Prime Minister contends that the agreement will not interfere with them in the slightest degree. There does not, however, seem to be any jeason for rushing this agreement through the House. If it were referred to a Select Committee that Committee could make the fullest inquiries in regard to our present shale oil industries, and also as to the personnel of the Anglo Persian Company. I have not had time to carefully consider the whole schedule -to the Bill, but I have perused it, and can find in it no provision for empowering a private company to establish oil refineries here and to import its crude oil free of duty. established refineries here, and attempted to import crude oil, it would thus be crushed out of -existence by this monopoly.

Enormous gain would result if sound, practical efforts were made to prove the existence of oil in Australia. For a great number of years, we have been spending money in Papua with bad results, because the work has been undertaken by the Government, instead of endeavouring to carry on the work under a political Minister. I commend them now for taking steps to utilize the services of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who have special experts and geologists who thoroughly understand the business. I am also pleased that, instead of adhering to the terms of the memorandum., which provided for retaining the field of exploration to Government efforts, such a policy has been renounced, and the GoI am looking at vernment are now prepared to allow outsiders to prospect for oil in that field.

If these people are prepared to spend their money, and if it can be certified by a geological Department that the conditions are in any way favorable for the discovery of oil, the Government will be justified in spending many thousands of pounds in the purchase of drills, which could be lent out to parties, prepared to guarantee the expenditure of a certain amount of money in prospecting work. In my opinion, the offer of a large bonus is worthless. Let ue give assistance to prospectors.

It is rather unfortunate that we are unable to discuss the details of the agreement before we arrive at a decision on that question. again remind honourable members that this is neither a second-reading debate nor a debate in Committee upon the Bill. So far, I have allowed a considerable amount of latitude; and what honourable members have really been doing is to go over a lot of matter which has already been thoroughlythreshed, out in the House. When they desire to go farther, and to debate details of the schedule, and possibly details of suggested amendments, obviously, I must draw the line, because those are matters which can be dealt with only in Committee. stage, honourable"" members may dissect every word, every letter, and every comma bf t h e ' B ill , or any proposed amendments to the B ill , if they -so desire. quently It will not be in order at this stage of the proceedings to debate the matters to which I have alluded. The proposal is to refer this B ill to a Select Committee, when such matters would be freely open to discussion, as they would also be in a Committee of the whole. numbers appear to be up. It is set out in the B ill that this Anglo-Persian Company is to use its best endeavours to obtain a f u l l supply of oil for Australia. It may very soon report to the Prime Minister that it has used.its best endeavours in the direction indicated, and without success. hand, it obtains a f u l l supply of oil for Australia, it will be obliged to go for that supply to the very people against whom honourable members opposite have inveighed so vigorously. If the B ill be referred to, a Select Committee, I hope that that body will examine representatives of the Vacuum Oil Company, of the Standard Oil Company, of the Shell Company, of the Anglo-Persian Company, and other' experts who may be available. I understand, for example, that D r . 1 Wade is still in Australia. If honourable members' were sitting in judgment upon any case, would they limit the evidence to one side? I claim that if any information can be obtained, even fro m an But before we reach enemy source, that information should be made available. I should have no hesitation in telling any Select Committee appointed to get evidence where it could, so long as it obtained necessary information, and surely some information could be "" obtained from the men to whom I am referring. A Select Committee appointed by this House would no doubt possess sufficient brains to judicially examine evidence, and the whole inquiry could be completed' in twoi or three weeks, and the report presented to Parliament when we meet again after the adjournment for the Royal visit. The question to be decided is a momentous one toAustralia, and we ought to see, when starting a business of this kind, that the foundations are firmly laid. There are columns in the Times of the 2nd March this year which disclose to me, at any rate, that we are in some danger if , without inquiry, we close with When we reach that thiscompany. What is being done in other parts of the world where the oil industry is developing by leaps and bounds? In Mexico there are not fewer Consethan 150 American companies obtaining and exporting oil, and if we depart from the State system of developing our oil resources wÂ© ought to allow other companies to send their experts to Australia. Personally, I should like to see the best experts employed, because, if we could get twenty companies to establish themselves in Australia, it would not-be long before we should be self-contained so far as oil is concerned. If this were so, we in Australia would be able to rejoice in the fact that by the development of our oil wells we were conferring immense benefits, not only on ourselves, but on all the world. [? .'2] -The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has expressed the joy with: which he would welcome twenty companies to explore the Australian .oil resources. But Australia has been open to these'companies all along, and one result of our neglect to do anything to provide ourselves' with oil was that petrol and other oils that come from petroleum were exceptionally dear in the Commonwealth all through the war period.

It was shown that these Combines had made enormous profits at the cost of this country during the war neriod, and when the Necessary Commodities Commission fixed a price which was considered fair, the Combines boycotted the State until the price was lifted to a level they thought they had a right to demand. Now, when the Commonwealth Government submit an agreement with a company which will provide, at any rate, some cheap oil, we have, from 'Unexpected quarters, these extraordinary arguments against the proposal. I was astounded to hear the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) say that, because the Government would hold half the stock, they will become a party to the extortion of high prices. I never heard a more damaging argument against any proposal to nationalize an industry. If the Government would do such a thing, are they not just as likely to'extort high prices through the medium of other industries they might wholly control ? do it under cover of the company. ment is so artificial as to suggest that honourable members are not expressing their convictions, but looking around for some means of bolstering up the case for opposition companies, it is, unhappily, the fact that whenever an effort is made to deal with any of the big interests, we find-without the slightest suspicion of corruption or collusion-that those who wish to oppose everything the Government may do become naturally tlie mouthpiece of those interests. vernment's anti-profiteering moods? ways in my anti-profiteering ""mood""; I do not change it simply because the Bill to deal with it bears the name of some man I dislike. this Bill had borne the name of the Leader of the Opposition instead of that of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), or some other Minister, we should not have heard the speeches we have been under the painful necessity of listening to in this debate -..^ -I have been waiting to hear one sound reason advanced for sending this Bill to a Select Committee. We heard reasons ^ rememlast week in the House and in the lobbies, but those reasons have all been dissipated into thin air; and we now hear great fear expressed that a giant monopoly is being established. We in Australia have suffered under at least two oil monopolies for many years. In New South Wales a Labour Ministry introduced a proposal to deal with the matter by establishing a State monopoly, not of crude oil, but of petrol; and that proposal was supported, not only by the Labour party, but by a large section opt-' side. The proposal now before us is to refer to a Select Committee the agreement which the Government have entered into subject, to the approval of this House. The agreement does not establish a monopoly; and there is nothing in the way of the establishment of a monopoly to inquire into. The contract is to deliver certain quantities of crude oil yearly, and that quantity is not sufficient to meet the demands of Australia; thus the contract can have little effect on competing companies so long as their prices are as satisfactory as the prices of others. If the prices of those competing companies are better for the public than those charged by the Anglo-Persian Company the trade will soon go to them. But the fear that the public are going to be charged more is not the reason that we are inundated with expensive telegrams and literature-the fear is that the presence of a company controlled by the Government will bring down the price of oil, and that the competing companies will have to leave the market or sell at the same figure. The whole agitation against the Bill is founded on an idea that by the establishment of refineries in am alAustralia, where our people may find employment, we are striking a blow at the monopoly prices to which the Commonwealth has hitherto had to submit. ThatI venture to say that if is not a matter for a Select Committee, but a matter on which every one who has followed the profiteering operations in this country can come to a speedy determination. made more progress if the Government had undertaken the business themselves?",51,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Wade S Connexion With The Oil Fields In

An y one of the twenty companies which the honourable member for Maribyrnong pictures in his imagination is free to explore for oil in Australia as much as it likes; the agreement establishes no monopolygives no monopoly rights. Reference has been made to the powers that may be exercised in connection w i th the Customs duties; but under what conditions? If the Commonwealth Government thinks the price charged is fair and reasonable it may do the things provided, and can only do them through this Parliament; not only is the Government to be satisfied that the price is fair and reasonable, but the majority of honourable members has to be satisfied before any one of these three conditions apply. The fear that a monopoly w ill be created is the emptiest of all the suggestions made in support of a Select Committee.

In what has happened since we have an illustration of the new phase of Imperialism. The explorations of. Mr d'Arcy, and the energetic persuasions of certain high British officials who are mixed up in this company have become responsible for the fact that Persia is now to all intents and purposes a part of the British Empire. It seems to me that the scheme is part and parcel of the activities of what is known as the RoundI able group, or the 1 newer Imperialism, that seeks to exploit the outlying parts of the Empire in ciers in London. It is eighteen years since Persia became an oil-producing country. Close upon the discovery of oil there, Persia was partitioned between Russia and Great Britain, but as the result of the European war Britain now holds not merely the part allotted to her by the agreement with Russia, but the whole of Persia. The internal composition of this Anglo-Persian Oil Company makes it apparent that it is intended to act towards the oil fields which are thought to exist in the Commonwealth and, virtually, the and its Territories in the same way, and. to my mind, the development of the oil industry in Australia under the terms of the Bill would be fraught with as great danger to the liberties of the people of this country as the discovery of oil brought to the people of Persia.

When addressing myself to subjects under Chamber, I am not concerned about the individual opinions of honourable members opposite, or even of honourable members on this side, but my purpose is to discuss various matters from the view-point of the industrialists in all countries, who, I may tell honourable members, are very much concerned about the system of concession giving and exploitation of which the operations of the Anglo Persian Oil Company are a sample. If honourable members take the trouble to read sueh organs of the New Imperialism as the Bound Table, they will know that there is a combination in Great Britain whose idea is to exploit the Dominions of the Empirei n the interests of a financial group whose head-quarters are in London. member does not know it .

Honourable members should be aware that the world to-day is being divided into huge international Trusts. The nations are taking on the aspect of Trusts. They have become huge industrial workshops that must have control of the materials they require or go under in tbe industrial struggle to maintain their supremacy. It every dav becomes increasingly necessary for them to control in one way or another countries rich in iron and the other articles I have referred to that are essential for the maintenance of their superiority in armaments. They must acquire these countries by force, or, if they have them, must use force to retain them. Taking this view of the question, I find no reason for supporting the oil agreement which has been submitted to us. In my opinion, I ask thÂ© honourable it calls for a very exhaustive inquiry by a Select Committee, or by some other body, to justify the Government in asking us to consent to it . Some honourable members have said I did not intend that this agreement will not retard the development of oil supplies in Australia consideration in this or the Territories under the control of the Commonwealth. Why is it that honourable members who have talked about the Commonwealth Shipping Line have not come forward w i th a proposal to establish exclusively Commonwealth refineries.

When it is a matter of Australia desiring, to build submarines and destroyers we can send men to Great Britaint o learn their job. Are there no refineries in other parts No t under preof the world where Australian citizens can be sent to learn the technique of refining oil during the period which is to be occupied by endeavours to discover oil deposits here? I have been reading a book in which I learned that the trouble with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been, not that it has had insufficient supplies of o i l , or that the. quality has not been up to the mark, but that it has not had enough refineries to cope with its output. ThÂ© nature of this agreement, in my mind, tends to support that fact.

Most of the wells, however, have to be kept shut down for want of facilities to deal with the crude.

307,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [9.45],"I have had many differences of opinion with the Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Pearce), but in connection with this Trust evil I should like to quote briefly from The Uprising of the Many, 'by Russell, who, by the way, gives a good deal of credit to the Ministerf o r Defencef o r action which he took some years ago fighting Trusts that were threatening Australia. Australia, the late Mr Thomas Price, had trouble with the Shipping Trusts of Australia. Tlie Trust got a verdict of 500 dollars. Mr Price owned his cottage, the result of years of toiling at his trade, and beyond that he had not a dollar. So the great Shipping Trust, which annually gouged millions from the people of Australia, purposed to seize the 900dollar cottage to punish him for telling the truth. Then an agent tried to tempt Mr Price by offering to advance h i m the money, and it is related by one eye-witness that a somewhat portly gentleman was seen rushing out of a house with an infuriated member of Parliament behind him. This agent, we are told, was finally kicked like a bundle of rags into the gutter. writer also has something to say about George Ryland, who was eliminated from the Northern Territory by that man who, in my judgment, ought to be in gaol for his administration there. land was black-listed for five years. This is bow Mr Andrew Fisher, who enjoyed the unique distinction of being regarded as an honest politician, wag treatedAndrew Fisher, .a locomotive and mining engineer, and afterwards in the Labour administration, the best Minister for Customs that Australia ever had, went up and down the colony looking in vain for employment. He made a study of mines; no man knew them better; but no employer would have him on liny terms. Finally a miner, who was an old friend, and to whom he had made a rather pleading application, said to him, "" Fisher, I should like to have you here, for I know your ability, but it is impossible. You know what would happen to me if I employed you. In six months we would both be looking for jobs."" I have referred to these incidents in order to bring home to honourable members the evils that confront us in connection with these Combines. own experience of Standard Oil methods. A gentleman who, I understand, a salary of Â£16,000 a year, and commission, boasted, I believe, at a meeting in South Africa, that, if necessary, he would buy the Commonwealth Parliament Dr. Maloney. order to advance the interests of his company. I was introduced to him a few years ago by Mr Alcock, of Messrs. James Service and Company. He at once commenced to speak about Standard oil, which, as honourable members know, is not a pleasant subject with me. I said to h i m , I do not care to talk about Standard oil. Let us talk about someA former Premier of South thing else."" In the course of our conversation I was interrupted by a constituent, and upon my return he again started to This is what happenedtalk Standard oil. Another interruption in the conversation occurred, and for the third time he introduced the subject of Standard oil. I then said to him, "" I w ill eat with you, drink with you, or smoke with you, but I w ill not talk Standard oil with you."" He at once replied, "" But , doctor, you must know that we give the public a better article at a cheaper price than any other company, and we pay better wages."" It then flashed across my mind that he was the man from South Africa, and I said to him, "" I believe you are the man who boasted he could buy the Commonwealth The Parliament. Let me tell you that your Standard Oil Trust may be rich enough to buy anything, but, by the Living God, you will not buy the Australian people, who have the adult franchise."" A t that George Rymoment my friend, Mr Alcock, joined in and asked the reason for my display of temper, and the Standard OilCompany's representative at once replied, "" The doctor is not to blame; hÂ© gave me three warnings."" I then remarked that I would like to fling the Standard Oil Company"" down below.*' He replied, "" It would make a mighty fine blaze."" Mr Alcock was pacified, and there the matter ended. The man, however, attained his object. We were trying to bring about the importation of oil in bulk, so that it might be tinned and cased in Australia, and thus give employment to tinsmiths and carpenters. In that effort we were defeated by two votes, and I believe that those two votes were had.""

If the provisions of the Bill do not interfere with any one having a free hand in the development of the oil industry of Australia no objection can be taken to the proposed new clause. It is an additional safeguard, and simply provides, for what many honourable members have been 20 advocating, that there shall be no ob31 stacles placed in the way of other companies who desire to operate in any of the 11 Territories or areas mentioned in the B ill .

Since the B ill cannot take away any right from anybody, except as set out in the agreement, and since the agreement does not -prevent any one from coming here to prospect for, or develop, or refine oil, the proposed new clause is superfluous, and to the extent that it mentions the Territories, which we are resolved to reserve as the prerogative of the Crown, it is dangerous. I hope honourable members will nob agree to it . honourable members will agree to the new clause. advocate open competition, while we on this side stand for Government monopoly; but I propose to support the clause because it will permit others to come here and erect refineries , and w ill not permit 1 the people of Australia to be swallowed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.

No attempt is made by the honourable memharness any outsider to the 'conditions under which the Commonwealth is endeavouring to safeguard the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. All the trouble the Government have taken to [91] insure the supply of oil to Australia in the hour of emergency will be put in jeopardy. A t the very foundation of the agreement is the recognition of the fact that the hour of danger may arrive when the whole of the Pacific may be in turmoil. If the two great contending Powers bordering the Pacific to-day come into conflict, we may be cut off from the rest of the world, and the mobility of our Fleet reduced , to naught. We would look in vain for a supply of oil fro m one of the great competitors in the struggle, and assuredly we would be drawn into the maelstrom of war, because these two great contending forces which are to-day more or' less our Allies, would, certainly require our foodstuffs and our raw material, and as soon as either secured supplies from us, those very supplies would be declared contraband by the other. In such circumstances, we should look in vain for supplies of oil from any other source. This agreement is an honest endeavour to provide supplies of oil within the Commonwealth or our Territories for the hour that may arise, and tlie company with whom we are making it is good enough for Great Britain. I repeat that the proposal of the honourable member for Franklin would render valueless all tlie Honourable members opposite trouble the Government have taken to safeguard Australia from the need to depend on foreign competitors for supplies of o i l .

This amendment will Teally test the feeling of the Committee as to whether we are going to create .a gigantic Inchcape Combine by preventing the people of Australia from developing the oil industry. ister and Attorney-General) [10.28] This amendment ought not to be agreed to for many reasons. It says that nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to prevent any person or persons from prospecting or developing, manufacturing, refining, and marketing any well oil, shale, or other oil "" in any part of the Territories or areas mentioned in this Act."" Now, no Territories or areas are mentioned in the Bill. It has nothing whatever to do with the finding of oil, but merely with its treatment when found. If the words in the amendment relating to "" any part of the Territories or areas mentioned in this Act,"" but which are not mentioned in it, were struck out,and there were substituted a provision that the Commonwealth should have the same right to fix the price of oil as it has in connection with the Anglo Persian Company, then it would be quiteall right.

The Bill is one to approve of an agreement which has been entered into by the Commonwealth with the< Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited. Clause2 approves of that agreement, and! bhe remainder of the measure is practicallv the agreement itself.
