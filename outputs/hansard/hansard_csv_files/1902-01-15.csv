Prime Minister what action the Government int'end'to take in connection with fche paymenfc of income tax. T t has been stated iri the press that tlie right honourable and learned gentleman says he is not liable, and that he does not"" intend to pay income tax to any of the States. Ifc has come to my knowledge that each State is going, to claim income tax where ifc has been in force. We are liable to be summoned'at any moment for the payment of income tax in two States, and I wish to know whether the Governirient intend to introduce a Bill defining which State is to have the income tax, and so prevent any possible litigation, which must surely follow if we do not pay income tax. If we pay incometax to one State we are not exempt from payment of income tax to the other under present"" circumstances. I ask the Prime Minister' if lie will make a statement as to the position of the Government on the'subject, and whether they intend to introduce a Billj so that honourable members will know where"" to pay their income tax. Bill would not be of any use. The question depends entirely on' constitutional considerations. Whether the law passed' by individual' States' for the collection of income tax applies to .Federal incomes can only be decided under fche Constitution, arid any Bill we might intrwluce to say that ifc 1 should or should, not be collected would be useless; because it could not prevent the tax frombeing, collected if ' it werecollectable,', and itcould' not make ifc alegal right if it were not. a legal light already. Therefore, my honourable friend will see that there is no necessity for. a Bill. I have'eome to the conclusion, founded upon decisionsin other countries, particularly in America, that federal incomes are not chargeable with income tax imposed by the States. That is the position which I shall take up, but I hope that I am not going to be made a scapegoat, and to be sued, because in that case I should have individually to pay my cost of defending the action. It is a personal question for any officer of the Commonwealth, or any one who receives his income under the Commonwealth to decide whether or not he is liable to a States and we cannot intervene for tlie purpose of saying that we shall pay the cost of defending such actions, or otherwise interfere, because that is uo affair of tlie Commonwealth.

In any case it seems to me that prove that they had been, domiciled there is. a very serious, risk of leakage from here, with the object as. has been this, cause, and; if certificates are to be proved by various people, of. submitissued under, the. Immigration Restriction ting them, inHong Kong or some Act, I trust that the Government will see Chinese port, to. the. highest bidder who that the method ofidentification relied wished to .come here., It hag. been proved upon, will, be so completeas to, place it that an immense traffic has been done, in beyond almost the possibility of. dpubt that that way in these certificates, with the rethe people returning are those whom they sult that the whole object of the Chinese claim to be. Another matter deserving of Restriction Act* has. been defeated for consideration, is the migration of these years, past. In Queensland, too, it was people from State to State-fch e point reproved, only very recently; that a number ferred to by the honourable and.' learned of certificates, hod been forged, and it inember for South Australia,,. Mr Glynn, was only by an accident almost that a few minutes ago.

In Western Australia many of these had been; used, in the past; they have no poll tax, but a rethat is, how many Chinese had obtained striction, of one Chinese immigrant admissionto, Queensland, on these forged to certificates,; and the methods followed, by ship bringing them fco the State.

23,Mr Watsqn,"-It, has been suggested that there is a considerable difference of",17,Adjournment Alien Immigration
24,Mr Avatson,"That has been done inaliens or immigrants there is an even greater variety of legislation. Several of the States have an equivalent of the Natal .examination test; that is to say, they can insist upon a language test as far as these general immigrants are concerned. 'That applies to New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia, but in the other three States there is no such restriction. It seems to me that, while holding in view what has just been stated by the Prime Ministeri n answer to the honourable .and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, it would be advisable, if constitutional procedure will allow, to retain the various State Immigration Restriction Acts in operation for a considerable time to -come, because if they do nothing else they will prevent the undue migration of these .people from one State to another. It does not seem proper that where a State has taken -comparatively effective measures to prevent the influx of undesirable people, it should -be suddenly s'ubjected to an inundation :f rom those States where no precautions have been taken. member overcome tlie provision of the Constitution regarding freedom of commerce and intercourse between the States? pretation of such niceties to the professional element in the Chamber and out of it. I do not pretend to be able to interpret that delicate point as clearly as I should like, but, speaking as a layman, I do not think the term "" intercourse "" in the Constitution relates to anything more than trade and commerce-as the context seems to indicate. I do not think it would be any bar to the 'continuance of existing restrictions upon immigration in the various States. Whether the Constitution would allow immigration laws to be passed by the various States in addition to those already in force is a matter upon which there would probably be «raver doubt, but I do not think there is .anything in the Constitution Act which -applies either to the disuse or the repeal of the Immigration Restriction Acts at present in force in tlie States. "" commerce "" is held to cover passengers. ifc would' undermine the position I have taken up with regard fco the migration of people from one State to another. MrV . L . SOLOMON -But we are not to be bound by fche United States Constitution or practice. thatfcheJudges of the High Court that is to be constituted will be to some extent guided in their interpretation of the Constitution by the decisions given elsewhere under somewhat similar conditions. A t the same time, looking at the matter merely as a layman, I do not think that we are bound to accept that interpretation. intercourse between State and State depends upon an Act of Parliament, whilst here it is provided for in the Constitution. what the powers under fche Constitution really amount to may require to be argued out before the proper tribunal. In the meantime, pending any reference to the High Court and a decision being given by high authority, it seems to me that we should put the strictest rules in force, in view of the fact that unless we do so several of the communities which constitute the Commonwealth will find themselves placed at a disadvantage from their own point of view. Wherever the Constitution will allow of it, an interpretation should be placed upon ifc in the direction of maintaining the condition of affairs that previously existed. I think most people will agree that we should endeavour to disarrange as little as possible fche conditions existing prior to federation. Taking New South Wales as an instance, we had a very strict Chinese Exclusion Act, and our Immigration Restriction A ct was also very severe, as far as its administration was concerned. WhatI urge is that the strictest possible interpretation should be placed upon the Constitution in regard to these Immigration Acts, and also that the greatest care should be exercised with respect to the recognition of the exemption certificates to which I have referred. Another matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Prime Minister concerns more directly Western Australia. In that State there is a law under which it In the United States is possible, or has been possible, to import coloured labour under contract, one of the conditions being that these labourers are not to be introduced south of the 27th parallel of latitude. In addition, any person importing a labourer under the Act -",17,Adjournment Alien Immigration

31,Mr Watson,"The question as toand, of course, all brought in under the Act are under contract-ha s to enter into sureties for his return, when demanded, to the country whence he came. The labourer under the Act is entitled to enter into a fresh agreement at the completion of the first one, and an agreement may be abrogated under certain conditions by a magistrate; but any labourer found in AVestern Australia, not under contract to any employer, is liable to be deported at the will of fche Government. The expense of the deportation has, of course, to be borne by fche man who originally imported the labourer, and, further, the last employer of -a labourer not under contract, is liable to a fine of £ 5 0. The point to which I wish to -draw attention is, as I am informed, that there are now 300 or 400 at least of these "" walk-aboub "" coloured people, as, I think, they are termed in Queensland-that is, time-expired labourers-in Western Australia who are not under any cantract, and are therefore liable to deportation. Further, a large proportion of them have, as, indeed, was inevitable, leaked southward very considerably beyond the 27th parallel of latitude, and the local authorities, it seems, will take no steps whatever to deport them, holding that the whole question of emigration and immigration is in the hands of the Federal Government. I believe that even when the power was within their purview they took no steps to carry the Act into effect, as was originoffered by auction in Hong Kong to the ally, or, at any rate, ostensibly intended. A number of these coloured labourers, I am informed, have been guilty of crimes for which alone, under the same Act, they are liable to be deported. After serving a term of imprisonment a labourer is liable to deportation, but in that respect the Act has not been carried into effect. In fact, so far poll tax on their own account on would be as my information goes, no steps have been taken by the AVestern Australian Government fco carry out fche provisions of their own measure, and latterly the authorities have excused themselves on the ground that such, powers are within the purview of the Federal Government. The deportation of these men need cost the FederalGovernment nothing, because there exists in regard to every one a bond from the original employer, undertaking to defray the cost of the passages of time-expired labourers to the place whence they came. I do not wish fco go into the matter at greater length, because it seems to me that the whole question of the recognition of exemption certificates, and of the migration of these coloured people from one State to another, including those in AVestern Australia, of whom I have spoken, is so important as to deserve the most serious consideration the Federal Government can give to it. We all, I believe, hope that the administration of fche Immigration Restriction Act, even though that Act was passed in a form of which some of us do not approve, and which we think will render it comparatively ineffective, will make up to a large extent for any defects there may be in its provisions intrinsically, That is the reason I have directed the attention of the House to a number of instances of leakages -which will materially, for some time to come, affect the operation of this measure. We shall no doubt be told that these exemptions will in time run their course. I admit that these certificates will be a diminishing quantity, always providing that no more forgeries of the nature perpetrated on the Queensland Government are brought into existence. A t the same time, even allowing that no more forgeries are perpetrated, I am given to understand that the number of exemption certificates and permits in existence is very considerable, and that nearly every one will be found to be of value to some one in China. In fact, we find that on several occasions these certificates have been practically highest bidder who came within a reasonable degree of the description set out. I am even informed that the tonnage restriction of A'ictoria., instead of helping the poor Chinese by letting them off a poll tax, has resolved itself in many instances into the shipping companies imposing a good round emigrants. But I do not propose now to delay the House at greater length. I merely \ is k that fche Government shall take these matters into consideration and make the administration of the Act as effective as we hoped it would be, and as the Government promised it should be. External Affairs) I propose to make a few remarks on this subject afc once, instead of waiting for further speeches, because I take it that the remarks made by the honourable member for Bland cover a good deal of the ground, .or most offcheground that can be covered at this early stage of the",18,Adjournment Alien Immigration

I do nob shareany anticipation rof the Act proving ineffective to its working* I can see enough already -to-satisfy me that the Act can be, and,. I think, will be-effectively worked.

But as to.permits, it is only fair to say, bhat it has become necessary bo recognise bhem? up>to-.a. certain point,, for the-reason thab theyweue legalizedby Sbate.

But there is. a good dealt of force ini what the honorable member for Blandhas said regarding the possibility of trafficking in thesedomicile shall not be claimed except upon permits-.fchrough the wantof proper identification. Upon, bhab point I have-already taken, I think, blie best, sbep open, bo me. The officers have asked whebher bhese permibsare to.be recognised, and the answer given has-been that the-presentation of a permit will be evidence upon, which to-exempt the applicant frpm the operation of the Act, if he is clearly identified as being bhe person to whom the permit) wasissued. The officers will haye directions nob to accept permits unless they, are abundantly, satisfied bhat the persons presenting them are the persons fco whom they were originally issued, so that any atbempt to commit a fraud will be dealt wibh, with, as much scrutiny as it is possible to besbow. upon such a .subject There is an additional reason for that. If honourable members.turn: to,section-3 of the Immigration Resbrdction A ct which we passed, bhey will see that among those excepted from its operation areAny person who satisfies an officer that he has formerly been domiciled in the Commonwealth or in any, colony which has become a State. Now a permit; if tlie person presenting ib is identified, may be some evidence of previous domicile, so that under the administration of our own Act there is cast upon us a special care in this respect. Thab care is 1 beingexercised under a minute which has It is brue bhat some of been-issued; in which ""domicile"" is defined by a.paraphrase of a judicial definibion of theterm. When I say a paraphrase; I mean a rendering of'fchedefinition in simpler I do not bind myself' bo language. The paraphrase is as follows:A man is domiciled iii that place in which he has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and his family, not for-a mere special aud-temporary purpose, but. with. the. intention,, of making ithis permanent home. l It seems, to me that a good many permits have been issued, in the past with a somewhat insufficient recognitionof thevalue of the word""domiciled,"" and bhe-great deal that it implies as evidencingan intention--to make a permanent home in fche countiry in which domicile is claimed. The definition, of which I have spoken; will be enforced in iiegand, to all, applications to enterthe Commonwealth i on the ground of haying been previously domiciled, there. Honourable members will, see, therefore; that, in these two. particulars a lauge improvement is likely to ensue by reason, of a clearer identification ofi. the applicant being necessary,, and by insisting that",19,Adjournment Alien Immigration

42,Mr Fowler,"It isa. big, complaint i nsay whether the administration of the Immigration Restriction Acts affects migration between State and State1 but the administration of the Commonwealth Restriction Act cannot affect migration between State and State. Our law, which almost entirely supersedes laws passed in the various States, relates to immigration into the Commonwealth, and no more. The difficulty confronting a person who is undesirable will be to gain admission to the Commonwealth. When he has got into the Commonwealth on the supposition that he is desirable, there will be no difficulty about his passing from State to State. ThatI think must be an indispensable condition of any law which deals with the Commonwealth as a whole. I hope this explanation will satisfy the desire for inquiry by honourable members, and that they will see that this matter is being dealt with in no inactive spirit. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am very glad the honorable member for Bland brought this matter up to-day. The Chinese are a very clever, cunning, and deceptive people. If weimagine that we caninventany methods of restriction, or any form by which they can be kept out of this country, then we are cleverer than any other people who have lived upon this earth. sort of scheme possible for the mind of man to invent in the United States, and still the Chinese got in. We must understand that the Chinaman who comes to the country does not come to live in it or build a home in it . He comes here to get a couple of hundred pounds, with which he can return to the flowery kingdom, where he is an emperor on a small amount. Consequently he is here purely for the purpose of acquiring that couple of hundred pounds, and the certificate which he gets from the State and takes back to China which is a part of his assets. It is a part of his external income, because another Chinaman is prepared to pay a good price for it, and all his friends will subscribe enough to enable him to get out here, and become as well off as the man who came back to become an independent emperor in the community where he was once hard up. I think it would be a good plan to have a picture of every Chinaman taken; let that picture be the certificate, and on it let from one State to another free. If we go us have his measurements. We shall have \ the Prime Minister him in the photo, and after he returns it will be very hard for him to find another Chinaman with all the measurements which that certificate will show. He may find one, and I say we shall want psychological experts to read their very souls if we wish to keep these Chinamen out. I do hope some means will be devised, because we do not wish to see this country overrun with these people. They come here and live upon nothing, and they can accumulate money where our race would starve. I trust the Government will lose no opportunity to carry out their pledge to the people of Australia in connection with the Immigration Restriction Act, by seeing that these gentlemen are kept in the country God selected for them and intended they should live in. much this House might desire that the various provisions of the State Acts should be put into force, we ought not to forget the 92nd section of the Constitution Act, by which it is provided that trade, commerce, and intercourse between the States shall be absolutely free. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, if the larger meaning is to be given to that word "" intercourse,"" then it seems impossible for us to restrict the passage of these people from State to State. I may mention that this point was before They tried every noticed by the honourable and learned member for Indi, and as far back as the time of the Convention in 1897 he referred to the difficulty, and to what was intended by the Constitution. Though, upon looking at the report of the Convention, I do not find that he gave particular instances, still it is perfectly clear that at the time it was seen by members of the Convention that once we were federated, and a law was enacted upon the point, or even before such a law was passed, trade, commerce, and intercourse would be perfectly free, and that the word ""intercourse"" should have the fullest meaning possible. Reallyi t does not seem that we can give it any other meaning than that passengers from State to State should be free. The fullest meaning must of course be given to the words "" trade "" and "" commerce,"" and if we give any meaning to the word 'intercourse "" at all, it must be that persons residing in the several States, no matter who or what they are, must be allowed fco go back to precedent and look to the meaning",21,Adjournment Alien Immigration

45,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"Howeverput upon the word "" intercourse"" in America, we find that thereA law of a State imposing a tax r^Jon passengers arriving in the ports of such State from a foreign country, is a regulation of commerce and void. So that, even if the word "" intercourse "" were left out, we should find that under the words ""trade"" and ""commerce,"" it would be impossible to place any barrier whatever upon any person passing from State to State. what is known as the "" passenger cases."" from those cases, as the honourable and learned member points out, and I say that that was clearly in his mind at the time he spoke in the convention. ThoughI have not before me the reports of the conventions held in Melbourne and Sydney, still from the report of the Adelaide convention it is perfectly clear that some other discussion must have taken place upon the subject. The honourable and learned member for In d i at that convention very clearly referred to the "" passenger cases,"" and quoted from the book to which I now refer Baker's Annotated Constitution of the United Stales. another clause here stating thatThe statute of New York imposing a tax on passengers from foreign countries landing at the ports of thab State, and holding the vessels liable tor such tax, is unconstitutional. Henderson v Mayor, 92 US., 259. I see also here the name of another case cited, from which it appears possible that a Chinaman got into one State and wished to pass to another. no report of the case given here, but from bhe name of bhe case it is evident thab some case such as has arisen here had arisen bhere. The case cited and approved is "" Chy Lungv Freeman 92 US. 275."" No doubt Freeman was then Secretary for Home affairs in America. So that we see that under bhe meaning given in America to the words "" trade "" and "" commerce "" alone it was held that the passage of a person from one State to another could not be prohibited, and in no insbance could any bax be imposed upon him. How much more clear is ib if bhe f u l l meaning is bo be given bo the word ""intercourse "" with us that we cannot possibly place any restriction whatever upon -A man passing from one State to another. Therefore whatever action the House might wish the Prime Minister to take, it seems to me that he has been absolutely constitutional in the course he has adopted : and I for one should feel it to be very wrong if the Executive showed any desire bo outstep the law in this matter. We have a law on bhe subjecb, and ib oughb bo be followed. Wibh regard bo bhe fear expressed thab we are likely to be inundated by Chinese because a few men may secure the exemption certificabes belonging to others, I point out that even if every man who goes away obtains a certificate, and a different man comes back in his place upon it, there would still be no increase in the Chinese population in the Commonwealbh. As we know bhab in all human probabiliby bhab would nob be the case, it is perfectly clear that we are only excitiug needless alarm when we balk aboub an inundation of Chinese under such circumsbances.

The allowance of Is. per diem to men relieving letter carriers now attached to the General Post-office, Melbourne, has been discontinued, in accordance with the recommendation of the Reclassification Board. Owing to the deliveries to a number of adjacent suburbs being now effected from the General Post-office, Melbourne, the circumstances under which the allowance was originally granted have entirely changed, and in the opinion of the Reclassification Board the continuance of the allowance was not justified. In Committee of Ways and MeansConsideration resumed from 13 th cember, 1901 (vide page 8737)Item 74 -Manufacture s of metalsJf.E.L, including engines, boilers, pumps, machines and machinery, n.e.i. ; also screws, n.e.i., axles, springs, and plated and mixed mefcalware, including plated cutlery, ad valorem, 25 per cent. That the words ""and on and after 16th January, .1902, free,"" be added. A little while ago a very long debate took place in this committee upon the desirability of imposing duties upon agricultural machinery, and, as nearly every honourable member who represented a farming constituency told us that the imposition of duties upon agricultural machinery enabled the farmers to obtain better machinery at lower prices than they would otherwise have to pay, I was almost inclined to vote for the Government proposal, because if by the imposition of duties you can obtain locally-manufactured articles which will be cheaper and better than imported articles, I am in favour of their imposition. But, whatever may be the facts in regard to the effect of imposing duties upon agricultural machinery, I , as the representative of a large mining imposition of duties upon mining machinery does not allow those engaged in mining to obtain better or cheaper machinery than they could otherwise obtain. On the contrary, the imposition of duties upon mining machinery makes it more expensive to all engaged in mining work. But in Australia it is absolutely necessary that those who are engaged in mining pursuits should have the best and most up-to-date machinery, if they wish to carry on their operations at a profit. Honourable members object, and I think very rightly, to the employment of cheap Asiatic labour in our mines, and I . would go further, and say that all men working in mines should be paid a fair standard rate of wages. Now, in mining for tin, lead, silver, and copper we depend for our profits, not upon the local market, but upon the markets of the outside world. If we had to depend upon the local demand, 75 per. cent, of the men employed in such mines would be dismissed. The BrokenH ill mines alone produce over 80,000 tons of lead each year, of which theysell locallyonhyabout 10,000 tons. To obtain a sale for the remaining 70,000 tons, they have to compete in the markets of the world with foreign companies who Deemploy the cheapest labour possible, and use the most up-to-date machinery. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for Australian companies to use the most modern and best appliances. I would point out, too, that machinery differs from many other manufactured articles in this, that the cost of labour represented in its price is a great deal more than the cost of labour represented in the price of other things. During the discussion of the Tariff, reference has been made to such industries as the making of nails, and of candles; but, in industries of that kind, the manual labour employed costs very little in comparison with the price of the manufactured product. W it h regard to machinery, however, the case is very different. Therefore, it is possible for countries like England and Germany, where mechanics are paid a lower",25,Kembla 1 Whether He Is Aware That The State Go

66,Mr Thoma S (Barrier),"I m o v e-wage than is paid here, to successfully compete -with our manufacturers, who are attempting to produce some kinds of machinery in competition with those countries. Notwithstanding the advantage enjoyed by the Continental countries, a good deal of machinery is locally produced and supplied to the mines. Until two or three months ago, BrokenH ill , as a mining centre, had the advantage of having free machinery. In face of that fact, I am veiy pleased to say that Gawler, in South Australia, was able successfully to compete with the world in many instances, and to send a good deal of machinery into the BrokenH ill mines. But I venture to say that, notwithstanding all tlie protection to the foundries of Gawler, had it not been for the markets of BrokenH ill and Western Australia, there would be veiy little work going on in Gawler. If you were to ask the manufacturers of Gawler whether they would prefer to have the duty which South Australia gave them and be prohibited from dealing with the markets of BrokenH ill and Western Australia, or whether they would prefer not to have the protection; but to have an opportunity of going to those markets, you would find that they would prefer to have the markets rather than have the protection. I am dealing now, not with pldughshares at 36s. per dozen, but with mining machinery. able member define mining machinery ? thing which mines use I call mining machinery. used in the mines. There is a great deal of machinery which cannot be produced in the States. Machinery of a different sort from that which is being made, or machinery of a new design cannot be produced here unless the manufacturer has a guarantee of having at least more than two or three orders for that particular description of machinery. for instance an engine which would cost from £5,000 to £10,000. I am not here this afternoon to deal with ploughshares at 36s. per dozen, but with large machinery which would cost from £5,000 to 10,000. Some years ago a member, of the firm of Hudson Bros, said to me-""This is our difficulty. In Australia we may get an 25 L order for a good-sized engine, but we have to sell the first one for a great deal less than cost price."" They have to get the patterns and lay down the plant for the first engine. No foundry could possibly sell the first one at anything like cost price. The second one is not sold at cost price, and the profit only begins when the manufacturer sells the third, the fourth, and the fifth. gines have one set of patterns. machinery of a new design. In England or America, when a manufacturer gets an order for a machine of new design, there is a very strong possibility that in a short time he will get an order for a second, a third, and a fourth, and then the profits will come in. But in Australia the manufacturer cannot depend upon getting an order for a second, a third, and a fourth machine, because there is no field here for them. machinery 1 machine. Although we have a good deal of mining going on in Australia, we have only one BrokenH ill , one Mount Morgan, one Mount Bischoff, and one Moonta. I admit there are a few large gold mines in Western Australia. I asked a person tlie other day what he thought it would cost him to produce a £10,000 engine if he had to lay down the plant and get the patterns. He said it would cost him from £17,000 to £18,000 to produce the engine, as the plant would cost £7,000 or £8,000. engines 1 ber mean to say that Australian plants All engines which are cannot do that work now ? cannot make the patterns or lay down the plants, but I point out that it costs a manufacturer £7,000 or £8,000 to lay down the plant for a machine of new design. Does the honourable member mean to tell me that if a manufacturer were ' going to build two pumping engines with different cylinders the same pattern or I mean a big machine, plant would do ? for a machine of new design has necessarily to be imported.

If the firm had not had a guarantee from the Government to make a large number, they could not have afforded to lay down the plant to make one. Big imported machinery is not sold here every day. If a foundry could get an order for a good-sized engine, it would be a good while before it would get another. ber think that these big engines are supplied from stock types at the foundries ? ordered. doubt; but they could not have a different plant and different appliances for turning out eveiy engine. Eveiy new invention and every new design must necessarily be imported into Australia in the first instance, and in such cases I suppose even protectionists will admit that the mining companies would have to pay the whole of the duty. It may be argued that if a high duty is imposed upon engines and machineiy, local manufacturers will be encouraged, and that under the influence of local competition prices will come down in a few years. Against that, however, I would point out that just now, in connection with the mining industry, new methods of dealing with ores are constantly being discovered, and five years is considered by mining men as a fair period at which to fix the life of any new appliances for the treatment of ores. It is stated, therefore, that by tlie time that local competition could commence to operate in regard tofchemanufacture of any particular type of machines or appliances they would become obsolete, and new machinery would have to be imported from abroad. Sometime ago I read a very interesting article regarding 'the principles folof machinery as has the United States, lowed in America and En gland respectively in the manufacture of locomotives and engines generally. In England locomotives are built to last for almost any length of time, whilst in America they are constructed with a view to their use for a period of not more tlian fifteen years. The American engineers take the view that within fifteen years the locomotives will become obsolete, owing to the rapidity with which improvements are introduced into the construction of engines, and they construct them accordingly. The English engineers, however, put more strength into their engines, in order to enable them to work for a much longer period. Personally, I rather favour the American idea, because science is now making such gigantic strides that machinery which is up-to-date to-day will very soon become obsolete. When I visited Western Australia about three years ago I met a number of mining managers, one of whom told me that, owing to the vast strides made by science, five years was the f u l l life of any plant used in connection with gold mining. During the Christmas holidays I visited BrokenH ill and went through some of the mines there. I met Captain John Warren, the manager of the Block 10 mine, who is well known in mining circles throughout the Commonwealth. He had just made a trip round the world, during which he visited England and America, and he told me that so far as electrical science is concerned America is streets ahead of England or Germany, and that mining people are now falling back upon electricity in order to help them. If America is streets ahead of us in electrical science it would be folly on our part not to utilize the developments which have resulted from engineering skill in America, for the purposes of developing our own resources. That the price of labour is not the chief factor in the cost of producing machineiy, is shown by the fact that, although in England and Germany the mechanics engaged in the construction of machinery do not receive such high wages as those similarly employed in Australia, the American mechanics are in many respects more highly paid than our own. Yet America can still send' machinery to us in successful competition with our local manufacturers. It would be unreasonable to 4 expect small communities like ours to make such rapid developments in the manufacture possessing a population of over 70,000,000. their industries under a protective policy. honourable member likes, but what I say is that if the American machinery is going to help us, we should obtain it .

I am very glad to see people employed in manufacturing horse-shoe nails, or in making boots and shirts, and so on, but I desire for a little while to direct the attention of the committee to an industry which, I think, is of somewhat greater importance than these. The mining industry at BrokenH ill is at present under a cloud. Twelve months ago, in 1900, there were 7,256 men employed in the BrokenH ill mines, whereas in December, 1901, only 4,862 men found work there. There was thus a falling off in the number of men employed of 2,394 within twelve months. I do not for one moment say that this reduction is the outcome of the Tariff. Of course, primarily it has been caused by the fall in the price of lead. I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to some particulars taken from the reports of the principal BrokenH ill mines, with a view to show the precarious condition of the industry on the Barrier. The price of* lead to-day is about £ 1 0 10s. per ton. During the half year ended 31st May, 1901, the profits of the; BrokenH ill Proprietary Company amounted to £87,000. to secure an average price of £ 1 4 per ton for their lead, and during that half-year they produced 27,000 tons. Lead is now realizing £ 4 per ton less than the price obtained during that half-year by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company. The Block 14 Company made a loss of £8,271 during the half-year. They produced 6,000 tons of lead, for which they obtained on the average £ 1 2 per ton. The present price of lead, of course, is £ 2 less than that figure. The British Proprietary mine made a profit of £23,000, being able, during that time, to obtain an average price of £ 1 7 per ton for their lead. I have already pointed out that lead is now £ 7 per ton less than at that time. Block 10 mine made a profit of £1,330, being able to sell their lead at £12' per ton. The Sulphide Corporation made a profit of £89,000, having sold their lead at £16 per ton. In giving these figures, I am leaving out odd pounds, shillings, and pence. The North BrokenH ill Company made a loss of £916, selling their lead at £ 1 3 per ton; the South BrokenH ill made a profit of £12,000, with lead at £ 1 3 10s. per ton ; and the BrokenH ill Junction North had a loss of £1,520, selling their lead at £ 1 2 per ton. During that tune there was a profit made at BrokenH ill of £213,000 ; but if some new methods are not discovered in order to produce lead more cheaply, and if"" the price remains as at present, the turnover will be £221,995 less during the current half-year than in the previous half year, so that the whole profit of £213,000 will be wiped out by the fall in the price of lead. As I said just now, the price of lead is undoubtedly the main factor, but it isone that we cannot control. In the face of this fall in price, the Commonwealth Government have placed somewhere about £30,000 extra taxation on the mining companies. The BrokenH ill Proprietary, under the operation of the Tariff as introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs, will have to pay close on 20,000 extra taxation. port machinery. of the various companies what the taxation would mean if they had to import their machinery under the Federal Tariff instead of under f'ree-;trade, and Mr Dickinson, the secretary of the Proprietary Company, calThey were able culates the extra taxation, so far as' tlie company is concerned, at £19,132. that ? piece of machinery has to be imported from the old countiy, Germany, or America valued at £10,000.

111,Mr Thomas,"I did not say so. Ithere, a reasonable expectation always exists that orders for it will be forthcoming. Thusi t is that a f actory in England can spend £20,000 or £30,000 upon a mere speculation. Buti f the proprietors of any Victorian foundries were asked to spend an equal sum upon an experiment, I think they would consider the matter two or three times before acceding to the request. I do not hesitate to say that, if no taxation were imposed upon mining machinery, and the price of lead dropped much lower than it is at the present time, the mines at BrokenH ill would be forced to shut down. No Government can regulate the price of lead. I wish that they could. I wish they could do so as easily as the present Government can impose a Tariff. But unfortunately they cannot. I therefore urge that the Government ought not, by irksome taxation, to hasten the nun of BrokenH ill . The mines there produce from 75,000 to 80,000 tons of lead annually. The extra taxation which this Tariff will impose upon them represents from £30,000 to £40,000. That is almost equivalent to a drop in the price of lead of 10s. per ton. The price of lead is already low enough, and yet this Tariff will practically reduce it to the extent I have indicated. In the output of lead we have to compete with the prolific mines and the cheap labour of Spain, in copper with the cheap Chilian labour, in silver with the rich mines and cheap labour of Mexico, in tin with the cheap labour of the Straits Settlements. neeessaiy to continuously have the most up to-date plant upon these mines. I know that mining directors are veiy loth to order entirely new plants, even although it might be advantageous to do so at intervals of, say, five years. I believe that the Proprietary Company paid £100,000 for its amalgamating plant. I do not know whether the foundry at Bendigo could have manufactured that plant, but it would have been a very good thing if it could. When once a plant has been laid down, the shareholders aud directors are not particularly anxious to substitute a new one for it , .however desirable it may be to adopt that course. If we increase the cost of mining plants by 25 per cent, we shall offer an additional inducement to directors and shareholders to machineiy most up-to-date machinery obtainable. The latest appliances throughout the world are those dealing with low-grade ores, and I venture to affirm .that the backbone of the mining industiy of New South Wales, South Australia, and even of Western Australia is to found in the low-grade ores. During the six months ended the 31st May last, the BrokenH ill mining companies disbursed £1,250,000 in wages and expenses. It will be seen, therefore, that this is an industry which we should be careful not to hamper by unnecessary taxation. I would also point out that it is not BrokenH ill only which has to be considered in this connection. There are 1,250 men employed in the iron flux and smelting works at Port Pirie. If the BrokenH ill Proprietary Mine were to close down to-morrow, those men would be-dismissed the next day. A t Cockle Creek, in New South Wales, 600 men are employed in smelting ore for the sulphide corporation of BrokenH ill . If the Central Mine were to close down these employees would also be dismissed. Then, in connection with these mines there are from 200 to 300 men employed at Dapto, New South Wales, and 350 men at Port Adelaide. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs, when dealing with this question, to think of South Australia, even if he does not think of BrokenH ill , and to recollect tliat there are 1,250 men directly employed by the BrokenH ill mines at Port Pirie, and an additional 350 at Port Adelaide. Thusi t is to think of all the States. 1 bigger one than that of the horse nail industiy. The railway revenue of South Australia represents approximately £1,200,000 annually, of which sum BrokenH ill alone contributes £400,000. During tlie last Christmas season the Barrier mines gave their employee's a week's holiday, the result of which was that the South Australian railway receipts fell off to theextent of £8,000 in that brief period. that fact is not entirely owing to the holidays. that if the mines of BrokenH ill suspend operations for a day or two, the result is felt in South Australia. It would be a very continue operations with old serious matter to that State, indeed, if she instead of securing the could not obtain her £400,000 of railway revenue yearly from BrokenH ill . Last year the railway revenue derived by",30,Letter Carriers Constituency Say Unhesitatingly That The

115,Mr Thomas,"I am merely showingSouth Australia from the carriage of wool was £22,6(53, whilst during the same period the freight on timber alone to BrokenH ill aggregated £28,000. So that really the revenue from the little item of timber alone to BrokenH ill is more important to South Australia than is the railway revenue from the whole of the wool industry of that State. is proposed to put a duty upon it equal to -50 per cent, upon the original cost at Puget -Sound. So far as the South Australian freights are concerneditmustnofcbe forgotten .also that most of the garden produce of South Australia goes to BrokenH ill . I remember that some time ago, when the New South Wales State Parliament passed an Act prohibitingfcheimportation of grapes into New South Wales from any of the other colonies, because of. a disease in some .grapes that were imported, I think, from Victoria, it was proved that in South Australia there was no such disease in the grapes, and we had some very urgent wires from the market gardeners of that State seeking to havefcherestriction removed, becauseif they were unable to supply tlie BrokenH ill market that season it would mean ruin for them in respect to that particular industry. I may add that the New South Wales Government did remove the embargo, and the South Australian grapes came into New South Wales. I do not wish to throw the mining engineer out of work in order to give the miner work. There is no particular advantage in throwing one man out of work in order to-find work for another, but I tell the Minister for Trade and Customs that if the miner is not working the mining engineer cannot be at work. You may have a man working as an engineer in connection with agriculture; he may be making ploughshares or horse-nails, but he cannot be employed in a mine unless the miner is at work. Soi t is not only for the sake of the miner that I desire he should be at work, but also for the sake of the mining engineer, because if the miner is at work the mining engineer must necessarily be at work, workingfcheengines, and, if at nothing else, making repairs. I should like to see them making the engines here if possible, but they must be employed in some way or other if the miner is at work. I , there.fore, ask that the miner may be considered, not merely for his own sake, but that the mining engineer and other people may also find work. I am not pleading for the removal of this duty for the sake of BrokenH ill only, or for the sake of South Australia only, but for the sake of every mining camp in Australia. I plead for it for the sake of the struggling prospecting companies. I believe that to-day from a mineral stand-point we do not really know what the vast resources of Australia are, and we do not wish to penalize the men who go right into the back blocks prospecting, or to penalize those companies who are prepared to run a certain amount of risk in mining development. I do not say that they do so from philanthropic motives ; I quite admit that they do not. penalize them in their efforts to develop any new field, because the advantage that comes to them is our advantage, and the advantage of the community generally. It is really laughable when we hear the talk of fche little industries we have here making umbrellas, or making shirts, and that kind of thing, when really one good mine would give more employment than would all the duties we could possibly put on in order to assist these small industries. To show honourable members how important the matter is I may mention that by this day's post I received a letter from Mr Courtney, the manager of the Central Mine, and who until a month or so ago was president of the Mine Managers' Association afc BrokenH ill . I did not ask for the letter and did not know it was coming, but I am very pleased to have received ifc. Mr Courtney saysI regret tliat I was away from Broken Hill when you were recently here, as I wanted to have a brief conversation with you in reference to"" the utilization of the zinc-blende, which, as you know, we are all over-stocked with ; but which is of no value, as sales cannot be negotiated for any large quantities, the abundance of this ore in various parts of the world tending always to regulate a low price. It therefore becomes advisable to manufacture metallic zinc in Australia, and by fche establishment of this industry not only supply the Australian requirements, but exportfcoother parts of the world rather than ship the ore, the condition of which is not so good as can be obtained by buyers in other countries. We propose, therefore, shortly makiug some test runs on spelter producing, which, if as successful as we anticipate, may develop into an important industry. I need hardly point out, however, that the plant is most costly, and innumerable difficulties must at first be experienced as the whole of the staff and workmen will have to be",31,Letter Carriers Constituency Say Unhesitatingly That The

I challenge him again to enumerate any particular article of machinery which is required in connection with mining, and to show that it cannot be produced at a reasonable price in Australia. If he can do that I will support him. Let us take boilers and macliinery generally. There is in Victoria a large number of iron foundries. The result of some twenty or' 30 years' expenditure of capital, tlie 'training of employees, and the acquirement of special knowledge has been the building up of an industiy of which not only Victoria but the whole of Australia ought to be proud. Instead of a proposal being made, which is calculated to inflict a fatal blow on the industry, it should receive the sympathetic support of every Australian. These foundries, as I have been reminded, employ upwards of 8,000 hands, and certainly ought not to receive a knock on the head, on an occasion such as this, merely to suit a particular cry which has been raised in favour of free-trade. and what will happen ? which is always raised by extreme free traders. Protection has not killed the mining industry in Victoria. That industry has grown up alongside the engineering and metal-working industries here, and this duty will not k ill the industry in Australia generally. Let us take Bendigo-the district which I represent-o r Ballarat, or Castlemaine. In each of those places the mining industiy and iron foundries and engineering works have grown up side by side. There has been no antagonism inconsistency between the two industries. On tbe contrary, the mining companies have enjoyed the convenience of having foundries carrying on operations alongside their mines. When a mining company requires machineiy for a particular purpose it is able to go to the engineering workshops and foundries next door, where the mining managers may supervise the manufacture of the machinery they require. Tlie honourable member admits that it is a convenience to the companies to be able to do that, instead of having to send the plans and specifications as protection is concerned. If the to America, England, or Germany. The establishment of these works has been adistiuct advantage to the mining industry in Victoria, just as it has been an advantage to the agricultural industiy to have agricultural implement makers carrying on their operations in factories not far from the fields. The conjunction of field and factory is a necessary part of our industrial life. We should not have the field in one countiy and the factory in another. The approximation of these two agencies in the great work of production is a great convenience, and in the common interests of progress. I contend that the proximity of the foundries to the mines has resulted also in the invention of machinery for use in the mines. It has resulted in the invention of gold-saving and power appliances, and in appliances generally calculated to promote the interests of the mines. Then, again, we have in the proprietors of these foundries, and the work-people engaged in them, a population growing up with an interest in the mines, and among whom we find, very frequently, call-payers who have helped to maintain the mines. It would be a very poor district indeed which had to depend upon mining alone, and which had no diversity of occupation. It would have a very doubtful future before it . It is desirable, therefore, that every mining district in which there is a population clustered should endeavour to promote the growth of manufactories and other industries in addition to mining, so that, if the latter should fail, there would be other industries to act as a prop and a stay in a time of distress. Since this question has been brought up, I have given my serious attention to it, in order to ascertain how the duty would affect my district and Australia generally. I have sought information in every available quarter, and T have arrived at the conclusion that the protective duties which have ruled in Victoria hitherto have resulted in the firm establishment of manufactories and of manufacturing interests, which have not in any way increasedfcheprice of the articles required by mining companies. I was asked by one body to support a reduction of the duties on mining materials. In reply I invited fche body to specify the articles which were considered to be affected by these protective duties, but I have not received a reply up to the present time. It was not able to specify any",33,Letter Carriers Constituency Say Unhesitatingly That The

Little do they care about the poor miner and the poor farmer, except to trot him out occasionally for the support of their free-trade arguments. On these grounds I strongly object to the proposition for sweeping away these industries. A t the same time if the Minister, yielding to any information which is placed before him, can see his way to place any particular item on the free list, I shall be quite prepared to favourably consider a proposal of that kind. very admirable speech from the honourable member for Barrier, showing how the mining industry is affected by this duty, I was rather surprised to hear the representative of tlie mining district of Bendigo talk as if the miners were not to be considered at all. If there was one thing more clearly shown than another by the honourable member for Barrier, it was not that one individual, but that many thousands of individuals, would be affected by this duty. But we have the honourable ancl learned member for Bendigo, in effect, saying-""You may talk about your thousands of miners; you may talk about your workmen employed here and there, but what is their voice compared with the voice of the iron founder at Bendigo, or the iron founder somewhere else."" We have this sort of thing going on here until one wonders what the rest of the people of Australia are thinking about, that they do not rise up and protest. I am quite sure that so soon as an opportunity is afforded to them, they will rise up and protest. We have honourable members getting up and saying that a large number of men such as the miners are not to be considered at all, in effect that thousands and thousands of men engaged in these industries are' not to be considered, and asking what are they for except to pay taxes. Of course, if these people are going to submit to all this taxation in the interests of one or two manufacturers, there is no more to be said. It is in the power of honourable members to deprive the manufacturers of the opportunity of levying duties upon the men. I suppose there is nothing whicli more fills any man with indignation than does this taxation. In the case of the horse-shoe nails we had the honourable member for Bourke stating that, although there was only one manufacturer of such nails in all Australia, all the rest of tlie people must not be considered ; that simply and solely because a man calls himself a manufacturer he is the only one in Australia to be considered. AVe had a majority of the cpmmittee saying that that was a very sound doctrine to lay down, and that although there was only one manufacturer of horse-shoe nails they ought to support him, and give him an opportunity of levying a tax on the people of Australia, as the} did, although it was shown tliat we 7 could afford to give the man the money a dozen times over, and otherwise employ from 20 to 25 times the number of men that were employed in his factory. Now, the honourable member for Barrier has shown that in one mining district alone some thousands of men are affected by this duty, and that if they are affected, men all over Australia, certainly in New South AA'ales and South Australia, are affected. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo does not consider those men for -a single moment. While he was speaking I did expect to hear from him this argument"" Do you not know that putting a duty on mining machinery puts ore into the ground ? c It enables the miner to discover where the ore is. It enables him to locate a particular portion of it . The miner at Bendigo, by getting a 25 per cent, tax on his machinery, his shafts, his pulleys, and everything else which goes into the mine, is able to discover the amount of gold there is in a particular place; in fact, if it were not there before, it would put it there""because surely that is the only ground on which he can 'defend the extraordinary assertion made by him. AVhilst we are told that the men employed in fche Victorian foundries will be affected if fche duty is abolished, no explanation is given of the fact that the number of men engaged in metal and machinery works in New South Wales is greater than in Victoria. learned member excludes those engaged in smelting, there are less men engaged in fche metal industries in New South Wales than in Victoria. are engaged in smelting, because they are just as dependent uponfchemining industry as are the men employed in foundries.

On the other hand, tlie minei-s have had taxes imposed on them to still further depress their condition, and hurry them into other work so that wages may be forced down. Why is this ? Because they are poor ordinary miners. If a manufacturer a club, the Ministerialists at once doff tlieir hats and bow down to him. They inquire how many men he employs, and on being told that he finds employment for ten men -or , as in the case of the manufacturer of horse-shoe nails, seventeen men-the y say "" Dear me, we must see to that, and at once impose a duty which will allow you to collect £30,000 from the public.""

Because the working man cannot make representations to the Government in the same way as do the manufacturers, that is no reason why they should be utterly ignored. The case made out by the honourable member for has been made to refute his statements. The honourable member for the Barrier has dealt with only the one big mining centre of BrokenH ill ; but other places, such as Kalgoorlie, might be cited. I have no doubt, however, that Western Australian members will deal with this question from their own point of view.

Such a state of affairs can only arise in a new country, aud we must gradually come to the normal conditions existing in other countries. It is impossible that in any one country the rate of wages and the standard of living can remain for any length of time higher than in other countries. WhatI desire to point out particularly is that, while endeavouring to protect one industry, we must guard against injuring another, the injury of which may mean the throwing of thousands of people out of employment, as was instanced in the case of BrokenH ill this afternoon. It must be remembered that those people in such cases are thrown upon the unskilled labour market, which is not protected by any wages board. That seems to me to be the difficulty with which we have to contend. We make special efforts by means of wages 'boards and other systems to protect the skilled trades, but we are making no attempt to do anything for the protection of unskilled labour. The introduction of machinery into the various trades to cheapen production has thrown thousands of skilled .workmen upon the unskilled labour market. That is where the great competition arises, and where we find the lowest wages. bulk of the people are employed. say that the bulk of the people are employed in unskilled and unorganized labour? MrM c DONALD organized, but unskilled labour; and when I speak of the bulk of the people being engaged in unskilled labour, I mean that they have not been brought up to any trade or served an apprenticeship to any trade. I know that in many of what were originally skilled trades the labour is now performed by unskilled workmen. Take, for instance, the highly complicated trade of the compositor. A compositor required to serve an apprenticeship to learn the picking-up of type, while to-day a man without having served any apprenticeship at all, goes to a linotype, and in three or four days can perform the work. to that trade now in Victoria for seven years. I do not even exneed for it . Honourable members will agree with me that any ordinary intelligent lad can pick up the operation of type-setting by the linotype in three or four days. knowledge. ber know anything of it from personal experience ? little technical knowledge of use in some instances, just as one man may shovel mud better than another. But we know that where these linotype machiues are in use, a mechanical engineer is kept to look after them -It would be madness on the part of any firm to allow the mere operator of a linotype machine to attempt to repair it if it got out of order. I do not wish to go into that matter, but I desire to impress upon the committee that the mining industry at the present time wants a good deal of watching. While in some portions of Australia trie mining industry is being largely extended, I notice for instance that Victoria, which once occupied the premier position amongst the Statesi n the matter of the production of gold, is now only third or fourth upon the list. I do not attribute that to protection, but what I wish to show from it is It is there also that tlie that we should be very careful in imposing duties, not to hamper this industry in 'any way. I believe that for many years in Australia the mining industry will be one of the most important in the country, and we should make every effort to lighten the burdens upon people engaged in it . If I did not say unwe allow them to get machinery in free, they will have so much more money to spend upon the development of the mines. It is possible that large mining centres may spring up in different parts of Australia which will give employment to thousands of men. If the machinery required can be produced as cheaply and as well here as in other parts of the world, those interested in mining are not going to be stupid enough to send elsewhere for it .

The Moonta Mines 'Company, South Australia, called for tenders for a winding plant, the contract being open to manufacturers in the old -countiy as well as in the different States of the Commonwealth. The result was that a Queensland firm was successful, notwithstanding that it had to pay a duty of 25 per cent, on the machinery which it sent into South Australia, and also to pay wages on a higher scale than those ruling in the southern States. If chat is not a sufficient argument in favour of allowing mining machinery to come into the Commonwealth free I do not know what is. Sir contract relate to machinery which could be made by only the particular factory in Queensland 1 winding plants in Victoria or in South Australia, where, according to the boasts of certain honourable members, the finest foundry in Australia is to be found ? been imported into Victoria for years. South Australia. The machinery supplied by the Queensland firm was so good that the Moonta Company has repeated the order, and the factory is now making-up, to its order, a plant of the same kind. ber refer to Walker's, of Maryborough 1 too. refer is that in which a boiling-down works, It refers not only to maestablished at Barcaldine, in Central QueensThere is land, distant some 460 miles by rail from the coast, called for tenders for a boiling-down plant. A' Victorian firm, in competition with the Queensland firms, including those of Rockampton, which had only to send the machinery 460 miles by rail, secured, the contract, although it had to forward the plant to Queensland and pay a duty of something like 25 per cent. If that is not another argument in favour pf free-trade in machinery I do not know what is. If themanufacturers in the different States have been able to compete against one another, and send their machinery from one State to another, notwithstanding the border duties, is that not one of the strongest arguments for free-trade tliat could be given 1 I can vouch for every word which the honourable member for Kennedy has said in regard to mines being shut down for the sake of a few pounds. I am sorry to say that I have had an interest in some such mines myself, and I know it is a fact. In one particular instance up north, we required machinery to work a mine, but we had spent so much money on the mine that we would not pay any more, and it was shut down. Some one else came along and erected the necessary machinery, with the result that the mine is paying to-day. If mining machinery had been allowed to come in free at the time no doubt that mine, instead of proving a duffer so far as some of us were concerned, would at the mine owing to the duty on mining machinery 1.",41,Letter Carriers Constituency Say Unhesitatingly That The

But the fact that there is a duty on agricultural machinery affords no reason for imposing a duty upon mining machinery. The duty upon mining machinery falls upon those engaged in one of our primary industries. Everything that the miner eats, wears, and uses is taxed. The very rope employed to haul the ore from the bowels of the earth is taxed. It may be said that a duty upon mining machinery will not fall directly upon the miners; but if it does not affect, them directly it affects them indirectly. A t BrokenH ill as soon as the price of lead and silver went down miners wages were reduced. The miners, however, cannot be protected as other workers are protected in Victoria by the operation of wages boards.

The natural result of things would be to make Queensland white, but Victoria will never be white, because she has a system of permits which enables aliens to return here, and she is breeding aliens here. In Little Bourke-street there is a bigger canker spot than the black labour in Queensland. Every industry in Victoria employing two men and a boy must be protected, but Victorians are not so ready to.protect the industries of other States. Every Victorian whom I have heard speak in this chamber is a protectionist for sentimental, not for economic reasons. The lord high priest of protection, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, is a protectionist for sentimental reasons. admit that the honourable member foe When I referred to the iron foundries he could* not refrain from interjecting about the non-employment of women, and if it is not tlie ladies with him it is the poor downtrodden factory hands. The Victorian system of protection requires the passing of special Acts to protect the workers. workers from protection. from protection! The Victorian protectionist would like to see all Victorian industries pro-, tected, but he is amost ardent free-trad er in regard to things that he has to consumehimselL When the timber merchants of. Queensland were down here it was very funny indeed to observe their movements. In Queensland they are rabid protectionists, and I am very pleased that they are to get a dose of their own physic. They looked upon the Victorian protectionists as brothers in arms, but what are they to get from them ? They know what they will get when the timber duties are reached. Timber is the raw material of our butter boxes, and on top of a duty on timber we have a duty on mining machinery. The Tariff is stifling one of the principal industries of Queensland, and that is mining. There are no gold mines in my electorate. The miners there are opal miners, and as they use the old windlass,' their machinery is taxed. Everything they use is taxed; even the oil Cruras they use for bucketing up the stuff are taxed. A l though this paragraph is not quite the smallest in the Tariff, I think it includes more items than does any other. I should like to know from the honourable member for. Barrier if he really means to admit free the whole of the items in the paragraph. , I think he is anxious to get only mining machinery admitted free. I am with the honourable member for Newcastle to this extent,, that if we cannot get mining machinery admitted free I should like to .see the 25 per cent, duty kept on. I should like tbe Minister to tell us whether he is going to make any difference, or whether he intends to stick to the cast-iron 25 per cent, duty all through., There is only one course open to me.

225,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"IBarrier might have undertaken some classification before he moved his amendment, but I would point out that the Government have not attempted to classify the items under this heading as they should have been if they were to be dealt with in any intelligible manner. How can such terribly inclusive letters as ""n.e.i."" be expected to operate with judgment *or discretion ' in respect of items covering such a range of trades and businesses as the manufactures of metal ? There ought to have been. some more enlightened attempt at classification of the items by the Ministry. Failing such attempt on their part, we can hardly expect an honourable member' to undertake the task. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Barrier felt that, as mining machinery might include items which are equally useful in other industries, from the way in which the items had been grouped in the Tariff"", his only course was to propose the removal of the duty from all tlie items. I was rather astonished at some remarks that fell from the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. He, quite unnecessarily I think, introduced the old fiscal argument, but whilst I cannot compliment him on his argument, I must compliment him on his splendid audacity. I would not for a moment impugn his acuteness by saying that he did not see the contradictoriness of his own facts, but, in spite of that contradictoriness, he brought forward figures as to the wages in protectionist countries in* support of his argument that primarily protection was for the assistance of the labourer, and not of the manufacturer. supported protection in the interest of the labourer here, and not of the capitalist. that, he said that if he did not think that protection primarily assisted the worker he would not support it . I am not objecting to that statement. WhatI am objecting to are the illustrations brought forward in support of it . The honourable and learned member gave the wages of boiler-makers in five or six countries, and he said that that the workers of Australia had to compete. Every one of the countries in which the wages were below those in Great Britain, a free-trade country, was a protectionist country. There was one protectionist country above Great Britain, and tliat \vas the United States of 25 M 2 America. In making the comparison with England he omitted to allow for the longer hours worked per day by the American worker, for the wages he gave were per day. The American boiler-maker works ten hours. Even if the wages that have to be competed against be as low as those of Italy or Germany, as regards boilers, there is a natural protection that overcomes all that difference. Yet the honourable and learned member, whose astuteness I would not for a moment question, coolly put these figures and facts before the committee as an argument in favour of protection. He intimated that a cargo of boilers might arrive if this duty were not put on, but such a cargo is a thing I have never heard of. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports questions the correctness of the statements made by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa regarding the number of hands employed in the iron trade in New South Wales as compared with Victoria. According to the returns furnished by Coghlan, if we take the iron trades as including iron works, en-' gineering works and foundries, and railway carriage and rolling-stock manufacture and repairing works-and you cannot separate the iron work in the railway shops, which is veiy considerable, from other work, because the figures are not given separately-w e find that 6,800 hands are employed in New South Wales as against 6,500 in Victoria. Abandoning that basis, however, and adopting another, we find that by taking the engineering and boilermaking, brass and copper and dock operatives in New South Wales, and comparing their numbers with the brass and copper workers, engine and machinery and iron industry employees of Victoria, as detailed in the return laid upon the table of the House, there are 5,528 hands employed in Victoria, as compared with 5,166 in New South Wales. different result. which I obtained my figures is that furnished by'the Ministry and laid before the it was against those wages House. which I ' have relied. Compare those engaged in engineering works in New South Wales with those employed in Victoria, and see what the result is. fair, because the engineering workers are'",44,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

Mort's Dock and Engineering Works is one of the largest in the Commonwealth, and the men who are emploj'ed on ships should not be excluded from consideration, because nearly all. ships are now constructed of iron. If the policy of the honourable member for Port Melbourne excludes ships and encourages the people who make what the ships carry, is he to get the credit for the labour employed in the making of the articles whilst -his opponent is not to be credited with the labour employed in repairing the ships which bring them ? compared with like. bei wants a comparison that will suit his own view. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo Stated that the Australian ironworks could supply machinery as cheaply as it could be imported. If that statement is correct why do the local manufacturers need protection ? veying machinery and boilers from England to Melbourne and from Melbourne to Bendigo is a sufficient steadier for the Bendigo market. from England to Australia as cheaply as from Sydney to Fremantle. veyed from England to Bendigo as cheaply as plates manufactured in England can be made into boilers in Bendigo. The honourable member stated that the Bendigo works could make machineiy as cheaply as the English manufacturers, and if they can, they should not need protection. The aspect from which the honourable and learned member views this matter is shown when he states that the mining industry grows up beside tlie iron works. iron _ works which grow up beside the mining industry. The whole tendency of those who support the protectionist policy is to place the secondary industry in the more important position, although it could not exist without the primary industry. I would ask whether this duty is proposed for revenue or protectionist purposes. Those honourable members who have spoken in its support have advocated it as a protective duty, although it covers a large class of articles, and it can only be protective in regard to those articles which can be produced here. This protection gives to the manufacturer the power of levying duties which the Custom-house ought to collect. The duty cannot be protective in regard to that large class of articles which are patented-whic h can only be produced by plants out of all keeping with the requirements of Australia., and involving the use of patented machines. All this numerous class of articles will have to pay a heavy duty in order to gain admission to Australia. of articles does the honourable member refer ? the honourable member, and I cannot be expected to go through a list which would be yards long for his enlightenment. There are such articles as I'have referred to, and many of them, and if duty is charged upon them it will add to the cost of conducting certain industries. Now, does this seem reasonable ? It is proposed to protect certain industries, and to encourage new manufactures, and in order that these industries may be kept abreast of the times, and production may be cheapened so as to allow of competition with the world all the newest processes will have to be adopted, and the best appliances employed. Yet the first thing that is done when an attempt is made to bring new industries into existence or to extend their usefulness is to impose a tax of 25 per cent, upon the machinery required. Under all the circumstances, I think it would be infinitely better to abolish the duty than to retain it in its present form.

MrO ' MALLEY rise to point out the difficulties which inexperienced members, and those not expert on the Tariff"" question, have in ascertaining really what is covered by this item. The item may be described as covering a multitude of sins of the Tariff"". To my surprise, I find that the item covers a lot of fencing material in the shape of .standards, which hitherto, in some of the States at any rate, have been admitted free, and which are an actual necessity in places where timber is veiy scarce. In South Australia these standards and their fixings are largely used on all pastoral runs, and will be more extensively used in the future than iu the past, because of sub-divisions and the necessity for vermin-proof fencing. And yet, under""n.e.i.,"" this fencing material will pay a duty of 25 per cent. On the northern system of the South Australian railways the large bulk of the fencing material for the support of the wires is formed of this veiy material, and I would ask the Minister whether he cannot see his, way to admit it free. The standard to which I particularly refer is a patent, which I hope the honourable iu any case will have to be imported, so that there is no question of any local industiy. Reason must govern the to prevent the honourable member subsequently moving that this material be placed on the list of exemptions. to be a veiy considerable reduction in the proposed chity on mining machineiy. In South Australia, and at BrokenH ill and various other places, too much of the necessary raw material cannot be placed on the free list. I admit that this is a big item, having regard to the whole list. That, however, is more the fault of the Ministry, because it is not fail to honourable members to submit a proposition of this kind, which covers, perhaps, hundreds of lines under ""n.e.i."" Honourable members, who would probably be prepared to support a duty on a number of the items for revenue purposes, are forced into the position of voting against the whole, which represents some £80,000 of supposed revenue. much is represented. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo suggested that honourable members should discriminate as to the lines they want on the free list, V e i y well. and I 'have instanced fencing material as showing the difficulty of knowing what is really covered. In connection with mining machinery, improvements are taking place every day, and a new invention may in a very short time put a machine out ofdate in the work of development.",46,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

251,Mr Poynton,"A t any rate that I think it was the honourable member for the Barrier who referred to the fact that some machineiy which was imported for the BrokenH ill mines about a month prior to the introduction of the Tariff-machinei y which was not obtainable in any part of Australia-woul d have to pay £2,500 in duty under the special circumstances which exist to-day. I i we had a schedule of the-various kinds ""of machinery covered by this item, we should be in a much better position to deal with it . I u this connection, I would ask. tlie Minister for Trade and Customsi f it is not possible to f uriiish honourable members with a detailed list of the lines thus included, so that we may know exactly upon what articles this duty is to be imposed. I am satisfied that the item must cover over 100 different lines which are dutiable at 25 per cent, and I am convinced that a number of honourable members opposite would not be prepared to vote for the imposition of such .a heavy rate if they knew exactly the articles upon which it was to be levied. I hope that the Minister, if he will not -consent to the inclusion of mining machineiy in the free list, will agree to a substantial reduction of the duty proposed. If any State in the group has been benefited by the mining industiy, it is South Australia, .which has been rescued from an apparently hopeless position on three or four occasions by this great industry. the mines were within its own bounds. Mi-. POYNTON -Exactly. I might, for instance, refer to Moonta and Kapunda. South Australia has also derived great benefit from tlie BrokenH ill trade. There are millions of tons of low-grade ore in BrokenH ill which can be treated by up-to the manufactuners. We have seen from date machineiy with a small margin of profit, but for a considerable time, at any rate, that machinery must be imported from abroad, probably from America, where the manufacture of mining machinery has reached a very advanced stage. I cannot understand the terrible dread which some honourable members entertain that our local foundries will be closed, especially when we come to consider that the wages paid to the operatives in such America are in some instances higher than those which obtain in Australia, and that an enormous natural protection is represented by the freightage on foreign importations. The exceedingly heavy rates charged upon our railways for the carriage of machinery to mining.fields, and the costly nature of its transit, where no railways exist-representin g in some cases as much as £ 3 0 and £ 4 0 per ton constitute a tremendous tax in themselves. Anything, therefore that we can possibly do to encourage the mining industiy in Australia we ought cheerfully to undertake. There is an extensive tract of countiy in the Commonwealth which would be valueless were' it not for its mineral deposits. I agree that mining upon this continent is merely in its infancy. I believe that in many parts of Australia the opening up in the future of a single mine will provide an amount of employment equal to that which is at present furnished by half tlie factories in Victoria, despite all the artificial en-"" couragement which the. latter have received. No industry gives a greater fillip to other industries than d.oes that of mining. It has a special claim upon this House, because of the enormous cost invol-vedoin tlie opening up of mining .fields. The honourable and learned member foi' Bendigo has said that the foreign trader does not help the mines, but I have yet to learn that the manufacturer is any more of a philanthropist than is the importer: The manufacturer does uot put one cent into anything from philanthropic motives. He invests his money for the purpose of deriving some material benefit, exactly as the importer does. I venture to say that if we could get the share list of the mines throughout Australia, we should find that a very large number of importers contribute quite as much to the call-paying roll as do the returns which have been quoted to-day that the BrokenH ill mines are almost upon the verge of closing down. I wish also to point out the different attitude taken up by protectionists in regard to their own pet industries. If honourable members look at the list of proposed amendments upon their files, they will see that the demand is tliat every line of raw material required for the manufacturer shall be placed upon establishments in tlie free list. When we look down the schedule, it is evident that protectionists have no confidence in any man who"", is manufacturingmachinery in Australia of the particular class they want; because eveiy line of such machinery is on",47,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

The moment we put it .to them that the made-up ai'ticle of the primary producer is the manufactured article of the secondary producer or manufacturer, they .say"" We can make those in Australia."" Buti t is a singular fact, which that list will show, that there is hardly an implement or tool of trade used in their industries which they do not want to have on the free list. They care not a rap about an industry alongside of them. If that industry is struggling to turn out the very class of manufactured article which they require in connection with their own industry, they say"" We want this on the free list,"" or they say that there is not a sufficient number of those articles used in the country to warrant the establishment of an industry for their manufacture. AVe have found the same thing in connection with deputations waiting upon Ministers to get certain lines of goods on the free list. I say the whole thing is wrapped up in. selfishness. All> kinds of articles which they require in connection with tlieir manufactures they want on the free list, and in addition they want to have the raw material they use also placed on the free list. I say at least let us have a few things, which mean life and death to the mining centres, on the free list, and if they are not to be placed on the free list do not put a duty of 25 per cent, on them, which really means over 100 per cent, when we come to consider the natural protection they have in the cost of bringing them here. Imagine a duty of 25 per cent, on boilers. An honourable member said we might bring out a cargo of boilers. Imagine a cargo of boilers coming out, and what would the freight on it be? Taking machinery as a whole, it will be found that, with the exception of furniture and bulky articles, there is no line of goods on which freight is higher. freight on mining machinery is reckoned in the same way, and there is a sufficiently heavy tax upon mining machineiy-whic h ma)' be required to develop resources a thousand miles from the sea-board-in the cost of bringing it from the sea-board. The least we can do is to put a moderate duty upon such machineiy, and there Cannot be two minds amongst honourable members that wherever it is possible we should put on the free list every line which is going to be of advantage in the production of minerals. able member for South Australia has made they will provide work for our own people; a comparison between the manufacturer and the importer. He says that one is as much a philanthropist as the other. Possibly, they both act from motives of self-interest and, so far as that goes, tlieir starting ground is the same. But the effect of the two classes upon the country is very different indeed. The importer buys in a foreign land, and covers his risk by insurance. He has always, either at sea or on shore, 20s. in the pound, less wear and tear perhaps. He has always that in hand, and is in a comparatively safe position. As a rule he can get the cost value for the article he imports when he cannot get his profit upon it. But in the case of the manufacturer in a new countiy, such as this, starting a new industry, he is in an entirely different position. He has to put up his buildings, secure his plant, get his workmen, and provide them with their weekly wages; . then he has to purchase the raw material for his manufacture. When all that is done, he has to search out and compete for his market. So far as regards benefit to the country, there can be no comparison whatever between the importer and the manufacturer. To say that if we were a' nation entirely of importers, it would be the same as if we were producing all we require for ourselves is simply arrant nonsense. ' could not import, surely ? thereforethe more we encourage production the more we shall be able to import by removing taxation upon it. production by giving the work to our own' people, and by increasing the wages fund of the country we shall have more On our railways the money to spend on things we cannot produce ourselves. The honourable member for South Australia says that we desire to havo on the free list every tool of trade used i u connection with our manufactures. I challenge that statement. It is not correct. What we desire to have admitted free are special or patented articles that are not made here, or articles one or two of which only are required to supply the wants of the whole country.

It has been said during this debate that wire rope used for mining purposes is dutiable under this Tariff. As a matter of fact it is not. are used by the poor miners, are dutiable. patent machinery s'hould come in free, provided that care is taken to discriminate between such machines when they are passing through the Customs. Where a new patent is introduced, either in mining or agricultural machinery, there should be no bar to its entry into the countiy, so that our mechanics may learn to copy it and the public be benefited. But a machine that has simply a small patent attached to it should not be allowed to come in free. We know that the country which has been pointed to so frequently during this debate -America-ha s long been the home of patentmachinery, and that the greatest improvements in machinery are made there. We know that the invention and construction of machinery there have been stimulated by the establishment of workshops all over the country, and by the freedom of the patent laws. By reason of these facilities young men have been enabled to use their brains, and they have been encouraged especially by means of direct rewards. In that way, and by the imposition of protective duties, the manufacture of machineiy has increased there until its completeness has become the wonder of the world. If we are not to follow on the same lines, how are we going to stimulate our people to invent and to construct the machineiy required in all our productions ? What we have done already in this direction may be seen in our agricultural implements. The manufacture of agricultural machineiy here has been stimulated, and our manufacturers have been encouraged, with the result that we have harvesting machineiy superior to any to be found. That would not have been possible but for our workshops. W it h regard to this duty, I am sorry, as the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, has said, that we have not a schedule of the machines in this item, even if it were only a rough one, because it is most difficult to discriminate between them. There are a number of articles in the item which should come in free. On others there should be a duty of 25 per cent., but I think that a great many should come in at 15 per cent. I do not agree with the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, that a sweeping reduction should be made all round, but I think we ought to have a schedule so that we may impose a duty which will be ""fair. I would ask honourable members to consider that we must have a compromise Tariff. We find that in the various States the duties on the articles under this heading have run from 30 per cent, down to the free list. We do not wish to be discussing this Tariff for ever. I presume we want to get away, and I would say, therefore, that as we have adopted certain lines in other cases -we should go upon them again, and by means of fair compromise come to a speedy conclusion of this debate. I wouldask the Minister to say whether he cannot differentiate between a number of articles included in this item, so that we may be able to put a fair duty on those that require a duty, and allow a large number of articles to come in free which should be free. committee generally will consider that tlie item before us is one of considerable importance, and that there is no waste of time involved' in the discussion which has taken place, or may take place, upon it. The matter was put from both sides veiy vividly at the beginning of the debate by the honourable member who moved the omission of these duties, and by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo who took up the opposite position, and seemed to be perfectly convinced of the accuracy of his views.

MrA . McLEAN -The right honourable member ought to come over here. the views of my honourable friends on the other side. These are not my views. I wish my honourable friends, who speak so eloquently and earnestly, to give some assurance of the faith which is in them in moulding this Tariff, because a policy which will do all the things which have been urged in favour of this dut\'' of 25 per cent, on mining machinery, is one which should be pushed to the point of prohibition for the benefit and protection of the people all round. found that there are not so many grievous If my belief were the same as that of honourable members opposite, I think I should stand a little more strongly by such a grand national policy. Itniust be a source of deep regret to some honourable members that the Tariff is being steadily improved in accordance with the views of His Majesty's Opposition, if it be possible to improve a thing of this kind. Improvement is very difficult because, of course, we are working upon opposite lines. brought in a tolerably sound protective Tariff. Putting the Maitland speech aside, the Tariff is a very cleverly constructed protective Tariff, and conve)'S the appearance at certain points of an anxiety for the public .revenue. But instead of standing up for the Tariff as introduced, a number of honourable members opposite have helped as to make great alterations. From a selfish point of view, the more incomplete, defective, unjust, and irritating the Tariff as finally settled may be, the better it will be for those who opposed it. But, of course, we have no right to put such contemptible considerations before our duty to the public. We, on this side, who consider that the Tariff has been moulded upon absolutely wrong principles, have a very difficult task in endeavouring to alter it: but it must be understood that ' we in no sense recognise the Tariff when altered as being founded upon sound principles. It is impossible to create a hybrid production such as this Tariff will be without having a number of striking anomalies and hardships which will make it a source of oppression and hardship, and something which must be radically altered at the earliest opportunity possible. A t the same time it is clearly the duty of the members of the Opposition, if we cannot get our own way entirely, to strive to bring the rates imposed on every important item down as nearly as possible towards a point I am trying to represent at which we could consider them fair. My line of action here will be thisI shall endeavour to carry out my views in their entirety, and, if that is impossible, I shall try to give as much effect to them as I can by voting for the reduction of duties which I cannot get rid of altogether. But under no circumstances will the Opposition consider themselves responsible for this Tariff. If we clear awa}' some of the misunderstandings which have arisen, it will be gaps between free-traders and protectionists as some jieople think, though there are many. For instance, we free-traders have no sort of animosity against manufacturing industries, or against any policy which will tend to develop in the country as many industries as possible. In no sense-do we desire to retard the development of inventive skill or of the higher forms of industry. But we think that' it The Government is extremely difficult to act fairly by all in endeavouring to legislate in favour of any particular class or of any particular industry. If this policy could work all round, its absurdity would become more obvious. It is not reduced to an utter absurdity, because it is not pressed to it fullest extent.

270,Mr Reid,"I s it not time that wetraction-engine, or hay knife, or reaper, he inflicted on Australia 'i Then the honourable member for Wimmera goes further. He insists that seed drills, plough and trace chains, and typea curious mixture-shal l be placed on the free list. Surely the marvellous industrial development which can solve the difficulties of constructing mining machinery, is equal to the construction of seed drills, or plough chains, or type! The young and amiable member for Darling Downs wants a number of agricultural implements and machines to be placed on the free list, and he names them as follows:Acme harrows, cane shavers, cane shredders, circular coulters, cultivators, dairy refrigerators, drill wheel hoe cultivator, fertilizer and drill comcases not so much by their own initiative bined, grain mills, hushers aud shelters, horse rakes, milking machine, mowers, potato raisers, root cutters, scufflers, steam ploughs, sulky ploughs, straw stackers, threshers, tractionengines. The honourable and learned member considers that these are things beyond the industrial skill of Australia, beyond . the circle within which people can get things so cheap and so good. In one breath, certain honourable members say that the importer is a hated, unscrupulous person, but in the next breath they say that he is philanthropic enough to pay the whole of the duty. It is rather a puzzling sort of picture which at one time represents the importer as that widely benevolent individual who pays the duties on goods importeu, and does not pass them on to the customer, and in another depicts him as the most selfish of his class. These attacks upon classes of men engaged in different industries are entirely unworthy of us. have got occasionally into the trick of using the term "" manufacturer "" in the way of reproach. We are not quite perfect yet, and one proof of it is that we occasionally speak of manufacturers as if they were to be singled out from the other classes of the community for reprobation. called them robbers! trade, I cannot say that we have not. A t this time of day, on both sides, we might try to avoid these attacks on different classes, whether manufacturers or importers. If the country think it well to impose protective duties, we have no right to complain of any man of capital and enterprise putting his money into the industries which it invites him to establish. For even broader reasons we have no light to look on a man who is engaged in commerce as if he were to be singled out by some moral obliquity from the rest of his species. He has a useful office to fill, too, and probably he is quite as respectable and just as is any other class in the community. We shall get rid of a number of embarrassing personalties if we t r y to look at the question quite away from the individuals who may happen to be engaged in these respective industries. But that is not all, sir. I have before me what the Government have already done, perhaps in some as from the force of some division. Government in any unfair position, but I take up the item which is before the committee. The honourable member for Barrier proposes that engines, boilers, pumps, machines, and machinery n.e.i., also screws n.e.i., axles, springs, and plated and mixed metal-ware, including plated cutlery, shall be placed on the free list. What an extraordinary assortment of articles is contained in this item. Surely the skill of my distinguised friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs, should have been equal to placing plated cutlery somewhere away from engines and boilers, but I suppose the magic .letters, n.e.i., are responsible for a number of these ill-assorted families. It is admitted that tlie mines, upon which the bread of thousands of families depend to-day, are in a position of great trial and difficult}', and that within a short period thousands of men engaged in the mining industry in one part of Australia have had to leave work, owing to the low price ""of their products in the markets of the world. This is the fact which the honourable member for Barrier has brought before us. Without being offensive to anyone, I say.that the largeness and tenderness of heart which made my Victorian friends gather as one phalanx round the two or three men and boys who are making horse-shoe nails in Melbourne, and around those who are making starch and blue and a hundred other things in Melbourne, should be shown on behalf of some of the people who do not live in Melbourne.

276,Mr Reid,"I do not wish to put thefor some sort of kindness towards tlie embarrassed mining industry, I am speaking not only for my own colony, but for South Australia, the prosperity of which I think the Minister for Trade and Customs will admit is affected in a most substantial way by the continuance of the mining industry at BrokenH ill . Thus we see that we are speaking on a broader basis in dealing with this particular set of mines than in connection with some other matters to which 1 have referred. Now, what does this mean ? It is said that this is a proper duty-thi s 25 per cent, duty, which is 10 per cent, more than the rate imposed upon agricultural machinery, and that in itself is a monstrous distinction. It is said that this 25 per cent, duty is necessary for the benefit of the miners at BrokenH ill . Was not a duty on machinery necessary for the benefit of those who have embarked their capital in woollen manufactures and in the various trades connected with clothing ? I find that even the small tools used in the hat factories, and shirt factories, and slop factories are all on the free list. Surely the giant development of industrial skill and enterprise, to which allusion has been made, hasovertaken the problem of making machines and tools of the description to which I am about to refer. I find that five engines, for instance, are on the free list. Is there any marvellous patent or mystery involved in the making or construction of a fire engine ? Is not that one of the engines which these great Victorian manufacturers could make ? I should think so. Why should fire engines be placed on tlie free list ? Were they not placed there so that those who were engaged in the laudable task of keeping down fires might be enabled to get their fire engines at a cheaper price? Por what other purpose would our friends put fire engines on the free list? Out of the thousand engines used in the various industries of Australia, why should this particular engine be placed upon the free list? Wasi t in orier to make it dearer and to allow the foreign manufacturer to supply us with rotten engines, that would not last? Was the competition thrown open to the whole world, so that we should be able to obtain an inferior article ? There is a certain amount of inconsistency about this. Why did not .my honourable and learned friend, who does not wish to see property given to the flames in Victoria, insist that the placing of fire engines on the free list would expose us to the foreign shoddy that is sent to us from abroad? AVhy should not the giant arm of Victorian enterprise embrace fire engines as well as other engines ? \\ hy should fire engines be taken T out of the clutch, of the Victorian manufacturer ? AVe must assume, with the present administration in power, that they were placed on the free list with a very good object. Now, coming a little lower down, we find machinery for scouring, washing, carding, spinning, weaving, and finishing the manufacture of fibrous materials placed on the free list. Surely the industry for the manufacture of woollen goods, which has the advantage of a protective duty, might be left within the sphere of the taxed machinery ? If men who have to sell their lead in Europe and London at ruination prices, in competition with the coloured labour of the world, are left out in the cold; or if it is unfair to them to ""leave them out in the cold, why are some honourable members so industrious, and so particular, and so precise, as to add to the protection given to other industries the benefits of free trade in machinery at the same time ? What greater degree of free-trade could there be than free-trade in the machinery necessary for making woollen goods? If a duty on machinery,is good enough for the struggling miners throughout Australia, is it not good enough for the woollen companies of Ballarat and Melbourne f These are things regarding which we should like some explanation. Then, whilst linotypes and machines of that sort are open to special observations as highly complicated and patented articles, printing machines and presses are also on the free list. Sewing machine heads, stitching machines, and typewriters are also on the free list. Now we come to something else. to the item under discussion. dealing with a complicated matter of this sort, would derive some light from the way in which other articles, falling under another heading, are dealt with. In the country I come from a certain amount of respect was paid to that method of treatment. Now we come to a much lower grade of articles than the complex mining machinery which is used for dealing with the treasures of the earth.

Is not this adding a little grease to the pig-to These are considerations' which do not occur to gentlemen . whose eyes for so many years have been steadily fixed on the industries of Melbourne. tralian Parliament, and we are dealing with a system of taxation that will affect every mining field in Australia. do something for the miners after the fashion of what we have done for the benefit of the slopmakers and. the bootmakers, who are all worthy men, following worthy industries. AllI say is that if the industries which have been, given duties have the benefit of machines and tools on the free list, then those who get no benefit from protective duties ought to have the same privilege. If it is not to the benefit of should be given them, we had better puc c all these tools and machines back on the dutiable list, in order to be consistent. ThenI see that amongst tlie special exemptions is copper in bars, sheets, pipes, and so on. Well, we have copper in the Commonwealth, which has to be sold in competition in the markets of the whole world, and we have tin, which is subject to the same conditions. We have lead, which comes from the very mines which are in the difficult position that has been indicated. three raw materials is on the free list; there is no protection for the Australian copper miner, tin miner, or lead miner. Lead was subject to a duty of £2 per ton, but by some marvellous piece of' consideration tliat little shred of benefit, if there be any benefit, was taken away. consistency is there in the work we are doing at the present time t If there is a principle involved in doing nothing for miners in the way of putting, mining machines on the free list, ought we not'for tlie same reason to put other machines, on the dutiable list ? But, of course, one feels discouraged by the fact Mr Meid. no matter what one says-and I make this remark in all fairness-man y of my honourable friends are in such a position, from their public principles and statementsto the electors, that one cannot expect them to go as far as we go. I quite admit that men must be consistent with their pubiicprinciples and professions to the electors, and, therefore, I cannot fairly ask a protectionist, or I suppose I cannot-Mr O'MALLEY -Mak e the duty 15 per cent. the whole of this machinery on the free list. I admit that a protectionist member may fairly say"" I-came in as a protectionist, But this is an Ausand cannot vote for admitting these goods-free ; 1 may, in view of' the whole of the circumstances we are dealing with We must try to now,, go down to a 10 per cent, or 15 percent, duty, but I cannot vote for a free list."" I do not wish or expect any man to act dishonourably by the electors, and I have a feeling that, as the House is constituted, there is a fair majority of gentlemen in the chamber whose pledges-' prevent their doing what we ask. But still honourable members will see tliat although that is so, Ave, from our point of view, have to do our duty to our electorsindustries that this treatment before whom we expressed different prin-' ciples. I do not want to take up an unfair amount of time in dealing with this matter, unless there is any attempt to drive ; and if there is any such attempt, we know what the results are. I would much rather that our time should always be devoted to aprofitable discussion of the items, and, therefore, I shall curtail my remarks to a great extent on the present occasion, feeling that so far as generalities are concerned they have been sufficiently dealt with. But Each one of these before I sit down, I may be pardoned if I make' one or two further observations. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo seems to think that the whole matter is settled, when he states that there is a certain number of men at Bendigo earning certain wages. Every intelligent free-trader admits, What sort of that this is only a matter of money. We can produce in any countiy any conceivable article at once if we have money enough to do so, and are willing to spend that money. The expression is often used, on both sidesof tlie House, though not so much on the opposition as the Government side-"" I am iu favour of protecting anything that can that be produced in the country."" It is a loose",55,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us
279,The Fatted Calf. Mr Reid,"I am speaking of puttingexpression, and tlie more accurate sense, and probably the sense in -which it is generally intended is"" Anything which can be profitably produced."" 'The introduction of that one word "" profitably"" throws a flood of light on the whole question. The moment we come to the question of profitable labour, we see the distinctiona most valuable and vital distinction-betwee n finding work for men to do which is a loss to the community, and finding work which is a profit to the community. I suppose there is more labour involved in attempting to climb a greasy pole than in any honest, profitable occupation. Wouldi t follow, if we set the whole of the working men of Victoria attempting to climb a greasy pole for eight hours a day at 10s -and they would fully earn it-that that industry was in a flourishing condition in this State? Protectionists have only solved half the industrial question when they point to any particular development of an industry. There is another questiondid that development of industry cost the people more than a development in another direction ? Isi t not at least possible that the energies of a whole community who are left alone to develop the broad, obvious, natural wealth of the country, may produce a greater degree of abundance and prosperity than the energies of men who have tasks set them by Acts of Parliament ? Do not let any one think that, because we are free-traders, we believe in idleness, or do not believe in Australian industry. Instead of taking up the time of the committee with long lists of details, it ought to be seen that there is the one simple fact standing out. According to protectionists, if there ate two countries in the world which should be going downhill, or which should be buffeted about at the mercy of all the other countries, those two are Great Britain and New South Wales. Great Britain has stood a good deal of buffeting amongst the nations of the world, and is at the head of them all to-day. As for New South Wales, as she stood two years ago, without this elaborate system of throwing a mesh of taxation over the industrial community, so she stands to-day with as many men employed in her factories as are employed in tlie factories of Victoria. When my honourable friend spoke of the mines springing up beside the factories he rather reversed the operations under which nations grow. If there is one truth obvious in the history of the development of all countries, it is that at first the pastoral industry and then the agricultural industry springs into existence, and when these have established themselves, villages and towns grow of themselves. When men tell me that if Australia does not impose these heavy duties she will never have manufacturingindustries, they speak in a way which strikes meas being a trifle extravagant; Why with the very growth of a town a number of industries must spring up. If we were all afflicted with a mania to buy everything we require in England, we should still have to depend upon Australian iadus tries for a number of things in our daily work and wants. Out of that nucleus of absolute necessity, and without any fostering or artificial stimulus, as the country grows tlie riper forms of industry, will begin to develop. That was the process in a sister State, where the wages are at least as high as they are in Victoria, and where the comforts of life are indulged in at least as freely. There were two processes going on. Those processes have now been arrested, so that we are denied a chance of seeing any further phase in the development of these interestingproblems. I ' de-: sire to be understood as taking so strong a stand in connection with this matter, because I honestly believe that the policy which I am advocating is the best for all our industries. Buti f we depart from the broad path which deals with matters of first principles, and if we listen to the voice of humanity and tenderness and consideration, then I say that, out of the hearts which can open so freely to the artisans of Melbournej we want some little gush of sympathy for the pioneers of Australia. Minister for Trade and Customs.)I must congratulate the right honourable member upon having spoken for a considerable time in regard to the item before the Chair, and upon having said very little about it. A t least, he accomplished, the feat of sitting down without telling tlie committee what he intended to do. He told us that he did not intend to. do this, that, and the other, without giving, us the slightest idea as to what he did intend.

280,"Mr Kingston (South Australia,","observations which he was bound to fire off at the earliest opportunity. Now that he has got rid of them. I hope that he will respect parliamentary procedure and practice, and not occupy valuable time with irrelevant matter. I was delighted more particularly by the indignant way in which he repudiated the suggestion of one of his lieutenants, that at no time had the charge of robbery been levelled against manufacturers. I felt sure tliat his regard for fact would induce that refutation, which I was delighted to hear. I take this opportunity of saying that I hope I have never used any words which reflected unfairly upon importers. HadI done so, I should have been very sorry, but I feel that my conduct in the past in this respect has been so irreprdchable that no stigma can possibly attach to me. The importer and the manufacturer are both out for business. Both are made of the same clay. They want to make money, and that is the reason they embark in trade. We have no right to institute comparisons to the disadvantage of one, Or to the particular advantage of the other. But I do say-and 1 hold this view most strongly-that the operations of the manufacturer are far and away more to the advantage of the State in which he condusts his business than are those of the importer. much. the country too much. What we know is that in the case of the employer there is capital available for the purchase of the goods. The goods come out here. They may be, as stated by the chief lieutenant of the Opposition, ""the sweepings of the world."" They are got as cheap as cheap can be. Not one penny of their cost goes in tlie employment of a single Australian hand. They come here and are sold under circumstances in which they compete very harshly with the products of the Australian manufacturer, who spends his capital in the employment of men, and who has to pay higher wages. In the one case all the money goes out of the country, whilst in tlie other it is spent locally in the employment of men, whose wages find their way into other channels, so that it is not only of direct advantage to themselves but to others dependent upon them, and is, indeed, for the good of all. What does the manufacturer do ? He builds or rents his factory-eithe r are equally good for the land-holder-spend s his money in the employment of men and the purchase of machinery which may be ""locally produced, which is a most distinct gain to all in the State. But I feel that I am likely to imitate the example of the leader of the Opposition, by indulging in a general discussion when I have not the same excuse for so doing. I have not been absent from this chamber for the time that he has, and, therefore, I shall proceed to deal more closely with the matter immediately before us. The right honourable member for East Sydney said that he was against compromise. He scoffed at anything in the shape of compromise being entertained in connection with this matter. I want to define precisely the position of the Government in this respect. We desire to carry this Tariff subject to any neeessaiy amendments. During the past few weeks of the debate. nothing has been more constant than the cry of the Opposition, "" Meet us half-way; compromise, compromise!"" would have been a great deal better if the leader of the Opposition had made himself acquainted with what has taken place in this chamber, and had endeavoured to steer a consistent course. The cry of honourable members opposite time and again has been "" Compromise, compromise !"" We do not wish to compromise unnecessarily. We should like to get what we believe in, and to get it to the fullest extent, but if we cannot get all that we want we will get all that we can. everything that we have got. have met honourable members. In a variety of instances arrangements h«,ve been made upon the floor of the House between the Opposition and the Government, as well as between other sections of it , which have resulted in compromises that are satisfactory to all. satisfactory to all, but when we could not get the best, we went for the next best. generally absolutely satisfactory to either of the parties to it, but it is a fair and proper thing under the circumstances, and I venture",57,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

288,Mr Kingston,"A compromise is not to hold that it .will be a mistake if, upon mati ters of detail at least, a spirit of compromise j is altogether rejected, and we are to refuse to I listen to strong arguments in favour of a medium, course. One matter has been .brought under our notice by the honourable member for the Barrier, and I would ask' honourable members to consider this item as regards what is proposed and what the amendment is. The item which we have before us deals with manufactures of metals n.e.i. and with expressed inclusions of certain goods. It includes a variety of articles, but^ mining machinery is the chief article included, and under the item it is estimated that a total revenue of £280,000 will be received. When honourable members consider that the proposition of the honourable member for Barrier is practically to strike out all these items, and transfer them to the free list, with a resulting loss of over £250,000, I am sure that they will not be long in coining to the conclusion that an amendment of that sort cannot be entertained for a moment. Mr B.EfD -Then the right honourable gentleman does expect them to be imported, and the duty paid upon them ? We were told there would not be a penny of duty paid. the leader of the Opposition amuses me. I told the committee time and .again what was expected. I am only too delighted to hear the right honourable gentleman, but I like the laugh best that is genuine, and that mirthless giggle, which we sometimes hear, is not so happy in its results as some people may imagine. What we stated at the very earliest moment was that the Tariff was designed for the double purpose of revenue and protection. In connection with this item we expect revenue from the importations which will take place, and we expect also protection as regards the items which may be affected by the protective incidence of revenue duties. All revenue duties to some extent operate protectively incidentally. We explained our proposals in connection with this item, and gave honourable members details as to what was expected from it at the earliest possible moment. They have the figures' before them, which show that we expect under this item a matter of £280,000 revenue. Do honourable members really wish to strike out that item 1 I think not. id X ber for the Barrier is a type of the extreme party. I believe he is one of the most genuine free-traders in this House. We have proposed this line in this form, and honourable members in discussingi t have selected simply mining machinery while, of course, a number of other items are also under consideration. WhatI wish honourable members to do is to recognise the matter from this point of view : Let ustake a division, say on the n.e.i., at first, for tlie purpose of ascertaining the highest rate at which any of the residue should be taxed. Then let us proceed with the discussion of the various lines in detail to determine what items should beincluded in that residue. Of course, we canput any item, mining machinery it may be, on the free list or at a reduced rate, but unless we determine that no item whatevershall be subjected to a taxation of 25 per cent, we must reject the proposal of the-honourable member for' BarrieV I wouldput it to the honourable member that,, free-trader as he undoubtedly is, he must recognise our revenue necessities, and I do not think that on the fullest consideration he would wish to wipe out this line, lock, stock, and barrel. I venture to consider, therefore, that it would be for the f a r greater convenience of the committee if he accepted my suggestion not to take adivision upon his present proposal, but"" to deal first with the n.e.i -com e to a decision as to whether the duty there shall be 25per cent, or 20 per cent, and then proceed in accordance with the practice we have adopted in all other cases in connection with this Tariff, of considering thedetails, and distributing them here and there wherever we think they ought"" to go, according to the wishes of the majority of the committee. I am. sure honourable members will be sorry to depart from the practice that has hitherto obtained, and which I believe has worked 1 with advantage. The intention of the Government is to give the committee the fullest opportunity of dealing with tlie matter in detail as they please. We have no intention of springing anything upon the committee in the shape of a block vote, or of supporting anything in the shape of a block vote, to induce tlie committee to come to a conclusion which we could not support, without the fullest consideration.

291,Mr Kingston,"The honourable memof a large majority of the committee. The right honourable the leader of the Opposition has said that he does not believe there is as much difference between protectionists and free-traders as might appear at first sight, and the position the Government take is the same as that which they took in connection with agricultural machinery. We wish to protect, but we do not wish, where there is no reasonable probability of the goods being manufactured here, to put on a protective duty. In such cases a revenue duty will at least be sufficient if, indeed, those goods are not admitted free. There is nothing I should like more strongly to repudiate than the suggestion that we wish to tax goods at protective rates when they are not likely to be manufactured in Australia, or are not properly the subject of protective taxation. I fcannot put it too strongly in that respect, and if I repeat myself in this connection I ask the indulgence of tlie committee for the reason that I should be sorry that, where we are so nearly agreed, there should, in the absence of a f u l l explanation on the part of the Government, be any misunderstanding between those who I believe can for the good of Australia be led to act in co-operation in this important matter.. We do not wish to protect that which cannot be reasonably made here. When from the nature of the instrument, and the rareness with which it would be wanted in Australia, or from any other cause, we cannot by a reasonable protective duty enable it to be manufactured here, so as to compete with the imported article, then I say away with the protective duty, and we have only the right to ask for a revenue tax, if indeed such articles might not fairly, in the interests of industry, be allowed to come in free. for. Mr KI NGST ON I believe that is all honourable members generally are asking for. And in that spirit let us reason together, and, so far as we can, adopt the practice we adopted in dealing with agricultural machinery, of exempting all which we cannot satisfactorily make here. I venture to consider that in connection ""-with agricultural machinery the subject was veiy fairly discussed, and very reasonable conclusions come to in all tlie circumstances. AVe have onty to apply bur minds to the various items in connection with this line to arrive at, probabty, similarly happy results. as regards mining machinery ? gards mining machinery is 25 per cent. duty. I believe there is little, if any, mining machinery which cannot reasonably be made here. Let me take the committee further into my confidence. When we rose, but a month ago, I felt that the committee would desire information, so far as it was obtainable, as to what machinery we could produce, and what we could not produce. To that end I gave instructions to my officers to make the fullest inquiry into the subject. The information which I have received from them is that there is little, if any, mining machinery which we cannot produce. quiries from the persons who were making the machinery, or from those who were buying the machinery 1 inquiries from both.

I will place an officer at his disposal to assist him in exploring all sources of innot be protected. formation. I venture to suggest that in matters of this sort, honourable members should freely accept the statement of the Government of what their wishes are, and the means which they have taken to ascertain the facts. Then they should assist us in regard to the facts. Those honourable members who say we cannot manufacture some of these machines, should tell us what they are. If they can show that a machine cannot be made here, then we will put it on the free list. I cannot be caught with chaff of that sort! If we were to accept a broad definition of that kind, we might, by the patentiug of some small matter in connection with mining machinery, have to permit the free admission of all the mining machinery in the world into Australia, and destroy the benefits which are intended to be conveyed by protection in connection with these manufactures. I venture to think I have made a fair offer. Can any honourable member suggest a fairer one? Are we agreed that it is a reasonable thing to protect machinery which can be manufactured here at a reasonable price ? those honourable members-ther e may not be many-wh o hold that it is unfair to give reasonable protection, I cannot argue with them. We believe in incidental protection in connection with this particular matter. AVe propose it and we hope that the committee will proceed to discuss the item on the basis to which I have referred.

To save the workers from competition to which they ought not to be exposed. simply going to say-""Protect me, and so long as my wages are right I do not care if the man who makes the machinery I use is sweated""? That is really the attitude of a miner or o£ any one else who, crying out for a white Australia and for the exclusion of the black people in the interests of labour, would yet compel the factory operative in Australia to compete with the cheap and pauper labour of the world. I speak strongly, because I feel strongly. It is a shame that men are not taught by their leaders to recognise the false position in which they are placed when they are induced to follow such a selfish policy as that. I am getting tired of hearing speeches about the success which is seen to have attended the policy of one Stfite when its progress is compared with that of another. We have heard a great deal about the larger number of operativesin one State than in another, and of not to j>ress his amendment, but to deal the number of people who have gone from one State to another to seek employment: but, with regard to machinery, I find that New South Wales exported only £48,605 worth, whereas South Australia has exported £127,997 worth, and Victoria £230,456 worth. It would be strange, indeed, if a State three times as large and four times as old as another had not greater resources and a larger development. But the effects of protection can be estimated only in connection with industries where the imports compete with the exports. Has New South Wales, with a population one-eighth greater than that of Victoria, more people employed in her industries ? No. The number of persons employed in protected industries in New South Wales is only 22,000, while the number employed, in A ictoria is 24,000. If r one faces the contrast between the two policies fairly, he must be forced to the conclusion that the Victorian policv has all the best of it . Exception has been taken to the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, upon mining machinery, because the duty on agricultural machinery is only 15 per cent., but the reason for the difference is AVe did all that and did it plain. The initial cost of, and the expense of -setting up plant to make mining machinery is undoubtedly far greater than the expense of a plant to make agricultural ruachinery, while the output of mining machineiy cannot be so large as the output of agricultural machinery. I invite honourable Is the miner members to discuss the item upon the lines which have been previously followedduring the consideration of the Tariff. Let us settle the general rate first, and then deal with exemptions, putting such articles as the committee may think good upon the free list, and reducing tlie duties upon others. Minister has made a number of interesting speeches during the last hour. I have followed them all, and I have failed utterly to see why he has taken the trouble to speak so frequently upon subjects so widely divergent from, and at times altogether unconnected with, the question before the Chair. He deprecated the action of honourable members in wandering all over the place; but what has he been doing ? He made a proposition of a most touching character to the honourable member for Barrier, asking him, as a loyal and consistent free-trader, with the matter in a spirit of compromise. When the Minister was asked what was his idea of compromise, he said a duty of 25 percent. He tells us that his idea of the Tariff is to bolster up industries and to get revenue. When he cannot get revenue he bolsters up industries, and when he cannot bolster up industries, he gets revenue. Having arrived at this rather confusing position, he told us that he was quite prepared, when an article could not be produced here, to allow it to be imported upon the payment of a reasonable revenue duty. But can he mention any article, unless it is a patented invention, which cannot be produced here.? There are skilled mechanics in the country, and there are capitalists who are ready and willing, if they are given sufficient incentive, to embark their money upon the enterprise.

338,Mr Mccay,"The honourable member ismanufacturer and his employee will be served without injuring any one else. Experience has shown that Australian-made machinery is just as serviceable as is the imported article and apparently the importing States take that view. We may fairly say that as regards mining machinery, Western Australia is chiefly an importing State. It is only recently that she has begun the manufacture of machinery, and tlie local industry has not yet attained any great proportions. In the year 1900, Western Australia imported electrical machinery, steam engines, flour-milling engines, ice-making machinery, .locomotives, mining machinery, engineering parts, and printing machinery, of a total value of £438,000. Of this, £204,000 worth was Australian made, and £224,000 worth came from beyond the seas. If we take mining machinery-as regards the Australian production, of which some honourable members have chosen to use terms of disparagement, in comparing it with the imported article-w e find that Western Australia imported in 1900 a total of £322,000 worth, of which £152,000 worth was Australian made, and £169,000 woith was imported from abroad, the bulk of the latter coming from Great Britain. We all know 1 of the relations which exist"" between the Western Australian mining companies and Great Britain, and there must inevitably be a tendency in . favour of buying the articles required for the mines in the place where the bulk of the shares are held. But in spite of that, half the imports in Western Australia are Australian products. learned member is quite wrong; I have more recent figures. MrM c CAY 1900 as token from the Statistical Register of Western Australia. The bulk of these imports were then from Victoria and South Australia, the only two States which have endeavoured to give practical protection.to those industries. natural advantages. much the industries .cost. South Wales has more, or as many, or nearly as many hands engaged in foundries and kindred works as Victoria, but I am astounded that there are not a great many more, in spite of the different fiscal policy, having regard to the considerable coal and iron deposits in the adjoining State. We have nothing in Victoria to compare with New South Walesi n that respect. Again taking the figures for the year 1900, we find, whatever may be the number of hands employed, that Victoria, -with nearly one-sixth less population, apparently worked something like 15 per cent, more iron and steel than did New South Wales, although New South Wales worked all the iron ore raised within her border. It is true that the latter was not a large amount, if the New South Wales Statistical Register is to be trusted. As I said, the great bulk of the imports into Western Australia from the rest of the Commonwealth were from Victoria and South Australia ; and some honourable members contend that that fact shows that no duty is wanted. South Wales that made the manufactures in South Australia. trade between the States that will make the manufactures of all the States. I have always advocated free-trade between the States, believing that within the one legislative area we should have as much freedom of trade as possible. In that area we can control the relations between employer and employed, buyer and seller, and the various interests concerned ; but when we go beyond the legislative area we must set up a barrier, large or small. We cannot control operations beyond the Commonwealth, and it is at the limits that we have to establish The honourable and any barriers which it may be decided shall exist. The fact that the bulk of the imports into AVestern Australia were from I give tlie figures for Victoria and South Australia does not in the least degree show that no duty is required. This export trade has been successfully established under a fiscal system. As I have already pointed out, the effect of a duty frequently is merely to change the place of origin of the article supplied, and to secure that it shall be in the community in which we live, and not some foreign country. I do not desire to weary the committee by dealing elaborately with this question. I only rose to say that experience has proved the correctness, in this particular instance at any rate, of the views held by protectionists, and the incorrect-, ness of the views held by free-traders. There is no use in our discussing any number",64,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

344,Mr Mccay,"Possibly so, ancl it is freeof theories when we have facts to guide us. It seems to me that there is only one inference to be drawn from those facts, and that inference I have ventured to draw. In conclusion, I wish, to .say that my voting for any particular duty under the head of "" n.e.i."" must not be taken to mean that' I believe that every article at present included should remain at 25 per cent. There are articles on which the duty should be reduced, and other articles which sliould be placed on the free list. I discriminate as to articles there is a chance of producing locally in sufficient quantities to satisfy the demand, and to create such competition as will keep prices within reason. I hold myself free, in regard to a number of items under this general heading, to vote for placing articles on the free list because they can be locally produced, or for reducing the duty on other articles because, under the circumstances, I consider the duty too high. the more ready to support the amendment, because I returned only to-day from a visit to Western Australia, where the feeling is -one, of consternation concerning the proposed duty of 25 per cent on mining machinery. In AVestern Australia no less than S6 per cent, of the total production of the State comes from mining. The State generally is absolutely dependent upon mining, and if the progress of that industry be retarded, as no doubt it will be by this dut}% the State must suffer very considerably. I trust that the officer who has been appointed by the Government to make in-quiries concerning mining machinery, has been through the same experience as myself during the last few weeks. WhereverI went I heard nothing but bitter complaints about the proposed high duty of 25 per cent. I discussed the matter with a good many mining men, and they all agreed that the duty would do very considerable injury, not only to the big companies, whose money is invested i u Western Australia, but also to the small prospectors. AVestern Australian Tariff on mining machinerv 1 most singular that although I have been to see most of the mining men in that State, and have interviewed the Chamber of Mines and other similar bodies, whom one would imagine any officer appointed by the Federal Government would consult, I did not get the slightest information of any such inquiries having been made. If inquiries of such a nature had been made. I should have heard of them, and it would surely be very strange for an officer to enter upon an investigation of the kind and not direct his attention to the State to which the mining industiy is of more importance than it is to any other State of the Commonwealth. that mining machinery cannot be made in the Commonwealth at a reasonable rate ? honourable gentleman exactly what they did say on that point. The Minister for Trade and Customs said, as I understood him, that he would be in favour of putting on the free list mining machineiy which cannot be made in Australia. There was not much, however, in that statement, when we consider that just previously the leader of the Opposition had admitted that there was nothing which could not be made in Australia. The Minister for Trade and Customs should take into consideration the cost of production; and I should like to read, in reply to the question just asked, what the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia says on this particular point. In reply to a telegram which I sent to that body some time ago I received the following :We admit all machinery can be made in Australia if cost be no object; but, when quality is considered, high-class steam engines, electrical plants, and crushing mills can be imported 15 per cent, cheaper nnder old Tariff. That means that machinery imported from the old countiy or elsewhere could be sold in Australia at 20 per cent, less than it is being sold at present. The communication proceeded :The higher quality required the greater is the saving. Owing to the natural conditions here, only best quality should be used. There is one point in connection with the speech delivered by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo which has not been sufficiently noticed. It is that whilst machinery suitable for the free milling ores which are found at Ballarat and Bendigo can be manufactured in Australia, the mining at those places is as different from the operations which aie carried on at BrokenH ill and. Kalgoorlie as mining itself is from agriculture. A t Kalgoorlie there are refractory ores which require most scientific treatment.

349,Mr Kirwan,"I will tell the rightscientific in the world, with the exception of those conducted -at Cripple Creek in America. It is imperative, therefore, that the different mining companies shall secure the most costly machinery. But the demand for that class of machinery in Australia is not sufficient to justify the establishment of the extensive foundries which would be necessary for its manufacture. The Minister for Trade and Customs spoke as if he were an authority upon the question of mining machinery. In this connection I should like to quote the opinions of a few men. who are recognised, not only in Australia, but throughout the world, as authorities upon this subject. I will first refer to a speech by the ex-Premier of Western Australia, MrA . E. Morgans, who is a well-known mining man. He has had experience in all parts of the world, and is considered an authority upon this matter. The speech in question was delivered in the Parliament of Western Australia when that body unanimously carried aresolutionhavingreference to the Tariff. Surely that Parliament ought to know something concerning the effect which the Tariff will have upon Western Australia. Some time ago the Prime Minister suggested that the representatives of the smaller States did not understand the position in which their respective States stoodI think, however, tliat what has since been said by the Treasurer in regard to Western Australia shows that those who were mistaken in the views which they held upon the financial position of that State are to be found upon the Ministerial benches. honourable member quotes with delight the resolutions of the Western Australian Parliament. to show that all parties are agreed upon the question. tells us that that State Parliament does not represent the people. instance I tell the Minister for Trade and Customs tliat it does represent the people. The resolution is as followsThat this House views with consternation the Federal Tariftj which has been promulgated in view of the serious consequences that must result parts of thoir machineiy. But the tax proto the. trade and commerce of this State as well as to the mining industry, which is one of the principal elements of prosperity, and this House enters its protest against the imposition of the proposed Tariff in its present form. In discussing that resolution, Mr Morgans gave a lot of valuable information in regard to the relationship of the Tariff to the mining industry in Western Australia. Concerning what can be done by the manufacturers of machinery in the eastern States, he saidWhat advantage would it be to the mining industry whether they paid 25 per cent, to Fraser and Chalmers or to the Otis Engineering Company in Melbourne ? What was the effect oif the creation of a ring, but to create a price, and what was the Federal Tariff bnt a ring for the purpose of protecting the manufactories of the other States? He had the facts in his possession showing that since the promulgation of the Tariff the manufactories in Victoria had withdrawn their original quotations for the purpose of raising the prices. It was true that it would stop the importation of machinery from England and the United States, but they would not get as good machinery from Victoria, and they would have to pay 22£ per cent, more for a vastly inferior article. He had bought immense quantities of it, and he knew its value and its merits. He did not deny that the manufactories iu the eastern States made fairly good batteries, and engine and boilers which would answer the purpose, but they could uot make them to compare with the English or the United States article. This is the opinion of a man who does not speak hastily, and who is an admitted authority upon this question. got the facts about raising the prices ? honourable man and his word can be taken. for particulars, but so far they have not been forthcoming. easily be refuted. names. for particulars, and he has failed to supply them to this day. the opinion of Mr G.

360,Mr Kirwan,"I wish also to-quoteNorth Coolgardie district, which lacks the advantage of railway communication. The cost of cartage there is considerable, and the scarcity of water constitutes a very great difficulty. All these things tend to seriously hamper the work of the prospector. Mr Hall saysMost of the miners in the back blocks will be seriously affected by this increase in the Tariff, for the reason that right through the northern field, from Lake Way to HJrlistoun, the bulk of the mines are dealing with low grade ore. Consequently, although large numbers of men are employed, the profits are necessarily Smaller than on mines of higher grade. The margin of profit being small, large quantities of ore must be treated. Being so far from machinery centres, any break down is very disastrous, and, consequently, the mines are forced to go in for the very highest class of machinery-and that comes from the old country. My experience of colonial batteries is that for the first twelve months they tained on this field before, the present crushing will run all right, but after that you very soon spend as much in repairs as would make up the cost of a first-class Fraser and Chalmers, or Sandicroft, battery. The charge for cartagewhich is such a tremendous item-is no greater on n first-class battery than on a cheaper one, and altogether, the out back miners recognise that the first cost is the best. For these reasons the machinery tax will press very heavily on those who are opening np the mines in the back country. lian machinery is cheaper. cheaper. He says the imported machinery is undoubtedly cheaper in the end, because it will last longer, and it is machinery which is particularly useful in that country. A good deal has been said here about what can be done by the local manufacturers. I know of a particular instance of a rock drill which I may mention here, the Ingersoll-Sergeant Rock Drill. made in Australia; but what are those drills ? The Ingersoll Drill Company some considerable time ago patented a certain class of drill. Since then they have been continually improving it , and they allowed the patents they had taken out for the older class of drill to lapse, and now the Ingersoll drills we can get in the Australian States are much inferior to the new Ingersoll-Sergeant drill which can be'got from America. That is an instance of the kind of thing carried on in connection with the manufacture of machinery in Australia. Many of these rock crushers, diamond drills, and other mining machinery are patented machines that cannot possibly be produced in Australia. I certainly hope that at least ii as regards these patented machines, tlie Government will see their way to place them on the free list. Just by accident I managed to get this extract from, I think, the Mining Standa/rd, to show how this Tariff is affecting one of our mines in New South Wales, which is referred to as"" the oldest, deepest, and best mine in this State""namely, the Lucknow mine, at Orange. This is what the manager of that mine says concerning the TariffMr Newman tells us that he will have to leavethousands of tons of low grade ore (containing no fine gold whatever, but which entails a concentrating and smelting process) below, as it cannot now be raised unless under a considerable loss to the company-which , of course, means a reduction of hands. To treat this vast body of low-grade ore Mr Newman has discovered, and. widen is said to be of a different class ever obplant of 20 head will have to be increased to 50, while the latest and best concentrators will have to be sent from London to replaee those at present in use ; but, owing to the ruinous Tariff proposals, this important discovery is rendered valueless, and consequently all the machinery has been countermanded, and a host of men promised work will now be thrown upon the State. Another instance of the kind which I quoted before, is so much to the point that I think it will bear quotation again. There are three important mines on the Kalgoorlie field, and they do not speak of a He does not say it is few men being employed there or a few thousands of pounds being spent. Those three mines, the Associated Northern, the Oroya, and the Golden Link, intended to introduce a sulphide plant to cost £200,000, but as soon as they found that this plant would have to pay a duty of 25 per cent., which would be equal to £50,000 added to the cost, they abandoned their idea. That We can get Ingersoll drills plant, if introduced, would have given employment to 400 men, who, of course, will not now be employed, and yet tlie Government argue that this Tariff will give employment to a number of men. were going to make could not be very large if they could not afford to pay the duty. gentleman must remember that many of these mines are worked at a very low profit.. The difference between profit and loss in the working of mines is often very small, and there are quite a number of mines in AVestern Australia, as there are in every mining camp in the world, that are being worked at a loss in the hope of some development",67,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

I could mention a number of mines on Kalgoorlie that are just paying expenses, but those who are working them are perfectly satisfied to go on, in the hope of something good turning up. If , however, we put a duty of 25 per cent, upon the machinery they use, they may not be disposed to continue to work their mines. the 25 per cent, duty upon ? Not upon the machinery with which they are working. of machineiy which they require. Some of these .mines are often working with an insufficient plant, and mining explosives and other mining supplies are also taxed. The honourable and learned member' for Corinella quoted accurately the importations of machinery from the Statistical Register, but I have here a return which shows the value of machinery and mining supplies imported from the Australian States and abroad for the year ended 30th September, 1901. The return -refers only to 44 of the Western Australian inining companies, but they are 44 of the best known companies. I shall be very happy to hand the return to the Minister for Trade and Customs, so that he may give it to the officer who is in search of information, but whom nobody seems to know anything at all about. This return shows exactly the importations of machinery into Western Australia by those 44 companies. I find from it that the imports of mining machinery from Australiaamountedin value to £96,941, and that is 33 per cent, of the whole of the machinery imported into Western Australia. abroad amounted in value to £197,246, and that is, roughly, 67 per cent, of the total. That makes a total importation of machinery to the value of £294,187. There is another item here of equal importance, and that is the importation of mining supplies. The total value of the mining supplies imported from Australia amounted to £125,430, which is 25 per cent, of the total importations, while the importations of mining supplies from Great Britain and foreign countries amounted in value to £369,666. guish between Great Britain and other countries 1 given are simply under the heading "" foreign,"" and the value of the importations of mining supplies from foreign countries, as. stated here, amounts to 75 per cent, of the total mining supplies imported into Western Australia.

The honourable and learned member for Corinella said that mining directors of British companies would naturally exhibit some sympathy for British firms. tendency which I did not consider improper. much the same thing. So far as the natural tendency is concerned, if the honourable and learned membeiknows anything about milling men, he must be aware that they are not likely to be influenced by matters of that kind. They will go where they can obtain machinery at the cheapest rates, and of the best quality. If , as has been contended by some honourable members, mining machinery can be produced in Australia equal to any that is imported, and at the same cost, honourable members will find that mining managers will always give the The machinery imported from preference to the Australian article. It must be remembered tliat the cost of carriage of machinery from the eastern States to Western Australia is veiy much less than the freights from the old world. Mining men will simply go where they can obtain the best value for their money. There, are some other returns which have also been supplied by the Western Australian Chamber of Mines, and the details of which I shall be glad to supply to the Ministeri n order to show their accuracy. They show exactly what has been done by 66 mining companies who are operating in Western Australia.

372,Mr Kirwan,"It amounts to Verypaid in wages by the number of workmen, we find that the average wage earner there is not receiving a sweated wage. He is not receiving the wage of a factory hand in Melbourne, but practically an average of £ 2 00 per annum. Honourable members will see what a great gain this is to the whole Commonwealth, and what a large number of hands this industry employs. The amount of money which is spent annually in Western Australia in connection with the mining industry-includin g the expenditure upon fuel, water, stores, drainage, duty on profits, position of the industries, if any, which import and export duties, lease rents and other Government fees-is £3,463,849. That represents the disbursements of 66 mining companies in Western Australia, whilst the value of the plants employed by them is £2,577,000. We hear a great deal about the harm that may be done to the sugar industry of Queensland by the abolition of Kanaka labour. I claim that the mining industry of Western Australia is of far greater importance to the Commonwealth than is the sugar industry to Queensland. The number of hands employed in connection with the Queensland sugar industry is far below the number engaged in connection with the mining industry of Western Australia. The annual value of the products of the Queensland sugar industry is something like £2,000,000, but the output of gold from Western Australian mines for the year just closed amounted in round figures to 1,800,000 ozs., or, roughly speaking, to over £7,000,000 in value. MrV . L . SOLOMON -£7,200,00 0 odd. worthy of consideration, and tlie Government ought not to place upon it the very heavy impost proposed by them-a n impost which will undoubtedly hamper the industry. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I do not intend to take up much of the time of the committee upon this item,, but I desire to point out the fact that this is not a matter which affects only Victoria. Honourable members of the Opposition have referred to this matter as if it chiefly affected Bendigo and one or two other towns in this State. of fact, however, Queensland will be very seriously affected if the articles included in this item, and especially mining machinery, are placed on the free list. I gather from the official statistics that as regards metal works of all kinds there are no less than 329 factories in Queensland, employing 3,931 hands. When I say that industries in Queensland having reference to metal working have grown up under a protective Tariff of 25 per cent., which has been imposed for a dozen years, honourable members will see what the position is. Certain honourable members coming from a free-trade State are desirous of doing what they call justice by reducing immediately all the industries of the Commonwealth to the exist in their own State. I understand from an honourable member that there are none there. Probably that is due to the fact that it is a free-trade State. I believe that the honourable member for Barrier, who has proposed that the articles included in this item should be placed on the free list, is desirous of doing what is fair and just. I would ask him, however, whether it is fair and just to the States which have industries that have grown up under protective Tariffs-in which capital has been invested, and where on the strength of these duties wages have been gradually raised, until by reason of the protective duties, they have been brought to a level of 10s. a day-that the whole of this economic and industrial fabric should be wiped out by his proposal. and learned member want all the other things in the list of exemptions to come in free? MrL . E. GROOM -Because* none of them will affect the industries to which I refer in the same way as would the placing of the articles in this item on the free list. The factories I refer to are factories which have grown up under a protective Tariff. We are framing a Tariff for Australia, and that being so, we have to consider the conditions of the various States. Where we find in existence industries that have grown up under a protective Tariff, we must give them fair and proper consideration. In Maryborough, Queensland, there is one factory-Walker' s Ltd -where , I am informed, nearly all the mining machineiy that is required in Queensland can be and is manufactured. That is only a single As a matter instanpe; thpre are other factories doing the same work in Brisbane and elsewhere. Therefore I submit that even a desire to be fair and just to all the States could not lead us to amend this item to the extent of putting all such articles upon the free",69,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us
373,Mr Kirwan,Surely this industry is,70,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us
374,Mr Thomas,"Why does the honorablelist. I trust that the honourable member for Barrier will seriously consider his position, and withdraw his motion to make this item free. able and learned member for Darling Downs has told us that this matter does not affect Victoria alone, as some honourable members on this side of the Chamber seem to think. I agree with him there j it is a matter which affects tens of thousands of pioneers who are engaged' in developing one of the chief primary industries of the country. We, on this side of the Chamber, are considering, not the interests of the manufacturers of Victoria, whose claims have been put forward so strongly to-night by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, but the interests of the thousands of hard-working men who, at BrokenH ill and in other parts of Australia, are earning, their bread by the sweat of their brow in the development of our mineral resources. learned member for Darling Downs has told us that under a 25 per cent, duty Queensland manufacturers have been able to produce mining machinery. I agree with him that they are entitled to consideration, but have we not, by the. act of federation, thrown"" open the whole of the Australian market to them and to other manufacturers, and, by doing so, have we not given them all the consideration to which they are entitled after their many years of protection 1 I am entirely in accord with the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier. I understand that he said that the proposed duty on mining machinery would have a disastrous effect upon tlie mining operations at BrokenH ill . But if the mining operations at BrokenH ill are inteii'ered with, it is not only the BrokenH ill miners who will suffer. A t Cockle Creek, near Newcastle, and at Dapto, on there are very large smelting works, and if the BrokenH ill and other mines throughout the country are shut down because of the high duties upon mining machinery, many men connected with those smelting works will be thrown out of employment. Then, again, the coal-raining industiy employs more than .10,000 men in New South Wales, and a great many more people are employed I by it indirectly. In what is known as the South Coast district of New South Wales, between Clifton and Lake Illawarra, there are hundreds of coke ovens. The mines' at BrokenH ill and other places provide a market for the coke that is made in that district, and if the mines are shut down, the coke-making industry will suffer. Thus, to benefit the comparatively few men who are engaged in the manufacture of mining machineiy in Ballarat and other parts of Victoria, tens of thousands of men elsewhere will bethrown out of employment. Under the Tariff, everything a miner uses and consumes is taxed, and on behalf of the coal-miners of my electorate, who number fully one-half of my constituents, I again raise my protest against it . The Minister for Trade and Customs was very pronounced in his statement to-night that the Government did not wish to tax articles which could not be produced here, or which were only very rarely used in Australia. He said that if a single case of that sort were brought under his The honourable and notice, he would give instructions to have it inquired into, so that the articles might be admitted duty free, or allowed to -come in under a revenue duty. Now, among the coke-making companies in the South Coast district in New South Wales, there is the Federal Coke Company Limited, whose head office is at 3 Gresham-street, Sydney, and this afternoon I received a letter from the secretary to the company, calling my attention to a machine which is used in connection with the manufacture of coke, under new principles recently applied in America and Wales. The letter is as follows :--.1>EAR Sm, I have been instructed to bring under your notice, as the member for the district in which our works are situated-viz. , Wollongong-the following facts in connection with a coke ram, or pusher, ordered many months ago, and on which, owing to its arrival shortly after the imposition the shores of Lake Illawarra, of the Federal Tariff, a heavy duty is demanded -ou r desire being to get this admitted free. About fifteen months ago a new company was formed, known as the Federal Coke Company Limited, with a capitalof £13,000, which has since erected its works at Wollongong. These works were designed after a principle much used in America and Wales. In order to curry out "" this design it was necessary to got a coke rani, or pusher, to discharge the ovens. Tenders were called in the C0I0113', but as it had never been used out here, we were unable to get a satisfactory tender, so we had to send to Liverpool, England, for the necessary machinery, tlie cost of which is about f l ,500, and its erection will cost about another £250. This machinery should have arrived before the duties .were put on, but",70,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us
375,Mr Fuller (Illawarra),"The honorowing to delay, it did not reach here until some few weeks after, and it is now in bond. As this coke ram is entirely new to the colonies, and is to assist a local industry on which £13,000 has already been expended, we think that in justice to the company the duty should not be insisted upon in connection with this particular case. It is entirely new, and nothing like it has ever been used in the colonies. Taking the Minister on his very strong . statement here this' evening-considerin g that the article has never been produced in the State, and that it is absolutely necessary in order to carry on the industry on the most approved principles, I ask him to send a despatch to .his officer without the slightest delay, and see that these men get this important article duty free. We hear a lot about the encouragement of native industries by the Government. Here is a native industry to which no encouragement could be given by way of duty, but every obstacle is thrown in its way by the Government, which can possibly be done. I sincerely trust that in the interests of all classes of miners throughout Australia-no t only the gold miner, but also the coal miner and all the other3-the Government will see its way to come to a compromise with regard to this item, if we are not able to get the articles in duty free. learned member is revolting from his leader's cry of "" no compromise."" an}' way. The Minister talked a lot about compromise here this evening; he told us that we' ought to deal with the Tariff in a spirit of compromise, as we had been doing for the last two months; and then all the compromise he offers us is that he will stick to the 25 per cent, duty in his Tariff, j shall stick to the position put forward by the leader of the Opposition tonight, that if we cannot get all we want to carry out free-trade principles, we must try and bring the duty as closely as possible into harmony with those principles which we believe should be adopted in the best interests of the country. ""like some of my honourable friends opposite to explain one or two little matters, which. I shall state as mildly as possible. Of course we all understand that, according to the free-trade argument, a pipe extends directly from the producer to the consumer, and therefore, when you buy in a free-trade market, you get the goods. at the lowest possible price. I mentioned in the House before a significant fact. In SydneyI bought a pump, for which I paid 63 in that free-trade port. I imagined that I was getting the pump at a free-trade price. Subsequently I found that the English price was £ 4 0 . The indent agent in Sydney had placed 50 per cent, on the pump in a free trade market. W it h regard to almost everything wluch is bought in connection with mining machinery, exactly the same thing happens.' If to-night we were discussing the question ' of a 50 per cent, duty, honourable members opposite, wonld. be horrified. In a free trade countiy I paid 50 per cent, extra, and am anxious to' obtain an explanation. A little while ago I was connected with the purchase of an extremely good American engine. One of the parts went -wrong, and it was impossible without very great delay to get a similar part. We discovered that it was much better to pay for a colonially made engine, for which we could get the parts readily, rather than buy an article from another part of the world. I shouldalso like honourable members to explain why iron castings in Sydney are dearer than steel castings in Melbourne. If you wish to obtain anything good in connection with The honourable and mining machineiy it has to be steel or something better. In Melbourne you can buy steel castings that will do their work I am not revolting in thoroughly. But if you buy in Sydney} ou r will have to give more for iron castings. The New South Wales manufacturer has not had a fair chance. Victoria may have had to pay a considerable amount to establish her industries, but they are established. In several places in Victoria you can get steel castings, but I do not think that any one will contend that you are likely to obtain first class steel castings in Sydney. There is just one other point I wish to mention. I know an instance of tenders being called for machinery from selected Melbourne and Sydney firms. The lowest Sydney tender was £ 1 6 , 0 0 0; the lowest Melbourne tender was £11,000 ; and of course the Melbourne man got the contract. In a matter of £16,000, free-trade Sydney was £5000 over protectionist Melbourne. I can prove the accuracy of every statement. I have made. I know perfectly well that it may be 'necessary to import engines in connection with intricate mining work, but for the small article for the small industry, it is better, if necessary,",71,Langdon Bonython Did Not That Have Been A Source Of Wealth To Us

378,Mr Ewing (Richmond),"I shouldto pay 50 per cent, more-it is better to have it made at home, I have already shown that in some instances the protected market is the cheaper. Every honourable member knows that, in common with any industry, if he can buy his goods just on the other side of the fence it is better to buy them there than to import them from a distance, .because he saves in time, and he gets a good article under his eye. These are a few facts which have come under rny own notice, and I defy any honourable member to disprove them. Progress reported.
