The first is that this is policy that works, that is sensible and that an amendment to the Migration Act 1958 to has the unity of the nation in delivering a remove the requirement that certain persons really clear strategic set of principles on how held in detention are liable for their cost of we deliver migration policy in this land. detention. Importantly, this excludes people WhatI see as those general underlying smugglers and illegal fishers, who will still principles are, hopefully, a point of unity for be liable for costs of detention and removal. everyone in this chamber. I see a migration So the minister may determine the amount policy that has places where we deal with people smugglers and illegal fishers will be people who arrive here legally or illegallycharged and it cannot be more than the actual by whatever means they get here-swiftly, cost. I start with that point because I have and sort out as quickly and as compassionlistened closely to the debate and there have ately as we can, with as much justice as posbeen references to people smugglers and ilsible for all involved, who is in and who is legal fishers.

Those who are out messages. we deal with as compassionately and swiftly The second point that shapes my view is as possible and hopefully return them safely in relation to debt collection. Any family or to the place they came from. business in Australia when seeking to collect The story of migration policy over at least debts does their best to do so. But a strike the last decade is a sordid one-and this is rate of failure to collect debts of 97.5 per not a reference to one side of politics only. I cent would send a message, I think, to every think there are many lessons for all with refamily and every business in this country that gard to migration policy. There is a differthis policy is failing. It is a policy that is not ence between real and sensible policy and hard in the paradigm that I have been hearing flag-waving and sloganeering in migration of hard versus soft; it is a policy that is failpolicy-and the latter has got to stop. What ing within a paradigm of successful, considwe get is a worse Australia. In many cases ered policy versus ill-thought-through and we get broken Australians who have gone failing policy. through an extraordinary process to legally It is that paradigm shift that I want people qualify as Australians.

It being 5 pm, (b) while the Minister fails to implement allThursday, 25 June 2009 ----Kalgoorlie Electorate: Kimberley Coast House’s attention the fact that on the Kimberley coast in Western Australia we are planning to create an LNG processing hub specifically for product coming initially out of the Browse Basin. The press last Sunday in Western Australia, specifically the Sunday Times, headlined ‘The battle for Broome’ and ‘Battleline drawn at wilderness gas hub’. It is a lot of piffle. We have got a line-up of would be, second-rate celebrities, including George Negus, Missy Higgins, John Butler, Di Morrissey, somebody called Geoffrey Cousins-I’ve never heard of him!and a second-rate drummer by the name of Rob Hirst all wanting to maintain their glorious lifestyle elsewhere in Australia whilst they pontificate about the denial of job opportunities and a future for Indigenous people who have called the Kimberley region home for more than 40,000 years. This annoys me. This project is going to pay taxes, it is going to pay royalties, it is going to employ people. It is going to put money into government coffers that will afford the maintenance of selected areas for national parks and for the creation of tourism infrastructure et cetera that will guarantee the maintenance of our natural environment, which is so precious. The promoters of this project, specifically Woodside, are responsible developers. They are responsible employers. Their work on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia has been exceptional. You can go to the Burrup Peninsula today and see on the other side of their fence a perfect environment, an unpolluted environment; certainly not a destroyed environment. George Negus, for instance, says we should not process this gas in the Kimberley, we should take it to the already destroyed Pilbara. It is an absolute nonsense. This project proposed in the Kimberley region, north of Broome, is some 60 kilometres away from Broome. It will have a boundary of approximately five kilometres by five kilometres. It is going on what is an ex-pastoral station, already changed permanently from its original natural situation. There is no rock art. There is no endangered fauna. It will not disturb the whales at sea who come regularly to the Burrup Peninsula to see what is going on down there. This is going to be a tiny spot in an area twice the size of Victoria. To suggest that its creation will somehow ruin the last bastion of wilderness in the world is an absolute nonsense. Celebrities should get out of the way and let Indigenous people get a job.

Sadly, it is the people with disabilities who have to adapt because in many cases their needs are considered to be secondary and somehow not relevant when objects are designed.

211,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sWhile smoke alarms are installed in most homes across Australia, I wonder how many members have thought about how useful standard alarms are to people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment. There are various smoke detection devices available for deaf and hearing impaired people. These include sensors which make lights flash in every room in the house if smoke is detected in one room, or devices such as vibrating pads and bed shakers that will wake up a person if a fire is detected during the night. However, these are not commonly installed, and deaf people who buy or rent a house are likely to have the significant extra expense of installing new smoke alarms themselves. Of course, smoke alarms are not just placed in our homes; they are also in hotels, bed-and-breakfasts and guesthouses, which people who are hard of hearing do use. These alarms often rely solely on noise to be effective. A person who is hearing impaired must take a portable smoke alarm with them when they travel to make sure they are absolutely safe. Standards Australia is currently working on a draft standard for smoke alarms for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. This process started in January this year and a draft standard is expected to be available for comment by November. At present there are a range of good products on the market for people with a hearing impairment, but they are only certified by Standards Australia as smoke alarms, not specifically as smoke alarms for deaf people. I commend Standards Australia for starting this process and for their genuine commitment to ensure that all Australians are protected. However, I would suggest that a better way to approach the problem would have been, when the original standard was being developed, to ask: ‘Will this create a product which will benefit all Australians not just those who are able to hear?’ When the question is phrased in that way, it is clear that the answer for the current standard is no. My second example in the time remaining is the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis. Many people with a disability who are unable to drive find it hard to access public transport. They rely on taxis for their transport needs. For this group, taxis are a crucial lifeline for participating in society, for medical appointments, social activity and the like. Taxis are regulated by the states, some of which provide their own incentives to increase the number of wheelchair accessible taxis. However, there is no requirement in any state for the number of wheelchair accessible taxis to comprise a set percentage of the overall fleet. For the record, Queensland is the best state at 15.2 per cent while Western Australia is the worse at 6.3 per cent. We think there is a lot more which needs to be done and perhaps we should have purpose-built cabs for people with wheelchairs rather than shoving them into buses which are not appropriate. I think that we do need a new taxi standard design and I look forward to this too.

Now the only reminder of SIDS Red Nose Day that I had last year was that the member for Fadden turned up and spoke in this place about it. Much to the delight of the media he wore a red nose during his speech. TodayI MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Constituency Statements
212,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.36 Am),"As we draw near to the winter recess and the attention ofhave taken it upon myself to remind members about Red Nose Day tomorrow. I have not gone to the length today that the member for Fadden went to last year of wearing a red nose but I have brought some with me and if any members would like to purchase these, I have plenty in my office and their generosity will go to a great cause. I would also urge all members to contact their state offices of SIDS and Kids to find out where they can assist with Red Nose Day tomorrow. SIDS and Kids is a not-for-profit organisation with the noble goal of eliminating sudden and unexpected infant deaths. SIDS stands for sudden infant death syndrome. The WA branch of SIDS and Kids happens to be based in the suburb of Kensington in my electorate of Swan and I have been fortunate enough to spend some time getting to know the people that run the charity. They do a remarkable job. SIDS and Kids WA concentrates its efforts on three important services which benefit the local community. Firstly, it advocates for and funds research into stillbirth-something that causes pain and suffering across the nation and indeed the world. Secondly, it goes to great lengths to provide public information to families about sudden infant death syndrome and safe sleeping for kids. Thirdly, it provides bereavement care, support and counselling for the families of those who have experienced the tragedy of stillbirth or the unexpected death of a child. SIDS and Kids has made great strides over the last few years. The organisation claims since 1990 to have saved the lives of an estimated 5,900 Australian babies through the SIDS and Kids sleeping program. However, there is still a great deal of work to be done-funding research, informing families and providing support. Rates of SIDS and stillbirths are still too high in Australia. I want to be part of the efforts to help this cause. That is why I was pleased last year to become patron of the charity’s WA branch. Last week I organised an information breakfast at Parliament House with key SIDS and Kids figures, which was well attended by members and senators. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my parliamentary colleagues, from both sides of the House, who attended the breakfast. TomorrowI will be out supporting the Red Nose Day volunteers again to help raise funds for their organisation. Red Nose Day has grown from humble beginnings to one of Australia’s highest profile fundraising days with a 97 per cent prompted recognition rate. I will be at the shopping centre near my electorate office in East Victoria Park. Local events are of course taking place around the country and I hope that all members will find the time to support this worthy cause. I ask the whole country to support Red Nose Day tomorrow. For the benefit of the members present, I will put on my red nose now. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Lowe Electorate: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport runway end safety area at Sydney airport has been completed on schedule. This means that restrictions on the use of the east-west runway at Sydney airport have been eased significantly and noise-sharing arrangements have recommenced during early morning and late evening from 6 am to 7 am and from 7 pm to 11 pm. This is positive news for my constituents in Lowe. The east-west runway is essential for the fairer distribution of aircraft noise and its access, as my constituents well know, is extremely important for noise-sharing arrangements. I have spoken on behalf of my constituents in this place on numerous occasions to express their MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Constituency Statements
213,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.39 Am),"TodayI am very pleased to record that phase 1 of theconcerns about aircraft noise. Due to the severely restricted access of the east-west runway over the past eight months, the completion of phase 1 is warmly welcomed by my electorate. As I have informed my constituents, the closure of the runway was announced by Sydney airport two days after the 2007 federal election. The details of that announcement were never revealed by the former Howard government during the election campaign. The upgrade consisted of the extension of the east-west runway to meet international standards. Despite the necessity of the works, the lack of community consultation by the Howard government with constituents from Lowe and surrounding electorates was contemptible, showing an unprecedented disregard for affected residents. However, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, imposed 22 strict conditions on the essential safety works to minimise the noise impacts on surrounding communities. As part of those 22 restrictions, the minister increased the working hours to 22 hours per day, seven days a week, effectively halving the proposed period of severe disruption to noise sharing from 15 months to eight months. Further, the minister maintained the existing cap on movements per hour and the curfew hours to ensure respite for residents during construction. I am extremely pleased to note that last week, on the approval of the Sydney airport master plan 2009, the minister again reaffirmed the government’s commitment to maintain the cap of 80 flights per hour and the curfew at Sydney airport and to invite the state government to participate in a joint study to find a suitable site for a second Sydney airport. Importantly, the minister has also confirmed the continuation of fair noise sharing at Sydney airport. I take this opportunity to commend the minister and the government for the 22 restrictions placed on the construction of the runway end safety area for the benefit of surrounding communities. This is another example of the Rudd government’s responsive approach to my electorate and the people of Sydney’s inner west. I remain optimistic that the remainder of the works will also be completed on schedule by March 2010 and that the residents of Lowe will benefit from the full resumption of noise-sharing arrangements. I also look forward to meaningful discussions at the next Sydney airport community forum in July when I represent my constituents. I will continue to fight for their concerns in relation to aircraft noise as we await the release of the national aviation white paper expected later this year. (Time expired) Climate Change Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.42 am)-Remember what Labor said prior to the 2007 election: A Rudd Labor Government will help all Australians play their part in the fight against climate change by making it easier to take practical action in their own homes, their schools and their local communities. That was an ALP election commitment for 2007-the very words of the current minister. How they have come back to haunt him! With almost every new sunrise we are seeing another government broken promise on solar rebates. The shadow minister has relentlessly pursued the gaffe-prone minister on this issue, highlighting the utter untrustworthiness of the government. Only this week the member for Flinders exposed yet another broken promise. This time it is the rural and remote areas which bear the brunt of the axing of the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program. The title of that axed program is quite prophetic because there is not the remotest chance that the people in remote areas will ever trust this minister or this MAIN COMMITTEE government again. Minister, people’s trust is not renewable and although you are in power now it will be a generation before this disgraceful treatment of businesses and residents will be forgotten. The announcement of this axing was even worse than the prior axing as it was made after the scheme had been closed. The scheme was unilaterally ended at 8.30 am on 22 June and businesses began to receive notices at 8.33 am. Yet again, the solar industry was thrown into crisis. The shadow minister has said that his office has been inundated with calls from desperate workers who will be laid off and despairing homeowners seeing their solar hopes evaporating. One company indicated to the shadow minister that his company alone would lose around $1 million a month. These actions have shown that: (a) the government is incapable of managing the country’s finances; (b) the government’s promises are not worth a thing; (c) the government’s commitment to the environment is a joke; and (d) the government does not care about people-either business people, workers or homeowners. Where is your concern about working families, now, Prime Minister? As for the minister, maybe he did not ‘wanna be the one’ to do this but he has sold himself ‘one too many times’. There is ‘no-one else to blame’, Minister, and while you have a ‘comfortable place on the couch’ the rest of the country is ‘used and abused’. Reid Electorate: Public Education Settlement Services) (9.45 am)-On7 May I was honoured to host a visit by the Speaker, Harry Jenkins, to two schools in my electorate. One of them, Granville Boys High School, is an area where we are seeing major efforts being made in the public education system against enormous odds. I congratulate Principal Linda O’Brien and Hala Maaliki, the chair of the parent and citizens group. I note the amount of work that has been done by the teaching and school community there. I note especially the instigation of new school uniforms, the arrangement of buses to take students directly from the school to their homes and the emphasis upon business connection with the Australian Business Community Network, KPMG, Microsoft and the Shell refinery. The latest newsletter from the school typifies an attempt to make sure that the school community, many from a non-English-speaking background, are informed about things such as the NAPLAN. I also note the effort to ensure that students have some say in the process. Work has been done by Professor Susan Groundwater-Smith and Dr Kris Needham in consulting the students themselves in focus groups about school safety and respectful learning. This is a school where 75 per cent of students are of Arabic extraction and there are significant numbers of Turks, islanders and Africans. It is a school where we have seen massive efforts made with regard to moots, with great success recently. I recognise Arshad Guliyara for his role recently in shadowing the school education director; Gehan Tuameh, the state SRC conference representative; and Saad Pareku as a school ambassador-all typical of a very strong involvement of the students in the community. I also note that recently there has been executive training with regard to laptop installation, a language usage laboratory coming onstream and three science laboratories. MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Constituency Statements
214,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid,"Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs andThe school makes sure that these students get a real opportunity outside their normal expectations-recently conducting a Narrabeen camp for year 7. We have had the instigation of peer tutoring at Granville TAFE college to make sure that this school is able to give the full complement of efforts to people. It is a school very challenged by the tribalisation of Australian education into very narrow schools; it is challenged by the instigation of selective schools, which means that students are sometimes denied the highest possible level of studies because of a lack of students in those areas. But this really does represent an effort by the teachers and the school community to make sure that, through public education, children are given an opportunity in an area of socioeconomic deprivation. Without this effort by the teachers and the community I really do believe that it would be a very much greater challenge for the students. Forrest Electorate: Youth Allowance Ms MARINO (Forrest) (9.48 am)-I rise to call on the Minister for Education to respond to students and parents in my electorate who are affected by the proposed changes to Youth Allowance. There is no doubt that these changes will have a major impact on students, parents and families right throughout the south-west of Western Australia. We have seen no analysis of exactly how many current gap year students in my electorate will be disadvantaged and worse off under the proposed changes to the independent youth allowance as a result of the proposed retrospective starting date of January 2010. Parents and students in this category are extremely worried. The proposed changes will disadvantage all young people currently taking a gap year. The decision to change the criteria for these students will preclude many of my regional students from attending university at all or, alternatively, add a significant financial and emotional burden to both the students and their families. It will also compromise the tertiary opportunities for other children in the same family. A second major concern is the new work criteria; the requirement to complete 30 hours of employment a week for 18 months in any two-year period. I would like to see the analysis on how many students in regional and rural towns in my electorate will actually be able to find those 30 hours of employment. I understand that in the 15 and over age group there has been an increase in youth unemployment from 3.2 per cent to five per cent. At any time in small regional communities, it is extremely difficult for a young inexperienced person to find 30 hours work each week. In the current economic circumstances, it is virtually impossible. Employment options are few and far between, or considerable travel and therefore cost is involved. How many students from towns such as Balingup, Donnybrook, Brunswick Junction and Dunsborough, Cowaramup, Harvey, Yarloop, Nannup and Augusta will meet that criteria? This requirement will also preclude the seasonal work option, sometimes the only option for regional, rural and remote students. You can spend 100 hours in one week in a header during harvest, or on a tractor during the hay season, and perhaps 18 hours the next doing similar work, but you will not qualify. Many parents in regional areas both work now just to support their children’s education. Where in such small towns can the same parents find additional employment to meet the extra costs-the additional costs that are not borne by students and families who live in cities who are often just a public transport cost away from their university? Many regional families rely on their children meeting the independent criteria, the gap year, to afford the significant addiMAIN COMMITTEE tional cost of educating and accommodating their children or child at a metropolitan university. Lindsay Electorate: Queen’s Birthday Honours Recipients in my community who received Queen’s Birthday honours. I would like to acknowledge Barry Walsh OAM, John King OAM and Ronald Richter OAM. Joan Reese was made a Member of the Order of Australia posthumously. I would also like to acknowledge Keith Rhind OAM and Reverend Peter Kilkeary OAM, who were residents of the Blue Mountains but have also been an important part of the Lindsay electorate for many years. To become a Member of the Order of Australia, or to be conferred with any of the nation’s highest honours, is a demonstration of a person’s contribution to his or her profession or cause, and their community. These people come from all walks of life; they are our stars, our quiet achievers. All of these individuals have shown their dedication and their strength of character and I congratulate each one of them for their work. Barry Walsh OAM is known to many people as the face of Penrith Panthers. Barry is the current chair of the Panthers board of directors and has been in that role for the last 10 years. He has overseen some major changes to the Panthers group and has seen the odd premiership win. He is also the chairman of the Panthers on the Prowl Community Development Foundation, something I know he is passionate about. I look forward to working closely with him on that in the future. Keith Rhind OAM is another Penrith Panthers luminary. He played for Penrith from 1963 to 1966, and moved to managing the club for more than two decades as a member of its board, including being chair and deputy chair. Keith has been instrumental in mentoring junior players and is a life member of the club. John King OAM is a fire and emergency services volunteer who has served his community for more than 40 years. He has been a member of the Regentville Bushfire Brigade and a member of the Rural Fire Service Protocol team. He has also volunteered at the Sydney Paralympic Games and at the Australian Wheelchair Tennis Open. He currently volunteers as a bus driver for Penrith Council and the Penrith RSL Ladies Auxiliary. Ronald Richter OAM was recognised for his contribution to athletics. Thirty years ago Ronald started taking his children to Little Athletics and has been volunteering ever since, including volunteering at the Olympics and for Athletes with a disAbility. Joan Reese OAM passed away in February this year. She was a dedicated history research volunteer for more than two decades and was also a recipient of the New South Wales Premiers Senior Achievement Award in 1999. Reverend Peter Kilkeary OAM has worked in churches all over Sydney including the Penrith Baptist Church. Although he now lives in Winmalee, he still ministers to people in my local community including the sick and injured at Nepean Hospital. I pay tribute to each of the Queen’s Birthday honours recipients in my community. I thank them on behalf of the people in my community for their tireless work. They are indeed our shining lights.

215,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.51 Am),"I rise to pay tribute to a number of local residentsMitchell Electorate: New South Wales Land Acquisition ing of an amendment to the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act in the New South Wales parliament this week. This act was allegedly passed by the New South Wales parliament in order to overcome some unintended consequences of two provisions of the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act that they thought were revealed by a recent High Court decision. This High Court case, which was a very important case to my mind, said that the Parramatta City Council did not have the right to compulsorily acquire land belonging to two business owners in the case of the Grocon development. Mr Fazzolari, the owner of an adjoining property, and Michael Winston Smith, had been fighting since their High Court victory in April to stop the government amending the law to allow the Parramatta council to acquire their land and transfer it to a Melbourne developer Grocon as part of a joint $1.6 billion residential, retail and public space development. This is a retrograde step for property rights in New South Wales and in Australia. I find it distressing that a group of business owners who have property there and who sought just terms from the council could have won their case in the High Court and then have the state government, in a heavy handed way, change the law. An analysis by Maureen Peatman, a partner from Hunt and Hunt lawyers who ran the successful appeal to the High Court, of some of the changes that have been proposed and now enacted into law by the state government says large numbers of private properties could potentially now be acquired by councils under the changes agreed to by parliament. This ought to be of great concern for all landowners across New South Wales. As I say again, large numbers of private properties could now be acquired by councils under the changes agreed to by parliament. An amendment to this legislation was proposed by the opposition and that amendment was accepted. The amendment said that it would ensure that councils would not have the power to acquire land for purposes that are private and not public. Indeed, in the second reading speeches of many of the members, they expressed the hopeand ‘hope’ was a word that was used quite often-that the government would not abuse this change, these amendments, that were being proposed to the act. I want to reflect this morning that I do not have a lot of hope in our state government-this state government or any future state government in New South Wales-not to abuse that. There is now a grave concern for private property owners across New South Wales as a result of this retrograde piece of legislation being passed. Throsby Electorate: Nation Building and Jobs Plan Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (9.57 am)-The government’s stimulus package has been derided by many opposition members as a wasteful cash splash. Nothing could be further from the truth, as one of my constituents explained to me in recent correspondence. He wrote: I am aged 64, of Aged Pension age in mid-July. My wife “currently” works at Bonds at Unanderra and we have two teenage girls at high school. I have been unemployed for nine years despite every effort to obtain employment. On 22nd DecemberI had to get a $500 advance from Centrelink in order to manage food and other necessities over the Christmas period. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Constituency Statements
216,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (9.54 Am),"I rise this morning to express my dismay at the passThe government’s second stimulus payment early this year gave me funds to enable me to start a business. Whilst the needs were trivial, they were nevertheless out of reach, given our parlous financial position. It enabled me to pay $80 to a Warrawong printer to print one thousand flyers, and to pay $44 to a Barrack Heights distributor to home-deliver the one thousand flyers in the Shell Cove area. On the first day of delivery of the flyer I have secured two clients. The nett taxable, GST-payable receipt by me will be $690 per client. The stimulus payment therefore has: (1) Enabled me to resurrect a basic home-based services business (2) Give business to a local printer, hopefully on ongoing basis (3) Give business to a local home-based brochure deliverer, again on an ongoing basis … … … … the stimulus payment has seen business flow to three business operators, ASIC, the NSW OFT, the ATO, and has produced a payment saving to Centrelink. He goes on: The stimulus payment has also enabled one of the clients, a very good chef employed part-time by a Shellharbour City Centre restaurant, to have funds enabling him to commence a business at Thirroul employing local staff and operating a bistro in a local club … … This will enable him to end his Newstart arrangements and he will be making GST and income tax payments to the government. He will be employing and training local staff and buying goods from local suppliers. I shall also be doing his accounting and BAS returns, again a positive cashflow situation for me. The stimulus payments were not just about retail spending. I thought you may be interested in how it had other effects on two recipients in the local region. If that was multiplied a few hundred thousand times across the country it would be good, don’t you think? Thank you for giving me a new start off Newstart Mr Rudd and Mr Swan. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Committee Report Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by Ms King: That the House take note of the report. sometimes tease me about it-that I am a bit of a train freak. I think we in Australia have totally underestimated the capacity of rail to do all sorts of tasks, whether it be carrying freight, whether it be modern passenger services, whether it be bulk commodities being hauled to port. In the last parliament I chaired an inquiry into Australia’s arterial road and rail systems and their connectivity to the ports. SoI take this matter seriously. It is true that if we could vastly improve both the capacity and the speed of rail we could make a huge indent in the amount of traffic on our roads. It is not an easy task and no-one should pretend that it is. On the other hand, we have figures that show the volume of freight MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Constituency Statements
217,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Kj Thomson),Order! In accordance with standing order,142,Committees
218,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.00 Am),"I think it would be fair to say-and my colleaguestraffic on Australian roads is going to double in the next 20 years and we already know the problems throughout Australia because of that. The report I just referred to talked about how almost every port in Australia has some form of connectivity deficiency, and in many instances that is rail. The fact that the government, in its recent major infrastructure packages, has spent a lot of money in the Hunter Valley is proof positive that rail really has to be upgraded. I am disappointed both with my own side of politics and with the government’s recent infrastructure outlays in that we are not doing more about inland rail from Melbourne to Brisbane. That would make a huge impact, not only on national efficiency but also on national safety in the number of trucks it would remove from roads into hubbing systems, which would be far less dangerous and far less onerous on the surface of our roads. We all know that roads crumble very easily if they are not maintained all the time. SoI am a strong believer in that. What goes hand in hand with an improved rail system is technology. For many years now-and I understand it has now been corrected-we have had the old, virtually 19th century, regulations between Brisbane and the New South Wales border on the standard gauge line, where the drivers or firemen would have to get out of the cab of the train and put the passing key into the device. It is 19th century technology and it was still being used until comparatively recent times on one of Australia’s busiest rail systems. We have to get beyond that. Also, we have got to recognise that trains are moving faster. The tilt train that is now operating in Queensland can travel at up to 160 kilometres an hour, and it does on some stretches. In fact, during the trials of the tilt train, a fully laden train, over a measured kilometre, at a place called Avondale, north of Bundaberg, was clocked at 211 kilometres an hour. That it is not European standard, but it is certainly much faster than anything we have ever seen in Australia. SoI come back to my problem. The technologies that have to go with that must be at the same level. ‘Technologies’ can mean all sorts of things. It can mean an integrated IT system of train identification and the working of points and passing lanes and the like being controlled at central locations on an electronic basis. The other thing that you have to look at if you have trains going a lot faster-and we have a lot of long trains now too, particularly coal trains and iron ore trains-is that level crossings have to be at a technological level that copes with those changes. Quite frankly, now they do not. The number of accidents that are occurring across Australia at level crossings is quite horrendous. We saw the recent case in Victoria. I am not for a moment disagreeing with the court or trying to apportion blame to any individual; I am just talking generically. You really have to ask yourself: if the level crossing identification had been better, might that accident not have occurred? Our committee, the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, decided to upgrade an earlier report by the corresponding transport committee in a previous parliament: the 2004 report about level crossings. I mentioned in my earlier speech on this matter that this was brought about by the heart-rending case of the mothers Merrilea Broad and Karen Morrissey, who appeared before us in 2004, having lost their children at a level crossing in Western Australia. It was a horrendous story. It possessed the committee to pull the level crossing component out of a road safety study and make it a MAIN COMMITTEE separate study. We went to lots of level crossings and looked at technology and made a lot of recommendations. Some have been implemented-particularly by the Victorian government, I might add-and others have not. In this report, we went over the areas that we have not dealt with for four years and had a look at what had happened. We travelled to Victoria, where we saw some very innovative work going on, particularly with rumble strips at level crossings. There are various forms of rumble strips, and I must say the Victorian ones are very impressive. You have a raised lump of bitumen, not to the extent of a speed bump but to the extent of a small mould. By setting those at a required distance, you can get a vibrating effect in the vehicle without causing it to run off the road or do anything like that. Inside the cabin-I know these sounds of mine might cause some trouble to Hansard-it creates a ‘bumpety, bumpety, bumpety’ effect. As you come to a level crossing, you are alerted to the fact that there is something ahead on the road. That similar technology is used in Queensland at T-junction roads coming into major highways. So, if you are turning into the Bruce Highway or the Pacific Highway, you will have that bumpety effect as you enter the intersection. You do not just come swinging into the intersection, thinking that it is perhaps another passive road like the one you have just come off. We can all do it-it is just a bit of inner tension, or because you do not realise you are coming into a stream of very fast traffic on a major highway, and you can very easily be lulled into a false sense of security. That happened to me just recently at a major intersection in my electorate. I did not realise I was right on top of the stop sign and, before I realised it, I was through it. So it is important that we have additional signals at these places. The rumble strip is one way of bringing level crossings to the attention of drivers, and I commend the Victorian government and think they should continue to pursue that-they did not want to have photographs in the report because they said that they are still working on it. I think it is worth commending the Victorian government and saying that all states should have a really good look at it. There are two types of rumble strips, and one is a mechanical one that comes out of the ground. Obviously, that is going to be much more expensive. You really have to work out whether you might be better with boom gates. That is another variation of it. Intelligent transport systems are also important. Two suggestions came before the committee, both of which I think are worth pursuing. One of them involved putting a special audio signal into GPS devices. I do not know if honourable members in the chamber have got those GPS devices in their cars, but if you have you will know that, as you get a couple of hundred metres from a school, you will get an audible signal coming through your GPS device. The suggestion is that, as drivers come up on level crossings, a similar audible device might alert them to that circumstance. Another one is to have the alert come through the radio system of cars and trucks, by having a permanent loop near level crossings. Those things were not possible 10 or 15 years ago; they are possible today. You have to weigh up the cost and technological difficulties against the possible outcomes. Another thing we found in this report was that there is very little uniformity of data between the states. If you want to seriously look at these things, you have to have uniform data, because that way you can have uniform solutions-and, more importantly, solutions that people recognise as they drive from state to state. I find that quite commendable, as well. Another thing we recommended was that, on major highways, there be an 80km/h limit as you come up on a level crossing. To some, that might sound a bit excessive-I think not; we MAIN COMMITTEE do have those things at schools. We drop the speed 20km/h in most states as you come up to a school during school hours. Why would you not do something similar at level crossings? I also want to talk about driver behaviour. When you look at the figures, the same sorts of things apply: inattention, weather conditions, alcohol-they all affect people’s behaviour at level crossings, as they do on the road in general. The idea-and I saw this in Gladstone, which at the time was in my electorate-of trucks using a z-pattern to go through boom gates is, to my way of thinking, just madness. A $6 million bridge was built in Gladstone which, although it is used for other purposes and has a long-term arterial aspect to it, covers three level crossings. One of the reasons for eliminating those level crossings was people playing Russian roulette with the boom gates. I think that there should be a mandatory suspension of licence for anyone who drives a vehicle through boom gates after they have come down. People should just lose their licence automatically for three months. If they cannot learn the sensible way, they have to learn the harsh way. I am normally not draconian about road rules and those sorts of things, but having people put lives at risk, including mothers with kids in bassinettes in cars, is just not acceptable. I commend this very good report. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Bradbury) adjourned. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson: That these bills be now read a second time. troleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2009. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to correct omissions in the act, which came into effect in November 2008, and also is intended to make a number of technical corrections, including to references to the act in other legislation. By way of background, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 provides for the injection and geological storage of greenhouse gas substances in Australia’s offshore areas-that is, those covered by the Commonwealth. The bill will provide for access and property rights for greenhouse gas injection and storage. Despite the constant assertions by the Prime Minister and the current government that the Howard government did nothing on greenhouse gas emissions, the fact of the matter is quite the contrary, and I was pleased that the Prime Minister finally acknowledged that in the House yesterday. I am surprised the Prime Minister had trouble saying ‘$3 billion’, because the ‘billions of dollars’ figures tend to roll off their tongues these days like they were just lolly money. But in the main chamber yesterday the Prime Minister did admit that the Howard government had allocated $3 billion to lowering greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Committees
219,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (10.16 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Offshore PeThe work that has been done to date on lowering greenhouse gas emissions in Australia was done by the previous government. That is a fact. The money that has been put into solar energy, the money that has been put into carbon capture and storage, the money that has been put into better efficiencies in coal fired power stations, the money that has been put into looking at ways in which we can improve the combustion of coal-the money that has gone into all those projects came from the previous government. It has taken the government 18 months to allocate money for new projects. As yet, no major sums of money have been spent building anything. There has been a great deal of talkand I know that many would not be surprised by that fact-about what the government are doing about greenhouse gas emissions. But the reality is that they sign things, they initiate reports, they establish a new institute that duplicates the previous institute and they do roundthe-world trips talking about what they are going to do. They say they are going to do a lot, but they have not done anything. The reality is, as is the case with this legislation which began development in 2005 under the previous government, that it is one of the real initiatives that will make a difference. I do commend the government for the work it is doing to ensure this bill operates correctly, but it highlights that bills of this nature-and this one is relatively simple-will continue to need amendment to ensure that they work. I will come back to that point a bit later. The provisions of this bill will authorise the injection and storage of greenhouse gas substances, as I say, in offshore waters. This means in essence the capture of carbon dioxide together with any substances incidentally derived from the capture or injection and storage process with the permitted and required addition of chemical detention agents to assist in the tracing of the injected greenhouse gas. What that means in layman’s terms is that, when you bury this gas and sequester it in the ground in these subterranean reservoirs or storage spaces, there will be a gas agent that will be put in there that can be traced so that we will know if that storage is leaking. I cannot emphasise how important this legislation is in regard to where we go in Australia, in particular in regard to the use of zero-emission coal fired power stations. Again, this government has said a lot about that but has not yet put any money into building one. I see it is allocated and I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy for providing me with a briefing yesterday, but what it says is that still this government is not providing enough money to build a series of zero-emission coal fired power stations. We have heard figures bounced around by the Prime Minister of somewhere between two, four and eight of these power stations being built by 2020. Let me apprise the House of what one of these power stations will cost. It will cost around $3 billion-about as much as a nuclear power station. They are an extremely expensive piece of kit. They are arguably almost double what it would cost to build the same size power station conventionally, as we call it, even using the latest superand ultra-critical boilers. These power stations are not efficient by nature-30 per cent of the energy they produce goes into capturing and storing the CO2. That CO2, as I mentioned, will be stored in these subterranean reservoirs. What we all need to understand about carbon capture and storage in relation to zeroemission coal is that it is extraordinarily expensive to build these power stations and extraordinarily expensive to run them. What the government is not telling the people of Australia is MAIN COMMITTEE that the price of electricity ex the power station will treble. It will go up threefold under their greenhouse gas emission program. Between the carbon price and the actual physical cost of building and running one of these power stations, people in Australia need to be aware that the price of electricity at the power station will treble. No-one is arguing with that figure. The figure is generally accepted to be in excess of $120 a megawatt hour, it is $40 currently and it is possible and accepted that the figure could in fact be as high as $150 a megawatt hour. That will bring into focus some of the folly of what this government is trying to do with the pittance that it has put into this technology in the 18 months that it has been in power. I say pittance as a relative term, but we need to understand that under the program which the government boasts about of somewhere between two and eight power stations having this technology by 2020 that, in fact, each of those power stations have a commercial shortfall or an economic gap, as they call it, of around $1 billion. And there is nothing that the government has announced to date that will cover that gap. Having covered that construction cost, they then need to be honest with the Australian people about what their electricity bills are going to be. Industry have got it worked out. They know that, between the CPRS, the rent and the actual cost of building these power stations, their power bills are going to go up significantly, and one of the great natural advantages that Australia has had as a country will be lost forever. Before any of our competitors move to this sort of regime, before we even know what any of our trade competitors are doing, Australia will be locked in through this ridiculous, poorly thought out CPRS to committing Australian consumers, in the case of industry, to an uneconomical price of electricity for those high-level consumers. We need at some stage to see the government be honest about the challenge that lies in front of them. CanI start by suggesting that they look at this publication, Powering Australia: the business of electricity supply. It has a wonderful photo on the front of a wind energy power station. I know there are some-not me, because I have an engineering eye, being an ex-farmer and someone with that sort of bent-who would say, ‘You have polluted the landscape with wind farms.’ I am not of that ilk. I believe wind farms, along with other forms of renewable energy, have an important role to play, but we need to understand that, given the remoteness of that power station, there are going to be added costs in transmission and energy lost, along with the fact that wind energy costs twice as much as coal energy now. We need to understand that, in terms of cost reduction, that technology is not going to see that figure alter dramatically.

223,Mr Ian Macfarlane,"I have done more on lowering greenhouse gas emissions thanally did, and then you can sit down with me with your environment minister and your other minister and you can compare notes. I tell you what: you are a couple of billion dollars behind-a lot of talk ahead, but a couple of billion dollars behind. We have actually put things on the ground, which you are yet to do. Coming back to the issue, whilst wind, solar, geothermal, wave and perhaps tidal have a role to play, Australia, as defined in this report, needs to build a thousand megawatts of electricity power stations every year from now until 2020. We need to know from the government how many of those power stations they actually think-not the ones they put in their speeches, not the ones they give in their media spin-will be coal fired power stations, how many of them will actually use this legislation, which is so critical to their survival, and then on what basis they will then tell the people what the price of electricity will be. What is all this going to cost the average person and the average household? While they are doing that and they are putting together their legislation, they should also address a couple of other issues in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and coal-fired power stations. They should acknowledge some of the points made by the Energy Supply Association of Australia, who actually know what is going on in energy supply. They should take very careful note of these four points, which the Energy Supply Association were talking to members of parliament about over the last couple of weeks. The first point is that there needs to be something done by this government to protect the balance sheets of stranded coal-fired generators through the allocation of additional permits. The way power stations are being currently treated by the CPRS, they will close, and the members opposite need to explain to their constituents what happens when the first coal-fired power station in Victoria closes in 2015. What is actually going to replace that baseload power? That is only six years away. That does not give enough time for a power station to be built that can use the legislation that we are discussing. What is actually going to replace that power station? We need to know how the government is going to protect the balance sheets of these coalfired power stations. We need to know if the government is going to deliver 10 years of firm emission caps to these power stations followed by a 10-year emission target range. Is it going to ensure that these power stations can convince the people who finance them, who lend them the billions of dollars to keep these power stations running, of what projections, costs and income these power stations have got? I need to emphasise that these power stations are not financed once in their lifetime; they regularly roll over their finance and refinance at various times. As anyone who knows anything about the power industry will know, these power stations are currently going through a round of refinancing. Some of the larger power stations will again be borrowing billions of dollars, at a time-as we are constantly reminded-of very, very tight lending. This money is borrowed both domestically and overseas. That borrowing capacity, which is already hindered significantly by the global financial crisis, will be made significantly more difficult by the CPRS. We need to ensure that the CPRS provides future settled contracts at permit auctions to enable liable entities to manage cash flows. There is going to be an enormous amount of money being paid by these power stations in advance. That is a cash-flow issue in the millions and millions of dollars. Power stations, in some cases, will need to secure up to $10 billion worth MAIN COMMITTEE of permits to continue to operate-that is $10 billion over and above the money they are drawing out of their normal refinancing regimes. Ten billion dollars-that is a lot of money. Even in the Prime Minister’s language that is a lot of money. We need to give these power generators the certainty they need or they will simply not continue to operate. We need the government to provide some assurance to coal-fired power stations that they will have a place in the future. This legislation is a very important part of that. It is a very important part of that because it not only provides the ability for carbon sequestration from landbased power stations, but it also provides the framework, in terms of what the state governments do. In that regard I am less optimistic, because the state governments, encumbered by huge debts, are looking with an eye of complete confusion on this issue. Looking at states like Queensland and New South Wales and Victoria, who rely so heavily on coal-fired power stations, I can only express disappointment in the way they are handling this issue. That disappointment, of course, does not stop there. We see a ridiculous situation where, despite the grand claims of this government, the Prime Minister’s own legislation does not take into account those first attempts at carbon capture and storage by power stations. We are seeing proponents like ZeroGen refused further assistance by both the state Queensland government-and I will not start on that or I’ll be here all day-and the federal government. We are still not sure if, under their new proposal, that project will get any money. What we do know for sure is that, despite this legislation, these new leading-edge projects will not get off the ground. This is because of the simple fact that this government, under its CPRS which has not got a practical line in the whole legislation, will simply tax these projects out of business through a carbon emission price. And when I say tax I mean that, when you do not have the technology to lower your greenhouse gas emissions any further, your emissions are still priced and you have to pay that price-and that is a tax. You have no way of avoiding it. It is as certain as birth and death. We have seen a ridiculous situation where ZeroGen-whose project aims at using this legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent from power stations and sequester carbon-still have to pay for the carbon for their pilot plant. Is this government fair dinkum about progressing zero-emission coal in Australia? Or is it, like a lot of what it does, just hot air? We have seen continual reference by this government to how important zero-emission coal is, but we have not seen any real action-a lot of talk; not much action. The government is very good at setting up another institute, particularly if the Prime Minister is about to go overseas, but at no time have we seen what it will actually do to get these power stations built. There is a number between two and eight that floats around, depending on who the audience is. We need to understand that there are none of these power stations operating in the world on a commercial basis now-zero. Nil. Zero. In the six years I was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, a great deal of money-real money, taxpayers’ money, hundreds of millions of dollars-was spent by the then government to progress this issue. We are still no closer now than we were five years ago, so we need to see this government get fair dinkum about it. Along with that, as a result of the CPRS, as this legislation comes into practice, as the cost of storing carbon gets added to the price of electricity and as the price of the carbon that is emitted is charged at the carbon price, we need to see what this government is actually going MAIN COMMITTEE to do to keep jobs in Australia. There is a lot of talk about jobs by this government. The reality is that unemployment is going to rise significantly and perhaps double over the next 18 months. Those are not my figures; they are economists’ figures. The member who spoke previously, who was here with me, showed me the latest economic predictions. They were being made by the same people who, 12 months ago, were predicting a bright future for Australia. What the economic picture seems to be, though-and there is no certainty of this-is that things will get tougher and jobs in Australia will be lost. At that point in time, you would think that a government that is fair dinkum about jobs-as it seems to be fair dinkum about carbon storage-would be making sure that this legislation, when put into practice, did not cost jobs in Australia through increased costs to business. There is no evidence to support that. There is no evidence to support the idea that the government has any understanding of the fact that trade-exposed energy-intensive industry will simply move overseas-that industries like aluminium, for instance, will simply not expand in Australia and that they will run down their physical assets to the point where they are no longer economical to run, in a cash-flow sense, and they will close. Who knows how long that will take? Maybe it will be 20 or 30 years, or 40 years, if we are lucky. In the meantime, we will see no more of those industries come to Australia. We will see no more pipelines for the Tomago aluminium smelter at Newcastle and no jobs for the people that will be thrown out of work in the resources industry or the coal industry as it is shut down by this government. It gets worse than that, because this week we have seen the release by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the effect that the CPRS will have on small business. It is sobering reading: As a consequenceof the CPRS and its effect on the small business sectortrade-exposed SMEs have limited opportunities to pass the costs on … We on this side of the House understand that explicitly. We know business because we are in it. We have done it. We are very good at businesses. We on this side of the House understand business. We know how to make money; those on the other side of the House know how to spend money. But as this report goes on, these businesses ‘have no way to pass on costs to their customers’: … but are not eligible for assistance under the proposed CPRS transition package. Increases in energy and transport costs will impact directly on SME employment and profitability. Employment-does that word ring a bell? It rings a bell over here. It goes on: The study finds that the CPRS in its current form will generate additional costs that would erode firm profitability by between 4 to 7 per cent … This is at a time when many economists are still predicting Australia will go into recession. We may have dodged the bullet last time. There is some suggestion that we may escape, but there is more suggestion that we still have a recession in front of us. The report continues: … the study shows that firms would likely need to reduce labour costslabour costs-does that ring a bell over the other side? It sounds like jobs going to me. Labour costs would need to reduce: MAIN COMMITTEE … by between: 4.4 per cent … and 8.1 per cent … on average for food processing SMEs; 7.4 per cent … and 12.9 per cent … on average for plastic manufacturing SMEs… I still do not have an answer from the minister for industry about how he expects Australian car manufacturers to compete. Plastic is a big component of Australian cars, along with electronics and steel. Steel and plastics will be subjected to the CPRS, and plastics with no compensation, and the manufacturers will be competing against the Americans, not to mention the Japanese, the Chinese, the Thais and the Europeans-although the European cars, while they are very good, always lose a slight competitive edge because of the location. But Australian manufacturers will still have to compete, particularly with the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Americans and the Thais. Car manufacturers in Australia will be paying this price on plastics, trying to compete with manufacturers in other countries. Again we hear this government say they are fair dinkum about a car industry, but they are quite happy to put it out of business with the CPRS. I will finish with these last few numbers. The chemicals manufacturing industry will have to reduce labour costs by between 1.8 and 3.2 per cent, and in the machinery and equipment manufacturing sector, which would include the car industry, we are going to have to see a 1.8 to three per cent cut in labour costs. Despite this legislation, despite the work that our government did when we were in office, the CPRS is going to destroy industry in Australia-not just the aluminium industry, not just the cement industry, not just the smelting industry but industries right down in the electorates of the people who sit over there. What we need is some honesty from this government. We need to see a situation where they will actually ensure that this legislation works-and, as I said, I commend the minister for his efforts on this. He is ensuring that, from his perspective, the legislation to sequester carbon is as good as it can be. There may be further work that needs to be done on it, and therein lies the salient point. As this opposition cooperates with the Minister for Resources and Energy to ensure that this small, simple piece of legislation which constantly needs amendments is amended to make sure it works, we draw the comparison to what it will be like trying to amend a CPRS that is basically flawed. This legislation is basically right. When it was introduced in 2005, it was basically right, but it needs a bit of tinkering. Here we are, four years later, doing that in good faith with the minister. What is it going to be like when we, the people responsible for the economic and social future of Australia, have to try and do the same for the CPRS? It will be full of politics, full of false promises, full of potential to destroy Australia’s economic future. We will do our best. We were a government with a record of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We reduced greenhouse gas emissions per megawatt hour of electricity produced. We did that. It will never be acknowledged over there. We gave the renewable energy sector a start. We were the ones who introduced the MRET, and it was working. What we are seeing from this government is a lot of talk, a lot of rush and a lot of politics about the CPRS. Using this legislation as a comparison, we should be very, very afraid of what the CPRS is going to do. It will be flawed from the day it is introduced. It will require constant amendment. We probably will not find out what the Americans are doing until after Copenhagen. The Waxman-Markey bill has to get through firstly the Democrats, then the Republicans and then the congress. The senate runs a parallel process. When it does get through, MAIN COMMITTEE we will have some idea of what we are up against there. We may then also have some idea of what we are up against with our trade competitors in Europe and Japan. We will still have absolutely no idea with regard to China, Korea, Thailand, India or a list of other countries which will give us competition in the industry sector which we will not be able to deal with and which will cost jobs here in Australia. Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (10.46 am)-Like the shadow minister, I rise to support the legislation before the House, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2009. As the shadow minister has identified, both pieces of legislation largely deal with technical and minor amendments which streamline requirements, provide clarification or reduce the overall regulatory burden on industry. These changes result primarily from three reviews of different aspects of the offshore petroleum regulatory system which have been conducted by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism over the past couple of years. Some of the amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act also arise as a result of amendments to the legislation in the Senate. I can reassure the chamber that there are no adverse effects on industry from these bills, or indeed any additional costs. It is interesting to see so many Western Australian members in the Main Committee at the moment. I think it is important to acknowledge how enormously significant the offshore petroleum industry in Western Australia is, not only to our state but to Australia generally. In the Western Australian economy, it is a $19.4 billion sector. About 69 per cent of Australia’s natural gas production and 70 per cent of crude oil and condensate production are located in Western Australia. Seventy-two per cent of Australia’s petroleum exploration expenditure in 2008 was spent in Western Australia. The industry creates significant wealth for the country, including through the employment of tens of thousands of Australians, some of whom are resident in my electorate of Hasluck. The industry underpins the revenue collection of governments and generates valuable export revenue. Particularly in the case of gas, it is also wonderful at replacing costly imported petroleum. It is a strong and vibrant industry and it is essential to the ongoing health of the Australian economy. Gas activities have been impacted by the economic downturn, with LNG imports having fallen in some countries and investment in production infrastructure having been delayed or deferred as a result of falling investment in gas based processing projects in Australia, although I think the long-term outlook is good and LNG demand, in particular in the AsiaPacific region, is expected to continue to increase. It may not increase at the growth rates previously envisaged, but I do think it will be a very positive future. I note in particular Woodside and the current Pluto project in the north-west of Western Australia, which is currently employing some 3,000 people-soon to increase to 4,500 in September-October this year. It is pleasing to see that sort of project development continuing even when there are significant pressures in the international economy. We know what enormous potential these gas projects provide to Australia, particularly in the areas of employment creation, investment and long-term infrastructure, with improvements in government revenues being perhaps amongst the most tangible. I know that the government is acting now to help Australian business prepare for the economic recovery and it is looking at ways in which we can introduce reforms and make other MAIN COMMITTEE changes that will promote investment in the Australian gas and mineral resources sector. In this area I would especially acknowledge the work of the Minister for Resources and Energy, the Hon. Martin Ferguson. It is quite clear that our role as a government in these circumstances is to look at what reforms we can make to best prepare Australian business for economic recovery. As the minister said in a media statement on 9 April 2009: Our role in the present economic climate is to deliver micro-economic reforms that get rid of red tape, reduce the cost of regulation, simplify the tax system, and get the balance right between taxation of production and consumption, investment and savings. In other words, we also need to ensure that we do the right thing by preparing the Australian workforce for the skills and jobs of the future in these industries. I have said how important this industry is to the Western Australian and Australian economies. I was also pleased to see the minister announce earlier this month the release of some 31 new offshore petroleum exploration areas and two special areas in Commonwealth waters. I think that is a reflection that you cannot promote project development opportunities in these industries without ensuring that you have a strong exploration industry. That is where project development opportunities come from, and I am pleased to see that those additional offshore exploration areas have been identified. Most pleasing for me was the release of the retention lease discussion paper a couple of weeks ago. I think it is a timely discussion to have in this sector. Yes, we have these wonderful resources available but we have to actually make sure that where companies have those leases they do eventually use them. I was interested to see the minister’s media release when he released the discussion paper. He said: The challenge we face is to realign the national interest of Australia with the commercial interest of investors. I have already flagged that my Department and I will apply a ‘use it or lose it’ principle to retention lease applications. That means we will rigorously apply the commerciality test to ensure gas fields are developed at the earliest possible time. The government remains strongly committed not only to open and transparent investment regimes and to looking at ways to promote project development in Australia but also to keeping the balance right with the national interest. I commend the minister on his agenda and on the progress to date in these areas. One aspect of the legislation deals with changes to the safety regulations covering pipelines. This will see pipelines being treated on the same basis as other facilities under the safety regulations and will see the removal of pipeline management plans and pipeline safety management plans from regulations. As such, the pipeline safety management plan levy will become a safety case levy. These changes in levy arrangements are set out in the bills, with amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act and the safety levies act. I think this is a positive change. I would make the general observation that this amendment ultimately will ensure that all facilities, including pipelines, will come under the general oversight or regulation of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority, and I think this is a good thing. It is certainly something that has been recommended in the past, by reviews during 2007. From a Western Australian perspective, having lived through the aftermath of the Varanus Island pipeline explosion in 2008-its terrible consequences in terms of the impact on business as well as domestic consumers-it is my hope that the changes to this legislation MAIN COMMITTEE in this regard will see a better system put in place for dealing with safety and the like in these areas. SoI commend and support those changes. There are also changes in the legislation dealing with an expedited consultation process on the granting of access authorities and making the joint authority the decision maker in relation to declarations of location and granting of scientific investigation consents. All of these changes are designed to streamline current arrangements and to ensure that the requirements of the act become less onerous and that there is less duplication. I think we all commend legislation which reduces a red-tape or regulatory burden. Again, I think this is a positive step in the right direction for these industries. The legislation also gives the Commonwealth government a role in the declaration of a petroleum location, which leads to an application for either a retention lease or a production licence. These decisions will be made by the joint authority. This is entirely appropriate, given that some of the exploration leases are over Commonwealth waters, and in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The changes to the greenhouse gas storage provisions of the act are to remove several inconsistencies and ambiguities arising from amendments made in the Senate. These changes are purely technical and make no policy changes to greenhouse gas storage related operations-although they do provide me with an opportunity to congratulate the Rudd government on the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute that was launched earlier this year. We know from media and other reports that this initiative has received strong and widespread international support. It is consistent with the government’s climate change strategy, which is designed not only to reduce our carbon pollution but also to help us adapt to the impact of climate change. We have to be involved in finding a global solution to the issues associated with climate change. I look forward to reading more about the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. As I said, it has received significant support globally, and of course we have seen a significant budget allocation to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture and storage projects globally. As I indicated, most of the amendments in this legislation are quite small, but together they will improve the effectiveness of the act and further streamline regulations. I commend the bills to the House. house Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2009, make amendments that are primarily technical but nevertheless deal with one of the great issues under debate in this House at this time-that is, the various aspects of greenhouse gas emissions and particularly, on this occasion, greenhouse gas storage. I find that a matter of great interest. It is also of interest that, when one consults the explanatory memorandum to the Offshore Petroleum Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill, under items 41 to 49 there is significant reference to, and extensive advice regarding, negligence as a fault in the criminal code that applies to certain matters of occupational health and safety. This is an ongoing trend in laying blame for negligence, particularly negligence by employers or other people in a position of responsibility, as part of protecting people and the generation of a safe environment. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009
224,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (10.59 Am),"These bills, the Offshore Petroleum and GreenI will take the opportunity to draw to the House’s attention the well-reported fact that we have an ongoing royal commission in Victoria relating to the tragic wildfires that occurred there last February. I have made a submission to that inquiry, but I have not yet had a phone call: ‘When are you coming to expand on your views, Mr Tuckey?’ It is all about the responsibility of the owner of the property to maintain a safe environment. I go as far as to say that blame must be apportioned. If the government of Victoria were a corporation, there would be no doubt that the members of the Parliament, as board of directors, would be currently being charged with criminal acts, because they ignored all the science of a hundred years or, if you like, of centuries of known and recorded Aboriginal practice. It happens to be a Labor government that is there now and they have been there long enough to have fixed the problem, but the blame goes well beyond that. In fact I have given evidence to a meeting of state ministers that I called to warn them of this, based on advice from our own firefighters who went to America. The ministers have known about it and at that meeting they refused to act. To use the words of one minister, applauded by the others, ‘If we’ve got to touch one tree, in terms of prevention, we won’t do it.’ So here it is: more legislation in this place to apply criminal sanctions to certain people under occupational health and safety rules and still not a mention of it down at the royal commission. They want to tear apart the firefighting services and everyone for their failure to protect people from a nuclear event. They could not be protected if they were anywhere near it. Total evacuation may have been a solution, but not to property, only to person. I just make that point because the opportunity is given to me by those words in this legislation. As the previous speaker from this side has been saying, the issue arises about greenhouse gas storage and the issue arises about greenhouse injection licences, which are specifically dealt with in this legislation. There are some interesting statistics, which I have developed, tested and had peer reviewed, if you like, regarding how we might achieve genuine greenhouse emissions reductions of 20 per cent without imposing a silly emissions trading scheme. It is referred to as a carbon pollution reduction scheme when all it is, in fact, is a derivatives trading scheme, the value of which I can only see accruing to the hedge funds and the screen jockeys who will be able to recover some respectability by practising, under the label of saving the planet environmentally, all the things that sent the world broke. I find that response to what I accept is a problem to be patently ridiculous. It is in fact a system that issues certificates to pollute. Some will be sold by the government accruing revenue apparently of about $11 billion, but we are told that the ordinary consumer and businessman will suffer no ill effects from that withdrawal of $11 billion from money that would otherwise be circulating to their interest. And then of course there is a significant and ongoing debate about the issuance of free certificates to industries principally referred to as trade exposed. As the previous speaker from this side said, nobody thought to put the car manufacturing industry into the mix and yet it is patently obvious that the American legislation will be much more generous in terms of the issuance of free certificates, exemptions or whatever you want to call them. That is the proposed legislation now before committees in the American congress. Therefore, for companies like General Motors that have now told General Motors Holden that they are on their own but ‘Good luck; we think you might make it’, the reality is that, MAIN COMMITTEE with a renewed business structure with gigantic capital subsidies from their government and relief from their employees health system that was costing them $1,500 a motor car, the suggestion that they are not going to come out and compete with their own subsidiary is laughable. Considering their mass market and everything else, they will knock spots off us. Even in its endangered state, the Chrysler company is, from my observation, on the roads already penetrating the SUV market, particularly in Australia with their jeeps. I cannot drive down the road for 10 minutes without passing a couple of jeeps or having them pass me. WhatI am saying is that the threat from this proposal that is in the Australian parliament has to be considered on a global basis. By the way, I have some admiration for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in some of the initiatives he has taken, but when he stands up in this place and says that farmers can be helped by initiatives in Australia and that their weather pattern is only going to change if we are able to reduce our emissions by 100 per cent it is of course farcical and it should not be said. We have an international obligation; we should not be the world leaders. Our emissions as other nations grow will be one per cent, not even the existing 1.4 per cent. When you look at those facts of life, it is questionable that we should have a system that allows people to buy certificates to pollute and make a judgment what they do thereafter. If you are running certain businesses with a captive market, what are you going to do? You are going to pass on the price. They cannot get away. Of course, you eventually get down to the household consumer or the primary industry farmer and they pay up because they have no-one to whom they can pass on those costs. I laugh when we hear these business calls for certainty, so they can make up their mind whether they stay or leave the country, so that they can start to reorganise their investment because China are not going to have an ETS. China are going to have, as already ordered, 20odd nuclear power stations which do not emit greenhouse gas. China have built the Three Gorges Dam as a huge resource of hydropower and now they are building a 2,000-kilometre high-voltage DC line because they know they can transmit energy along that line with practically no energy losses and therefore of course no associated emissions. We are talking particularly about greenhouse gas and we are talking about greenhouse gas storage. On a scale of one to 10, I have had to ask myself: how would you best achieve outcomes in this regard and where would you invest government money? Please remember we have just had a disposal through borrowing of $24 billion by way of $900 cheques to the citizens of Australia. Has anybody asked themselves: had that money been invested in practical measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases would that not have been a better outcome for our kids? We could have invested it in jobs in Australia. Most of the technology would be developed in Australia, notwithstanding that none of it has to be invented. In the remaining minutes available to me, I want to take the opportunity to point out what you can do to reduce greenhouse emissions just by changing your business pattern. Australia has 25,000 kilometres of natural gas pipelines and the gas is put through a compressor stationed every 1,000 kilometres along the line. They are used to keep the gas moving in the pipelines. Gas will not travel on its own. The compressors literally suck gas out of the pipeline and drive gas turbines to recompress the gas and move it on for another 100 kilometres or whatever down the pipeline. Those compressors emit 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per 1,000 kilometres-in other words, some 7½ million tonnes of emissions are associated with MAIN COMMITTEE those natural gas pipelines. A significant amount of that gas-in the case of Western Australia it is about 30 per cent of the gas pumped down from the Pilbara to Perth-is then turned into electricity in gas turbines. Along that pipeline, 250 megawatts of electricity is burnt up, which is equal to one Collie powerhouse in our state. Having burnt up the gas, the gas is then taken out at the end of the pipeline, turned into electricity and, in some cases, sent a third of the way back up that pipeline in the form of highly inefficient high-voltage AC power-not DC power. AC power is known for its inefficiency. It is known that a transformer must be placed every 20 or 30 kilometres, and that consumes energy. Why would you do that? The Premier of WA, recognising the need for additional electricity for the Perth metropolitan area-and there is nothing wrong with that-is proposing another 200 megawatts of power generation at Kwinana, just south of Perth. He has just learnt a lesson, and that is: to send any more of that power up to the mid-west region in my electorate, he needs to spend $700-odd million on an AC powerline that is going to waste a lot of electricity. The other day in a flash of inspiration, he said, ‘Why’-considering, of course, that the gas pipeline travels through that country-‘don’t we build the powerhouse up here?’ Fine. But the real question is: why not build it on the beach where the gas comes ashore? Instead of using a highly inefficient gas pipeline to pump the energy to where someone wants to consume it, why not use a highly efficient electrical line known as high-voltage DC? I might add that currently such a line crosses Bass Strait for the simple reason that you cannot put transformers in the sea. It happens to be an electrical system that can carry electricity transmissions in either direction. Just by changing that system, you no longer need to have emissions involved in the construction of gas pipelines. You do not build these steel pipelines without emissions. The member for Solomon would probably not like to be reminded that, if they take that gas across the sea from Inpex’s deposit in the Browse field to Darwin, there will be a huge emission requirement during the construction of that greatly elongated pipeline. I hear greenies standing up every day saying, ‘The Browse gas shouldn’t go to the Kimberley coastline’-the shortest possible distance-‘it should be pumped under the sea all the way to the Pilbara.’ I have just stated the sorts of emissions that will achieve. But does that worry Missy Higgins? Missy Higgins has a tax deductible house in Broome, where she goes to get inspiration in the wintertime. She wants to be a protester-excuse me-and there are two or three others standing beside her. Of course, if she got swine flu while she was up there she would expect the Western Australian taxpayers, who are denied payroll tax and things if these projects do not go ahead in their state, to fund the Flying Doctor Service to get her to a hospital-yet to be built. And good luck to Darwin in getting the Inpex project, but that has cost Western Australia the funding of the Fiona Stanley Hospital in the lost payroll tax. These protestors sit up there and want the roads and want the hospitals, but want the area to be left as a pristine environment. I think the beach involved at James Price Point is pretty, but let me say that there are 6,000 kilometres of coastline in the Kimberley-1,000 as the crow flies and 6,000 if you walked it. Someone wants two kilometres of it to invest in our future, and these people are up there carrying on about it. Excuse me-it is quite silly. It is to the credit of the new government that they have that project going forward. WhatI am really saying is that we keep reading so much-the member for Hasluck made mention of it-about carbon capture and storage. I only went to school until I finished my leaving, but I was lucky enough to go to Perth Modern School and I came out with distincMAIN COMMITTEE tions in science, physics, applied maths and English, if you like to know. I shudder in this place when I hear the grammar that is used these days. But what I learnt-and I passed in economics too-from my physics was that you cannot destroy an element, and carbon is an element. The fact is that you can at considerable cost, and the technology is yet to be proven. The last time. I heard from the CSIRO they said, ‘Oh yeah, you can do this; it will only consume 20 per cent of the production of the power station.’ That is a matter of physics. It is not a matter of getting the accountants in to find out how you can reduce that by half; it is a physical fact. So why would you be rushing around trying to prove that point? There is certainly a place for coal in generating power and energy for Australia. All we have to do to meet international commitments is reduce the relative amount we use. The gas people in Darwin said the other day, ‘We can give you a 20 per cent reduction if you just go on progressively using the gas.’ We want to achieve a massive reduction in automotive emissions and we move to electric cars, and hydrogen fuel cell cars still require electricity. We are going to have to double our generating capacity. So, in the process, why not use renewable power like the Kimberley tides that have genuine substance, why not use natural gas, why not use the other forms of renewable energy, as unreliable as some of them might be, so that by 2020 the relative component of coal-fired emissions is dramatically reduced? Nobody in the world is talking about reductions of 50 per cent. But of course if 50 per cent of your electricity was produced from renewables and you retained the benefit of the other 50 per cent being used by the cheapest possible product, coal, you have an outcome, and you have not taxed industry into submission and you have not put people out of business. In fact, over time you will achieve lower electricity prices from those renewable resources as the capital is written down, which nobody contemplates. We keep having this silly argument that somehow you can have an emissions trading scheme and immediately the business community will comply. They will stop emitting carbon. No, some will pay for it and some will leave town and make their emissions where there is a more compliant regime. And take it from me there will be plenty by one means or other. (Time expired) say that I am getting used to hearing the rhetoric about what we should be doing and when we should be doing it but never, ever making a start. If the Howard government had got re-elected, boy, would they have had a fantastic 13th year! They had these opportunities, so it is no longer just a point of rhetoric. The member for O’Connor was right: there are alternatives that must be considered. The truth of the matter is that going forward in the overall energy debate for this country is going to require a suite of technologies; it will not be any particular one. As legislators, we need to ensure that we have a regulative environment that encourages the commercialisation of each of those technologies that will play a part in the future energy needs of this nation. Having said that, I say that the simple reality is that 80 per cent of Australia’s electrical power is now generated from coal. Therefore it does require a serious response if we are to be serious in addressing climate change. I sat through a series of reports about climate change that came down at the dying end of the Howard government. One of the reports we looked at was about carbon capture and storage, or geosequestration as it is called. I also recall a dissenting report that came from various members opposite whose dissenting position was based on the fact that they saw no discerniMAIN COMMITTEE",154,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009
225,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.19 Am),"I listened intently to my colleague’s speech. I have toble evidence that humankind had made any adverse impact on the environment, climate change et cetera. They wanted evidence on that, based on some reliable information they had on what was occurring not on earth but on Mars, Venus and Pluto-if the latter is still part of the solar system. It was that ridiculous. Regrettably, the person concerned, the member for Tangney, only yesterday wanted to interject to the Prime Minister and again reiterate that, in his opinion, there is no evidence to support climate change as being anything other than a natural phenomenon. Whilst we have people like that opposite, who were in the former government, it is no wonder that in their 12 years of government nothing happened to address climate change. The establishment of carbon capture and storage as a response to power generation in this country and the fact that we are still carbon dependent is absolutely critical. I know others will argue that this is a technology that is still very new. I know the Greens will argue that by going down this route all we are going to do is further legitimise coal-fired power generation. I say to those opposite: we do need to make that start; this is not new technology-absolutely not. It is just that we are going to change the way we deal with the emissions from, in this case, coal-fired power stations. We can do this by using a network of pipelines to transmit the residue of the liquidised carbon to, I think, a bit over three kilometres offshore and then store it either in geological structures or, alternatively, using depleted oil and gas reservoirs, as they are doing in Bass Strait. If people are going to argue, ‘Is that the sole answer?’ I still stand by my initial comment: it is not going to be the sole thing that is going to deal with our future energy requirements, but it is certainly one essential technology that will contribute to this country in doing two things if firstly, being able to have competitively priced coal for export and, secondly, ensuring that those energy dependent industries that we are establishing or wish to establish in this country for the future have the energy they need to develop their enterprises and employ those Australians who are working for the further betterment of this country. So whilst this is part of a suite of technology, it is a crucial element for pressing ahead. Coal currently provides 80 per cent of Australia’s power generation capacity, and on a world scale it is 40 per cent. The member for O’Connor referred to the commissioning of new nuclear power stations, which is occurring in China. The reality is nuclear power currently contributes 16 per cent of world power generation. We understand all that, but the fact is coalfired power generation is still seen as the effective, viable, affordable form of power generation into the future. Therefore if we are going to have a part in that cycle, if we are going to benefit from exporting coal to the world, if we are going to want to attract those industries and make them competitive by using coal-fired power, we then have a responsibility to ensure that we do everything that we can to ensure that the industry functions as cleanly as possible and that amelioration of carbon is given priority in future construction within that industry. So while coal’s share of future power generation in Australia will decline-and there is no doubt that it will decline in favour of renewable energy and less greenhouse-intensive fossil fuels, such as natural gas-that is one of the areas in which we are very fortunate. From statistics I read only recently, on current usage we have in excess of 135 years’ supply of natural gas, and that is provided we do not find another supply of natural gas in the meantime. Natural gas will probably be the feed stock as we move closer towards a hydrogen economy into the future. Having that degree of natural wealth is going to be important for this country. MAIN COMMITTEE Years back when I had some involvement in the oil industry, working up and down the North West Shelf and into the Timor Sea and those areas, I saw the looks of exasperation on the faces of managers of companies, such as Santos and others, when they drilled and hit natural gas. That is not what they were looking for. They were looking for oil. We have so much in terms of a plugged gas supply at the moment until we discover more and reliable markets. Again that will come as part of the suite of technologies that will move to replace or reduce our dependence on coal-fired power. The International Energy Agency, which monitors and looks at these forecasts, is indicating that the demand for energy will grow but it still forecasts that coal-fired power will be the essential form of power generation into the future. As a matter of fact, according to the International Energy Agency’s statistics, coal will provide around 44 per cent of world electricity needs by 2030. By the way, that is an increase on the current share. If that is going to increase we need to be a part of the solutions based around clean coal technologies, because our livelihood is steeped in the fact that we are the world’s largest exporter of coal. In the period 200506, we netted $240 billion from our exported coal. We are the world’s largest exporter. Not all that long ago I went up to visit one of my sons working in Queensland, up at Blackwater, and I actually saw the extent of their operation up there, and that is why we do need to commit resources into ensuring that our infrastructure enables us to meet world demand. And that was only on one site. A lot of this country’s wealth generation is based on coal. The industry directly employs about 30,000 people and indirectly employs millions because various areas of industry out there are operating in this country because we have competitive, affordable access to energy, and the aluminium industry would be just one. All these things are very significant. It is also very significant to note, when talking about finding new technology for coal fired power, to realise we have about 350 years supply of premium grade black coal on current usage, including our exports. We have 800 years supply of brown coal. Maybe that is not a most favoured realisation for those in the Greens, but as a commodity coal is something that we are well endowed with. This means that we should be the world’s leader in developing clean coal technology, and that is essentially what we are trying to do by, firstly, developing carbon capture storage and, secondly, giving weight to the less greenhouse gas polluting fossil based industries such as natural gas. This technology-and it is not new; it is not new theory-involves reinjecting carbon into either depleted oil and gas reservoirs or, alternatively, into the depleted Esso field in Bass Strait or the Pluto field on the North West Shelf, where the proposal is to inject carbon about 1.5 metres into the substructure, into geological formations. The Greens actually posed the question in one of the inquiries: we are going to store a pollutant and does that break down. The answer is probably no, it does not break down. Those reservoirs under there, particularly the oil reservoirs and gas reservoirs, are full of carbon, and they have been there now for millions of years. That is what we have been tapping. I think using that depleted reservoir in Bass Strait to store future supplies of liquefied carbon will be very successful. This does require leadership and I am glad the shadow minister is here because I am sure he will want to talk a little bit about the CPRS, and I will invite him to do that because his colleagues in the other place are not going to do it. They have avoided a vote on CPRS; they have avoided actually making a standMAIN COMMITTEE make a difference. As the member for Mayo would appreciate, the government that he advised over a period of timemount to this country, but they did not take them to an election. And they had Work Choices. Where did they stand on these issues? Where did they stand on the position of low-polluting coal power generation? Where did they stand on those environmental things? They had words-and we heard the former shadow minister speak a little earlier-but no commitment. It is all very well to say, ‘We were going to do that.’ They are a bunch of ‘gunnas’-they were ‘gunna’ do that eventually! They were going to do that in their 13th year! That 13th year would have been a hell of a party. Can you imagine the pop of champagne corks going off everywhere! They had 12 years to muse on these things. They had 12 years of trying to get set in their minds what they were going to do when they got to their 13th year. I am sorry, guysyou missed the party. But it is not all bad news for you; you are still here as bona fide representatives of your electorates in the federal parliament of Australia. You can still play your role in speaking about the future for this country. You can still have a voice-except that your Senate members do not want it. They said: ‘Let’s not exercise our voice. Let’s vote to not have a vote.’ That is democracy at its greatest! I know that the legislation before us is probably not the best legislation to have the argument on, because it only makes minor technical changes to the bill, but I invite the members opposite to think about this: it actually goes to the heart of what this government is determined to do something about-reducing our emissions. This government is determined to make a start, a critical start, in environmental protection. These are not things that should be taken for granted. They require action. The time for simply musing, talking and debating is rapidly departing. We see the statistics. We see what the world attitude is. We see what the position of the Americans is. They had eight years of a Bush administration, which did not want to deal with this issue at all. Since the Obama administration has come in they have put a line in the sand and said, ‘We are going to do it.’ I certainly wonder what the Liberals would have done in their 13th year, when they would have had to react to Obama. They could not have taken instructions from George Bush anymoreor could they? That really would have been the tail wagging the dog. It is now our turn to get in on behalf of Australians and make the difference. The CPRS is critical. It is critical that we put a price on carbon. The opposition had a policy for putting a price on carbon which was never implemented. We are now implementing it. They cannot argue this on the basis of: ‘We refuse to argue it. As a matter of fact, we refuse to talk about it in public and we will definitely not vote on it.’ The issue of affordable power is essential in this country. We are an island which is a long way from our trading partners. One of the things that we use to attract industry is our affordable power. Industry wants to be able to use that, and coal will have an essential place in the mix. I shuddered when, not that long ago, in the lead-up to the last election, Senator Brown wanted a mandate to shut down coal exports within three years.

They thought many things were absolutely paraSpeaker, I do not aspire for my kids or my grandkids to have earthen floors and thatched roofs or to reduce our standard of living, which has been underpinned by cheap power in this country. If we are to maintain our position in relation to cheap power we need to ensure that we have the appropriate technologies available which allow us to maintain cheap power production on a more environmentally friendly basis. Therefore, carbon capture and storage provides a critical element in the forward planning and the forward development of the electrical power generation industry, the coal fired power generation industry, in this country. It is critical. We all know that there are costs associated with that. There is no point putting our heads in the sand and saying: ‘This won’t cost anything. It’ll just happen.’ We understand the position that has been put by the member for O’Connor, but we need to be serious about being a player on the world stage. Bear in mind that, whilst the opposition takes the view ‘Let’s wait for the Americans’, we are the world’s No.1 exporter of coal. That is our basic bread and butter. We should not sit back and wait for someone else to tell us what to do. Things have changed. It is now time for decisive leadership.

It is a part of the process of ensuring that we move Australia and, more importantly still, the world’s energy generation sources to a low or zero carbon emissions base. That is the goal, that is the objective, that is the responsibility, and that is what will occur. The only debate is around the time frame, but that outcome will occur over the course of the next half century-be in no doubt. The task is to do it in a way which is most effective with regard to environmental outcomes, and most efficient with regard to the costs imposed on our society and on other societies. The task is also to do it in a way which means that no one generation or no one country or society bears a disproportionate load. That is the context. In addressing this bill, I want to proceed in four steps: firstly, to look at the great global challenge; secondly, to address the challenge we face and our response as we move towards a clean energy sector; thirdly, to deal with some of the impediments; and, fourthly, to deal with this particular bill’s contribution. The global challenge is simple to understand. At this moment, at this point of history, what we see is 40 billion tonnes of CO2 or equivalent gases being put into the atmosphere every year. That figure is on the increase as China and India grow and add 800 new coal or gas fired power stations over the next five years. That is the grand historic moment which we face at present. The goal and objective, which we have sought for over two centuries, of seeing the eradication of poverty and the development of developing societies is part of that process. It is the grand historic paradox: as people come out of poverty, they consume more electricity and energy and, as they do this, they create CO2 emissions. That is, sadly, the great paradox of history, which brings us to this tragedy of the commons. And that is the issue which has been part of the great work of my life-coming back from a thesis in 1990 on the different approaches to reducing carbon emissions, whether it was a carbon tax or an emissions trading MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009

231,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.39 Am),"In rising to support the Offshore Petroleum and Greenscheme. That has been part of the work of my life, and I have been happy to place my political career on hold along the way in order to make the case publicly. Having said that, with this great challenge of 40 billion tonnes of CO2, with this great challenge of 800 new coal and gas fired power stations, with Australia’s responsibility at present being about 1.4 per cent-or 560 million tonnes-of CO2 per annum out of a total of 40 billion tonnes, we then say, ‘How do we address this problem?’ We know that energy generation for stationary energy produces approximately half of global emissions and approximately half of Australian emissions. We also know that deforestation-primarily driven out of the great rainforests of the world-accounts for a wedge of 8 billion tonnes, or approximately 20 per cent of global emissions. When you look at the great historic passage over the next 50 years, we proceed in three stages. First, we can halve deforestation. We can take that 8 billion tonnes of CO2 per annum, reduce it to 4 billion tonnes, and reduce global emissions by 10 per cent through a global rainforest recovery program. That is achievable, it is desirable, and it has collateral environmental and biodiversity benefits of an enormous scale. That can be achieved over the next five years. The United States, to their credit, has picked up the proposal of a global rainforest recovery program, which we had in government, for which Malcolm Turnbull, Alexander Downer and I announced a $200 million program, and which we pursued. We did it after discussions with Tim Flannery-and I pay credit to Tim Flannery for coming to us with that program, which was announced in early 2007. Having said that, the second great stage is the cleaning up of our global energy sources, and the third great stage is the cleaning up of our transportation fuels. These are all opportunities which we can pursue over the coming half century. The staging is not absolute, there will be overlaps, we can do the immediate work with the Rainforest Recovery Program, this bill deals with part 2, the clarification, cleaning up and improvement of our energy sources, the transition to a clean energy economy. That then brings me to part 2, this notion of the clean energy economy, and there are really three elements to this concept alone. Firstly, there is the adoption of renewable energy, secondly, there is the transition to gas as a major fossil fuel base and, thirdly, there is the clean-up of coal fired power. Carbon capture and storage-which is underpinned by this bill, which amends work which we did whilst in government-is fundamental to the process of cleaning up our coal and our gas fired reserves. I say this because we can see that with a full carbon capture and storage program combined with drying and gasification, instead of about 1.2 or 1.3 kilograms of CO2 per kilowatt hour of energy, or 1.2 or 1.3 tons of CO2 or equivalent gases for each megawatt hour of energy generated from brown coal we can achieve about 0.1 or 0.2 tonnes per megawatt hour or, in other words, we can have an 80 to 90 per cent reduction in emissions. That is profound, that is a profound change. Similarly, if we do that with gas we are looking again at 0.1 or 0.2 tonnes per megawatt hour. Again, we are looking at a sea-change in emissions. That is the great change for Australia along with the process of biosequestration of soil carbons, of bio-char, of mallee and mulga revegetation-which Garnaut himself talks about as having a potential for 800 million tonnes of additional capture per annum against Australia’s current 560 million tonnes-in other words, the potential for Australia to be a net carbon sink. MAIN COMMITTEE We must clean up our energy because if we can do that in Australia we can take that technology to China and India, because it does not matter if we close down Australia if we do not deal with these great sources of China and India, which are multiplying in their emissions as they go through this historic development path, then we will not solve the global problem; there is no question about that. It is, for me, part of my life’s work to help address this issue. So that is I why I believe in the importance of carbon capture and storage. The member for Werriwa raised what is happening with enhanced oil recovery around the world, he was actually quite informed and I compliment him on what he had to say in relation to that. We know that in North Dakota there is an Australian firm engaged in some of the critical work here, the precursor work towards a major enhanced oil recovery program using carbon capture and storage. We know that the North West Shelf, through the work of Chevron with Gorgon, potentially with the Pluto project, is going to be a site of one of the world’s greatest carbon capture and storage programs. We know in Algeria, we know with the Sleipner field in Norway that carbon capture and storage is underway. The technological components are not that difficult, they are however expensive and so that is the challenge that we have. Having dealt with the second element of the clean up of energy, I want to deal with the issue in relation to some of the impediments. Recently, we have seen three setbacks. First, we have seen the abolition of the Solar Rebate Program in Australia cutting dead an $8,000 rebate on the same day, no notice, no warning, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunity, the loss of the capacity for mums, dads and seniors to immediately access solar power. der. It is becoming very rowdy in this place. There are ample opportunities to have your say in this House on behalf of your constituents. I will ask the members on my right to quieten down a bit and the members on the left to continue as they were. disappointed it was as unimpressive as it was. Let me answer the question, because I invited it. The solar rebate was introduced by us and it was increased to $8,000. The Prime Minister of the day said that it would be an uncapped system. We wanted it to be successful. The then opposition promised that they would maintain it. Once it achieved exactly what we set out for it to do, to expand the capacity of ordinary Australians to access solar energy, it was axed overnight in the 2008 budget by the minister for the environment the Hon. Peter Garrett, in breach of his own election promise and the Prime Minister’s election promise. It then happened a second time. The means testing was put in place in 2008; in 2009 – 2½ weeks ago – the program was axed immediately. Four weeks after the Budget Papers promised that it would be continued, it was axed. Three days ago we saw that the remote renewable power generation program, or the remote solar program, was axed retrospectively. The distributors received an email at 8.33 am saying that as of 8.30 that morning this program had been axed. The ability of people in Indigenous communities, the ability of people in the member for Solomon’s home territory of the Northern Territory, to access solar power in remote communities was destroyed overnight. It was destroyed at the same moment. That is proMAIN COMMITTEE",162,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009

I have three solar groups in my office today who have been devastated as a result of this decision and I have had approaches from communities throughout Australia who have been profoundly disappointed at the loss of this benefit. Having said that, we also see that the renewable energy target which would provide some means of responding to this has not even been brought before the House of Representatives for debate even though the replacement was due on 1 July. Today, the last day of sitting for the financial year, a year after that legislation was due, finally that bill is listed. We would have to sit until 2 am tonight until it could be brought on. No debate, no barriers-we had offered to pass this legislation. We had offered to bring it forward. At any time over the last year it could have been listed and we would have found a way to pass it. way? increased the targets in renewable energy in excess of what his government did for 12 years. it. The problem is that two years ago the other side talked about a 20 per cent target and we are now 18 months in, at death’s door. They did not introduce the legislation a year ago; they did not introduce the legislation six months ago; they did not introduce the legislation during the Budget sitting; they did not introduce the legislation three weeks ago-last Wednesday it came in. We were willing to debate, to work, to push, to find a way through. We committed to passing this legislation if there was real discussion, but what do we see – it is not listed until the final day of sitting in the financial year and that is a year late and even then it comes on at 2 am in the middle of the night. We do want a 20 per cent target; we do want to work with you on that; we do want to see the legislation passed. Unfortunately it is very hard to pass legislation which is not actually debated in the Parliament of Australia. So those are the impediments to a clean energy future. Finally-and this brings me to the fourth element-this bill, this day, this moment is a positive thing and I congratulate the government. It builds upon that which we have done in terms of creating an enabling environment for carbon capture and storage. It is a significant step forward, and when people from either side of this chamber take that significant step we should all have the good grace to acknowledge it. I think it is a good bill. I do not walk away from that. It builds on work which had previously been done, but it falls within the broader great global challenge-and I return to my beginning of 40 billion tonnes of CO2 and half of that coming from fossil fuel sources-the creation of stationary energy. As we bring the developing world out of poverty there is a grand, historic objective with a terrible paradox. My response is that we will work towards a global clean energy compact. This bill is an important part of Australia’s contribution. There are impediments-seemingly little things-but with real human consequences and poor environmental outcomes such as the abolition of the solar rebate program and the solar remote program and the delays to the renewable energy legislation. But we will solve all of those, and we will work towards a clean energy future.

You have talked aboutthe Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the cognate bill. and note his knowledge in the area of environment, carbon capture, greenhouse gases and the like. It was interesting to hear him say that he had to put his political career on hold while he has had this knowledge. If he can possibly do anything about preselection in the seats of Tangney, the Kimberleys and O’Connor, that might make it a little bit easier for him to get this vast knowledge out there in party room and to get a little bit of support. Probably from the member for Mayo, who would beMr Adams interjectingmental issues should be important to him as well, so maybe they can start to change the mindset of those opposite, when it comes to the environment and the different things that we are endeavouring to do as a government after waiting for 12 years and nothing happening. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the cognate bill propose to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Act 2003. The amendments are technical and minor policy changes which streamline requirements, provide clarification and will reduce the overall regulatory burden on this industry. It is certainly an industry that is very important to the Northern Territory. It is an industry that is growing in the Northern Territory and, obviously, with regard to the Inpex proposal that is moving forward there, there are also a number of other companies that are looking to invest in the Northern Territory and these types of changes will benefit them greatly. These changes result from three reviews of the different aspects of the offshore petroleum regulatory system which have been conducted by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism over the past two years. There are no adverse effects on industry from these bills or any additional costs, and I appreciate the fact that those opposite are supporting this bill. A number of the changes relate to altered arrangements for pipelines, commencing 1 January 2010. These arrangements will be set out in a revised regulation to come into effect next year. They will see pipelines being treated on the same basis as other facilities under the safety regulations. This will see the removal of pipeline management plans and pipeline safety management plans from regulations. As such, the pipeline safety management plan levy will become a safety case levy. This change in levy arrangements is set out in this bill, with amendments to both the act and the safety levies act. The removal of consent to operate a pipeline is part of these overall changes, and will also take effect from 1 January 2010. Several changes, such as providing a consultation process on the granting of access authority, and making the joint authority the decision maker in relation to the declaration of locations and the granting of scientific investigation consents, are designed to streamline current arrangements. Moving the power to vary coordinates based on the current datum from regulations into the act will streamline regulatory process. It is about cutting red tape. This bill is housekeeping, if you like, cutting through the red tape. It removes the data management plans and changes the timing notification of petroleum discoveries, reducing some of the regulatory burden that is already on the industry. Often some of these things have already been agreed to. MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009
241,Mr Hale (Solomon) (11.56 Am),I note the contribution from the member for Flinders,166,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009
242,Mr Hale,"Well, he is a young bloke and he has got a young family. I think environThey have been debated and discussed within industry. This bill streamlines the process of companies being able to move forward and get their proposals up and running. A couple of questions have been asked and I would like to talk to those for a moment. What are the advantages of allowing decisions on the nomination of a declaration of a location to be made by the joint authority? This authority will be able to streamline, as I said. Also, by making decisions on the nomination of the blocks and declaration of location joint authority matters, these amendments create a consistent and agreed approach on what is a key matter in the development of the petroleum title. The declaration of a petroleum location is a necessary step before an exploration company applies for a retention lease to retain title over a currently non-commercial discovery or applies for a petroleum licence to develop a commercial discovery. The granting of a retention lease and a production licence are joint authority decisions. This amendment benefits the petroleum industry, as agreement between the state, the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth from the outset on the location removes any potential conflict on the decision later in the development of the petroleum project. Overall, this provides more certainty and should not lead to longer decision making. Why is it necessary to change the authority for making decisions on setting conditions for scientific investigation consents and granting scientific investigation consent from a designated authority to a joint authority? The granting of scientific investigation consent helps Australia fulfil an international obligation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This convention provides that all states have the right to conduct marine science research on the continental shelf with the consent of the relevant coastal state. This can include petroleum exploration operations. Given this, it is appropriate that the responsible Commonwealth minister should be part of the decision to grant scientific investigation consent or to set conditions for such consent. Further questions may be asked in regard to why these amendments are being put in place. Why is it necessary to notify the discovery of petroleum in petroleum production areas? Why is the period for notification being extended to 30 days? The reason is that discoveries in exploration permit areas or retention lease areas are already required to be notified each year. Each year a few new discoveries of petroleum are found in petroleum production areas. It is therefore consistent to require the notification of these discoveries. However, the government is not seeking through this amendment to get further information on existing accumulations of petroleum but on new, discrete accumulations. The rule on immediate notification with a report on the discovery within three days, while not onerous, does not provide the government with useful information. Any discovery, whether commercial or not, is required to be notified. If a company has had no time to assess the discovery, and yet the company does not provide this barely-useful information, it has committed an offence. This amendment allows a reasonable period of time for a company to assess its data and ascertain what it has actually discovered by increasing it to 30 days. These rules will apply to the discovery of petroleum in greenhouse gas titles. An interesting part of this legislation is to increase that time required of companies on making a discovery. They are given that extra time, some 27 days further, so that the information can be compiled and is of substance, complies with the act-they are working to the letter of the law in regard to the discovery that they have made-and is able to be put forward to the MAIN COMMITTEE correct authorities. What happens to the funding for the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority if the pipeline safety management levy is removed? A levy will continue to be raised for pipelines, but as a safety case levy. New levy arrangements will apply from 1 January 2010, which will be the start of the next levy year following the passage of the amended bill. There are a number of other areas in this bill but, as I have said, it is a non-controversial bill. It is just a little bit of housekeeping to streamline and tidy up the act to make it better for industry and less complicated with less red tape that has to be worked through. I was listening to the discussion from those opposite and it was interesting to reflect on some of their comments and some of their own history on climate change. For me, there is no silver bullet to climate change. It is a matter of looking at carbon capture and looking at the emissions trading scheme as well as renewables. I was out doorknocking a couple of weeks ago-something that would be foreign to the member for Mayo, being in a safe Liberal seat, but when you are on 196 votes you have to go out and meet the punters-and a lady yelled out to me saying that she was very disappointed that we had dropped the emissions target from 20 per cent to five per cent. As she was verballing me over her fence, I noticed that she was using a Gerni to wash down her driveway. I thought it was quite ironic that she was washing down the driveway. I saw her a couple of weeks later at a school fete and I said, ‘I remember you as the lady with the Gerni,’ and she was a little bit sheepish. I have digressed. I will go back to what I was actually talking about. It is everyone’s responsibility to address their own energy consumption and their own use of water initially. The education programs that have been run by both sides of government are important in this debate and need to be addressed. In the Northern Territory we have a lot of rain, but we are in drought for probably six months of the year-we do not have any rain-and certainly we do waste a lot of water. To see somebody washing their driveway down instead of using a blower or something like that is indicative of the attitude when you live in an area that gets over 100 inches of rain in six months. There is no silver bullet when it comes to climate change. We need to continue to invest in the renewable energy sector-some $500 million is being invested in that-in clean coal technology and in carbon capture. We should also look at alternative sources of power-wind, geothermal hot rocks and tidal-in areas such as those of the member for Canning and other members from Western Australia. Big tidal changes go through Broome and Darwin, where you get seven-, eightand 10-metre tides. There are alternatives and we need to continue to invest in them. It is a real shame-it is disappointing when you are a new member in parliament and you do want to make a difference-that the CPRS bill is once again bogged down in the Senate. We are now not going to be able to get it through until the August sittings. It is just this blocking of legislation, and this is important legislation; yet, those opposite have blocked it in the Senate and decided not to have a vote. Ms Grierson-Dinosaurs! When we have the debate on economics and the opposition talks about debt and deficit, all you hear is: ‘The burden that is being placed on our children’ or ‘$9,000 for every man, woman and child!’ It is all this ‘burden of debt’ and gloom and doom and fear. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009
243,Mr Hale,"That is the problem-it is dinosaurs. It is a really narrow way of thinking.As we have seen this week, it has now gone from fear onto smear, and to the interjections we have had to the last speaker, when the member for Flinders was talking about not being able to debate the legislation. We have spent three days in this House bogged down in a debate about an email that was false, fake and fraudulent. We have spent three days wasting taxpayers’ money in this House when we should have been putting legislation through that would move this country forward; we have been bogged down in a grubby witch hunt. The only person that is really going to lose out from the whole last three days is the poor old Treasury official; I think everyone else will move on with their lives except that bloke. And we have spent three days doing it. Then we have those opposite saying, ‘We have no time to debate this’ and ‘We have no time to debate that,’ because we have just wasted so much time on this other issue that will end up coming to nothing by the end of the week. As I said, it will be one person that will pay the ultimate price for what has gone on this week. For what? Mr Briggs interjectingfrom what I have heard in today’s reports.

And let me also remind the members on both sides to address their comments through the Chair. about there. It is just typical of those opposite when it comes to issues like climate change. There are very few alternatives. I brought out a bit of paper to write down the member for Flinders’ alternatives and, as you can see, it is fairly blank. A global rainforest recovery program-yes, it has a nice ring to it and probably could work. Unfortunately, they had 12 years to do something about this but did nothing, and we are actually acting on climate change. We believe in climate change while, on their side of the House, they still have their sceptics. I know that it makes it very difficult for the member for Flinders-who has got an extremely good intellect and a real passion for environmental issues-to be hamstrung by the attitudes of other members. Getting back to the bill, it is a non-controversial bill. It does not have an adverse effect on industry at all, and there will be no additional costs. It is about streamlining the operation so that both industry and government can work together to make sure the legislation allows industry to operate, to keep progressing and to keep moving forward. It gives that little bit of flexibility, in regards to being able to report the data back on discovery-you will find that an extra 27-odd days in the change in the legislation will enable industry that extra time to collect their data. I commend the bill. pleased to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 today, which I loosely term the geosequestration bill, and the associated amendments. As we have heard, the bills to be amended in this legislation were passed last year. These bills before us today make purely administrative and technical corrections to the existing legislation regarding safety levies and title matters, which I support.

247,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.14 Pm),"Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I amThe original basis of the legislation was an initiative of the coalition in government following a review by the science and innovation committee with the foresight to recognise the importance of creating a framework to manage the relationship between the petroleum industry and offshore storage of greenhouse gases. The resulting legislation aimed to regulate future industry. It provides for the injection and geological storage of greenhouse gas substances in Australian offshore areas in line with petroleum industry legislation. Whilst complicated by its very nature, the legislation was designed to regulate the exploration, assessment and testing of geological storage of greenhouse gases and to tackle potential conflicts between offshore petroleum operations and titles and geosequestration operations and titles. As a nation we need to reduce carbon emissions; we all know that. With Australia’s vast resources of gas and coal we need to find more efficient ways of serving our energy needs and reducing the emissions at the same time. I note that during the debate on the original legislation there were strong points made that the legislation created disincentives to invest in greenhouse gas storage operations. We must manage the competing interests at play between those seeking to sequester the gases and the petroleum industry and between the cost burden and responsibility of building the infrastructure and monitoring the sequestration of CO2. I agree there is a strong need to manage the relationship between those seeking to drill for gas and petroleum and those seeking to store carbon. They are working in the same environment. I have taken a strong interest in geosequestration, the development of geological storage of greenhouse gases, in recent times. I have welcomed the opportunity to speak to the experts in the field and have visited a number of research facilities working on carbon capture and storage. The legislation before us provides for the capture, or geosequestration, of greenhouse gases-carbon, in other words-produced mainly by large emitters. If we continue to use fossil fuels for energy we need to find smarter ways to use them and to invest in clean coal technologies such as gasification and carbon capture. Let me stress here that the Rudd government, for all its green rhetoric, has not offered any real money for clean coal technology. Before the election they were talking about clean coal technology and how they were going to develop it. There has been very little word about clean coal technology since, except in the duplication of international bodies to pursue clean coal. That has fallen off the Labor Party agenda. Conventional coal fired electricity generation plants have efficiency of about 35 per cent, which means that about 35 per cent of usable energy in the coal is converted into electricity. New technology can raise the efficiency by up to 55 per cent and at the same time reduce emissions by 25 per cent. The science of geosequestration is an innovative process and one that can offer benefits to Australia by storing carbon dioxide underground. As is the nature of new technology, it is often a matter of costs versus benefits-how much people are prepared to pay, how much the big emitters are prepared to invest. Currently, carbon capture and storage options include storing carbon dioxide in existing gas fields that are no longer used for production. The removal of gas from reservoirs has created porous spaces for the CO2 to be stored. Alternatively, deep saline aquifers can store carbon. Because they are so deep and the carbon is trapped below so much mud and clay, there is little risk of any path to the surface. The CSIRO is also looking at coal seams to store carbon dioxide. In fact, coal seams already store naturally occurring CO2. MAIN COMMITTEE Yesterday I visited Geoscience Australia for a briefing on the carbon capture and storage project, and I thank them for their brief. This was an outstanding opportunity to speak to the experts in the field, and they showed me the cores where CO2 would be stored. There is a misconception that when you take the gas out of a field you take it out of some huge cavern or vacuum. You do not. It is actually taken out of a spongy type rock, sandstone almost, that you see houses built from. Once the gas or the liquids have been taken out of this geological structure, there is obviously a great opportunity for other gases to go back in. Overlaying this soft, porous rock that allows the gas to be reinjected is usually a hard rock surface. I was shown cores of these as well. Obviously you do not want leakage. Many of the sites from which natural gas is taken have been there for millions of years, so there are millions of reasons for them being good storage spaces. I also recently had the opportunity to visit the Australian Resources Research Centre in Perth, very close to where I live. It is a partnership between CSIRO, the state government and the Curtin University, with more than 300 staff working towards cutting-edge technology in oil, gas and the mining sector, including carbon dioxide geosequestration. The centre was established to enhance petroleum and mining operations, to partner and work with the industry and to undertake significant research projects. It is a leader in petroleum and minerals research and a centre where scientists can interact, exchange information and explore new ideas in partnership with the industry to ensure the ongoing sustainability of Australia’s resources and environment. I welcome the opportunity to learn more about carbon capture from an expert, Dr Silvio Giger. Dr Giger is a structural geologist with the CSIRO and specialises in research technologies to increase oil and gas recovery in order to help secure Australia’s long-term energy security. He also assesses the viability of long-term geological underground storage of CO2-an important role in this day and age. Carbon capture and storage technologies could be well utilised in Australia. The centre’s location in Western Australia is highly appropriate, given that Western Australia produces two-thirds of Australia’s non-fuel materials and about half of it is petroleum. As well, Western Australia produces around 70 per cent of Australia’s natural gas and 68 per cent of its crude oil production. The strong investment means that geological rock formations are among the most studied in the world, and a good base for geosequestration adaption. A Perth basin is being studied for its potential to store CO2. There is a shale layer over the top, which I have already alluded to generally, which has been identified as a very good seal. It is a sandstone reservoir large enough to store the total emissions from all major sources from the south-west of Western Australia-an estimated 22 million tonnes per year. As I said, one of the areas that sorely need this as a result of the Collie coalfield and what is called the Harvey fault is this ideal location. This is the one being explored extensively by scientists, particularly people like Dr Silvio Giger. Chevron’s $50 billion Gorgon gas project is one of the largest resource developments in Australia off the coast of Karratha and will make the state a leader in the storage of greenhouse gases. The project will create 600 jobs and will be a leader in geosequestration technology. The major aspect of that project is to ensure the successful sequestration of carbon dioxide as a by-product. It is estimated to capture and store three million tonnes of CO2 per year for 40 years. The CO2 will be separated from the gas and injected into a saline reservoir 2,000 MAIN COMMITTEE metres below Barrow Island. It will cut the project emissions by 36 per cent. The technology is already in practical use. The Victorian Otway Basin project, basically a geosequestration test project, was launched this year. It involves compressing and transporting 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and then sequestering it in a natural gas reservoir two kilometres below the surface. I understand some 18,000 tonnes has already been stored. It serves as an example as to what can be achieved and where Australia can go with this technology. Energy efficiency and reducing emissions is prominent in my electorate. As I have mentioned previously, Alcoa has already taken direct action to address climate change. Globally its emissions are down by 36 per cent on 1990 levels. At the two refineries in Canning they have cut emissions by 12 per cent a tonne over the same period. It has invested in energy efficient cogeneration, CO2 geosequestration and carbon capture technology. There are two cogeneration plants at the Pinjarra refinery. This technology offers energy efficiency of 75 per cent, compared to only 30 per cent for conventional methods, and saves more than a million tonnes of CO2 emissions a year at Pinjarra compared to coal-fired power. This is the equivalent of taking 140,000 cars off the road per year. Essentially it means that Alinta, Alcoa’s partner, is able to supply more consumers with electricity, and the steam that is created in this process and would traditionally be wasted is used by Alcoa in its refinery for greater energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Even before this unit was completed, it became a finalist in the 2005 WA Environment Awards. I have only a short period of time left, so I would like to say that the coalition acknowledges the importance of taking a unified commitment to the Copenhagen summit. We want an unconditional five per cent reduction on 2000 levels by 2020 and conditionally up to 25 per cent. But we propose an earlier start to the emissions abatement and the potential to build on a 2020 target via voluntary action. As I have said many times on previous bills, Australia should wait until we go to Copenhagen, to find out what the great emitters of this world are doing, rather than locking ourselves into a legislative framework that gives us no flexibility to be in step with the rest of the world. The penalty, of course, is exporting jobs, exporting income and exporting damaging environmental gases to places like Indonesia, who produce far less efficiently and are greater emitters in their refineries than we are in Australian refineries. It is just crazy for us to be ahead of the game before the rest of the world decides how it is going to get on board. For some reason, the Labor Party thinks that being ahead of the game is smart. All it is going to do is cost jobs. What about the workers? I have said to the member for Charlton, the former ‘champion of the workers’, that realistically, when he is talking about these things, he has forgotten about the workers, because he is exporting jobs. Companies like Alcoa tell me that they will have to go offshore because they will not be able to compete in any efficient way in Australia if this legislation comes in with the targets that the Labor Party is suggesting now and wants to lock us into before we have a level playing field. The Rudd government needs to think seriously about its levels and its target. The coalition is strongly supportive of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. When the Labor Party talks about signing Kyoto and brandishes that around as a great achievement, it fails to tell the rest of the world that Australia was already achieving the Kyoto targets. I do not know if people underMAIN COMMITTEE stand this. When I say to people in my electorate, ‘Do you understand that, before Australia even signed the Kyoto protocol, we were actually achieving the Kyoto targets, unlike the rest of the signatories who don’t?’ they reply: ‘Why don’t people tell us that? Why don’t people tell us that Australia actually meets the Kyoto targets, instead of saying how terrible we are?’ Well, we do, we always have and the symbolic signing of Kyoto did nothing more to reduce greenhouse gases in Australia. It is just a crazy ideological bent that they are off on. The coalition’s green carbon initiative aims to achieve, by 2020, additional annual reductions of at least 150 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent encompassing these measures. I conclude that this legislation is obviously supported because it is sensible. The geosequestration technology is in its infancy, but Australia is at its leading edge. We have a magnificent mindset in Australia, through the scientists that we have in the organisations I have already acknowledged. They are ahead of the game, and the rest of the world is getting on board. As I said, Gorgon is going to be one of the outstanding models of what can be done in this area. That is the reason it has received state and federal environmental approvals to go ahead with this massive project. It is going to produce trillions of tonnes of energy efficient gas for the rest of this world, and it will leave Australia as a showcase on how we should store our greenhouse gases. Debate (on motion by Ms Grierson) adjourned. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.30 pm)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Bowel Cancer Screening Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (12.30 pm)-There are five million Australians missing out on a test that could save lives. New data on bowel cancer screening highlights the urgent need to fully implement screening for all Australians over 50, according to Cancer Council Australia. Cancer Council Australia CEO, Professor Ian Olver, says that the data shows how effective a national screening program can be, yet the program is currently only available to 50-, 55and 65-year-olds, and he warns that five million Australians are missing out on a test that could help save their lives. He goes on to say that not only are five million Australians currently missing out; current participants are only offered a one-off screening. This is contrary to national health guidelines, which recommend screening at least every two years from the age of 50. Professor Olver said that, according to conservative estimates, the government could save the lives of more than 30 Australians each week by expanding the program to include all Australians aged 50 and over. Further delays in program expansion would lead to more unnecessary deaths. So how serious is this disease? The answer is ‘very serious’. According to a recent Cancer Institute report, Australia has a higher rate of bowel cancer than America or Britain. Bowel cancer is one of the most common cancers in men and women, second only to prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women respectively. Each year in Australia there are around 12,900 new cases diagnosed. It is a major cause of death, with around 80 Australians dying from bowel cancer each week. Both men and women are at risk, as I pointed out earlier. One in 18 men and one in 27 women will develop bowel cancer before the age of 75. MAIN COMMITTEE For women, the number of new cases of colorectal cancer is projected to increase by 30 per cent, from 5,883 in 2001 to 7,673 in 2011. For men, the increase is predicted to be from 6,961 in 2001 to 9,294 in 2011. Furthermore, more than 75 per cent of people with bowel cancer do not have a family history of the disease. It is therefore even more important that the screening program is widened so that all Australians in the higher risk groups are regularly screened. According to a report into cancer incidence projections for 2011, the incidence of bowel cancer will increase per 100,000 people from 51 for 50to 54-year-olds, 85.3 for 55to 59-yearolds, 136.8 for 60to 64-year-olds, 203.6 for 65to 69-year-olds, until it peaks at a massive 435.8 for those over 85. But those are just dry facts and figures. Consider the personal cost-the initial shock, and possibly despair, of people facing this potentially fatal disease, then the realities of chemotherapy, during which many people are terribly sick and suffer dreadful side effects. After all that, many patients are still severely restricted in what they can do, and the impact on their lives can be protracted, if not enduring. I have received many emails from constituents on this important health matter and some have been heartbreakingly personal. One young woman said that her grandfather would perhaps be alive to see his grandchildren had he not died from bowel cancer. On the strength of that, her father took advantage of the screening program and was thankfully declared clearthis time. Another constituent told me that she had lost her mother to this disease at the distressingly young age of 42 years old and she is undergoing regular treatment for a related condition. These are real people who, without an expanded screening program, face an uncertain future. We have seen the success of the biennial mammogram screening program and the impact it has had on the early detection and therefore increased survival rates of people who have breast cancer. Not only does it make sense but it is our responsibility to ensure that improved medical techniques are used not just to save money but to save heartache, worry, diminished quality of life and, ultimately, lives. Building the Education Revolution Program Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.35 pm)-I commend the member for Tangney for raising the issue of bowel cancer screening and I support his call to make the test available to people generally who are over 50. I know the importance of that. TodayI want to speak about the massive investment the Rudd Labor government has been making in our schools, in our colleges, in our higher education institutions and in training facilities-an investment which has enormous implications for Australia’s future. My electorate of Calwell includes some of the most disadvantaged suburbs in Victoria, if not in Australia. Poverty, unemployment, health and housing problems are a challenging reality for many families in the area. We are working to address these issues at various points through income support; through job training and, more importantly, retraining; through policies to support local industries and therefore local jobs; through health services; through affordable housing-the list goes on. Nothing can be more important in the battle to break the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage than improving educational opportunities. That is why I believe that serious investment in our schools really does represent an education revolution. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the first steps this government took when it came to office was to fulfil its promise of upgrading access to computer technology for Australian secondary students. The National Secondary Schools Computer Fund will provide more than 2,300 new computers for use by secondary students in my electorate of Calwell. Schools which have been funded under the program include Gladstone Park Secondary College, Salesian College Rupertswood, Ilim College, Broadmeadows Special Development School, Craigieburn Secondary College, Hume Central Secondary College, Roxsburgh College, Sunbury and Macedon Ranges Specialist School, Sunbury College, Sunbury Downs Secondary College, Aitken College, Penola College, Isik College and St Mary’s Coptic Orthodox College. We all know how important the ability to use information technology is to succeed in the world. For the generation still at school, this knowledge is more vital than ever. Our children need access to computers to keep up with knowledge and information that is expanding at a staggering rate every day. They need to understand their options, to find work that is meaningful and satisfying, and to fully participate in the community as informed and engaged citizens. Part of the Rudd government’s $2 billion Digital Education Revolution is aimed at giving secondary school students access to world-class information and communication technology. As well as the national secondary schools computer program, we now have significant investment in school buildings and infrastructure through the programs collectively known as Building the Education Revolution. Under the National School Pride program, this government has made it possible for schools to complete minor works and upgrades that will improve the learning environment for pupils and teachers. In my electorate, $8.9 million has been made available across the government, Catholic and independent sectors. Under Primary Schools for the 21st Century an impressive $70 million has been committed in my electorate alone to construct much needed facilities for the local students. This is a massive boost to our local economy in a difficult time of global downturn. There is still another round of funding under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century to be announced. I am looking for more funding for the schools in my electorate. This massive investment in our schools by the Rudd government is complemented by the commitment of the Brumby government in Victoria. The Victorian government has initiated the Broadmeadows Schools Regeneration Project in the southern part of my electorate to help reorganise, rebuild and reinvigorate our local state schools, both primary and secondary. In the most recent state budget, the Brumby government announced $4 million for stage 2 of construction of a new senior secondary campus in Broadmeadows. This is in addition to the $12 million allocated in last year’s state budget for stage 1 of the project. The school is due for completion in the middle of 2010. The federal and state Labor governments have committed a combined $5.75 million for a new, state-of-the-art primary school, the Broadmeadows Valley Primary School, which combines four smaller existing schools. Construction of this school is well underway and it will open at the start of the 2010 school year. Adjacent to this new school will be a brand new early childhood centre, also funded by the Rudd government. In addition, the Rudd government’s programs extend to supporting infrastructure development in TAFE colleges, including Kangan Batman TAFE in my electorate, and at the higher education level investing in universities, ensuring that many more students from disadvantaged areas are supported in accessing tertiary education and funding the full cost of research. I am proud of the achievements so far MAIN COMMITTEE of this government and I am proud of the very real impact its commitment to education is having and will continue to have in my electorate. (Time expired) Budget: National Bowel Cancer Screening Program bat for the constituents of Ryan who have contacted me in relation to the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. In recent weeks I have received scores of emails and phone calls from Ryan residents who are deeply concerned that the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program is going to be terminated by the Rudd Labor government. They are deeply concerned because they have seen in recent months that the federal Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Rudd, simply does not know how to spend taxpayers’ money in the most efficient and appropriate fashion. We have seen $900 cheques go out to Australians and we will see the Australian government rack up some $315 billion in deficit, which will be a chain around the necks of the future taxpayers of Australia. In the parliament today, as the member for Ryan, I want to flag the deep concerns of those many residents of suburbs all around the Ryan electorate who have contacted me to express their deep concern that this important program-initiated by the former Howard government-is going to be axed. About 90 Australians die each week from bowel cancer. This cancer can be treated successfully if detected in its early stages. But currently fewer than 40 per cent of bowel cancers are detected early. That is why this program-and I say again that it was a vision of the Howard government-was put in place. It was put in place so that Australians could have a chance of surviving this awful cancer. The Howard government, as part of its Strengthening Cancer Care initiative in the 2005-06 budget, allocated some $43.4 million over three years for the phasing-in of a national bowel cancer screening program. Today we live in the era of the Rudd federal Labor government, which is putting the axe to these kinds of programs. It is going to do that because it has given away taxpayers’ money to individuals throughout the country in the form of a $900 cheque per person. Imagine if that kind of money were spent on aged-care facilities. Imagine if that kind of money were spent on income-producing assets and infrastructure. Imagine if that kind of money were spent on small to medium sized businesses. Imagine if that kind of money were spent on medical and scientific research in wonderful institutions like the University of Queensland, in the suburb of St Lucia in the Ryan electorate. Imagine if that $42 billion were spent on those kinds of priorities instead of on giving $900 cheques to people-many of whom are deceased or live overseas and have spent their money in the economies of other countries. TodayI want to bat again for the Ryan constituents who have contacted me. I want to flag some streets and suburbs of residents who have contacted me: Gower Street, Toowong; Sirocco Street, Jamboree Heights; Canowie Road, Jindalee-and both Canowie Road and Sirocco Street are in centenary suburbs-Brisbane Street, St Lucia; Dean Street, Toowong; Wynyard Street, Indooroopilly; Elvendon Street, The Gap; Upper Brookfield Road, Upper Brookfield; and Sweetgum Street, Bellbowrie. These are all people in the Ryan electorate who have emailed me to express their deep concern at the priorities of the Rudd Labor government. They have urged me to ensure that this significant program initiated by the Howard government remains in place. I remind them that unfortunately these kinds of very worthwhile programs that invest in the health of Australians and that were the vision of the Howard government are precisely the MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Offshore Petroleum And Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Levies Amendment Bill 2009
248,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.40 Pm),"Today in the Australian parliament I want to yet againtypes of programs that are going to be axed, because we face hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit. It is a great shame that the fiscal rhetoric of Mr Rudd when he was opposition leader now sees him in government totally misleading the Australian people. I have even had representations from people who do not live in my electorate but who live in places like Sumner Park in the Oxley electorate and Chelmer in the Moreton electorate. These electorates have Labor members, but their constituents are contacting me about their disgust at the Rudd government. I say to these people: rest assured that your local member is going to fight hard for you so that these kinds of worthy programs stay in place. (Time expired) Tourism Forestry mention two things that are related to my electorate and that are very important economic drivers: tourism and forestry. The first, related to tourism, is that last SaturdayI had the pleasure of the company of the Minister for Tourism, Martin Ferguson, at a tourism forum that was held in Wynyard and hosted by our local mayor, Kevin Hyland. Part of that visit was to officially open the Table Cape Lighthouse project. There was $185,000 committed in the last election to the lighthouse project. The lighthouse is on Table Cape, which is to the west of Wynyard, and provides a most magnificent viewing platform of the north-west coast, both to the east and the west, as well as the hinterland. The $185,000 has been used to open up the lighthouse so that tourists can actually go up the lighthouse, go outside and look at the magnificent views from the lighthouse, which was built in 1888. Also, the moneys will be used for signage for those people that go to the lookout at Table Cape and then go on a magnificent coastal walking track towards the west and towards the lighthouse itself. Some of the $185,000 was also used to incorporate, as a visitor experience, the lighthouse with the magnificent Van Diemen Quality Bulbs tulip farm, which is directly to the south of the lighthouse. So you can have the great experience of going through the farm, looking at the lighthouse and going up the lighthouse. Even for someone like me who suffers from vertigo, it was lovely and safe-fantastic views and a beautiful place. So when you come and visit the north-west coast, I hope you will go and have a look at Table Cape Lighthouse and have that wonderful tourism experience. I thank the minister and this government for honouring that commitment. The second thing I would like to talk about is forestry, a very important industry in my electorate and also in Tasmania. I was very pleased that the Prime Minister came to Braddon with me and went to Circular Head, a great forestry area, to announce Labor’s forest policy before the last election. I was very pleased that in the House yesterday the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Tony Burke, gave unequivocal support to the forest industries. Essentially, his speech outlined our election commitments and how we are fulfilling them-and we are. There was $20 million announced in 2007 to assist industry and support jobs, particularly in regional communities like my own, and the minister was able to go through each of the measures in that $20 million. What was very important about the minister’s speech yesterday was that it reinforced the importance of regional forest agreements. Throughout Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, these are the consensus agreements based on science wherein we strive to create a balance between conservation, preservation, reservation and, of course, the creation of a sustainable MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Adjournment
249,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.45 Pm),"Good afternoon, colleagues. I would like toindustry so that we can enjoy those things that we need to reserve and conserve while sustainably growing and harvesting a resource that belongs to us all, and that is very important in terms of communities, the economy and, of course, the environment. We know that forests and the industries associated with them are going to be very important contributors to this whole issue of climate change, particularly in terms of being carbon stores and carbon sinks. I was very pleased that the minister again reinforced this government’s support for the industry and for the RFAs, which are so important in giving surety not only to industry about its resources in the future but also to communities that rely very much on this really important industry. The other thing that the minister was very strong in endorsing and reinforcing was support for the pulp mill in Northern Tasmania, which is there, is waiting and has been surrounded by political controversy since cocky was an egg but which is a great absorber for jobs in the future. We are waiting for a tick off on that and, if it meets its environmental guidelines, it should go ahead. The minister made it very clear that it should and that he supports that pulp mill. (Time expired) Dr Mal Washer Herbert Electorate: Rotary Awards, Roads and Aerospace Precinct Washer, the member for Moore, was rushed to hospital last night. Mal was able to diagnose himself as having appendicitis. He wanted to go back to Western Australia but his staffer-the nurse, Gloria-would not allow him to fly and ordered him to hospital. I think that is an indication that women rule the world-and so they should! I have just been to see Mal at the hospital and I can report that he is in fine form and very comfortable, particularly as he just rang up Gloria and said: ‘Quick, come over-I’ve got a drama.’ His drama was that he had lost a button off the fly of his pyjamas and it needed to be sewn back on! So the nurse was there, sewing the button on and Mal is now resting comfortably. Tomorrow night it will be my privilege to present to awards to two very fine leaders of the Townsville community. These are the Paul Harris Fellow awards, which are given by Rotary for the highest ideals of service. The two members who are receiving these awards are from the Rotary Club of Townsville Daybreak, which happens to be the club that I am an honorary member of. The first recipient is Rotarian Trevor Hyatt. Trevor has made a significant contribution to the Rotary Club of Townsville Daybreak over the last 12 years. He has been a board member on several occasions, has served as president for one full term, is in the process of serving as president for the current Rotary year and will be joining the district YEP committee for the upcoming Rotary year. Trevor’s enthusiasm for Rotary is well illustrated by his participation in the club’s projects. He is undoubtedly mister reliable-always there. The fact that he has put up his hand to serve a second term as president is evidence of his firm commitment to Rotary and to our club. Trevor also has community service achievements as a judge in the equestrian events at the various shows around Queensland. He is well known as a member of the community in Townsville and is the principal of a long established and respected local locksmiths business. MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Adjournment
250,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (12.51 Pm),"Some of you will know that our colleague Dr MalThe other recipient, Betty Stokes, has been a member of the club for 13 years. She has been president of the club and a board member on a number of occasions. She served on the district YEP committee for a number of years and has been very active within the club in youth affairs. Betty is recognised as a quiet achiever who works away efficiently at whatever she undertakes. Betty is known for her reliability in whatever she undertakes and has been a significant contributor to the development and life of the Rotary Club of Townsville Daybreak. Betty is a person to have in discussion when cool, calm and well-balanced judgment is required. Betty’s son, Phillip, was an outbound exchange student recently. Betty and her husband John are certainly well known in the Townsville community, especially in the medical area. Both Betty and Trevor are very worthy recipients of their nomination for a Paul Harris Fellowship. TomorrowI will be attending the commissioning of the ring-road in Townsville and the Woodlands to Veales Road four-laning project. I am really proud of these two roads. I had the vision to get these roads built, and now that they are being opened they are just making such an extraordinary difference to our community in Townsville. You can get from the hospital or Lavarack Barracks or the university up to the northern beaches now in two minutes, whereas it used to take probably 15 minutes. It has cut huge amounts of travel time and, of course, it has been constructed to motorway standard. The ring-road acts as the bypass for Townsville, so it has taken the heavy vehicles out of the suburbs and that, in itself, is a very good thing. The benefit-cost ratio was quite significant and, to that end, the road has been very valuable for the local community. TomorrowI am having meetings, as well as a meeting in Brisbane on Monday, with the Defence Force in relation to the developing aerospace precinct in Townsville. These meetings will be in relation to the servicing of our helicopter fleet in Townsville, where we have both Black Hawk and MRH 90s based in the city. The 5th Aviation Regiment is Australia’s premier Army aviation regiment and will continue to be, but we will need to maintain these supercomplicated and technological machines that fly about our skies. I am looking forward to getting some good outcomes from those meetings with Townsville Enterprise Ltd and Townsville Airport. Stroke Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.56 pm)-TodayI would like to raise the issue of stroke. I have been approached by the Stroke and Disability Information (Hunter) Inc. group-an organisation that is fondly referred to as SADI. It is situated in the electorate of Shortland. SADI have been providing assistance and support to people that suffer from stroke and other similar types of disability for many, many years. The person who founded the organisation was Elaine Lenaghan OAM, who has since passed away. Her initial work in setting up SADI has been carried on very vigilantly by a number of the people involved in the organisation at the time, and it is now ably administrated by Juliet Roosendaal, who is the project officer. I have to also acknowledge Jim Folby and Stuart Chalmers, who are two constituents within the electorate of Shortland who have always been very active in relation to SADI and raising awareness about stroke in the community. The week of 14 to 21 September is National Stroke Awareness Week. Statistics show there is a steady increase in the incidence and prevalence of stroke events. As I mentioned earlier, SADI are dedicated to educating the community about any signs of stroke. They provide exMAIN COMMITTEE perienced caring and confidential education, information, counselling, support and advocacy to reduce the incidence of stroke and minimise the physical, social and emotional impact of stroke and other disabilities on clients, carers and the wider community-and, when we are talking about stroke, we cannot forget carers and the enormous impact it has on their lives when one of their loved ones suffers a stroke. SADI also supports existing stroke recovery groups and helps facilitate new ones. SADI sees itself as an umbrella group that provides support to other groups within the community. It provides information such as brochures, books, videos, DVDs, information packages and oneon-one information sessions. It holds seminars and workshops, links people with similar disabilities and supports self-help groups. SADI provides bi-monthly newsletters that have a wealth of information about every service in the community that people who suffer strokes can link into. These are some of the things that show the fine quality of work that is done by SADI. Additionally, SADI links carers with other carers. Importantly, all services provided by SADI are free. I will give a few facts and figures about stroke. About 60,000 people in Australia will have a stroke in 2009, which is an enormous number of people. In fact, stroke is the second single greatest killer after coronary heart disease, and the leading cause of disability in Australia. Every 10 minutes someone, somewhere in Australia, has a stroke. One in five people who have their first stroke die within one month; one in three die within a year. It is the second largest killer, as I have already mentioned. Stroke is the biggest single cause of disability in Australia. One in seven people will have stroke. Stroke kills more women than breast cancer. Twenty per cent of all strokes occur in people under 55, and stroke costs Australia $2.14 billion a year. There is a lot more I could say about SADI and about stroke. The one point I would really like to conclude on is that National Stroke Awareness Week is between 14 and 21 September, and I would like to inform the House that I intend to place a notice on the motion paper to bring this very important issue before the Commonwealth parliament.
