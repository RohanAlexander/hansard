The meet those needs. first of these was Mr Rob Bastian, whom the I am sure you will recall, Mr Deputy Prime Minister likes to quote regularly. Mr Speaker Nehl, as I think you were in the chair Bastian, when asked about the government's during the MPI debate at that stage, that last best efforts, said: week the Yellow Pages Small Business IndexI think that most small firms really still regard the was released. It indicated that the confidence Government as a bit of a burden still. of proprietors in small business has reached Lyneham replied, 'But this government its lowest level since August of 1993 and that promises so much to them,' to which Mr more than 80 per cent of small businesses see Bastian said: the economy in recession or at a standstill.

The alarming Pharmacy Guild of Australia said. For exambusiness conduct issues brought to light in the Fair ple, the MTAA executive director said: Trading inquiry have prompted the Committee to make strong recommendations about the need for Reforming Australia's fair trading laws will bring legislative action on the part of the Commonwealth more significant employment benefits for small to provide a viable trading environment for small business than the Howard Government's planned business. blanket exemption from unfair dismissal laws.

The business so that they had some confidence in concern is how you can get structural change and you. It was not what you were talking about adjustment in the market which is about fairness ... so we can grow employment. but a legislative base. Again, I quote the chairman, the member for Bendigo, who said: That was also reflected by Mr Stephen Greenwood from the Pharmacy Guild, who said: In particular, the Committee is recommending that a Uniform Retail Tenancy Code be underpinned in ... the Government's priority should be protecting the Trade Practices Act, that specific franchising fairness in the commercial dealings of small legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth,business. and I thought that was the question asked Exactly, Minister. That is everything that has todaybeen said in this report. There were some people who were opposed to it, there is no and that part IV A of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened to outlaw unfair conduct. doubt about that. Those who were opposed to it were, first, Treasury. Surprise, surprise! Small business is not afraid of strong competition, They are against it. In their submission to the and it is not asking to be protected from a tough trading environment. Small business simply wants inquiry, they 'cautioned against'-that is a bit a chance to survive. The Committee's recommendaof code--changes to the Trade Practices Act tions would give small business that opportunity. prohibiting 'harsh and oppressive conduct'. The minister is against it. He has already said The Committee's recommendations are not about ""protecting"" small business; they are about setting previously that he is opposed to it. There was some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable somebody else who was against it too, or at commercial conduct in Australia. least expressed a view. Cowper, the ACT Liberal Vice-President, who article headed 'No to franchise law call', quit the party in disgust.

Amendment Bill (No.2) covers the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987. The reference to this is very minor. It reduces the size of the board, which I think is probably a good thing. It is certainly going to limit costs. I hope grower representation is maintained. Too often on these boards the interests of growers are subverted when the nominees come from agri-political bodies which have long ceased to have much relevance to the welfare of the grower or primary producer. With respect to AQIS, the bill gives the power for AQIS to license people meeting its standards to certify things for export. It is my view that self-regulation in this area is fraught with danger and is probably not in our long-term interest. Having said that, it is quite clear that something has to be done about the extraordinary cost imposed on exporters by AQIS. A lot of this has to do with AQIS' s regulations and rigmarole, which are designed to enhance its income rather than expedite the processing of exports. I could go into great detail about what I see as the shortcomings of AQIS in this regard. Like a lot of other countries, we should forget this nonsense of full cost recovery. AQIS should be seen as an adjunct to Australia's exports. It should be impressed upon it that its job is to help exports, not to hinder them. I believe that, in the long run, self-regulation will not be the way to go. Some people in this parliament will remember the meat scandals which were a direct result of corruption in the process of certifying meat. The proposed amendments to the Social Security Act covered by this bill will allow the recovery of drought relief overpayments that were paid to farmers through a variety of mechanisms. This is interesting. In my view, the drought relief paid to farmers was not very substantial, it was extremely hard to get, and overpayments in this area would be minimal. However, I am cynically amused that we are prepared to enshrine in legislation the methods of recovery from farmers, yet we will not do the same thing in respect -o some quasigovernment bodies such as housing authorities where there was an enormous demand from people to have their rents taken out of social security payments-particularly, I might add, from the Aboriginal community. We simply do not do it, and this is to the detriment of government bodies such as the Aboriginal housing corporations. In other areas, such as the payment of Abstudy, John Dawkins very foolishly took this payment away from schools and gave it to individuals. That means that schools no longer get the money. I took this matter up with the previous government. As I have said so often in this House, there is really no difference-we are dealing with Tweedledum and Tweedledumberand this government refuses to act on it as well.",109,Requests For Detailed Papers Informa Tion The Following Paper Was Deemed To Have

263,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (4.30 P.m.),"The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation4756 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 Under this agreement, imported food from New Zealand will be inspected-if it is inspected-at point of sale, not at point of entry. This is part of our agreement with New Zealand. One cannot help but become increasingly cynical about our trade agreement with New Zealand. We are told that, on balance, we export more to New Zealand. This is a nonsense when you think of the other advantages New Zealand gets. I suspect that the transfer of money to New Zealand runs in excess of $2 billion a year from New Zealanders working in Australia. There is very little flow the other way. Of course, with the deregulation of the banking system under Keating, we simply do not know how much money is leaving the country but, quite clearly, it is substantial. In the long run, I suppose we can be big brother to New Zealand: the problem is when governments want to make us big brother to the rest of the world. Let me now move to the amendment to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline legislation dealing with the transfer of easements. The Commonwealth maintained an interest in the pipeline easements primarily to ensure that other people could use the easements. The Commonwealth has now decided that the demand is not there but that it will enshrine guarantees for other people to use the easements. I think that is all very reasonable and sounds like common sense. I do not see how you can sell the residual share in the easements and, at the same time, enshrine provision for other parties, as yet unknown, to use these easements. Certainly, I do not know how you can do it without dramaticaIIy reducing the money that you were going to get from these easements. While I very strongly support other people having access to those easements at very reasonable costs, it is my experience that governments tend to like money so if the government can work that out it wilI be for the better. I want to talk a little about the treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia in respect of the zone of cooperation. I was probably the instigator of the original Timor Gap treaty when I took Mr Brian Conway to see the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, BilI Hayden. The argument at the time was that Australia had made what could only be described as an enormous land grab--which would not have been upheld in any international court-by taking our land claim virtually to the border of Timor. It was my view that it would be much better if we could get an agreement with Indonesia for a mutual area where we could jointly exploit it. That course came to fruition. I believe that Bill Hayden deserves the credit for that and not Gareth Evans. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that history will be written that way. I have had a few letters from people claiming that Australia's sovereignty is being sold out. That is an absolute nonsense in this regard. I think it is being sold out every day in other respects but I believe the treaty signed with Indonesia on the use of the surrounding seas is in fact very much in Australia's favour. It must be said that the department has done a good job in this regard. I would like to mention the AQIS function. The government is here seeking to increase penalties for the introduction of sea organisms in the bilge water of ships. We have already seen such organisms introduced into Australia and it is an ever present threat to us. Even with this bilI, I am not sure that we are doing enough to ensure the security of our shores. There is a reasonably stiff penalty in there but I very much doubt that it can be policed adequately. I would like to see some better system of policing. I also point out that the demise of cabotage, and the entry of foreign ships into our coastal waters, is an additional threat to Australia. In the long run, we might see any short-term benefit in cost vastly outweighed by the threat to our environment. Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4757 I also find it a little unsettling to hear the member for Mayo( Mr Downer), the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, talking in the parliament today about our international commitments. One feels that there will be a tendency to water down all forms of protection under pressure from GAIT or our current masters in the United States, and I think that this is a very dangerous thing-if it is possible that quarantine measures are in fact a non-tariff protection measure. But it is my view that we cannot be too careful with quarantine measures. If we are seen by foreign countries as using this non-tariff protection measure, so be it. I would rather live with that than have the problems that we could inherit if we were to slacken our quarantine vigilance. This is a crucial point for Australia. One has really to consider the cost to us as a nation if, through laxity or mindless government adherence to some treaty that other nations tend to honour much more in the breach, we suffer losses in this regard. I tried to introduce into this parliament a private member's bill making the government responsible for such occurrences when industry suffers losses but, as a private member's bill, it did not go anywhere. I certainly think it would be incumbent upon the National Party, if it still represents rural Australia, to consider such a bill to make the government responsible for any mistakes that occur through laxity in our quarantine regulations. That is about all that can be said on the bill. It is mainly a bill which provides enabling mechanisms, and I guess it will be supported by both sides. to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 that the government has put forward, it is pleasing to hear that we have the support of the other side. We are debating this issue in the Main Committee, because it is non-controversial legislation. I will explain to the Main Committee some of the amendments, because our agricultural sector is obviously a very important industry not only from a jobs perspective but also from a national economy perspective. We have received some industry criticism in relation to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 that the cost of participating in the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the AHC, is too high. I confirm to the Main Committee that the Australian Horticultural Corporation undertook a review of its overhead costs in relation to this criticism. As a means of reducing overheads, the AHC proposed a reduction in the size of the board membership from nine to seven and a reduction in remuneration for the board. The AHC is certainly aware of the criticism and is trying to address some of those concerns. I would like to point out that the Australian horticulture sector is an increasingly important sector to the agricultural and rural areas of Australia. Horticulture is already a major domestic agricultural industry but has a much lower export focus than that of most other agricultural industries. In 1995-96, Australia's horticulture industry had a gross production value of about $4.2 billion. The total value for fresh and processed horticultural produce in 1995-96 was over $1 billion. With changing consumer tastes, including a growing interest in health and lifestyle issues, there will be an increased demand for horticultural produce in the foreseeable future; hence the importance of the amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1997. In relation to the Export Control Act 1992, the proposed amendments to section 23 will enable non-government persons specified by the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to issue certain certificates required for export. This will enhance administrative efficiency and ensure that the persons signing export documentation under",111,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (4.42 p.m.)-In speaking4758 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 quality based arrangements can be properly regulated. These amendments will be used, for example, in the implementation of quality schemes in the horticulture industry-where it is proposed that certificates, such as certificates of condition requested by certain overseas governments, will be signed by company management-and in the organics industry, where it is proposed that industry associations issue organic produce certificates attesting to product quality. As I mentioned, with changing lifestyles and the increasing focus on healthy food, this is certainly also another step which will assist that industry in identifying and certifying the quality of the produce. The member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) raised the issue of the changes to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Social Security Act 1991. The Farm Household Support Act provides for overpayments of drought relief to be recovered as a debt due to the Commonwealth but does not specify the means by which these debts are to be recovered. The amendments will provide the mechanism by which drought relief payment debts can be recovered, thereby maintaining equity with other social security payments such as the newstart allowance. The proposed amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 will allow recovery of drought relief overpayments through a range of mechanisms that currently apply to specific social security payments not currently including drought relief payments. The drought relief payment has been an extremely invaluable source of money for families hard hit by drought. Of course, coming from a rural constituency that has been hit with five years of drought, I know just how welcome it has been for our farming constituencies. However, I know, and the farming constituencies know too, that we need a fair system and that where there has been an overpayment these moneys have to be recovered by the Commonwealth. These changes really will mean that the recovery mechanisms that will be made available include deductions from future drought relief payments or deductions from social security payments. I think they certainly agree with that process. It is about a fair system and the farming constituency acknowledging that the government is trying to help by making these arrangements as flexible as possible in relation to the recovery of those overpayments. The amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 will enable Australia to fulfil our obligations in respect of the agreement reached with New Zealand that food safety and food standards are equivalent between the two countries. The amendment will allow for the Governor General to make regulations that give exemptions from the Imported Food Control Act for certain foods of New Zealand origin. This means that for public health concerns those foods will be treated as if produced here and subject to point of sale rather than point of entry inspection. This amendment has no effect on Australia's quarantine requirements or practices. There are also amendments in relation to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline Systems Act 1994, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Sea Installations Act 1987 and the Quarantine Act 1908. To refer to one other point raised by the member for Kalgoorlie in relation to the Sea Installations Act, he contended that the foreign ships participating on our coastal routes may be detrimental to our national interests. Let me assure the member for Kalgoorlie that that is not the case. I think he will find that when we get more competition on sea routes around our nation we will have a far more competitive environment, one which is far more conducive to making sure that our industries in Australia are internationally competitive. It will mean that we will be able to make the most of the opportunities that present themselves in the international markets. Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4759 I thank members from both sides of the House for their contribution to the debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Budget and Simplification Measures) Bill 1997 has two main elements. Firstly, it seeks to integrate into the social security system most child related payments to veterans' families. Secondly, it attempts to simplify the current rate calculation provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The plan to integrate into the social security system child related payments to service pensioners and income supplement recipients was announced in last year's federal budget. It seeks to ensure that from 1 January 1998 almost all child related payments will be the responsibility of the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which is due to take over the payment role of the Department of Social Security from JUly. The previous federal government inherited from the Fraser government a complex, poorly targeted and mean system of family payments. That system included family allowance, additional benefits for pensioners and beneficiaries, and the family income supplement for the working poor. Under the families package, these separate child related payments have been integrated into a single family payments system that is targeted towards lowand middle-income families. That recognises the additional costs of caring for older children or living in private rental accommodation. Just as importantly, the families package ensured that family payments to lowincome families were linked to a benchmark of adequacy that entailed indexation. In 1993, the Social Security Act was amended to integrate child related payments to pensioners into the family payments system. This bill seeks to achieve the same outcome for veterans' families with dependent children. The aim is to enable social security officers to become more of a one-stop shop for family payments, reducing the need for families to have dealings with separate agencies. If handled effectively, such an objective has much to commend it. To achieve this outcome, and with one important qualification, this bill effectively transfers responsibility for child related payments to veterans' affairs income support recipients from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the social security family payments system. To ensure that no family will be worse off financially as a result of the change, the bill includes an important savings provision. This provision preserves the payment by Veterans' Affairs of child related payments such as the dependent child add-on, the pensioners full rent assistance, and the guardian allowance, where a pensioner or recipient would otherwise be",113,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (4.51 P.m.),"The Veterans' Affairs Legislation4760 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 disadvantaged by the transfer. The opposition welcomes this safety net provision, which ensures that there will be no losers from the measure. The second major element of the bill seeks to simplify the present rate calculation of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The two elements are linked because the transfer of child related payments to Social Security requires amendment of existing rate calculators. The current rate calculation provisions in the act extend to some 110 pages, and entail six separate rate calculators and nine separate method statements. If you were to believe the title of the media release issued by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Bruce Scott) on 27 March 1997, it is a case of the minister cleaning up his act! Mr Bruce Scott-That is right. it should be noted that on the most optimistic assumptions this bill will probably reduce th865-page Veterans' Entitlements Act by a comparatively modest 80 pages. The minister's second reading speech indicates that this is the first instalment in a staggered review of the act to redraft it along 'plain English' lines. The opposition supports such a redraft and seeks clarification from the government of the timetable and process that are to be applied to the project, and the resources devoted to it in an environment where the department's staff levels continue to fall. Turning to the specifics of the rate calculators, there are at present six-one for each of the following categories: service pensioners with children; service pensioners without children; service pensioners who are blind; service pensioners on frozen rate; income support supplement recipients with children; and income support supplement recipients without children. The bill seeks to replace these separate calculators with a single rate calculator, but one that contains seven modules and involves six overall rate calculation processes, all of which largely mirror the existing processes. This highlights the complexity of this crucial aspect of the legislation, resulting from incremental decisions that have been made over the years to make exceptions of certain situations. I well understand thrJ in complex systems there often needs to be a trade-off between the objectives of simplicity and clarity, on the one hand, and equity and fairness on the other. As a result of changes to the rate calculators, the bill also introduces consequent changes to the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care Income Testing Act. These are simply housekeeping changes that make no change to existing entitlements. The opposition does not oppose the provisions of the bill dealing with the rate calculation process, but wishes to flag an anomaly or two that require attention by the government. A particular anomaly that has been brought to my attention by a range of veterans' groups concerns the impact of disability pension payments on rent assistance to service pensioners. This is something that is directly relevant to the rate calculation aspects of this bill. There is bipartisan agreement that disability pensions, being compensation for war caused injury or iIIness, should not be counted as income for taxation or veterans' affairs pension purposes. The only exception to this at present is that, under the act, where a service pensioner also receives a disability pension, the rate of their disability pension reduces the rate of rent assistance payable. Where the pensioner is receiving a high percentage of disability compensation, this can completely extinguish their access to rent assistance. This provision appears to be a relic of an earlier period when rent assistance for pensioners was generally subject to a separate income test. Separate rent assistance income tests have been removed",115,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"However, before the minister rests too heavily on his laurels,Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4761 from all other parts of the social security and veterans' affairs systems, except for those in this situation. Some may argue that people receiving both a service pension and a disability pension would be receiving an adequate total income and can therefore do without extra allowances like rent assistance. To me, the difficulty with this argument is that it means that a dual-that is, disability and service-pensioner living in private rental receives no more assistance than someone who is a home owner. After all the work produced by the national housing strategy and by other stu.dies as part of the housing reform agenda, I would be surprised if any member would argue that private renters do not face particular financial difficulties, particularly in large cities such as Sydney, but elsewhere as well. I would also point out that the returned service community rightly receives financial assistance from the government under the defence service homes scheme, in the form of a mortgage subsidy paid out of the Veterans' Affairs budget to Westpac, to assist them to become home owners. It is only right and proper that this should be so. To my mind, however, this subsidy only strengthens the argument that veterans who are struggling in the private rental market warrant extra assistance towards their housing costs, even where they receive a dual pension. I acknowledge that the situation I am raising has been in place for many years. Nevertheless, I believe the minister should try to address it when the opportunity arises. I doubt that the cost involved in disregarding disability pension income for rent assistance purposes would be particularly large. It has been suggested to me that it would cost about $9 million. In conclusion, I mention in passing the opposition's strong concern at the impact on veterans of several measures in the recent budget. We will be taking the opportunity to highlight these concerns in future debates in this chamber and in the Senate. I indicate support for the current bill. does something good, the opposition gets up and says that it is not good enough. They never acknowledge the fact that we have only been in government for a short time and that, in that short time, a great deal has been achieved. Not many ministers have achieved as much as the honourable Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Bruce Scott) who is in the Chamber today. The purpose of this bill, which is his bill, serves to finalise the amendments to the budget simplification bill 1997 to give effect to the coalition government's budget for Veterans' Affairs as contained in last year's budget. The intention of this bill is to facilitate the process for the income support recipients by having them dealing with only one Commonwealth department in order to establish their entitlements to child related payments as a result of the integration into the Department of Social Security's family payment of the child related payments made to Veterans' Affairs. There will be no reduction to the total amount of Commonwealth payments made to the family unit and there will be absolutely no negative financial result on any income support pensioner or payee. The changes contained in this bill will go a long way to providing a plain English version of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, through simplified rules that are easily comprehended by veterans and the community at large, the coalition government is delivering on our commitment to streamline public administration through a more efficient service delivery. This is pretty much a general housekeeping bill and I am pleased to support the bill. members who have participated in the debate on this non-controversial legislation and note",116,Representatives Main Committee

I thank him for his comments. I did listen to some areas where he said that we should be, where possible, seeking to amend some areas of the defence service home loans legislation whenever possible, but I remind him-as he would perhaps acknowledge in his own speech-that his party did have 13 years in government to make such changes-perhaps he ought to remind himself of that from time to time. The amendments will make one step closer a process for simplification of our Veterans' Entitlements Act. As was highlighted in some parts of members' speeches, SO pages have disappeared, as a result of these amendments, from an SOO-page Veterans' Entitlements Act.

271,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (5.05 p.m.)-by leave-ITuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4763 (2) This clause ceases to apply to a person, and does not afterwards again apply to the person, if: (a) the service pension referred to in paragraph (l)(c) would have ceased to be payable to the person; or (b) family payment under the Social Security Act is no longer payable to the person or the person's partner or is no longer payable to the person or the person's partner at a rate higher than the minimum family payment rate; or (c) service pension becomes payable to the person. (3) A person to whom this clause applies is taken for the purposes of subsection 85(7) to be 11; receipt of a service pension under Part III. (4) In this clause: pension child-related amount, at any relevant time, means an amount that would be required at that time to be included in a service pension under ModuleC or ModuleD (as ModuleC or ModuleD was affected by Module DAA) of the Service Pension Rate Calculator at the end of section 42 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 as in force immediately before I January 1998. The first three amendments are minor corrections to the bill and have no policy implications. The fourth amendment is to protect another small group of veterans. These veterans would otherwise lose eligibility for full medical treatment benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, where their child related payments are integrated into the family payment. These veterans now receive a disability pension of 50 per cent or more of the general rate as well as a service pension. That combination of payments entitles them to a full range of medical treatment benefits from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The veterans targeted by this amendment are those who will not be paid a service pension after the child related payments are integrated. The amendments will ensure that their treatment entitlements remain for as long as they continue to be eligible for the above, the minimum family payment, for any child payable on 31 December this year. The amendments, and indeed the whole of this bill, demonstrate once again this government's intention to look after the interests of veterans and their families while at the same time simplifying both the delivery of the Commonwealth services and the legislation providing for those services.

274,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (5.08 P.m.),"At the outset can I put in an apology in this4764 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 opposition's perspective, however, that we do not see any controversial elements contained in this bill, which at the end of the day simply changes in a whole variety of very minor ways the way in which this act operates. Accordingly, we will certainly not be opposing it and we do not, as I have said, suggest it is in any way controversial. This bill seeks to amend a number of acts administered under the portfolio responsibility of industry, science and tourism. The Australian Science and Technology Council Act of 1978 is amended to add the council's functions and to reflect the addition of the term 'engineering' to the name of the council. Appointments to this council will be made in future by the minister responsible, with the approval of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), rather than the Governor General. The only thing I say about that is, of course, that we would like assurances, and I am sure the minister will be quite prepared to give them, that those appointments are from a carefully selected and culled group of individuals, that ministerial discretion reflects that the best possible people are appointed and that there are no other reasons why people should be appointed to that particular organisation. I will come back to the tourist commission in a moment. The National Measurement Act of 1960 is similarly amended, requiring the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to maintain, or cause to be maintained, coordinated universal time as determined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The amendment will ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with measurements in other countries. Again, this is a very sensible thing to do. The Science and Industry Research Act 1949 is to be amended to remove section 9AB from the act consistent with the current restructuring of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Act 1992, the Patents, Trademarks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939, the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 and the Trade Marks Act 1995 are similarly to be amended to make a number of technical amendments in these pieces of legislation which are, again, non-controversial and therefore supported by the opposition. The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 is to be amended to remove the requirement that the members of the board of the commission cease to hold office at the age of 65 and that the board not employ persons on terms and conditions more favourable than those of the managing director, and that is probably a very sensible thing to do. Finally, the Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987 is to be repealed as it no longer has application. As I have indicated, Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition does not oppose any of this legislation. However, in connection with the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987, permit me to make some very brief comments generally about tourism which I seek your indulgence to do. In particular, what I am concerned about and what I think the Australian tourism industry is concerned about are the number of difficulties now being caused by some of the comments, some of the perceptions, and certainly by some of the newspaper reporting, of the activities of the One Nation Party and the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). A couple of weeks ago I was in Brisbane as part of my responsibility as the shadow minister for tourism and I met with a number of people from the Brisbane Chinese community. These were Hong Kong Chinese Australians and Taiwanese Chinese Australians and they raised with me their concerns-particularly from a tourism perspective-about the effect that the One Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4765 Nation Party's philosophies, and the comments being peddled by the member for Oxley, were having on tourism. They cited as an example the fact that something like 40 tours from Taiwan, with an average of about 30 people on each, had been cancelled. They said the reason advanced for those cancellations was that there was a perception in Taiwan that Australia was no longer a welcoming country, a welcoming destination. I think that is absolutely abhorrent. Tourism is now our second, and very close to being our first, major source of export revenue. Even this government has recognised that it needs to put some of the money back into the ATC which it took out in last year's budget and so it has put another $5 million in the 1997-98 budget. This is in recognition of the fact that we are finding that the damaging debate in this country, with its racist overtones, is damaging our tourism industry. That is just one example. I therefore found it quite interesting that in the Sunday Telegraph, a Sydney newspaper, on I June this year, there was a comment piece by Sarah Harris under the heading of 'Passing the tourist buck'. I thought it was absolutely fascinating to read this. As you are a regional member from Victoria, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, and I note also that there is a regional member from Queensland present, I think that this is an article to which your attention should be drawn. It talked about the operation of a Victorian tourism proposal and it said: In the northernmost tip of East Gippsland Shire there is a tiny community called Delegate River which-by virtue of the Victorian government's lack of appreciation-should rightfully belong to NSW. We will not quibble about that. The article goes on to say: It has a beauty so sharp that if God did not rest there on the seventh day, he must at least have dawdled a while to admire his handiwork. Sarah Harris goes on to say: Late last year, this community was buzzing with the prospect of the first of several convoys of visitors from Singapore. But at the height of the so-called race debate, the bookings were cancelled. It has taken much work by local operators to rekindle the Singaporeans' interest. This month, the Delegate River Tavern and Tranquil Valley Resort will accommodate at least 20 visitors from Singapore. Their hostess, Val Savige, has already received plenty of well-meaning-if mistaken-advice from local patrons. ""They will only eat raw fish,' warned one regular. ""They don't like being touched on the head,"" advised another. The colourful local bard, minus his two front teeth, has kindly offered to take them fishing. They may also meet a man rumoured, in a passion of grief, to have consumed the ashes of his late wife, or be privileged enough to see a platypus playing in the creek below their cabins. They may learn that Kentucky Fried Chicken is local parlance not for fast food but Department of Community Services officers who ""take-away kids"". But whatever their tourists do, they will experience the genuine warmth of a real Australian community populated by characters as endearing as they are individual. This is the best antidote we've got to Pauline Hanson's venom. 4766 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 I think that particular article demonstrated that in rural communities in Victoria-just as is the case in what are commonly described as popular tourist destinations in this country, like tropical Queensland, the Gold Coast, Sydney, and so on-some of the nonsense that has been peddled by people and has been reflected, regrettably, in newspapers in Asia is having a detrimental effect on the Australian tourism industry. that that article was printed in and the date? concluding my remarks in this debate, I again want to make it perfectly clear to people in this country associated with the Australian Tourist Commission and the Australian tourism industry, and more generally to our colleagues on both sides of this parliament, that there are real and lasting factors that, regrettably, are going to be a great disadvantage to Australia's tourism industry in some of this debate. I appreciate your latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, in allowing me to make those comments in what is a very limited and technical bill. It was the first opportunity I have had and I felt that, given some of the things that have been happening in our country in the last few months, it was an appropriate comment to make. Let me reiterate that the opposition in no way believes that this legislation should be impeded and I wish it speedy passage through the House. member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin), in leading for the opposition, that the opposition will not be opposing these amendments. As the member for Cunningham has just stated, the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is of a non-controversial nature. It amends 10 acts administered in the industry, science and tourism portfolio: the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978, the National Measurement Act 1960, the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987, the Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987, the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Act 1992, the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939, the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 and the Trade Marks Act 1995. The amendments to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 add the field of engineering to the council's increased responsibilities. Additionally, delays in appointments to the council will be greatly reduced by the direct appointment by the minister, with the approval of the Prime Minister, instead of the present system of referring appointments to the Governor General, with all of the delays that that has incurred. All of the other amendments are straightforward and of a non-controversial nature. However, I want to make passing reference to the repeal of two subsections of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987-specifically subsection 14(3) and 42(3). The repeal of subsection 14(3) removes age restrictions to the continuation of appointment after the age of 6S. The repeal of subsection 42(3) will allow those employed by the board, in particular those who are employed in overseas offices at sufficiently high remuneration to live in some high cost of living countries, to earn a higher salary and conditions than those of the Australian managing director, for all of the obvious reasons. I support the amendments. This is a general housekeeping bill which is quite extensive, covering-as I said earliersome 10 different acts. It is important to note that some of these acts go back to 1949; some, to 1960; some, to 1987; and some, to 1985. They have all been overtaken by certain-",119,Representatives Main Committee

The procedures for making appointments to the council, as I said earlier, are very important in that the previous arrangement required the Governor General to make the appointment. As we know, the wheels of government tum slowly and the Governor General had to ensure that those nominated had the approval of the minister and of the Prime Minister. That caused a great deal of delay in the appointments. As a result, a great deal of time was wasted. This will now be taken away by the changes which will allow the minister, with the approval of the Prime Minister, to make the appointments. I am conscious of the fact that there is a great deal on the agenda this afternoon. Whilst in general terms this bill is of a non-controversial nature and serves to close off some of the real loopholescomments now and just conclude by saying I strongly support the amendments to the bill. for Lowe( Mr Zammit) for a very mild filibuster. The amendments in the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 are, in themselves, not important but they give me an opportunity to say something which I think is perhaps fundamental. The fact that they are brought together from various parts of legislation, affecting various areas of government responsibility but all coming under the minister for industry, is very pertinent. It is about time we started to understand what we mean by industry and industry policy. Rod Cameron of ANOP made a very interesting speech last week to the minerals conference in Canberra, in which he pointed out that the current assessment that he has made of his own work and some work on behalf of the minerals industry suggests that people in Australia are extremely concerned about the perceived absence of industry policy. In the chamber, day after day we have been debating these questions about industry policy. It is important to start talking about what that actually means. There are some who think industry policy is a way of giving cash or some handout to business. There are some who think that one writes a monumental manuscript of enormous length and detail, spelling out how every industry should work. The Prime Minister( Mr Howard), in some smart remark the other day, referred to a 1O-year plan. A lot of people feel that somehow there has to be a single, discrete thing: complex, detailed, and totally prescriptive. Perhaps one day it may be that; I have never known it to be. Industry policy in a modem Western society is the accretion of a whole range of forces: many negative, many positive. It also involves a mind-set and an understanding of what industry is actually about. The idea that taking away the regulations, taking away government and taking away so-called red tape and letting business get on with being in business will somehow produce some coherence is-quite frankly-fanciful. The idea that out of chaos comes order is not very logical. An industry policy first requires an understanding of what the drivers are and what the forces at work are. The forces include competition, government, cost, innovation, commitment, and an understanding of how the bits fit together-how the ingredients actually work together.",122,Representatives Main Committee

That problem arises from the fact that people deal with the fragments discretely on one hand and yet they talk about them as if they are coherent, and on the other hand the alternative they argue for is a prescriptive, detailed and punitive system. What this government fails to understand, and what it is doing at the moment-and has been since March last year-is making and carrying out industry policy. The fact that it has beencontribution on this debate, which is a very narrow one particularly relating to repeal of subsections in tourism legislation and changes to bounties. It is probably not appropriate for a wide ranging debate on industry policy as such. I ask that the member contains his remarks to a more narrow focus on this particular legislation. is that this is industry policy being made right now in narrow, prescriptive, detailed little ways across four or five pieces of legislation which in fact project and give an attitude and affect things. For the last 15 months the government has been changing bits and pieces all the way through-or doing nothing at all. That, in itself, is making policy. That in effect is actually doing something. I am suggesting that what these amendments to the legislation indicate is of no great consequence. The fact is that they have been brought forward in bits and pieces, in dribs and drabs and fragments all over the landscape; the whole industry and commercial landscape is littered with bits and pieces. Whether they be computer bounties, shipbuilding bounties, or R&D tax write-offs, they are bits and pieces which are, in fact, making a substantial policy change to this country. More importantly, they are making a substantial change to the attitudes and mind-set of the people out there, both in the community and in business. So the government, in effect, is making policy even by these minor technical amendments. I urge the House, and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to understand the significance of what is actually happening in this period. The decision of the government that it will not have an industry policy per se means that the industry position you have is an unconscious and fragmented one that is failing. If people in the community think that there is no industry policy and the people in business think that there is no industry policy, then a country without industry policy obviously does not want industries. So what the government in effect is doing through this process is dismantling what was a reasonably healthy attitude towards industry on all sides-by the work force, the employment community and the investment community. I am trying to put on notice that this House, this parliament and this government will some day have to face up to the fact that this is not the way to approach issues; this is not the way to run things. It is not appropriate to bring together five or six technical amendments and say that these are inconsequential and we do not discuss and debate them, so that the country and industry are run step by step, brick by brick, tile by tile, across some mosaic of which no-one can see the picture in advance and no-one can see it afterwards. You are building a picture with mosaics. These little pieces are changing the landscape. They are changing the scene and no-one knows how, least of all the government.",123,Representatives Main Commitiee

These amendments are to the point, but I have concluded my remarks anyway. very glad to be able to sum up this legislation on behalf of the government and to thank all the members who contributed in one way or another. We have heard wide ranging speeches touching on a number of topics, thanks to the tolerance shown by the chair. As all members know, the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 amends a number of acts administered by the portfolio of industry, science and tourism. As has been acknowledged by one speaker after another, the changes are not controversial and are mostly technical in nature. Several of the proposed amendments implement important election commitments given by the government in the area of science, engineering and technology. For example, we have maintained our commitment before the last election to change the name of the Australian Science and Technology Council to become the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council-a very important and symbolic change which has been welcomed by the Institution of Engineers and by the engineering community in general. The Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council is a very significant source of independent advice on science, engineering and technology policy. The amendments to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 implement this important name change. The government has also sought to implement a number of changes to improve the effectiveness of the CSIRO, consistent with our recognition of that research body having a leading role in Australia's technology and industry development. Overcoming structural impediments to focus on key research products was a primary concern. Changes proposed to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 reflect the new administrative framework developed by the review of CSIRO's management structure and performance, and put in place the government's objective to facilitate greater flexibility in CSIRO's structures and research programs. I am glad to say that that new structure is working particularly well. The remaining amendments are largely administrative in nature and, as such, do not raise substantive issues.

One key finding says: ... in the absence of regulation, the market for migration advice has tended to operate imperfectly with consumers bearing unacceptable cost in terms of exploitation and inappropriate practice by a sector of the industry; ... More importantly, another key finding says: ... that the Scheme has provided a measure of consumer protection and ... its credibility as a consumer protection mechanism has strengthened somewhat in the time since the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) conducted a review of the Scheme; ... Essentially, there is an admission out there that this is one industry that needs a significant amount of regulation. I would be the first to admit that the organisation that, in the long term, the government sees as having some role in self-regulation-the Migration Institute of Australia-is a reasonably reputable association. It has structured meetings with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs three times a year; it has conducted training courses; it was involved in the Roach inquiry; and, indeed, it is an organisation that we do not have too many criticisms of. It has even received grants from the government to develop a practical training course. The reality, as the other part of the quote says, is that there is an industry here in which we see very desperate people and we see some very crude sharks in the market who very much are on the ball essentially to exploit these people, whether by claiming refugee status when they have got no bona fides in the world, by launching spouse or de facto relationships when people have not even got the required cohabitation, by having people already in bigamous relations purporting to remarry et cetera-you go along the train of claims. Many times it is essentially aimed at buying time in Australia, once they come here and overstay, to develop a relation-hip with somebody during their period of fighting this refugee claim. I want to say, on the other hand, that, whilst there is a need to supervise those kinds of operators in this industry, the reality of life is that you often have people in your electorate, constituents, who have been just as involved in this conspiracy. They want to buy time, they want to rort the Australian system and they are out here to overstay. The inquiry, titled Protecting the vulnerable, by a joint committee of which the current minister was a member, came down in favour of a number of recommendations. They included the continuation of the then scheme for three years, a review at the end of that period, continued registration of lawyers-which was a fairly controversial measure and which was upheld in the courts of this country, despite the views of lawyers-individuals not being required to register if they worked for voluntary organisations and training modules for migration agents. It also suggested something which this government should do, and which was suggested to the previous government; and that is to close the long standing loophole that advice to sponsors and nominators is not covered by the provisions of legislation. As I say, it should have been undertaken by the previous government and it is more than necessary to be undertaken today",125,Representatives Main Committee
288,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (5.34 P.m.),"There are a number of telling commentsTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4771 because it is a major loophole where those who are in malpractice in this field ignore the needs. That unanimous inquiry, which wrote to all 1,450 then registered agents, received 65 submissions, had witnesses from major sectors of the industry, such as the department, the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales, immigration advice centres, the Law Council, the Migration Agents Registration Board and so on, and came to a number of conclusions. Amongst them were the following: The principal issue is not whether the advice is paid for or is provided free of charge, but whether consumers, particularly those who are least able to shop around for advice, should be able to expect accurate advice from competent advisers, and whether they should be able to access appropriate avenues of redress should the advice which is provided prove to be negligent, inaccurate or dishonest. The committee furthermore, at XXVI, noted: One particularly invidious outcomeand I have just mentioned itof the omissionthat is, of nominators and sponsorsis that persons who have been found to be unqualified or unfit to practise as migration agents can circumvent the scheme by directing their practice through sponsors. The parliamentary committee furthermore noted at 2.20, on page 9: In addition to the above, many requests for immigration advice arise from persons who are not in a position to advance adequately their own cases or the cases of family members. Applicants may lack an adequate command of English, or may not comprehend the requirements for making immigration applications. Such applicants may be unable or unclear about how to best advance their cases. Applicants from different cultural backgrounds might not understand the processes and the statutory requirements relating to visa applications. At 3.82 the committee came to a unanimous summary of the then prevailing situation in the industry and in the regulation of those agents. It noted at page 61: Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered. On the positive side, around 600 persons either have been denied the right to practise as migration agents or have decided to withdraw from seeking entry to the industry. In addition, the avenues for developing expertise in migration law have increased noticeably, with various courses and seminars now being conducted at a tertiary level and within the industry itself. On the negative side, disciplinary action taken against migration agents has been minimal, even though the number of complaints in relation to registered and unregistered practice has been increasing over time. I want to put on the record at this stage that that is certainly a very clear weakness of the current scheme. There are doubts out there as to the way in which people can be pursued and, I guess, an unwillingness by many people exploited to come forward because of the reality of their situation. I have got to express some early doubts that self-regulation is going to essentially do anything about that aspect-the most significant aspect of the problem. We might be able to bemoan the question of cost to the users in the field, we might be able to make a number of other criticisms of the scheme as it currently operates but, fundamentally, I believe the most important aspect of this is to rid the industry of these people, dissuade them from participation and, whether people like to hear this or not, penalise them and throw them out of the industry if necessary. I do not think that that most crucial aspect of the problem that the committee itself noted is going to be tackled by self-regulation. 4772 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 There is an admission by the Spicer inquiry-and this is why we have got a situation here today where the legislation is being extended until next year-that the industry's main organisation, which I have earlier indicated is one which we can largely have respect for, is not in a situation where it can claim to be representative of the industry. Its membership is rather small. I think the last figure was 2,200 people registered. There are some major players that are members of the Migration Institute of Australia. There is talk about banks, even voluntary organisations and corporations, and there are probably some practices in this field which are members, but a significant part of the industry is not involved in the institute. The Spicer inquiry says that at this stage it is incapable of policing the industry. That is why the government speaks about the concept of statutory self-regulation as an interim measure in their move towards self-regulation. The minister notes agreement with this analysis of where they are at but, on our side of the debate, we do not have the confidence that he has that the ability might be there within the next six months. are, as he says, incapable at this stage of conducting self-regulation-and I take his point. The situation, as the Spicer inquiry noted, is such that there are quite a few remaining problems in the field. As a person who has consistently questioned the degree of influence of various lobby groups on our migration policy, I want to say that I think we went to the other extreme in the Spicer inquiry. I notice that one of the members of the inquiry had some involvement with Careforce, but I thought the balance was too far in the other direction if we look at the membership; it had a significant preponderance of practitioners. At the end of the day, regardless of one's analysis of them as individuals, you would have to ask whether there was a degree of self-interest in moving the government out of the field, moving the administration out of the field and thrusting towards self-regulation. I am not saying for a moment that there are particular errors or particular weaknesses in the inquiry but, as I say, I think I have a reasonable track record in not wanting these kinds of organisations to be dominated by FECCA or by some immigration advice centre. But, if one were to analyse the make-up, one would perhaps say it had swung too far in another direction. The inquiry did make a few pertinent points that are important for the future, regardless of whether there is support eventually for self-regulation. I think its point No. 11, on page 5, is accurate and should be taken on board regardless of the direction this country goes in. It notes: ... there has been inadequate promotion of the current Scheme and, in whatever arrangement replaces the current Schemeor, for that matter, if the current scheme continuesan ongoing consumer information strategy, targeted in particular to members of non-English speaking background communities, needs to be developed. That is indicative of what I said earlier. I think there is a lack of knowledge out there of what to do if people feel that they have been ripped off or even if the people they go to feel ripped off. There is a lack of knowledge and a lack of confidence perhaps that, at the end of the road, they will be getting success in pursuing people. The Spicer inquiry also noted: that in a deregulated environment, consumers in the migration advice industry would not be able to rely solely on the remedies available to them under consumer protection legislation and have in fact failed",126,Representatives Main Committee
289,Mr Ruddock,The next six months is for the,128,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"Sorry, 20 years time, is it? The minister is conceding that theyTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4773 to take action to any significant extent either in the courts under the consumer protection provisions of trade practices legislation or in the States and Territories small claims tribunals. So they are putting on the record something that is in evidence: that there is a relative lack of successful prosecutions, and many people-as we noted earlier-have been dissuaded from moving into the industry. But that does not mean that there are still not a number of people who perhaps, with more knowledge in the field and with more determination, might have been pursued. We have concerns that with a reduction in the support of various advice centres by the government in the 1996 budget, these people that we are supposedly trying to tackle and supervise and to rid ourselves and the industry of, are going to be encouraged. There is no doubt that the significant reduction in support by the government of people who are doing this kind of assistance on a voluntary basis only opens up the field in a more obvious way to those who wish to exploit people. The legislation, as on a previous occasion, is an extension by this government of the currently operating provisions. AndI want to mention again that unanimous report, Protecting the vulnerable? which made a number of significant suggestions as to the better operation of the supervisory section of the industry. Some of those suggestions were not taken up by the previous government; others which were taken up, in the view of the Spicer inquiry, essentially improved the situation. The summary position is that we do have here a field that allows people who have come from societies where there are repressive regimes lacking the rule of law, where people have no knowledge of the court system, where they have fears of police and of police institutions, to feel more confident. We are saying to these people that they should know their rights straight away. They should know that they have to be very thorough ir. the way they deal with people offering advice to them. That is not the reality that people have out there. They are extremely desperate on many occasions and see their only option as being the person they have been led to by family or friends or, more often, that person who advertises very heavily in particular ethnic media and who sometimes has the support of institutions within the ethnic community as being their basic salvation and way of staying in this country. They are, as the opposition notes, very vulnerable and they should be our primary responsibility and we should not adopt an attitude as to how we should regulate this industry on the basis of ideological bent. We should have doubts about an industry which, at this stage at least, in the view of the Spicer inquiry is not capable of operating without very major improvement. It should get more people involved, have more membership, and reach a stage when it really can say that it represents the industry. Until that happens, I think that we have really got to question whether the next stage of this process is in the interests of those people that we say are most vulnerable. One of the recommendations of the Spicer review stated: ... in the interests of developing a cohesive industry with consistent standards, mandatory registration as migration agents continue to apply to legal practitioners. That is an important point that the joint committee in its past review strongly supported, regardless of their feelings of self-importance and their desire not to be covered by regulation. The other point that the opposition would have some concerns about is the resourcing of this regulation. It is not just a question of eventually handing it over and being hopeful that things will basically scrabble through and that they will be able to do it through their own 4774 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 resources. The opposition supports the extension of the current legislation, believing that, on bal;mce, it has had major accomplishments, that it has kept a lot of people out of the industry whu should not have been in it in the first place. The legislation has had some measure of supervisory oversight so that perhaps people will be more reluctant to exploit others. It has probably accomplished that in the area of fears about moving the charges too heavily. It has, in some cases, removed people from the industry and essentially, at the end of the day, it has a motivation which is beyond the self-interest of those people who seek-supposedly in the long-term-to regulate themselves. I commend the bill. 3) 1997 provides for a six-month extension to the migration agents registration scheme under the Migration Act 1958, given that the present six-month sunset clause would see the scheme terminate on 21 September this year. Extending the scheme to 21 March 1998 will initially allow for the introduction of statutory self-regulation as a transition stage before the eventual introduction of full self-regulation. The Migration Institute of Australia, a relatively new industry body, will have time to establish the necessary structures to take on this self-regulatory role of over 2,200 migration agents now operating. Disciplinary sanctions including removal of the right to practise are expected to form part of the industry based self-regulation. There will also be specific complaints resolution processes to protect vulnerable members of our community and aspirant members who use migration agents. The government's plan to move progressively from the current scheme to partial supervised deregulation and eventually to industry self-regulation will enable the government to support and work with reputable agents and allow this peak body to develop standards and selfregulatory systems and procedures, picking up on the comments of the member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson). Two years ago, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in its report Protecting the vulnerable? delivered some mixed findings on the operation of the scheme which had only been established in September 1992. When the then government introduced the scheme, they rejected self-regulation because of a claimed high level of fragmentation in the industry. The creation of an industry peak body since then is an important step in ensuring that migration agents are more able to speak with one voice. I found it interesting that the joint standing committee's report suggested that it was difficult to determine just how many visa applicants sought the advice of migration agents. An Immigration Rights and Advice Centre telephone survey suggested that three per cent of callers specifically sought guidance on alleged wrong advice or the checking of other advice from migration agents. However, the complexity of migration legislation and regulation, the extent to which people compete for places, and an applicant's inability to advance their own or their family's case are other factors pushing them towards migration agents. The joint standing committee criticised the generally low level of public awareness of the scheme, as has been mentioned by the member for Reid. The scheme has also not fulfilled its aim of becoming self-funding. On a more positive note, the committee noted that 600 people had been stopped from practising as migration agents. This demonstrates that the provision of migration advice is an imperfect market and that the current regulatory system still enabled shonks to get a foothold in some cases. The then Refugee Review Tribunal commented that 'many agents are ignorant of the regulations' and that 'submissions are little",128,Representatives Main Committee
291,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (5.51 P.m.),"The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4775 more than legal nonsense.' The Immigration Review Tribunal commented that in 1993-94 the proportion of successful applicants was the same, whether or not a professional adviser was used. The self-regulatory regime will bring forward the self-interest of reputable agents to ensure that vulnerable potential migrants are not exposed to incompetence, dishonest and exploitative practices from people offering migration advice to the discredit of legitimate, competent and qualified professionals working in the field. Last time. I spoke on this subject, I suggested that migration agents were people who were proffers of hope. They sold the hope and the prospects of coming to our country as a key ware that they had to offer for their payments. That just highlights the importance of protecting people who tum to these advisers in the hope that they will improve their prospects and chances of migrating to our great country. The proposed changes in the bill follow an internal review by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The task force took advice from a group of independent experts chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, former chair of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. One recent example brought to my attention is of a visitor to Australia who liked the place so much he wanted to stay. He must have been visiting the electorate of Dunkley; it is a wonderful place. A migration adviser in a regional centre, which I will not mention-not far from Dunkley-advised him to apply as a refugee. He said that he was not a refugee in any sense of the word, but he followed the advice he had been provided for his $3,000. Clearly, he was rejected and now forfeits any credibility when applying in the future on more legitimate grounds. I cannot begin to tell you how much he laments taking the advice that was offered to him. It also leads to the question of lawyers, and I am pleased to see that lawyers are being brought within the scope of the program. It is not a question about whether they are charging more than $1.20 per photocopy page or those sorts of things. It is an important specialist area where very much they are providing advice on hope. Just as migration agents need to ensure that they understand the program, so must lawyers. Going back to that earlier comment, pure legal nonsense is not a way of getting through the system, notwithstanding the considerable sums of money that are often paid for very poor advice. I am sure the member for Reid and other colleagues in the committee room are aware of the number of people coming into electorate offices all around the country looking for help after they have paid good money to migration agents only to find that they have sent them up the wrong track. I am very encouraged by what the minister is doing and I would like to pick up on some of the points that the member for Reid has mentioned. We seem to be in heated agreement over this. We seem to agree that there are doubts over whether the present system as it is is working effectively. We share that view, and we also share the view that the current system has been inadequately promoted and that there is a lack of knowledge about it. Unlike the member for Reid, I do not believe there are doubts over self-regulation at this time because of the way the minister is going about this particular transition. What he is saying in the first instance is, 'We'll supervise a partial self-regulation, where the minister can delegate the authorities to the institute, and see how it goes.' We can learn from the experience. The minister is there to provide advice and support over time as the instituteagain as the member for Reid says-develops and matures and gets up to speed to be a fully competent peak body for the industry. 4776 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 It is interesting that the member for Reid referred to some papers on the free advice that is provided to people seeking to migrate to Australia. My view is that, wherever you are getting your advice from, the consumer still deserves protection. I certainly would encourage the minister and the institute to consider including voluntary organisation in the work of the institute as we move into this partial self-regulation regime. The reason I say that is that I have many people coming to my electorate office seeking our assistance after they have spoken with an ethnic community organisation outlining perhaps how they should go about seeking to apply to enter our country. Often that advice is not accurate. Often that advice has led to people from my part of the world being very up-beat and very positive about their prospects without really seeing how they measure up against the criteria of the migration program. In some way, I would certainly encourage the minister to ask the Migration Institute of Australia to take in some of those organisations, both in the development phase of the systems and procedures that it is putting in place in preparation for self-regulation and also to see whether there is a way of ensuring that those community organisations, and others offering free advice--out of goodwill more than anything-are at least fully informed of what is going on and are not providing false hope to people. It also would ensure that the consumers that we are seeking to protect can be involved in the development of those systems and procedures as, once again referring to the member for Reid's comments, the institute gets up to speed in preparation for self-regulation. I will not add a lot more than that, although I did have some rather interesting facts on the changes that the government has made to the migration program, why I believe the changes are very much for the better, and why I believe the measures the government has put in place have built confidence in the migration program and, to some degree, have made it a little more complex, thereby increasing the need for competent advice to people wishing to apply. In closing, it is clear to me from reading this report and from my very vague understanding of the career of the member for Reid in this place that he has something to offer. I certainly encourage him to put forward his ideas and to make a positive contribution to what the minister is trying to achieve. He should let the Australian public and aspiring Australians benefit from the obvious understanding and insight he has on this subject. The opportunity is there in this supervised delegated regime that the minister is overseeing to ensure that the particular systems and processes, the checks and balances that need to be put in place, are developed and are in place as we move towards industry self-regulation. I commend the bill to the House, congratulate the minister on his continuing good work in a difficult place, and invite my colleagues on both sides of the House-including the boisterous member for Reid-to make a contribution where possible to the development of a selfregulatory system. 3) 1997 extends to 21 March 1998 the sunset clause of the migration agents registration scheme, which was to terminate on 21 September 1997 after having operated for five years. It is for that reason that the opposition supports this bill, and for that reason only. This move is in preparation, from the government's point of view, for statutory selfregulation for a transitional period, with a proposed move to full self-regulation of the migration agents industry. My view of self-regulation can sometimes be characterised as giving",130,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mr Darga Vel (Fraser) (6.01 P.m.),"The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4777 the blood bank to Dracula to look after. Unfortunately, Australia has seen some disappointing results from self-regulation. The opposition recognises the limitations that exist in a globalised market whereby migration agents who operate solely offshore are not subject to regulation in the same way that Australian-operating migrant agents are. However, we also need to recognise the inherent contradictions and limitations that self-regulation imposes, particularly in a market that even Mr Spicer has described as less than perfect. Mr Spicer is not known, from my experience, as someone who is an ardent opponent of selfregulation-indeed, he has often been at the forefront of running arguments supporting selfregulation. In this instance, he is encouraging us to be fairly cautious, and I think that is the prudent course for those who support self-regulation. For my part, I have some very serious concerns about the proponents of self-regulation in this industry in particular. For instance, the government has articulated concerns about the potential for abuse of the spouse provisions of the migration regulations. In fact, these concerns have been cited as justification for cuts to the migration program. This bill raises questions about how, at the end of the day, the government will be able to control the level of fraud in the marriage program, for example. If the government is really serious about stopping fraud in the marriage categories of the migration program, it would need to ensure that the method of regulation-self-regulation or otherwise-is effective, not only on the fraud issue but-and from my point of view this is a more important issue-the level of the exploitation of the applicants involved. One view is that, because of the complexity of migration law, it is unrealistic not to give applicants the ability to obtain professional advice about how to maximise their chances of lodging a successful migration application. The previous speaker suggested that voluntary organisations should be included in the scope of the current debate, but the facts of life are that they are already covered by the scope of the current regime. They already have competency standards and they compare very favourably with private providers. However, in the absence of adequate funding being provided so that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs can perform that function-and I note that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has sustained pretty tough cuts this round-the government needs to ensure that whatever regulatory regime is imposed or is adopted, whether it is self-regulation or otherwise, is effective. This arises essentially out of the complexity of migration law. We have accepted in this debate, prima facie, that migration law has to be complex and we have then progressed down the road about how migration advice may be provided. I suggest there is another course which bears some thought and that is the degree of complexity that migration law actually requires. The cost of migration applications is very high. There is the cost of applications, and a person may require further advice about migration law from migration agents. We need to really ensure that people are getting value for money in terms of accurate and lawful advice from migration agents and that that advice is fair dinkum. More importantly, we need to ensure that people who apply for migration to Australia do not have their expectations falsely raised about their chances of lodging a successful application, bearing in mind that this is an industry where people make profits out of other people's hopes and expectations. 4778 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 I have heard stories recounted today, which are consistent with this line of argument, of examples of genuine asylum seekers to this country who provide vast sums of money to agents in order to lodge applications for refugee status. Many of these people appear to have been told by unscrupulous agents that their claims will have a greater chance of success if they enter Australia through the back door, that is, come to Australia as a tourist and then lodge a claim 'for refugee status whilst in Australia. Someone who is desperate to escape an oppressive regime does not always have the time or inclination, capacity or resources, to sit down with immigration officials to determine the best way of proceeding. In these cases we need to ensure that asylum seekers do not arrive with false expectations of their claims being recognised simply because they have been encouraged to put up a large sum of money. Members might remember that I spoke yesterday of the problems encountered by workers on the Mandir Society'S temple which was opened in Canberra last weekend. I commented in the media last Sunday on this situation where workers are brought into the country and their rights as workers are breached. In that instance the workers were paid an appalling rate of 51 c an hour, contrary to the undertakings that the sponsor made to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. They were not paid superannuation, they were not paid proper allowances, they had inadequate safety protection, there was inadequate fall protection, if any, and there were no first aid kits on site, and so on and so on. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was advised, but the sponsor was able to bring out more workers. The department allowed this circumstance to take place even though it knew that this blatant exploitation was taking place, Clearly, there needs to be a little bit more guts applied in some of these circumstances. I do not know whether, in that particular case, the workers were brought out through a migration agent, but that is not the point. There have been documented cases of people who have been brought out and basically their rights have been totally ignored. all right with you. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A.

In conclusion, the opposition supports the continuation of the current program, which is why we are supporting this bill. In terms of the debate about the progress to self-regulation, I think there are a number of matters and issues that still need to be resolved. A very prudent, cautious and conservative approach needs to be taken. I am pleased that the general recognition for prudence and caution has been echoed on both sides of politics. I commend the bill to the House. p.m.)-in reply-I am pleased to have this opportunity to sum up in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997. I thank the members for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson), Dunkley( Mr Billson) and Fraser( Mr Dargavel) for their comments. As the member for Reid has left, I will come back to his remarks. I will pick up those of the honourable member for Fraser instead, in case he intends to leave. Let me deal with the issue on which I interjected, because it is a very important question. I am sorry if I missed some remarks you made yesterday in relation to this matter. It is the usual practice, if you wish ministers to be aware of your remarks, to indicate-perhaps by a call to the office-that you intend to raise something and then they might be in a position to follow it up quickly with you. Being now apprised of your remarks, I will have a look at the question. Let me also say that I have spoken with the construction union on a number of occasions during my consultations. While general issues have been raised with me about the need for efficacy in processing skilled applicants, either through employer nomination or under the other alternative arrangements which we have where there are tripartite labour market agreements for people to be able to enter Australia to work in particular situations, I understand the union's reticence and desire to protect conditions and so on. We are not about using the migration program as a basis for undermining conditions here in Australia. AllI would say is that at no point in time was I aware of the particular claims that you have raised in relation to the temple development here in Canberra. I do not recall that matter having ever been brought to my attention and, I suspect, if it had been, it would have been something that I would have noted. I simply make the point that my department is in a position to act in relation to visas granted on particular conditions, if we are apprised of the fact that breaches are occurring. There are certain natural justice provisions that have to be followed, and you do need to put before people the assertions that are made; and people need to stand up and say that somebody is not being properly paid, so that we can put those matters properly before them and deal with them. The reason that we have to follow that course is very simple: it is because of the administrative law that operates in this country. In relation to the rights that people obtain through the issue of a visa, we are not in a position to simply terminate the visa without following the natural justice principles of putting allegations that are made before people, for them to have an opportunity to correct them if an error has been made. That brings me to the second point of substance in the honourable member's contribution that I wanted to pick up, and that was in relation to the complexity of the migration act and",134,Representatives Main Committee
298,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (6.114780 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 regulations. I do not think it is generally understood why we have an act that is so complex and so difficultunderstanding of it. I do not know that that is necessarily desirable-not that I should have an understanding but that I should be the only one who understands it. I have an understanding of how this arose under your predecessors. Senator Ray was the person who essentially got in place the present act and regulatory regime. This was modified through the reform act that followed. We moved to introduce the statutory scheme that we have in place today because we had seen develop over time a situation where the previous largely discretionary regime was no longer capable of operating in this area. This was largely because of the operations of administrative law. The courts had essentially taken over the determination as to who was going to enter Australia and who was not. I frequently draw to people's attention and put before them an interesting article written by a former immigration official, Evan Arthur. He made it clear that we were going to have 14,000 onshore applications on strong and compelling compassionate grounds under the guidelines that have been developed for interpreting that provision, which was section 6A(l)(e) of the old migration act, by the courts when the matter was largely left for them to define what those words meant. The former government was not of the view that the immigration program should be dominated by people who had entered Australia on the pretext of being a visitor, simply managed to run a reasonably good story and then been able to stay in Australia. The view was that if people wanted to apply to come here they should apply offshore and wait their tum. Ultimately the statutory regime we had with the very limited discretion that ministers now have-the non-compellable discretion-was to ensure that the government of the day was able to administer the program as it had planned. You made some observations about asylum seekers. I would like to say that it is a vexed issue about which I could speak at length. I am certainly concerned to contain the abuse that is occurring in relation to asylum claims but I do so in the context of a determination to ensure that no bona fide refugee should be rejected. I recognise that some people's circumstances might be such that they will go to extraordinary lengths to get here. They will pay people. They will forge documents. They will mislead me as to their intentions. But it is because of their vulnerable situation and the claims have to be examined on that basis. That is the obligation we have accepted. My officials understand that and that is why we provide the opportunity for review independently by the Refugee Review Tribunal. I challenge the members of the Labor Party in relation to some of the proposed changes that I will be initiating during the course of these parliamentary sittings in relation to the issue of judicial review. We have already a very significant litigious load. I am probably the most sued minister of the Commonwealth at the present time. There was an expectation that when we put in place independent merits review that people would get out of the courts. It has not happened. The fact that the courts are involved has led to significant changes in the way in which people are able to enter Australia. It has removed a lot of the decision making from the",135,Representatives Main Committee

300,Mr Ruddock,"It gives me an advantage over many. I at least have some element ofTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4781 government of the day. I will be proposing a mechanism whereby we can again get control of the immigration program for the parliament and for the government of the day. That will be done through a privative clause which will ensure that the only matter that the courts will be able to examine is whether or not the people who take the decisions-at first instance, my department and the merits review system that we have in place-are legally competent to take the decision. That will considerably narrow the range of issues that we take into the courts and upon which the courts can tum their very creative minds. It will lead to a situation where the act may not have to go through the many contortions that it now goes through to deal with some of the very elaborate approaches that are taken by the courts in dealing with this act in particular cases. To come back to the bill that we are dealing with, the bill is to extend the sunset clause. If the sunset clause is not extended, the present statutory scheme collapses. Let us understand it-it collapses and then there will be no scheme. We are proposing an alternative; one that has been developed as a result of a review undertaken by my department; one that was the subject of advice from a reference group of very eminent Australians. I accept the comment of the honourable member for Fraser( Mr Dargavel) that Ian Spicer was a person who normally would be a gung-ho deregulator. He was a member of the reference group. Other members of the group included Pamela O'Neil, a former member of the Labor Party and a very distinguished agent for the Commonwealth in a variety of roles; Ian Tonking, a Sydney barrister and a specialist in trade practices matters, particularly in relation to consumer affairs issues; and Cheryl Webster. The member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson) asked some questions about Cheryl Webster. I have known Cheryl over a long period of time. She works as a grant-in-aid worker for Careforce, which is part of the Anglican Home Mission. I do not think that in any way disqualifies her. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Anglican Home Mission society has worked amongst migrants and refugees in your electorate over a long period of time. Cheryl is a person of great personal quality and one who can contribute and did contribute significantly in relation to this. The other members of the group are John Hodges, a former minister, and Pauline Matthewson, a prominent member of the Migration Institute of Australia. It was a very balanced group and its advice was very helpful. It was not an ideological issue. It was a matter of addressing the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The honourable member for Reid took us through the committee's report very helpfully, but I remind the member that I was on that committee and I am very much aware of its recommendations. The committee was of the view that self-regulation should be looked at. The reason that there was a sunset clause and it was continued was that this was an option that was always to be kept open. The committee recommended in 1995 that the migration agents registration scheme should continue to operate for another three years with a range of improvements, and that at that stage it should be reviewed so we could look at these further models. Self-regulation was one of those that was held out. We are operating largely within that time frame. It is important to recognise that what we are proposing is a form of regulatory selfregulation. In other words, there will be amendments to the act to establish that the Migration Institute is the body that will be undertaking the supervisory role. It will be in accordance with 4782 MAIN COMMITIEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 its code of ethics. It will administer a scheme in which peer pressure will establish, hopefully, the highest order of supervision and standards for membership. I think those people who are ethical and who are involved in the Migration Institute will be anxious to ensure that the higher standards are upheld. My expectation is that they will work with legal practitioners. They have already indicated to me that they will sit down with the Law Council to look at ways and means of integrating their different approaches to the question of supervision. I expect that they will be able to work together in the way in which this particular scheme is developed. I thank particularly my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley( Mr Billson) for his very supportive observations. I think they were far too generous, and I speak with a degree of experience in relation to that. I know my own weaknesses but I nevertheless thank him for it. Let me say that voluntary organisations will be included in the regime. We fund a number of organisations now for the purposes of providing advice, and that is important. We expect that those people who are offering free advice through voluntary agencies ought to be the subject of supervisory arrangements. They will still be able to be registered. They will not have to pay a fee and they will not have to necessarily satisfy the same comprehensive knowledge test. One of the things that I am very supportive of is the work that is undertaken through our universities and through a number of the voluntary organisations that we fund to provide tuition, if one might put it in that form, for people who want to be migration agents. We have a number of programs now that are leading to a better trained work force in this area. That applies not only to agents but to the legal profession. It is an area of some complexity and difficulty, and one where specialisation is very important today. I thank honourable members for their support for this legislation. Obviously, my officials and I will take on board all of the comments that have been made. We are in the process of drafting the legislation now and obviously there may be a much more comprehensive and vigorous debate when we see the substantive legislation.

I spoke about it as being a humanising and responsive change so that people's real lives could be better integrated with the systems and procedures of the Child Support Agency. This is achieved by providing an opportunity for income estimate elections to better reflect the non-custodial parent's capacity to pay and, as a result, to reduce the likelihood of custodial parents having to refund overpayments. It will reward reliable payers of child support by allowing for their employers not to be involved in the arrangements where they have a satisfactory track record of paying. It also provides for the Family Court to take into account private arrangements amicably entered into when making property and spousal maintenance orders. I spoke about the bill as being a welcome first step in ensuring that the law supports and encourages the sort of desirable behaviour we hope for where a relationship is no longer viable and there are children left behind who need to be cared for. I mentioned a number of further reforms that I believe warrant consideration, and I sought to encourage the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) and the member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon) to constructively contribute to the diligent work that many of us in this place, under the chairmanship of the member for Grey( Mr Wakelin), are doing in trying to deal with many of the challenges facing the community, involving relationship breakdown and the care of kids. I say to those opposite: resist the temptation to be petty and pathetic as the coalition government seeks to deal with the recommendations that remain from the joint select committee report on the child support scheme and other, quite numerous, constructive ideas that have been brought forward by the coalition members working in conjunction with the member for Grey. I say that for the kids' sake. This is about making sure that the kids get the support, care and input from willing parents towards their development into young Australians and great citizens of this nation. There are a number of things which I mentioned in my earlier contribution that simply seek to ensure that the system encourages all parents to do the right thing and to reward them for it, and to discourage behaviour that is unhelpful or contrary to the care and development needs of the child. That is one of the great dilemmas that I have with some of the provisions and arrangements that the Child Support Agency operates under at this time: they seem to actually discourage people from doing the right thing. The person sitting in your chair on the last occasion I spoke, Madam Deputy Speaker, allowed me to use the term 'the stuff it option'. That is what far too many of my constituents say to me when they come to see me, in despair about the impact that the Child Support Agency regime is having on their lives. Too many people are saying that it is easier just to throw their job in and not put in to the community but to put in to their own care needs and, as a result, not to provide anything in the way of financial assistance for the care of the",136,Representatives Main Committee
301,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (8.00 P.m.),"In continuation of my earlier contribution, I remind4784 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 children that they helped to create. It is disastrous that people are seeing that as a viable alternative to being a constructive and willing contributor to the development of their children. We should view the Child Support Agency in the first instance as a fallback option where less intrusive and light-handed regimes are applied to people who voluntarily go about doing the right things out of interest and care for the child. The Child Support Agency arrangements need to be interventionist, intrusive and quite prescriptive for people who are not doing the right thing. But to apply those sorts of regimes to people who are doing the right thing is a very sad mistake. In closing, there are some issues that I would certainly encourage those in this place to consider. The first is to foster greater cooperation between the Child Support Agency and the Family Court. I spoke briefly about it in my last contribution, and I encourage all of us here to put our minds to that. The second is to try to work out a way of encouraging non-custodial parents to go that extra yard to do the overtime or take on that second job, to try and repair their lives at the same time as making a contribution towards the care of their child. How can we do that? There are some good ideas around and we need to work through them. I welcome the interest of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) in this matter. I am certainly encouraged by the vast number of coalition members that are very serious about trying to leave an improved Child Support Agency as a memento of our first term in government. I commend this bill to the House and I ask those present, when they are thinking about the Child Support Agency, to think about changes that are there for the sake of the kids. Billson) with his well-chosen comments on what has been a long running issue for the parliament and, indeed, for the nation. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 has been in the parliament for some time. It was introduced into the House on 6 March 1997 and referred to the Main Committee on 18 March 1997. The purpose of the legislation is, firstly, that custodial parents will not have to refund overpayments but, instead, future payments for the year will be reduced commensurately; secondly, that non-custodial parents will be able to make their payments directly to the CSA, rather than through an employer; and, thirdly, that the Family Court, when making property or maintenance decisions, will be able to take into account future liabilities under the Child Support Act, even if an assessment has not been made. No doubt the details have been well canvassed previously in the debate. I will not go over old ground, but I will pick up some of the points that the member for Dunkley has made. There is a great challenge for the parliament to improve the child support scheme. It is not just about the administration of the CSA, because that is symptomatic of a deeper issue, in my opinion. The child support scheme has a history of at least two decades. It goes back to the changes to the Family Law Act of Attorney-General Murphy in the Whitlam era, right through to the midto late-1980s, when the child support scheme was introduced with the Child Support Agency. Although the Child Support Agency has seen a doubling of the number of parents who are contributing to the care of their children-that is, from about 30 to 35 per cent to about 70 per cent-that still leaves 30 per cent of parents who are not fulfilling their responsibilities to care for their children. So there is much work left to be done. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has been well quoted over the last 2Y2 years that it has been before the parliament. Many of its recommendations have been",139,Representatives Main Committee
302,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (8.06 P.m.),"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Dunkley( MrTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4785 introduced, but there is still much work left to be done. The underlying philosophical base whereby parents have the responsibility to care for their young-in the case of the child support scheme, to the age of 18-is at the heart of this issue. The tendency not to rely sufficiently on private arrangements, as they have become known, and the tendency for the DSS to refer people readily to the CSA seem to be issues which the parliament should consider. It is pleasing to see that the member for Chifley( Mr Price) has introduced a private member's bill. I know of his deep interest in this matter and of the commitment that he, as chairman of the joint select committee, and those across the parliament made from about 1994 onwards. I am sure that the response that they received from the public and the work that went into it must have left an overwhelming impression on those members. The member for Chifley continues his long-running interest in this issue. I remember him commenting to me-and I am sure he would not mind me saying it-that too much of the focus of the child support scheme is on the corpses of dead relationships. That was a profound comment that I will never forget. The need to look forward from those failed relationships, certainly those that have children resulting from them and yet do not survive, is a key issue for the new government. That is, the new family, whatever its format, has to be considered as much as those children who remain in the previous family. The child support scheme has great difficulties, I believe, in that it falls within at least three portfolios: Social Security, Assistant Treasurer and Attorney-General. It is quite a job to try and bring those portfolios together to focus on this issue. There has been well-documented, or at least well-discussed, opposition from within the public sector and from within areas of the Department of Social Security to any change, because they believe that they have got a formula that works. Certainly it has worked somewhat better than the system in the old Family Court days. But in the opinion of many, as the member for Dunkley( Mr Billson) has mentioned, and certainly from the government side and from the back bench, there is a view that it should work a lot better. There is plenty of potential for it to show great improvement. The issues of inconsistent advice from the CSA still are constantly surfacing. There is a range of issues that I do not think I will canvass here tonight, but that the committee I have the good fortune, or otherwise, to convene is in the process of discussing. What we need to realise is that this is not a gender issue. This is an issue about fairness for families. It is an issue about the private responsibilities of parents. For it to become some kind of gender contest defeats the whole notion of the responsibility of the adult community to children. In conclusion, I do not think this is an issue that we can afford to allow to become a partisan contest. It is essential that all parents take their responsibilities to their children with the utmost care-and that, I am sure, the overwhelming majority do. The responsibility of the 30vernment is to support the principle of supporting those parents who put their children as their number one responsibility. It is not prudent for any government to have a situation where the social welfare system, the court system, or any other system undermines that fundamental responsibility of parents to their children. When you consider that we have gone from virtually zero employees employed by the Child Support Agency to about 2,400 people, at a cost to the taxpayer of something approaching $130 million for an agency that has the role of saying that parent A shall pay parent B for the care of their children, you have to ask the fundamental question of whether the pendulum has swung too far. The bipartisan acceptance of this legislation is one more small step in the 4786 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 improvement of the child support scheme. However, there is much to be done and I look forward to playing my part in that. I support the legislation. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (8.15 p.m.)-I rise tonight to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. Since the establishment of the child support scheme and the Child Support Agency in two stages-firstly, in June 1988 and, secondly, in October 1989-the results have been mixed with many cases bordering on frustration at a time when emotions run very high. The issue of child support is one of particular interest to me because of the large number of constituents in the Petrie electorate who have had a marriage break-up and who are directly involved in a case in the Child Support Agency or are affected through independent maintenance payments. One of the most frustrating things that I find in my dealings with constituents and the Child Support Agency is that every case is so very different. Every case deals with people who have emotions, who have different needs and different circumstances, and they need to be looked at on their individual merits. The Child Support Agency seems to have a number of loopholes which have led to great consternation and distraction in the maintenance settlements. It is important that we, as a government, take the time and effort which is necessary to sew up these loopholes. We need to listen to our constituents on these issues and we need to work through the problems for the betterment of the whole community at large. A point that needs to be made when we are dealing with the child support scheme is that each case can be terribly time consuming. As I have mentioned, the issues are complex and like any situation there are always two sides to a story. The child support scheme deals with the rights of the child. The rights of a child should always be foremost and we need to look at that very carefully. The belief is that when children are involved in their parents' divorce the children must be protected, and they must have a sustainable, great quality of life. I expect that all members of parliament in their day-to-day dealings with constituents would receive similar complaints on this issue. The main areas of concern for people tend to be on issues such as custodial parents not receiving maintenance, and repetitive or conflicting letters received by the paying parent. Many constituents have also raised with me the complexities and the concerns relating to the percentage system in deducting the level of child support to be paid. While I acknowledge that in any system that exists there will always be people who are trying to find holes or ways around it, there seems to be, in the case of child support, plenty of community discontent and a strong push for change in this area. I believe it is important to acknowledge, on behalf of all the people in Australia who are affected by this, that there are a number of huge concerns with the Child Support Agency. As a member of the government, I believe that amendments to the legislation are absolutely necessary to assist custodial and non-custodial parents and must be given absolute priority at this time. We must look at flexible legislation being introduced into this House that tries to amend some of the inequities which presently exist and look at ways to ensure that the system works well and works with people instead of against those whom it was originally intended to assist. The system must work for both parents. It must work towards providing an amicable and timely maintenance delivery as well. It must work for custodial and non-custodial parents in Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4787 such a way that the administrative procedures do not supersede posItIve results. The government is aware of some of these problems with the child support scheme and, as the previous speaker, the member for Grey( Mr Wakelin) mentioned, it is working towards that. I am happy to say that I am a member of the committee looking at reviewing this legislation and it is looking at some of the ways that we can fix some of the problems of the past. The child support legislation amendment presently before the House addresses a number of discrepancies, many of which arose from the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which was also mentioned by the member for Grey. In the time available to me tonight I want to speak to a number of these amendments. Firstly, I wish to make a couple of points in relation to the amendment dealing with the consideration of child support liabilities in property and spousal maintenance proceedings. This amendment has important ramifications for those parents who voluntarily pay maintenance as presently the Family Court does not take this into consideration when making property and spousal arrangement judgments. There have been many who have felt that the system has failed them because property arrangements have not been taken into account when child maintenance payments were made, or that future circumstances were not taken into account. In essence, as a result of the amendments, custodial and non-custodial parents who have private arrangements will be treated exactly the same as those parents working under the guidelines as specified in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. This amendment ensures far more flexibility. Maintenance cases can involve property trusts and other assets, and the level of child support should be taken into account in those proceedings. The amendment also gives some forward thinking to the legislation. The legislation will now take into account private arrangements for child support and give opportunities to take into account potential liabilities under the child support scheme. A further amendment deals with employers who withhold child support from an employee's pay packet. I note that, according to the explanatory memorandum for the bill, nearly 30 per cent of those who pay child support have arranged their circumstances such that the payments are withheld by their employer. This amendment adjusts this situation and gives the option for far more flexibility for those who wish to pay child support straight to the registry. Through this amendment the payer of child support will have far more independence, and the intrusiveness which they may have felt in the past will be diminished. In some cases the employee may not wish the employer to know of their previous personal history. Administration, paperwork, and compliance costs to employers are also expected to be reduced by this move. However, I do acknowledge that there are cases where the payer may default in payments. The amendment covers these instances with a trigger mechanism which results in the employer withholcling the relevant amount of child support in those cases. Those who default will cause employers to withhold payments and they will have very limited future access to this procedure. The legislation also allows for payers to appeal if their application to pay directly is rejected by the Child Support Agency. A further advantage of this would be to reduce the cost to employers of administering the child support payment from their employees' wages. Most businesses do not object to complying with this but they do object to the terrible impost placed on them. 4788 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 A small business operator recently contacted me detailing the cost to him of collecting child support on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. It was absolutely horrendous. The administrative costs included cheques, bank charges, stationery, postage and computer processing. For this particular company, when all those costs were taken into account, it amounted to $12.36 per week per employee, which totals $642.72 per year. Just imagine the enormous savings that can be made to private enterprise, and to the government as an employer, if those who pay child support can opt to make their own arrangements. There are a number of other amendments in the bilI also in reference to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 which bring them into line with references to the Social Security Act 1991. These are necessary for continuity and consistency. On the whole, the legislation acts as the first step in the federal government's process of reviewing the whole child support scheme. I am sure that both sides of the House can support this process to streamline the child support legislation. I believe it is really important that we have support on both sides for this legislation and that we work towards ensuring the benefits for both parties involved. The Child Support Act does have problems and there are some great concerns out there, but this government is making a major commitment to fix those problems. because what I have to say and the sentiments that I have about the child support scheme have been expressed by those who have already spoken in the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment BilI (No. 1) 1996. The fact that over 80,000 Australians have signed petitions pertaining to child support and the Family Law Act is indicative of the animosity in the community in relation to both these laws. Of all the issues brought to my attention by my constituents, there is none more voluminous, and none which causes more emotion and grief, than that dealing with child support and family law. I am certainly not envious of the minister responsible for the Child Support Act, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). To have responsibility for that and for superannuation is a double-whammy poisoned chalice, if I can put it that way. The bilI being debated makes changes to certain aspects of the child support scheme. The objective of child support is certainly justified, as we have all noted. The child support scheme came into effect in 1988 with the objective of requiring both custodial and non-custodial parents to pay for the maintenance of their children rather than leave it to the taxpayers-who are, too often, expected to provide for all the needs of so many people in our community. While the objective is certainly worthy, to put that objective into legislation is a difficult task by any means, as we have discovered over the years. There is no way that, on issues such as child support and family law, any parliament would be able to provide legislation which is suitable to all people. Nevertheless, as a member of parliament, you do hear of cases which make you wonder how our laws allow to take place certain practices that, at the end of the day, ultimately affect not the parents but the child, who is always the innocent victim in such disputes-although that point is quickly forgotten. The first change provided by the bill allows a non-custodial parent to seek a revision of their payments owing, if they believe their income is less than 15 per cent of the previous year's income. This wilI, of course, amend the non-custodial parent's child support assessment. If a custodial parent has received an overpayment, this bilI will allow them to receive reduced",140,Representatives Main Committee
303,Mr Eoin Cameron (Stirling) (8.25 P.m.),"I do not intend taking up too much time,Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4789 payments accordingly until the ledger is balanced, so to speak, rather than having to pay back the overpayment. One child support case that I had brought to my attention dealt with the matter of a noncustodial parent overpaying the custodial parent. Apparently the Child Support Agency wrote to the gentleman offering three options: reducing payments until the overpayment was offset; taking a payment from the CSA of the equivalent of the overpayment; or giving the payment to the custodial parent as a gift. I thought that final option was a misnomer, given that the parents obviously had irreconcilable differences which had brought them to the situation that they were in. As such, it was not surprising that the non-custodial parent did not take up the final option. While this amendment is welcomed, it will still leave many clients of the Child Support Agency quite dissatisfied. The theme of many complaints to my office is in relation to the assessments made by the CSA, and the fact that the information used for the decisions affecting their assessments does not reflect the actual situation that the non-custodial parent is in. People ask me why, when they are earning X amount of dollars, the CSA assesses them as though they are earning Z amount of dollars. I hope that this amendment will provide the relief that those people require who are earning less than they are assessed as earning, notwithstanding their obligations to their child or children. That is the paramount point. I only say that because I know that I will still have people coming to my office complaining about their assessments and the facts and figures used to calculate them. The second change effected by the bill is to allow non-custodial parents to make their payments direct to the Child Support Agency rather than have them deducted from their pay and forwarded to the CSA by their employer. This move is consistent with other legislation that has come before the House, such as the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill which allowed the parent's child-care payments to be paid directly to the child-care provider. This reduces the intrusiveness into what is essentially a private matter between family members. If the non-custodial parent chooses, there is no need to require the employer to deduct pay from a non-custodial parent for forwarding to the CSA. The previous situation implied that the non-custodial parent could not be trusted to make payments to the CSA and that the payments should be compulsorily deducted from their pay beforehand. This is a logical amendment that I am sure non-custodial parents will find completely welcome. They know that they have a responsibility for the upkeep of their children, and the vast majority will not shirk their responsibility and will continue making their payments personally, without the intrusion of a third party. My principal concern is that the CSA pass the payments on punctually, which is but another topic of complaint that I receive about this particular subject. The final change deals with potential child support liabilities when the Family Court is making decisions on property or maintenance. In closing, I would like to read to you a letter which I received on 29 May, which is so typical of letters that I receive concerning this particular subject. Obviously, I will leave my constituent's name private. The letter reads: I am writing to ask you to raise the issue of child maintenance in parliament, specifically to amend the laws of the Child Support Agency. BeforeI begin let me state that I want to support my family and I know it is right that I should do so. My situation and many others I have spoken to about this subject is: I earn around about $30,000 a year working from about 80 to 100 hours a fortnight; I am living in a rented duplex, I drive a 30 year old car 4790 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 and I'm BROKE. ThoughI live a mangy, pitiful existence I am expending a little more every fortnight than my net income; and you know what the means. After accounting my expenditure which includes just normal everyday bills with the exception of tithing I pay to my church-which is tax deductible-I am left with about $3000 for the year for buying clothes, entertainment, birthday/Christmas presents for the kids and the mother/wife, little luxuries like haircuts and medication which cost me about $300 to $400 a year and a variety of miscellaneous things. I have a personal loan for a computer which is $70 a fortnight, the rest as I have said is just living costs. I dream of one day buying a house and starting my life again. I would like to buy another car to replace the one that is breaking up around me. IfI found another companion I would like to be able to keep her. I would like to think that I am getting ahead and moving forward and maybe having the benefit of joying in some little reward that I can give myself for supporting my family and paying my taxes and doing the right thing. But in sad reality, I can not. And the cruel hard fact of the matter is, I never can. IfI work overtime or work myself to near death with one or two other jobs to get ahead then bang, I am hit with a greater child support bill the year after. Most importantly is my relationship with my children. I have lost the benefit of watching my children grow up and having them around me as a family. Now it's twice a fortnight I have my kids sleep over. I would like to be in a position to compensate for my separation from the children, on the days that I see them by taking them out and spending a little money on them and supporting them directly instead of indirectly. When my rostered days off come around and I have my kids over I have very little money to do anything but feed them. This situation leaves people to either give up to the extent they want to give up; Go on the dole; Earn undeclared cash money or tum to criminal activities to get ahead. ThisI cannot do and why should I have to resort to immoral or illegal activities to live? IfI cannot afford to pay petrol or maintenance costs for my vehicle then I have no alternative but to cease work. Or if the physiological impact of being separated from the family, working in a stressful job and then having nothing to show for it but the worry of mounting bills, poverty and bankruptcy; if this anxiety and sorrow causes a break down then, what is the advantage in this? I would cease paying tax; The government would be obliged to pay my sickness/unemployment benefits and completely supporting my wife and kids. Isn't it better that I am working and paying tax and willing to help support my children? Now in the name of equality I would like to mention my wife and her charmed life. She is buying a house in a suburb of Perthshe drives around in a late model van, it appears that she can buy clothes for herself and go out whenever she wills, and she has the added benefit of having the children with her and buying things for them and taking them out etc, which I think is great; I am happy for her and I am grateful the kids have a good home to live in and a loving mother to look after them. My humble prayer is not to have what she has but at least have half the benefits and joys and opportunities that she has. At the moment I have zilch, zero, naught, nothing. The simple fact of the matter is, it isn't fair. So for this reason I would like the child support laws changed ... He goes on to say: ... I'll leave it with you in the hope that you maybe able to do something to address the gross inequalities, burden and distress child support indirectly fosters amongst the many Australians whose only crime is, is that they for one reason or another, could not live with their companions. Faithfully yours. I think that letter just about says it all. WhilstI have no hesitation in supporting this bill, I do not think it will stop the tide of complaints that we all have coming into our offices concerning child support. As I said at the beginning of my speech, over 80,000 people have signed petitions airing grievances about child support and family laws. That displays the Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4791 inadequacies of the legislation, although I do not intend for that to imply blame. I simply do not believe one will ever be able to write legislation that pleases everyone in these disputes. Given the dissatisfaction with these laws, minor amendments will not, in my view, stop the tide of complaints. Indeed, it has almost become a tidal wave of complaints and I have no doubt that the day will come when completely new legislation will need to be drafted replacing both the Child Support Act and the Family Law Act. I do not see why that should be later rather than sooner. I think the new laws should be on the agenda of all political parties. for this debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill. This is a very tough area; there are no easy answers here. There is an interaction between family law issues with issues involving access to children, property law and so on. There are people who deny this but these issues are certainly not separate in the minds of those who are affected. I want to take this opportunity to put forward an idea which I have had in mind for some time in relation to property settlements. I would be interested in parliamentary and public reaction. Family law is presently extremely costly, both to public legal aid and private legal parties. Many of the outcomes are not well regarded by the parties who are involved with them and a lot of them have a poisonous effect on interpersonal relationships. I think we need to look at codifying property settlements so that people know exactly where they stand so that there is no need to litigate. I am interested in a system analogous to what happens with wills where the government regards as legally enforceable any agreement concerning property division in the event of separation or divorce made either before marriage or during marriage. However, in the absence of any such agreement we would have all property split fifty-fifty in the event of a marriage breakdown, without regard to the issue of contribution or who has custody of the children and so on. I am also interested in the idea of an opt-out provision concerning child support whereby both parents would be given the option of assuming up to 50 per cent of the responsibility for maintenance of their children. If they agree to accept 50 per cent responsibility, the Child Support Agency would not be involved in that particular family circumstance. Of course, if they did not want to do that then the child support arrangements would apply. There has been a lot of debate about legal aid cuts in the context of the Commonwealth budget. It has a massive family law budget-I think, in excess of $100 million-and it does seem to me that we ought to be able to do a lot better than we are doing. The second thing I want to do is pay tribute to the work done by the member for Chifley, ( Mr Price), in this area. Child support is a work in progress and it is remarkable to see the extent of the praise coming to the member for Chifley from both sides of the chamber. So much so that I think it is worth drawing attention to some of the specific references. The member for Sturt( Mr Pyne) pointed out that the member for Chifley headed up the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, and also pointed out that this committee broke the record for the number of submissions received by a joint select committee or a standing committee on any issue being investigated. He said that the member for Chifley did a very good job with his committee. That has been said by other speakers in this debate, and I am sure it will be said throughout the debate. Indeed, the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) said:",144,Representatives Main Committee
304,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (8.36 P.m.),"It is nice to have an audience of such size4792 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 I think that the Price report did a good job. I believe that we should be looking more closely at that report and doing more in this regard. The member for Bowman( Mrs West) said: My congratulations go to the member for Chifley( Mr Price) on the Price report. He did an excellent job. It is now up to the government to put these recommendations into place. Then later we find the member for Dawson( Mrs De-Anne Kelly) saying: I would simply like to conclude by saying that many excellent recommendations have been made in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Matters, and I believe that they do need to be addressed. We also had the member for Canning( Mrs Johnston) saying: BeforeI start, I would like to commend the work that has been done by the member for Chifley( Mr Price). Not only is he very passionate about what he is doing, but he has also put a lot of work into it in previous years, and I congratulate him for it. None of those members are Labor members. There are Labor members who supported the work of the member for Chifley, such as the member for Isaacs( Mr Wilton). But I think it reflects a remarkable degree of support for his conscientiousness and basic sense of fairness and decency on these issues, and I personally start with a presumption that his views in this area ought to be accorded a great deal of weight. The third thing that I wish to do is to support the amendments moved by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) concerning the bill before the parliament. I think these amendments are worth repeating. The member for Werriwa has moved that the House: (1) expresses concern at the failure of the Howard Government, after 12 months in office, to respond to the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee into Certain Family Law Issues, entitled 'Child Support Scheme: An Examination of the Operation and Effectiveness of the Scheme'; (2) believes the Government should be concerned about the well-being and welfare of all families: whether they be intact families, separated families, single parent families or serial families; (3) notes with concern the failure to implement some of the report's recommendations has caused parents and their children to suffer needless hardship; (4) believes that there is important and urgent need to improve and strengthen the Child Support Scheme; and (5) considers that much time has been lost and therefore the Government should respond to the recommendations of the report concerned with changing the child support formula as soon as possible and introduce legislation within six months to this effect. This is an issue about which massive community concern has been expressed. That has been noted by previous speakers from all sides. I will just note a couple of the observations of the member for Calare( Mr Andren) who said: By far the most angry and disgruntled group of people are the men who have lost custody of their children and have also lost out or come out with a lesser share in the divorce settlement. They are now paying substantial amounts of income in child support. In many cases their former wives have now found new partners and so have an extra income coming in. The way men see it, they have lost their wife, their house and their kids, and are now continuing to lose a large slice of their income. Similarly, the member for Capricornia ( Mr Marek) reported to the parliament on a national conference on family law issues held by the Lone Fathers Association. He noted a set of groups which attended this conference, including DADS, the Child Support Action Group, Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4793 Reform, Parents Without Partners, and others as well. It is an extraordinary flowering of groups, if you like. We are not a nation of joiners. To have so many groups which have arisen to try and address some of the issues in this area does suggest that it is an area of substantial concern. I have had the same sort of feedback in my own electorate. The previous speaker, the member for Stirling( Mr Eoin Cameron) referred to cases and correspondence which he had received. I have received a number of similar letters, including one from a woman whose husband was previously married. She and her husband have one child. She went through the child support formula and said that, from her point of view, the two children of her husband's first marriage were being regarded as more valuable than children that she has with this man. She regards that as a most unfair situation. When she challenged this, she said, 'We were told by the Child Support Agency that disregarded income levels for custodial parents are as high as they are to encourage them to work.' Her observation is that since the child support becomes so large, why in fact would they work? In this particular case, the husband had been staying home to look after the child-and, in this day and age, a lot of people would regard it as very appropriate and quite reasonable for husbands to stay at home and look after their children. As a result, he was not earning any income. His former wife challenged the idea that he was not earning any income under ground 8 of the grounds of application. It says: The income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of one of the parents or the child are not properly reflected in the assessment. I have to say that, when I look at that ground, it seems to me to be extraordinarily open-ended and to give the child support review officers an extraordinary amount of discretion. In fu:t, in this case, the assessment was made that the husband was able to provide child support, notwithstanding that he did not have an income. In the report of this case, the review officer said: I note that the Payer's new wife is therefore able to work full time to support the family. What is clearly going on here is that the husband's income is not being taken into account but his wife's income is being taken into account. This seems to me to be an unusual state of affairs and one which certainly can give rise to anomalies. We do receive correspondence of this kind. There was another letter from a person in New South Wales who, I assume, wrote to all members of parliament. In his case, he said that the amount being deducted by the Child Support Agency was close to five times in excess of the amount that he had agreed on with his ex-wife. Initially, she agreed to refund the excess amount that came to her but, after the payments started, she was not interested in doing so. In his letter he says: I do not understand how the government can say that the more money I earn, the more my children cost to raise. This is reflective of the substantial community concern that has arisen in this area.1ille Nrn; are reflected in the statements made by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) when he put forward the opposition's amendment. In so doing, he expressed concern that the government, after 12 months in office, had failed to respond to the basic findings and recommendations of the parliamentary report of 1994 and that delay was occurring in addressing these issues. He pointed out that this committee had received something like 6,200 submissions, the largest number of submissions ever received by any committee of this parliament. The member for 4794 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 Werriwa also made some important comments about some of the fundamental concepts at stake here. He said: As is so often the case with these win-lose scenarios, the child support area has been seen through the prism of gender equity issues. He also said: It is also much healthier for the parliament and parliamentarians to consider child support through the prism of income equity concerns and to examine the fairness of the existing income transfers implicit in the formula. He went on to say: We should blindfold ourselves to whether the parent is male or female, and rather take an income equity focus on these questions. He further said: ... by blindfolding ourselves to the gender equity concerns, the parliament can have a far healthier and productive debate. That is an accurate way to look at these issues and to try to deal with them conceptually. I have a couple of additional remarks that I would like to make before concluding. One is that the member for Dawson( Mrs De-Anne Kelly) referred to the idea of linking child support and access issues. I have to say that the law to date, or certainly in recent times, has regarded these as entirely distinct issues and has not been willing to see it that way. I do think, having spoken to quite a few parents who have been on the sharp end of the child support and access issues, that there is something in what the member for Dawson is saying, because you do get a situation where, if access orders are being flouted, the non-custodial parent is required to go to court himself or herself to seek court orders. There is always the onus of time, energy and expense resting on them, whereas, if a child support order is flouted, you have the full majesty of the Taxation Office and the Child Support Agency coming down on the person in breach of the child support order. It does seem to me that consideration ought to be given to some linkage or to at least developing a situation where those issues are dealt with in a more comparable way. Finally, I think that family law and child support issues are a work in progress. My ideas on this issue are developing, as I believe that all of our ideas need to develop, in the light of experience. But the case for some action now is indeed overwhelming and government legislation, which picks up only some of the Price committee recommendations, simply does not go far enough. I do not think it is good enough for coalition members, pre-election, to be picking up votes by bagging the Child Support Agency and child support arrangements. It is now up to coalition members to actually do something about it. Supporting or taking on board the amendments proposed by the member for Werriwa would be a very good place to start. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (8.51 p.m.)-I rise tonight to represent the numerous paying parents in the seat of Lindsay who have come to see me over the last 14 months regarding the efficacy of the child support legislation. It is interesting to note, in any discussion on this subject, the actual history of child support and the Family Law Act. When the Family Law Act was first introduced in 1975, it was only a small act of about one centimetre in thickness. It was designed to simplify the whole family law relationship and to move away from the concept of fault in any relationship breakdown. That act is now a three-volume practice manual of about 10 inches in thickness. The Child Support Agency Act was introduced in 1988. Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4795 By now, we are well away from the concept of fault. We are well down the track where there is an accepted community morality about the obligations to pay child support. Yet there are parties leaving a marital break-up who feel like criminals. The intrusion into their personal affairs has been to such an extent that they have felt hounded. They have often given up jobs, given up employment prospects and moved into a cash society to avoid moral obligations or social obligations. This act goes some way to mending their feelings in terms of being able to hide from employers the fact that they have had a marital bust-up or that they are in fact experiencing some personal problems. I think that is an important olive branch to offer in the family law disputes that do take place in today's society. It is something that this society is going to have to deal with and deal with in a very humane fashion, because more and more marriages are breaking up and more and more families are now second or third families. It is those people in those relationships that need to be considered. Gone are the days where people will break up after a 20or 30-year marriage when no more children will be forthcoming. These days, you will find that, quite frequently, there are three or four children-all under the age of IS-from different parents, and all liable to be attracting child support. When you have 27 per cent of your gross wage going towards paying for two children from a previous marriage, you are probably paying 47 per cent in tax, and you are left with 26 per cent of your wage for your second family, which may have up to three children and a dependent spouse, you start to get very concerned about the efficaciousness of this legislation. It has resulted in an inordinate number of complaints. By reducing the intrusiveness on people's subsequent lives when they move on from a marital break-up, when they move into further relationships, when they move into further employment prospects, they feel that it gives them a chance to mend old wounds. It gives them a chance to move on and develop a better working relationship with their previous spouse. That is crucial for the forward progress of this society. We need to achieve the original objectives of the Family Law Act 1975. We need to get to the stage where these matters are resolved by the couple on a basis that each feels has dealt with their needs. They need to feel that they have been fairly dealt with. They need to have a basis for continuing with their current and future living arrangements, and for continually changing. The adversarial system-the number of complaints and the number of political organisations that have formed such as the Lone Parents Association, DADS and the Family Law Reform Party-is an indication that there is growing distress from marital break-up. The purpose of this legislation at all times-and into the future-is to move these matters out of the legal system and into a social and community context, into alternative dispute resolution and into support for future families from both parents. It is not a male or female issue. Quite frequently these days, the female is the paying parent and, quite frequently, it is the female of a second or third marriage who is wearing the consequences of prior relationships. These things, in light of a changing society and very mobile family relationships, are going to continue to be part of society. Our definition of family continually needs to evolve and we continually need to update legislation to make it reflect the times. Most paying parents have a very sincere attitude to their children. They want to have a continuing relationship with the children and they spend an enormous amount of money on 4796 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 their children when they have access. Child support needs to take into account a number of payments that paying parents are already making. This act goes some way to delivering, for the paying parent, a feeling that their concerns are being listened to by government, that there is some hope in the future before their children tum 18 when they can mend the fences with their previous spouse and get to some cordial social relationship where they can, between themselves, make payments to each other. It also gives the parents a chance to choose how they are going to pay for their child support. By voluntarily paying it to the parent with custodial obligations, it takes the fault away from the paying spouse. They then feel that their personal affairs are not aired in public with their employers by having their wages garnisheed or by having to do battle in that adversarial manner with the Child Support Agency. They feel more adult about getting on with their responsibilities to their children and their previous relationships, whilst still leaving room for them to get on with new relationships and family matters. This bill is a very important step. It certainly does not go far enough, and the committee is working to move in the direction of answering all concerns in this area, both for the custodial spouse and for the paying parent. With that, I commend the bill to the House. spend the first couple of minutes relating a story that came to me today. It is not particularly related to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1), but it is certainly related to the issue of what this bill addresses. To those present tonight who are mums and dads-and I stress that what I am going to say to you, as the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said, is not a male or female issue; it can happen to either parent-you might understand what I am going to say to you. One of my staff, in fact, has separated from his spouse and there has been a terrible problem in that separation. My staff member lives on Magnetic Island so has to catch a ferry from the mainland to the island. The other spouse, in fact, spends quite a lot of time on Magnetic Island and catches a similar ferry. There is a child of that relationship and just on the weekend that particular spouse and child were on the ferry when the person who works for me also got on that ferry. When the person got on the ferry the young child who is a young man of about four years of age saw his father and said, 'Daddy. Daddy,' and basically called to him to come. So the father in that situation went to his son, took him in his arms and hugged him, and spent some time with his son. When the ferry got to the other end of the journey to Magnetic Island, the other spouse went straight to the police and reported the father for stalking and for attempting to abduct his son. What a sad situation this would be. How you would abduct your son on a ferry I do not know. Those of us who have a loving relationship and who have sons and daughters can understand how a dad would feel in that situation. I do not know why this is happening. In my own marriage I have a wonderful relationship. I have a wonderful son and daughter. But how can we in our society today have a situation where dads or mums cannot see their sons or daughters when they should see them. What is wrong with us? What is wrong with our society? At the moment I feel the way the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) did. I did not intend this, but it is just how I feel. Why do parents have to separate? Why do they have to use each other in this way. No-one cares about the kids. Thank God, Margaret, Mark and I and my daughter, Kylie, are a loving family.",147,Representatives Main Committee
305,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (8.59 P.m.),"Madam Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I willTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4797 I should get back to the text of my speech now. When I became a member of parliament I was astonished by the level of public concern regarding family law and child support issues. Often the two are confused which does not help matters. It did not take me long to get an indication of the depth of the problems that I was being confronted with from day one in my term as a member of the federal parliament. Even now, some 14 months down the track, it is still difficult to know where to begin addressing the problems my constituents bring to me. I see on a daily basis examples of how the current CSA system is not working. My Townsville office staff have lost count of the number of times that they have taken calls from women and men who have gone through the Family Court and the child support system and have come out the other end almost literally with nothing to live for. It is heart breaking to listen to grown men and women fall to pieces over the phone because they have not seen their children for months on end even though they are legally entitled to see them, or because they have not received any child support payments. I can understand why people talk openly about living only from one day to the next and seriously contemplating on a daily basis taking their lives. As much as I admire the people who work in the Townsville Child Support Agency, they can only operate under the system we helped set up for them and we know that, while the system has vastly improved over recent years, it is still not working. I will support the changes presented in this bill, but I think everyone who has spoken on this bill recognises the need to go much further in terms of legislative changes. Half-hearted attempts to change the system will not really achieve the change for the better we all know the system desperately needs. We all know family breakdown can tum into a very bitter and nasty affair. One party blames the other; they both get lawyers; both parties seem willing to do or say anything to get custody of children, and so it goes. We might have to be mindful that, when we do try to change the way in which the CSA operates, we may change it for the benefit of one party, but to the detriment of the other, be they custodial or non-custodial. We also need to be mindful of the fact that, in dealing with cases of family breakdown, you simply are not going to be able to please 100 per cent of the people 100 per cent of the time. We need to weigh up the pros and cons of legislative change and act to make the CSA as workable and as fair as possible. My fear is that, if we set out to please everybody, we will end up with half-hearted reforms that will not go to the root of the problems members and senators see walking through their doors-week in, week out. By far and away, the largest number of Townsville CSA related complaints I receive come from the non-custodial parents. I receive, as I am sure every other member of this House does, many complaints from custodial parents about the Child Support Agency. More often than not those complaints are from women who are faced with having to make repayments because the child support paying father's income has changed. This often places custodial parents in a very difficult financial position. However, in between his income changing and the administrative process recognising the change in income status occurring, the paying parent is still paying at a higher rate than he can afford. The receiving parent is at the same time being overpaid and running up a bill she will have to repay once the system catches up with the change in the paying parent's income. This impacts on both parents, the custodial and the non-custodial. I have seen, on more than one occasion, mothers come into my Townsville office in tears because they have just received a letter telling them that they have to pay back a considerable sum of money because of overpayments. In cases I have personally come across, quite often the single mother is not in 4798 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 a position where she can repay this money, certainly not in one lump sum and certainly not in the time indicated on the letter that she receives. The proposed amendment will reduce the incidence of overpayments to persons receiving child support which currently arise because of the retrospective effect of an income estimate election. It will better reflect a payer's future capacity to pay because the amount payable will only be changed for the months remaining after the estimate has been lodged. It will reduce the level of child support arrears that may arise when payers spend amounts refunded to them as overpayments, but later do not have the funds to meet their advised ongoing child support liability. I certainly hope that this will be the case. The explanatory memorandum further states, in relation to the use of election where income changed, the parents paying child support will still pay the correct amount for the year based on the income estimate. If overpayments are made, they will reduce the remaining child support liability for the remaining part of the year. Similarly, underpayments will be offset evenly throughout the remainder of the year and this is a very good position to be in. These are good measures, which will take some pressure off the child support receiving parents, who instead of being faced with repaying overpayments, will instead have their repayments reduced for a period of time to reflect the relative size of the overpayment. I think that such a change will be easier for child support recipients to manage. I have in the parliament today a petition of 1,300 signatures calling on reforms for the Child Support Agency and family law system. This petition was compiled by Mr Laurie Chalker in my electorate. Mr Chalker was due to start a marathon run from Townsville to Canberra last month in protest at the way in which the CSA and the family law systems do not work. Unfortunately, his run had to be cancelled. Had he been able to travel all the way to Canberra collecting signatures, this group of signatures would have been but a small fraction of what Laurie would have been able to collect. That brings me to another point. All the people with CSA problems who walk through our individual electorate doors are but pieces of a very large jigsaw. The fact that so many members have spoken on this bill, and intend to speak on this bill, is evidence that Child Support Agency problems are not confined to just Queensland, Tasmania or Victoria. As elected representatives speaking on this bill we are individual pieces in a much larger jigsaw. I am the Herbert piece; Bruce Billson Individually, we may just be one voice representing one small part of Australia. But, if you take us collectively, all the small pieces add up to form a very large picture. That picture is of the mums and dads, and most importantly of all the children, caught up in family breakdown as they are crying out for change and reform. It was only last week I was visited by a constituent, in this case a custodial parent, and it was a lady. She said, ' Mr Lindsay, I've just received a bill for $2,000 that I must pay because the Child Support Agency has overpaid me. I've spent that money in the last six months, I've spent it on my children. I run a very tight financial position but I now have this bill that I must pay. How do I pay it?' That is what we are dealing with tonight. These are the sorts of things that the government and the opposition, in a bipartisan way, need to be mindful of and need to do something about. I have certainly been very active in working on the government members' Child Support Agency subcommittee because I believe that we have a responsibility as members of this parliament to try to correct the wrongs that exist currently in the system. I can understand the",152,Representatives Main Committee
306,"Is The Dunkley Piece; Mr Mcclelland Is The Barton Piece, And So On.","Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4799 impatience to have these wrongs corrected. Since the recommencement of the parliamentary sittings I have been telling my constituents that we must make changes to the legislation, and what we are dealing with tonight is part of that. It is now June; we are still going. The worse part about it is that no-one is really disagreeing with what we are trying to do, whether it be on the opposition side or on the government side. I hope that together we can do something that will be for the benefit of those families who have been split in unfortunate circumstances. While tonight's legislative changes are relatively small, I find it a bit disconcerting that we simply cannot push it through because while we talk and adjourn, and talk and adjourn, people's lives are being adversely affected. I certainly hope that we can get support tonight for this bill. I invite all of my colleagues to support it, as I do. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I think we all know the philosophy behind the Child Support Agency. That philosophy is that if you bring a child into the world then you take responsibility for that child, whether your relationship with your partner continues or not. Too often in the past husbands, and de facto husbands, deserted their wives and left their children to the tender mercies of the state. It is not fair that the taxpayers of Australia should pay for the irresponsibility of those fathers, or for that matter those mothers, who for one reason or another desert their children, yet may well have the means to support them, totally or in part. So the Child Support Agency was brought in to correct this anomaly. It depended on an order from the court or a percentage payment levied on the non-custodial parent to support his or her children. It was collected by an agency within the taxation department. All those things are quite appropriate mechanisms but I do not think the original system took sufficient note of the human dimension of this problem. Such a system depends on goodwill and where that is absent there can be a lack of equality or empowerment. WhatI mean by that is that both parties initially, at the time when arrangements are made or need to be modified, should be able to represent their case in an equal and unfettered way. But quite often we see the situation where one party has legal aid and the other party has not. That of itself I think leads to quite an imbalance in the outcome. I suppose that-as most do when they come into this job as a member of parliament-I felt that the responsibility to the CSA and the matter of custody and access were separate and distinct issues. After four years in the job I do not believe that any longer. In fact, I believe the diametrical opposite. Regardless of what previous parliaments have said, regardless of what my own party or the Labor Party have said, I have come inexorably to the conclusion that those two things are linked. I believe that the custodial parent-the one in receipt of child support-has both a financial and custodial advantage. If this is not exercised with equanimity and natural justice a gross distortion and disadvantage occurs to the non-custodial parent. For example, where a custodial parent says, 'Yes, under the terms of the arrangement made by the court you can have the children for the school holidays but you will have to pay the airfares,' which might be quite considerable, what that often does is deprive the non-custodial parent of the short.number of weeks-two, four or six weeks a year-that that parent might have the children; it deprives the parent of the ability to give them a decent and meaningful holiday; and it deprives them of the opportunity to create a relationship with the children, albeit over a very short period.",154,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.13 P.m.),"I wish to speak this evening on the Child Support4800 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 Perhaps if the custodial parent is totally manipulative they might put it on the non-custodial parent, even over that short period, to provide the children with new clothes, school clothes for the coming year or warm clothes if there is a climatic change. In other words, the kids become a sort of bargaining chip. They become collateral in the relationship. I am deeply saddened when I see non-custodial parents, generally the fathers-and I do not say that with any sexist overtones whatsoever; it is generally the fathers-deprived of a meaningful relationship with their children. I believe this could be addressed very easily, as indeed the recognition of the interrelationship between custody and access on one hand and maintenance on the other would confirm. I feel that on those occasions where the non-custodial parent is in control of the children, whether the maintenance payments be voluntary or court established, the maintenance payment should be suspended for the non-custodial parent. In other words, if the non-custodial parent is taking care of the children during that period, then the equivalent of the fees should go to them. It could be argued that the custodial parent has responsibilities over and above that in the home--electricity, rates, rent and so on-that continue whether the children are there or not and that perhaps there could be some formularisation of this on a one-third/two-thirds basis. In principle, I think that should be the case. During times of voluntarily agreed or court established access, the non-custodial parent should not have to pay any form of maintenance, or perhaps only a limited amount to cover the ongoing running costs of the home. This would be a discipline on manipulative custodial parents. A person might be using the kids as a weapon against the non-custodial parent. She might be making it as hard as possible for him to have the kids, saying things like, 'I'm going to make sure that he pays the fares and buys the kids warm clothes-I'm going to make it as difficult as possible for him.' Or she might say, 'I'm going to say that the kids have got the flu and they can't come for four weeks; they can only come for two.' In that situation, whatever the court or the voluntary agreement determined in terms of access would be invoked. For the period that was laid down in that agreement or that court access, the payments by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent would be suspended. I think that would solve a lot of problems very simply and very effectively. If we are sincere about this, if we are fair dinkum that the welfare of the children should be the dominant feature of these relationships, then they cannot be used as collateral; they cannot be used as bargaining chips. I have heard of some horrific cases where fathers have waited for years to see their kids and, because of personal animosity between the mother and the father, the mother decides that she is going to put every possible barrier in the way of the father. That sometimes spills over into even more vindictive activities. It is sad, too, that some sections of the legal fraternity are not lilywhite in this matter. There is a system in vogue at present, if the lawyers I speak to are any measure of the activity, that says that when a person is in a disadvantageous situation in a custody hearing, regardless of whether her ex-spouse is violent or not, regardless of whether he has been showing animus towards the wife or not, a restraining order is taken out against him-not because he has done anything wrong, but because that will place the custodial parent in an advantageous position in the court hearing. What is even worse-and this appals me right to my very core-is that quite often the charge is made that the father has sexually molested the children. Over the last four years, an Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4801 increasing number of non-custodial parents-in nearly all cases fathers-have come to me as white as a sheet saying, 'I have never had any criminal conviction of any sort against me in my life. NowI am accused of molesting my children. I can no longer see them, except under supervision'--or in some cases not at all-'because of the charge made by my former spouse.' It is a shocking and deliberate evil that is perpetrated that destroys the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the children. The children, of course, know it is false, but society does not, and it places all the people in the chain-the Family Court, the bailiffs, the police and all those that get involved in these activities-in a horrendous position. I have seen this in the case of a constituent in my electorate-and I repeat this in many of these speeches because I cannot get it out of my mind. When the actual court cases for custody and separation were going on, his wife received legal aid, whereas he hitchhiked on semitrailers some 1,000 kilometres or more from my electorate to Sydney. He went into court unrepresented. His former wife went into court with, on one occasion, a solicitor and two barristers. Despite this, he made a very good fist of it. The wife perjured herself on numerous occasions and got custody of the children, claiming to take them to a new relationship with her parents in western New South Wales. Within a month she was in a de facto relationship in North Queensland. I saw that father with his limited resources do everything he could to regain those children. He had lost his home, a very successful business, and access to his children. But his wife used her position quite unconscionably and finally he was able to bring her to court in North Queensland for defiance of the custody arrangements in contempt of the Family Court. In the course of that particular case she argued-by the way, without any disclosure of this prior to the case-that some 11 years earlier he had molested her sister. On the basis of that charge, on what was probably the penultimate case in that custody hearing, that father from that day to this did not see his kids except under supervision. I just find it appalling. But what is even worse is that, on the basis of this charge, the New South Wales police have charged him with interfering with that girl 11 years earlier. It is not for me to go into that case because it is before the courts but I just want to show you one of the extreme cases of the disintegration of a family. At the end of the day, what was the separation all about? Was it not for a better life for each of them and for the kids? What have they all ended up with: total and utter misery and the kids not knowing whether they are coming or going. I think in the time that is available to me I would like to say something about second families. Many speakers have spoken of them. The Child Support Agency recognises that when there is a break-up the children of the custodial parent often enter a new relationship. Sometimes it is one of great opulence and wealth and quite often the non-custodial parent, already deprived of his children, finds a new relationship. Sometimes that relationship involves the children of his new partner-his stepchildren. But they are receiving no child support from their father or their non-custodial parent because, perhaps, he was a waster, or a pensioner. Perhaps he was not in a position to pay any maintenance payments and for that reason the children of that second family, and the whole family, live at a gross disadvantage. I believe that what we have to do is not have these ironclad rules but, rather, look at the whole family situation. Does anyone seriously pretend that when the custodial parent goes into an opulent relationship and gets maintenance payments from the previous, non-custodial parent, the payments are going to be divvied up between the children and the stepchildren strictly in 4802 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 accordance with the way the father pays maintenance? Of course not. All the kids are going to be treated equally-and so they should be. But when you come back to the other family, the second family of the non-custodial parent, quite often there is no wealth, and there is no adjusting mechanism made available. I also believe that we need a more effective way of being able to alter arrangements. I had a case where a wife went off the rails mentally, claimed that she had separated from her husband, received maintenance payments for some years, and had them sent to a false address. It was a very clever scam, actually. It was not until her husband noticed how his tax refund cheques were falling and queried, on the third year, how he could lose the $4,000 refund he was expecting that he discovered it. They said, 'You are separated from your wife.' He said, 'NoI am not.' He subsequently did separate from her. But during that period it was established by statutory declarations, by declarations from neighbours, that during the period for which this huge Child Support Agency bill had accumulated they had indeed not been separated. In fact, he had not been out of the family home for more than three nights in the whole period. When I put that whole case to the Child Support Agency-and admittedly it was before the previous inquiry that we had in the last parliament, so I imagine things have improved, but it illustrates the point-there was no automatic adjustment. He was told, 'There is nothing we can do about that. You will have to take it back to the court.' Where there is clear evidence like that, why put the whole system to that financial burden? In an instance like that, I think there should be something in provincial cities. Perhaps if we had Child Support Agency magistrates who would sit in the magistrate's court in the main provincial cities, they could hear these matters quickly and issue an order varying the regulations or the arrangements, rather than taking the whole business back through the Family Court. Surely something like that would be preferable. I have only touched on a few points tonight, but I think they are very important points. As I said before, if we are fair dinkum about the welfare of the children, if we are fair dinkum about people who have separated in a supposedly non-fault environment being able to rebuild their lives, then what we have to do is get this system right. that the statistics in my electorate office show that by far the largest number of inquiries, and the most emotional and most time consuming, relate to the Child Support Agency. Nobody in my office, including me, was in any way qualified to be able to deal with some of the problems and concerns that have come into the office. I must say that I have quickly learnt to be able to give some words of wisdom to some of the unfortunate victims of this particular government bureaucracy. Those words of wisdom are: no matter what you think of your partner, no matter how much you dislike your partner, go out and talk to your partner, find some sort of common ground and strike a deal, because the moment you walk away and look for a third party, that being the Child Support Agency, you are guaranteed to lose. Unfortunately, that is the reality of it; unfortunately also, with human nature, with the anger and bitterness associated with separation and a tug of war to try to inflict some sort of emotional gain through the children, it is not at all possible in most cases. Although, like any thinking Australian, I agree with the concept behind the child support scheme that parenthood has its price and responsibilities regardless of the state of a marriage and that taxpayers should not bear the burden of failed marriages, after the relatively short",155,Representatives Main Committee
308,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (9.33 P.m.),"Like most members in this House, I have foundTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4803 time that I have spent as a member, it seems obvious to me that the administration of the child support scheme has gone dramatically off the rails. Legislation before the House in this bill is aimed at correcting some minor flaws encountered in the scheme and I commend those changes to the House. But this legislation needs to go much further than these changes. It is my belief that the whole operation of the child support scheme needs to be revisited in the name of fairness to all. The question needs to be asked: what is the agenda driving this scheme and the agency that enforces it? Yet it has become readily apparent to me-and dare I say to the majority of members of this House-that the whole soul and structure of the child support scheme is in need of a dispassionate and all-encompassing review, with a new, fresh, fair and rational approach to be taken. Problems with the child support service were of such an intense and urgent nature that late last year I had to convene a child support forum in Cairns, the main population centre in my electorate, which attracted over 70 participants. One of the problems facing the victims of the current child support scheme that came out of this forum and from the electorate office inquiries is that it would appear that the whole core of the problem can probably be best addressed by the vision statement of the Lone Fathers Association of Australia. That is that all parties in the divorce situation, including the non-custodial parent, enjoy a fair and equitable distribution of financial resources emanating from a child support scheme and fair and equitable access to the children involved. Disregarding for the moment the attitudinal problems emanating from the CSA staff in their dealings with non-custodial parents, the two primary problems seem to be in the assessment levels of child-care contributions and the tax treatment of the CSS payments by contributing parents-the accountability of the money paid to the custodial parents through the scheme. Let me make one point very clear. In most of the dealings my office has had with noncustodial parents in the child support cases, there is absolutely no argument that a rational and reasonable level of contribution must be made towards the upkeep of children of failed marriages. Most non-custodial parents accept this fact and willingly accept the concept of maintenance. The problem is the methodology upon which the CSS is based and its enactment by the Child Support Agency. Firstly, on the assessment level, currently the formula used by the CSA is 18 per cent of gross wages for the first child, rising to 26 per cent of gross for five or more children. A major problem is in the use of the gross wage for the assessment purposes. The net effect of this payment to the average non-custodial parent can be as high as a third to half more in real dollar terms than those percentages reflect on paper. The government can take a major initiative in fairness by adjusting the formula to either a percentage of the net wage or by allowing the CSS payments to be tax deductible. The real effect of this arbitrary and unfair method of assessment is that many non-custodial parents are leaving the work force and going onto the dole, simply because they feel that they are better off on the dole than having to pay exorbitant levels of support demanded of them under the current system. If you have any doubts about this, you merely have to look at the number of non-custodial parents in receipt of unemployment benefits. Approximately 30 per cent currently have taken that option and that is more than three times the national unemployment average. So, by default, government action to recover child support payments and reduce the burden on the 4804 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 taxpayer have the opposite effect of encouraging people onto the dole, thereby costing the taxpayer seven or eight times more than it would cost just to pay child support in addition to the sole parent pension. Talk about a hollow victory. The problem with the assessment formula does not stop there. The anomaly between the level at which the Department of Social Security assesses the worth of the child and the level at which the CSA can assess the same child for higher income earners borders on the ridiculous. Standard DSS family payment for one child is $93.10 per fortnight. Yet a noncustodial parent on a basic wage is forced to pay $186.70 per fortnight, slightly more than double what the government considers to be the worth of a child. As the non-custodial parent's income gets higher, the contribution level per child becomes commensurately more out of step with reality. There is no differentiation as to the age of the child or children. For example, a three-year-old qualifies the custodial parent for the same rate of payment as does a 13-year-old, yet anyone would know that the cost of upkeep and education of a teenager is much higher than that of a toddler. There is no doubt that the real problem is the escalating divorce rate in Australia. As a government, we are committed to a return to family values and it devolves upon us to look at some of the major issues that are contributing to the current high level of family break-up in this nation. However, in the interim we have to look closely at how we can address the myriad of anomalies in the current child support scheme. Let us never lose sight of the real purpose of this scheme and our primary focus must always be on the innocent victims, the children. I must also acknowledge that in the majority of cases, both parents-and I repeat, both-have a deep love and intense interest in their children. Accountability of CSA payments in the hands of the custodial parents also seems to be one of the major problems associated with the scheme. This is a major source of conflict that I and my staff are hearing from non-custodial parents. The impression that they receive is that there is no accountability as to the direction of expenditure of CSA payments in the custodial parent's hands and that in many cases the money is used on expenditure totally unassociated with the care and upbringing of their child or children. Another concern is that when the custodial parent has taken up with another partner in a de facto relationship and both parties work, it is not uncommon to find a non-custodial parent reduced to poverty through a CSA ruling on maintenance while a custodial parent enjoys their own income, sometimes an income on a par with their ex-spouse, as well as the income of their de facto. I have heard of cases where a custodial parent in a new family situation and earning well in excess of $100,000 a year is receiving substantial CSA payments from an exspouse who is struggling to meet these payments, as well as having to cater for a new family on a single income. Possibly we, as a government, should look at setting up within the CSA a trust situation where the custodial parent is allowed to draw down regular maintenance payments from the moneys contributed by non-custodial parents for living costs and must account for all other major items of expenditure on the child or children for things such as education and other expenses. This would ensure that funds contributed by non-custodial parents are used exclusively for what they were intended, the maintenance and upbringing of the child. Another major area of concern that has been brought to my attention from dealing with people involved in the child support scheme is the problem of child access. There seems to be no relationship between demands to pay CSA payments and the paying parent's right to Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4805 access the child. The dogma of confidentiality is so entrenched in the bureaucrats at the Child Support Agency that non-custodial parents are often hounded for payments of child support, even when the custodial parent is ignoring decisions from the Family Court as regards access to children. It should be a two-way street. If the CSA is going to religiously enforce one law, the payment of child maintenance, then it should ensure that the other laws of a family nature are adhered to and that custodial parents abide by Family Court access decisions. I believe that this is only fair. Let us tum to the Child Support Agency itself. There are major attitudinal problems within the CSA that need addressing urgently. There would appear to be a regime of arrogance in place that in talks with my colleagues I have found to be almost universal across Australia. Non-custodial parents are treated in the main with contempt by the apparatchiks who staff this agency, which is totally contrary to the concept of a no fault divorce. If there is to be more than easy access to the tennination of marriage that seems to be the norm today, on the basis of no need to prove fault, then there should be no fault attributed to dealings with either the divorced or separated couple. This does not appear to be the case with the CSA. Almost every case that is brought to my office's attention includes an element of dissatisfaction with the attitudes of people in the CSA. Besides problems of arrogance and assumed guilt, there seems to be no continuity of dealing with staff. Non-custodial parents rarely speak to the same case officer twice and arbitrary decisions without any semblance of concern for the well-being of the non-custodial parent, or in many cases for their new family, bring about hardships beyond the nonnal human compassion. This goes both ways. It is not only the non-custodial parent that suffers from the shortcomings of the CSA. There seems to be a regime within the CSA of taking the easy way out. I have a particular case in my electorate where a non-custodial father, very well-known around the town as being, if not a millionaire, verging on that asset level, has structured his affairs in such a way that he has managed to bring his child support payments down to a mere $30 a week, some $17 a week less than his estranged wife could get in family benefits, forcing his estranged wife to try and raise their daughter on something like $100 a week after mortgage payments. Yet this gentleman has three booming businesses in Far North Queensland, a large and profitable painting business offshore, and a new one starting in Cairns. He lives in a $650,000 home in an exclusive beach suburb to which he recently added a $50,000 swimming pool and he recently bought his current girlfriend a $100,000 luxury motor car. You can see quite clearly that it goes both ways. I think this is another area that we have to look at very seriously, where people are able to conceal their income and, in doing so, are able to walk away from their commitment of contributing to payments for the upbringing of their children. It seems that, in that case, the CSA found it too hard to research this man's assets and income to realise that he has a very smart accountant and is conning the agency. This government is in a unique position to put a new broom through much of the anti-family legislation that we have inherited. I believe the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) when he says that he wants to run a government that returns this nation to traditional family values that once made it a much more stable society than it is today after 13 years of social engineering. This bill is a small start to cleaning up some of the surface anomalies in the child support legi4806 MAIN COMMITIEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 slation, but we certainly need to go much, much deeper. We need to go right to the heart of this act and bring to it fairness, accountability and justice for all concerned. I am an active member of the recently established government backbench committee dealing with child support legislation, and I am certainly looking forward to changes that we hope will be introduced later this year. There are literally hundreds and thousands of Australians out there, both custodial and non-custodial parents, who are haemorrhaging under the socially libertine attacks on the institution of marriage this act encourages. They say that from acorns great oaks grow. I commend this bill to the House, primarily in the hope that it is a first small step in returning justice and fair treatment to what is one of the major social engineering failures of this and the previous decade. Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. Since being elected to represent the people of Makin in this place, I have received many requests for assistance in matters relating to child support and the Child Support Agency. It was a matter I raised in my first speech in the House. As a result of many constituent inquiries I have received on this issue, I have made numerous representations to the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Jim Short and the current Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp. They have, on each and every occasion, been willing to listen to my requests and have been extremely helpful in seeking a resolution to the particular problem I have been seeking to resolve on behalf of my constituents and, most importantly, their children. As a result of representations from government members, me included, the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, have established a committee to investigate suggested changes to the child support system. As a member of this committee, I appreciate the opportunity to bring the concerns of my constituents directly to the ministers responsible for the operation of the agency and related services. I place on record my appreciation of the fine work being done by the staff of the Child Support Agency in Adelaide, South Australia. Their work can sometimes be very difficult and distressing, but I have always found them ready and willing to help to the best of their ability, even though the outcomes are not always what both parents would wish. The establishment of the Child Support Agency has had a significant effect on the number of non-custodial parents who now pay child support. Prior to its introduction, it is estimated that only one in three non-custodial parents was paying child support. This compares with the current situation where 56 per cent of all collect cases pay child support each and every month. Furthermore, surveys that have been taken suggest that about 85 per cent of registered private collection cases pay regularly. This means that around 65 per cent of registered payers now make regular payments to support their children. These figures illustrate the general success of the agency in ensuring that both parents contribute towards the upbringing of their child or children. Despite this, however, we recognise that there are problems and inequities within the current system. Over the last three years, the number of cases being dealt with by the Child Support Agency has increased by around 50,000 per year, and this is expected to continue. At the end of last year, there were 247,000 collect cases in the system and a further 164,000 registered private collection cases.",158,Representatives Main Committee
309,Mrs Draper (Makin) (9.49 P.m.),"It gives me much pleasure to speak in support of theTuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4807 The Howard government's 1996-97 budget recognised the necessity of reforming aspects of the system and provided additional resources to the Child Support Agency. As a result of the reforms already made by the government, child support collections increased by $36 million in the 12 months between December 1995 and December 1996, and the amount of child support debt was reduced. Some 80 per cent of total child support liability was collected and distributed to custodial parents, and the number of payers having their arrears directly deducted from their wages increased by more than 4,000. There is still a need for further improvement, as my constituents will testify, but I am sure that all Australians would be pleased with the progress so far. The issue of the repayment of overpayments by custodial parents has been raised with me on several occasions. On one occasion, a distressed constituent contacted me after receiving a letter from the Child Support Agency requesting her to repay a sum of money. The constituent had already used the money to provide her two children with the opportunity to visit their grandparents in Victoria. She could not afford to travel with them and had had to scrimp and save to provide them with enough money for the trip. The letter from the agency was a very unpleasant shock to her and she did not know what to do. Thankfully, assistance was provided and her two children got to see their grandparents, but this highlights one of the problems which currently exists and, I am pleased to say, it is being addressed in this bill. As members would be aware, child support assessments are calculated using the income tax returns of the payer for the previous two years. If the payer feels that his or her income for the current year will be more than 15 per cent less than previously estimated, he or she can have their child support payments reassessed. This estimate affects the child support payments from the beginning of the financial year, meaning that the custodial parent may have to refund money which has already been paid. To illustrate this point, I wish to mention another case which was brought to my attention by one of my constituents. On this occasion, the custodial parent had been overpaid and was required to repay the money. However, the estimate given by the payer had been incorrect and he had, in fact, earned more than his estimate. The result was that my constituent had to pay back all of the amount she was overpaid and then would receive back part of this after the adjustment was made for the payer's incorrect estimate. She could not see the logic in this and, frankly, nor could I. This bill changes the way in which overpayments are recovered. A parent will no longer be required to refund money already paid. Overpayments will be recovered by reducing the non-custodial parent's payments for the year. Underpayments will also be made up over the period of the year, rather than all at once. It will still be a requirement for the correct and total amount of money for the year to be paid, but these changes will mean that far fewer custodial parents will be required to repay overpaid amounts of child support. This measure will also lead to a more accurate assessment of the non-custodial parent's future capacity to pay, because the amount payable will only be changed for the months remaining after the estimate has been lodged. The level of child support arrears should also be reduced as a result of these changes. Another improvement that will be implemented on the passage of this bill relates to the preferred method of payment by payers of their child support obligations. Currently, many payments are deducted directly from the non-custodial parent's wages by his or her employer and sent to the Child Support Agency. I know of a number of my constituents who are 4808 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 3 June 1997 distressed by this lack of control over their own finances and who resent the fact that their employers are forced to become involved in a private matter. The changes in this bill will allow non-custodial parents to make payments directly to the Child Support Agency without the involvement of his or her employer. This is in line with the recommendations of the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues-as is much of this bill. We must give credit to the work done by that committee. Naturally, this change to allow non-custodial parents to directly pay the agency is subject to the approval of the registrar. The registrar must be satisfied that the parent will pay on time. Custodial parents can be reassured by the fact that the registrar will be able to reverse the decision to allow direct payment if payments are not made on time. A payer parent who has had his or her application for direct payment rejected must wait two months before applying again for this method of payment. Similarly, a payer parent who has failed to make regular payments on time, using the direct payment method, may have the employer deductions reintroduced and must wait six months before applying again for the direct payment method. These provisions safeguard the custodial parent, whilst giving the opportunity to noncustodial parents to make regular direct payments to the Child Support Agency. Furthermore, this measure is in line with the government's stated aim of supporting small business. By providing the option of direct payments by the payer parents, the responsibility and associated compliance costs to employers will be reduced. A further aspect of this bill that will please non-custodial parents, in particular, is the provision to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to enable the court to consider future child support liabilities in property and spousal maintenance proceedings. This will apply even without an administrative assessment under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. I have received many representations from non-custodial parents who feel that their child support arrangements are unfair and do not take into full account their financial position. The anger and emotion of some of these parents illustrates the need to ensure fairness and equity in dealing with issues relating to child support and family law. There have been cases where there has been no child support assessment applied for when the custodial parent has applied for child support arrears after the property settlement has been determined. In such cases, the child support liability has not been taken into consideration, to the detriment of the payer parent. Amendments in this bill will allow payer parents to have these future child support obligations recognised and taken into account by the Family Court before the settlement of property and spousal maintenance. This is both fair and equitable, and in line with the Howard government's commitment to the implementation of positive reforms to child support arrangements. I must comment on the breathtaking audacity of the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) during his contribution to this debate. The member for Werriwa has suddenly become a latter day champion of reform in the area of child support arrangements. Never mind that, in 13 years of Labor, nothing was done to make the system fairer; never mind that the thousands of Australians who held genuine grievances concerning this matter were ignored by Labor ministers and by an unsympathetic Labor government. I know the stories, and I have seen the heartbreak caused by the callous attitude that Labor has towards people. But we now have the member for Werriwa whingeing and complaining Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 4809 that the Howard coalition government is not doing enough. The honourable member moves amendments designed to play politics with people's sensitivities, yet he does not recognise the absolute failure of his own previous Labor government to do anything to improve the system when they had the chance. We now have substantial reforms before us which will help to make child support arrangements fairer and more equitable. The member for Werriwa ought to reflect on that. He ought to remember that the improvements are taking place under the Howard coalition government. This government has proven willing to listen and act on matters relating to child support. I am very pleased to be able to bring the concerns of my constituents directly to the minister responsible. The establishment of a government committee on the Child Support Agency has enabled government members to voice the concerns of their constituents and work on finding practical solutions. There were over 6,000 public submissions to the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. This reflects the very real need for the reforms contained within this bill, and for an ongoing process of reform to further improve the system of child support. I believe in the need for further considered reform to ensure even greater fairness and equity. As I said in my first speech in the House, many constituents feel that the child support formula is unfair because it is calculated on taxable income minus exempt income, rather than on net income, which is the amount of money that the non-custodial parent has to live on in real terms. I said at that time, and I say it again today, that I will continue to work towards a fairer system for both custodial and non-custodial parents in my electorate of Makin and Australia wide, for the benefit of all children. to commence by thanking many members for their contributions to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. In effect, all members from both sides of the parliament have supported the contents of this bill. The number of speakers to this bill indicates the amount of interest in parliament with the operation of the child support scheme. Firstly, I would like to respond to the amendment moved by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) on behalf of the opposition. For obvious reasons, the government will not be supporting this amendment. As the member for Makin( Mrs Draper) has very adequately and eloquently said, the opposition-the member for Werriwa in this case-are moving amendments when they had 13 years to do something about this issue. It is gross hypocrisy to come here and criticise us when we have been in government for only 15 months. We are responding, and we are responding in a very significant way. For the record, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues reported in November 1994. That committee made 163 recommendations for change to the Child Support Agency and to the scheme in general. At the time that the coalition government took office, more than 100 of the recommendations from this committee had not been responded to. Those that were addressed by the previous government were largely administrative. The recommendations left to this government, not surprisingly, are more substantive and more complex. For the most part, the remaining recommendations from the report of the joint select committee involve complex issues of equity between separated parents, their children and the Commonwealth.",162,Representatives Main Commitiee

This is in stark contrast to the previous government. I note with interest the remarks made earlier this week by the honourable member for Chifley( Mr Price), chair of the joint select committee, when speaking on his private member's bill in relation to this matter. He said: ... it never occurred to me that nearly three years would have elapsed and that only the easiest of the recommendations-53 in all-would have been tackled by my governmentthe Labor government when they were in powerand the present government and that the remaining more difficult policy issues would be and continue to be unresponded to ... In fact, if I reflect on the three years, I am a little surprised that the caucus has never really had an opportunity to vote on these measures or any of the other recommendations. That is from Hansard, 2 June, 1997. This is the government's first legislative response to recommendations made by the joint select committee. The government recognises that this bill does not address the key issues of the joint select committee. However, the government does not believe that these common sense reforms should await consideration of the somewhat more substantial issues raised by the joint select committee and many others in the community. Nothing says more about the priority given to child support by the previous government than the fact that the first legislative response to the committee had to await the advent of a coalition government to be introduced. The bill amends the child support legislation to bring it into line with the provisions and concepts of the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Each of these acts has undergone change over the last few years without at the time making the necessary consequential changes to child support legislation. The bill amends the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 to adopt the thrust of recommendation 124 of the joint select committee on the use of income estimates. This amendment will allow estimates for the most part to have a prospective effect only. This will reduce the incidence of overpayments to persons receiving child support by removing the retrospective effect of the current income estimate provisions. The bill amends the Child Support (Registration Collection) Act 1988 to enable parents who pay child support to elect to pay directly to the register. This amendment adopts recommendations 55 through to 57 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. It reduces the level of intrusiveness of the child support scheme where payers voluntarily comply with their child support obligations and over time may reduce the administrative and compliance costs of the scheme. The amendment provides a better balance between the need for regular financial support for children of separated parents and the rights of parents to privacy. The bill also amends the Family Law Act 1975 to allow the courts to take into account the child support liability of a person in property and spousal maintenance proceedings, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. The amendment responds to recommendations 156 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The reforms proposed in the bill are responsible. They remove some significant and frequent causes for complaint from payers and recipients of child support. They are, to use the words of the member for Dunkley( Mr Billson) 'human and responsive reforms'. They represent a small step in responding to the outstanding recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues and I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Tuesday, 3 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 4811 a second time.
