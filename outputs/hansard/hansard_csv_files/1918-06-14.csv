Last evening, after the honourable member for Brisbane had read certain extracts from the letter which we have been discussing, the honourable member for Calare (' Mr Pigott) telegraphed to Mr Hall, the Attorney-General in the New South Wales Government, repeating the statement contained in the letter, and he has just handed to me Mr Hall's reply, which reads as follows:Finlayson's statement that I approached German internees, either directly or indirectly, absolutely without foundation.' HALL, Attorney-General. that I was not in the chamber when the statement was made by the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson); and as I wish to refer later on to the letter he produced, I am anxious' to know whether it will be possible to secure at once the Hansard report of what occurred yesterday ? allow uncorrected galley proofs of Hansard to be available, except with the consent of the honourable members concerned. Hansard is not yet available from the Government Printer's hands. tioned last night, it having been said that I had visited the German Internment Camp at Holdsworthy, I have looked at the first three sheets of the letter, which is addressed, ""Dear Mr Finlayson,"" from some internee in .that camp, in order to substantiate thc accuracy of the honourable member's quotation, and I find that the letter has apparently no ending. The last sheet is missing. able member my positive assurance that the whole of the letter is there. in the ordinary way; but I accept the honourable member's assurance.

I find that . the reference to myself is contained in the words, ""Kelly, Orchard, and Sinclair were here, but not inside."" I did go inside tliat camp in order to look over it, and as the gentleman who writes to "" Dear Mr Finlayson "" complains bitterly about the class of food provided there, I wish to say that from personal inspection I found that it was excellent, and was in adequate quantity. I say also that the conditions in that camp are infinitely better than those which our own poor prisoners in Germany are experiencing. that the letter from which extracts have been read is unsigned, and that it casts a reflection upon a memher of another Parliament, and mentions the names of honourable members of this Chamber, I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it would not be in the interests of this Housei f you saw that all references to the letter and the personal explanations arising therefrom were expunged from the rewords ? only by resolution of the House. letter is now the property of the House, and should be tabled as a record. of the House. It has also been admitted that a document which has been cited ought to be laid upon the table of the House, if it can be done without injury to the public interests. The same rule, however, cannot be held to apply to private letters or memoranda. I understand that the letter referred to is a private one, and that it has not heen read as a whole, although extracts from it have been quoted. In any case it was read when the House was in Committee, and the attention of the Chairman of Committees should have been called to it at the time if any exception was taken to its character or contents. question of privilege, I understand that last .night the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) admitted that he accepted responsibility for the statements, the honourable contained in the letter. of privilege before the House, and this",21,Visit S Or Members

ThatI am not prepared to do, but I have replied that the Government sympathize with him in the attacks which have been made upon his character. The Government are ""not responsible for the appointment of consuls in this country.

Tor the first year-lOlS-KP-representative s of farmers' organizations agreed with wheat shippers as to .the handling charges to be paid. These rates, however, were reduced at the instance of the Ministers constituting the Wheat Board. The rates for 1916-17 were still further reduced. Owing to the length of time it has become necessary to store Wheat, a different arrangement for 1917-18 was decided upon. The rates for that year are so low that it is considered that some contractors will make little, if any, profit. Minister, upon noticeJ.

Inter-State tonnage, a schedule has been adopted. S HIPPING : VESSELS AVAILABLE . ber for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) a while ago asked me a questiou as to shipping available for the carriage of jute, and I promised to obtain additional information. The Ministeri n charge (Senator Russell) has forwarded me the following memorandum from the Chief Prices Commissioner ( Mr Percy Whitton) : The position with regard to the shipping is that the Shipping Board is now expecting to have the following steamers available between now and the end of December:Carina, four trips; Australs (2), eight trips; Talatoa, three trips; Carawa, three trips; Yankalilla, one trip; making nineteen trips in all, whereas the. estimated requirements are twenty-seven trips of 7,000-ton steamers. Continued efforts are being made to obtain this additional tonnage. The Carina is due in Calcutta this week, and will commence loading at once. The Yankalilla is now on her way to Calcutta, and it is expected that the Talawa, and probably two Austral boats, will be available for August loading. It is further part of the scheme that the vessels mentioned shall remain in the direct trade between Calcutta and Australia during the season. An additional part of the scheme is that a certain amount of cargo shall be taken to Colombo by a local service, and there transhipped to transports and other boats calling at Colombo from Egypt on their way to Australia. Of course, that latter w ill be additional to the nineteen steamers of which we know at present. In Consideration resumed from 12th June (vid-e page 5936), of motion by Lord That the first item in the Estimates under Division 1-The Parliament, namely, "" The President, Â£1,000 ""-be agreed to. --When the House adjourned last night after a prolonged sitting of thirty-one and a half hours, I had the privilege of the call; and I have now to express the hope that all honourable members feel as fresh as I do after a good night's rest. Since the requisition of I first desire to draw attention to the result of the by-election in the Albert Park constituency for the State of Victoria, which shows which way the wind is blowing in the matter of price fixation. Honourable members will have seen from nan, the successful candidate, had a majority of 1,841 over his next opponent, as compared with the majority of 1,540 recorded for his predecessor, the late Mr. Elmslie. B ut for the stand taken by the Age, I do uot think that the Federal Government, or their supporters, would have made any pronouncement in regard to price-fixing; but we have yet to learn exactly what they intend to do, and how soon it will be done. If the Government carry out the promise that has been made to the House, it will be made plain . to every purchaser how much he is called upon to pay, and if he is overcharged there will be an official to whom he can' appeal. I only hope that this official will have the power to institute any legal proceedings necessary, so as to remove. from the private individual the onus of initiating a prosecution. The leading article in the Age of to-day saysIn establishing the practice of the short session and the long recess, the Government is making a serious mistake. That is my opinion, and I am sure it-is the opinion of the public generally. We members are not earning our Â£12 a week by holding short sessions and taking long holidays. I much prefer Parliament to be in session, for then Wrongs may be readily remedied, whereas if Parliament is not sitting weeks of delay may be involved. The leading article goes onNow, when the 'Commonwealth is spending more than Â£80,000,000 a year on war, and has vast trading interests throughout the couti. ncnt, there is more reason why recesses should be short and sessions long than there was in the days of peace, when the Federal ParliaCommittee: ment was expected to sit for at least six months in thc year, and on one occasion sat almost continuously for eighteen months. Any member on the election platform who expressed disapproval of these sentiments would receiveshort shrift at the hands of his. constituents.

In this' connection I wish to read a statement, recently published in a newspaper that used to be the strongest organ in Australia fighting for Liberal measures. It is stated in that journal that the people are being overcharged by millions of pound's. This is not the statement of a Labour man or a Socialist, but that of a wealthy newspaper, whose writers feel the injustice inflicted on the community hy the robbery that is going on at the present time.

We may have to give up the hope that, we can compel the enemy, which has been misled by the brutal Prussian military system^ to indemnify us. if we get through at all. I would rather make Germany pay than make Australia pay for the expenditure The high prices of foodstuffs that we have had to lincur in. connection with the war, for which we are in. no way responsible'. I hope to see the military power of Germany broken and destroyed, so that it can never again be effective. But I havegreat regard for the middleand southern Germans, asad great, reverence for the great scientists, musicians, artists, and litterateurs of Germany. The only name among them indicating Prussian descent is that of K a n t , the-, great philosopher.

That revolution swept away the rule of thei aristocracy and brought about the expression of all sorts of wild ideas and theories:, but as By no. word or Allison, the conservative historian, has remarked, "" never in the history of the world has there been such an uprising of genius and the appearance of so many great minds within so shorta space of time as. in that period.''

In the same way I am speaking for the farmer.. I was a settler over forty-five years ago. I only mention it in order to make my argument stronger, and show that my sympathy is always with the man on the land. On the question of the savings to the people let me quote from State Regulation of Pricesi n Australia, written by that brilliant student of the University' of Melbourne, MrH . L . Wilkinson, a member of the Price of Goods Board of Victoria, and a winner of a great prize that few men have been able to obtain. On page 73, Mr Wilkinson, in his book, saysThe Hon. D. K. Hall, Attorney-General of the State of New South_ Wales, who administered the price-fixing legislation of that State, wheat, flour and bread, or by the method of estimated that the following savings were made to consumers as a result of the State regulating the trade in these commodities :On account of reduced prices of wheat On account of reduced prices of bread On account of reduced prices of butter That makes a total of Â£890,000 to the extent of which the people of New South Wales have benefited.

Some further figures, which ought to be placed on record in Hansardi n order to give a basis for fixing the price of wheat, flour, and bread, are to be found on page 95 of the same bookIn a report issued on 16th June, 1916, the board, in regard to fixing prices, says:We have considered the question whether the fixation of minimum prices by legal enactment for ' recommended, prices ' would be the best suited to the conditions prevalent in New Zealand.

W i l kinson's The Trust Movementi n Australia, giving the quotations for flour and the ruling prices for bread in Victoria as follows: Flour Bread End of July, Â£ s. d. 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 When the people of Victoria were paying Â£11 10s. per ton for their flour, in the other States the price ranged from Â£ 1 0 2s. 6d. in some cases to about Â£ 1 2 in Queensland. and 7Â£d. for the loaf of bread. cause of the increase in prices? fixation of the price of wheat at 4s. 9d. per bushel, although We have enjoyed bountiful harvests. have also been increased to a slight extent. per ton in 1913, the price of the 4-lb. loaf a laboratory test as a fair basis. of bread in Melbourne was 7d. paying too much for bread at. present.

Any honourable member who has seen the wrecks of humanity that are caused, particularly by dry mining, w ill agree that the statements I am making are not too severe. I believe that if the Government would make an appeal to the very wealthy people to lend their money free of interest during the war, a large number of rich men would respond. When we are trying to get the shillings and pence from the workers in the street, when no man can go down the city without being asked to spend something on patriotic buttons or other means of raising funds for war purposes, it cannot be derogatory for the Government to make a request to those possessed of, help the country in its hour of need, by lending money free of interest. I believe that if the request were made, it would meet with respect and bear f r u it . Sitting make the following quotation from a letter by MrW ill i a m Wilson, secretary of the Australian Protectionists Association, in regard to the fiscal issueI have previously Why will not the National party fulfil its pledges ? Is it because the Government is afraid of losing revenue from Customs duties on tliese luxuries, whose importation the Luxuries Board has recommended should be prohibited, and that tbe Government is afraid of introducing taxation to make up for this loss of revenue, or is it because the importers-the old free-trade Conservative party-hav e control of their National party, and dictate what The BrokenH ill Proshall or what shall not he done, quite irrespective of party pledges, the welfare, and the solvency of the Commonwealth ? No one appreciates more than I do the difficulties in the way of dealing with the Tariff during the present world war, but I think those difficulties could very well be avoided if the Government would adapt to our circumstances the Japanese Tariff, which is, perhaps, the most up-to-date in the world, and bring in a B ill applying it to Australia.

I have received the following report from the Department:Work for the season was promised by a number of graziers if the men were trained. A class was accordingly formed, and men invited 1 to join. suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. Every one who did so applied to be admitted.",36,Forrest

Shed-owners have further given an undertaking that, if the men are suitable, they will be given an opportunity for permanent employment. The class was started with twenty men, and was later increased to fifty. The class hours were fixed at from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with one hour for lunch and two ""smoke-ohs"" of fifteen minutes each. In the second week' of the course, the men knocked off, objecting to the hours, which they desired Bhould 'be confined to !) a.m. to 4 p.m. Two of their number ultimately interviewed the oflicer in charge of vocational training, and submitted three complaints1. Short payment of sustenance in certain courses. 2. Tlie nature of the wool handled. N 3. The hours df training. The first was immediately adjusted, and steps taken to prevent its recurrence. Regarding the second, the oflicer in charge reports:-""The second point in dispute was that of the nature of the wool which they were called upon to handle, and I immediately called over to mo the instructor, Mr Carrodus, and Mr Coombe, a representative of the Estates Company, and an expert classer, in order that I might be informed as to whether the men were being treated unfairly in the matter of nature of wool that they were handling. It transpired that the men were handling wool known as "" carding pieces,"" and that this very wool had been selected as being best calculated to give thc men speed in their work and to provide the very training which they were most likely to require in the wool-sheds. It was intended that they should pass next on to merino pieces, and graduate on to the finer wools. This was explained to the men, and in less than two minutes the matter of the class of wool was disposed of."" As to the matter of hours, the officer in charge pointed out to the men that these had been fixed in the interests of the men themselves, having regard to the brief period for training. intimated their willingness to resume, and all, with the exception of one man, did so on the following morning. The places of the man who declined to resume, and of two who dropped out through physical disabilitv, were immediately filled. The instructor states that the men settled earnestly to their work after he had explained to thera the reason for sorting the wool complained of. They have become quite interested in their work. Some men, with leg wounds, found the strain of standing caused swelling. Instructions were immediately given that these men should he given frequent opportunities for sitting down and resting. Another difficulty was that some of the stronger men were detailed to carry the wool from the sorting table to the presses, and they objected to having their time occupied in this way instead of at sorting and picking. Men have since been specially provided to remove the wool as it is treated at the sorting table. It is not correct that the wool was provided by the Estates and Mortgage Company. It was specially released by the Wool Committee to permit of the instructional class beingformed. It may be added, however, that thj: company referred to very kindly made available its large show-room floor for the use of the class. This was most helpful, as, owing to the heavy demands upon storage space consequent upon freight difficulties, it was extremely difficult to procure suitable accommodation. A comparison with rental quotations shows that the accommodation made available by the company represents a contribution to the training of returned men of approximately Â£300. v It will thus be seen that the company has been treating the Department very generously. It reaps no advantage out of the transaction, but is really assisting the Government in training returned soldiers for useful occupations. power and light. very generously. the desert. member w ill admit that one of the brightest features of the war is that it has brought to the f r o n t amongst all classes a degree of personal sympathy and humanitarian interest that many did not believe to exist.

It is true that the men have been engaged s on picking burrs out of the wool burrs out of the wool. understood. What the men are doing is necessary work, but they are not in the class for the sole purpose of picking burrs out of the wool. The report continues2. It is true tliat the men have been engaged on picking burrs out of the wool. This duty is necessary, and, on the recommendation of Mr Fox, Chairman, State 'Wool Committee, through which all wool is made available for the class, the men were put on this class of work, as it was calculated that, by so doing, their training would be greatly expedited. It really constitutes the A.B.C. of the training. 3. The men do not receive any wages, as they are totally inexperienced.

The reply which I received this morning from the Honorary Ministeri n charge of shipping ( Mr Poynton), covering a statement from Admiral Clarkson, shows that it is absolutely necessary in the in terests of the community that the whole question of shipping should be threshed out in this Committee, and that the Government should be asked to give it serious consideration.

What we do strongly along it . During the present shortage of object to is tonnage, goods for different parts of the Commonwealth are being sent largely by vessels visiting only' two ports-for the up bills of lading until after the vessel has most part the ports of Sydney and Melsailed, the documents .may not reach you bourne. This inflicts much inconvenience be well, therefore, to keep a look outforher, on business men in Queensland, South and arrange in. some way for the warehousing Australia, and Tasmania. Goods coming of the goods until documents reach you. for those States have to be discharged at one of the larger ports I have named, and are sent from there to their destination. Before the war, and until shipping was taken over by the British Miuister for Shipping, the rule was always to supply through bills of ladling to the final port of discharge, so that a consignment remained in the control of t h e . shipping company by whose vessel it was shipped from the Old Country until it The reached its final port of destination. In that way our goods were safeguarded until they reached tlieir final port. This London Board, however, has now given instructions that no bills of lading shall be issued to any merchant except to the first port of discharge-the destination of tlie vessel. and the goods are no longer handed over by the agent of that vessel to one of the coastal companies (to bje forwarded to their destination without any additional expense to the merchants at other ports. Under this decision of the London Board, it is absolutely impossible for merchants in other ports than the port visited by the oversea steamer to handle with any degree of safety goods from Home. able member tliink that we are fortunate in being able to get any goods at all from the Old Country?

151,,"It is now. Mr CORSER I suppose that in theseThat is all right so far as the joonsigiiee at the port of arrival is concerned, for he is on the spot, and is a'ble to ascertain whether any goods are on board for him. The circumstances are very different, however, in the case of a merchant in Townsville, Rockhampton, Maryborough, or any other distant port. When goods are shipped, whether from Glasgow, London, or Liverpool,, the manufacturer there obtains his money on bills of lading with other documents handed to a bank, and these, together with the invoices and insurance documents, are forwarded to the port of destination. Then, and not until then, the shipping agent at the port of arrival knows to whom the goods belong,..they being consigned to order as a protection to the bank. If the goods are landed in Melbourne and Sydney fourteen days before the merchant in Rockhampton, Townsville, Tasmania, or South Australia receives any notice, how can the goods be protected? There is now a regulation under which it is possible to refuse to entertain any claim -for pillage or destruction of goods .unless that claim is lodged with the agents for the British Shipping Board within seven days, and, of course, in such cases as I have instanced, this removes any chance of complying with the regulation. Unfortunately, there is considerable pillaging; and only last week, in a case in which I was concerned, a ship's agent .for .an oversea steamer repudiated any claim because notice from Maryborough had not reached him within seven days of the time of the discharge of the goods from the ship.; and this occurred even before the drastic regulalation came' into operation. Under the circumstauces it will be simply impossible to obtain a penny piece on account of any damage to, or pillaging of, goods in transit, and it will be necessary to appoint agents in Melbourne and Sydney to see that goods on their arrival are properly stored and insured, and sent on to their destination. All this, of course, means a considerable added cost, which will have to be passed on to the consumer. Why not use the machinery already in existence for handling such goods ? I trust .'that the Minister will represent to the British Shipping Board that, in view of the long distances between ports in Australia, bills of lading should, as in the past, he issued to the final port of discharge, and it ought to be imperative on Ur. Corser. the British agents at these ports to see that'the goods are safeguarded and forwarded with all despatch. Should this entail a little more expense, I am sure the Australian merchants would prefer to bear it rather than have their goods knocking about the port of discharge with nobody responsible for their safety. I have no desire to say anything against the management of the Shipping Board under Admiral Clarkson. He is an excellent man for the position. I , amongst others, have often wondered that he should be able to grasp the situation as he has, and to so sncoessful-ly administer his office. But the matter to which I am more immedia-telly referring is outside the range of Haas duties, except, perhaps, the latter part. pears to me to be within his powers. must rest on ithe shipping authorities at the port of shipment to give through bills of lading to Hobart, Rockhampton, Adelaide, or wherever it may be. It is for them to safeguard these goods; and if the agents here had sufficient clerical assistance when there_ were five or ten vessels -to one arriving at the present time, surely the old arrangement could be successfully continued. However, the present difficulty is not because there is not the assistance, or owing to any refusal to do this work; and I can only put it down to lack of knowledge of the local circumstances of .Australia on the part of the British Shipping Board. The whole of the facts ought to be laid before that Board with a view to some remedy being applied. In the letter read by the Minister today, we are told that this is a matteT outside the Commonwealth jurisdiction, and that the trouble is due to the scarcity of tonnage.

The other day a commission agent in Nanango wanted on a Friday to communicate with Murrarumbi, a station about 40 miles on the Maryborough side of Nanango, in reference to a transaction involving a sum of about Â£5.00. As a train leaves Nanango at ten minutes past 5 o'clock each morning, and stops at Murrarumbi,. he naturally concluded that his letter would be, delivered ahout 9 o clock ? on the same morning, in accordance with custom in the past. But because no mail is now made up. on the down train for Murrarumbi and numerous small stations, the letter was sent on to Maryborough, a distance of about. 140 miles, and brought back to Murrarumbi on the following Monday, too late to be of service, and, therefore, the deal was lost. All Honourable memhers who know along the line are butter and cheese factories'. In my district there are ahout twenty of these factories. A t certain times in the month there must be a large correspondence, including advices of cream and cheques, between them and their suppliers. This correspondence is much longer in transit than it should be. Why must country communities,, which, under any circumstances, are under disadvantages unknown to city dwellers, have their inconveniences increased by the Postal Department? If there must be cheese-sparing, let it be in. the city,, where, if necessary,, boys can be despatched with the delivery of messages and letters. Many of the farmers out back have sent sons> and often only sons, to the war. They are prevented from getting letters from them as often or as early as they might get them,, and they are also prevented from getting information through the local press as early as they might get it. This naturally increases their' anxiety beyond that, of persons resident in the cities, where information can be obtained from newspapers; not only daily, but every morning and evening,. The Postmaster General, is,. I believe, a competent man, and is doing his best, according to his In judgment. But I fear that too much pressure is exercised by city populations to prevent inconvenience being suffered by them,, with the result that out-back populations;, which cannot so easily place their difficulties before the Minister, or the Deputy Postmaster-General, of the State; do not get fair treatment. Country correspondence is mostly very important, containing, as it does very largely, advices concerning the despatch of cattle, produ:ce>. and orders for goods. It frequently happens that goods are now delivered ahead of the letters advising their despatch. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of pilfering on. the railways,, and men who have: not received invoices cannot always; tell whether the goods of which they take delivery are of the quantity or in the condition in which they were sent.

Since then, at the request of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), my leader, Mr sired. Tudor, has drawn up a list of regulations, the repeal of which would assist considerably to bring about better feeling. The Government has decided to repeal some of these regulations, but to retain others, many of which, I think, it will be wise in the public interest to repeal. Some of these regulations appear to have been hurriedly framed, because of strong feeling existing between different sections. 27a-'and regulation 86 might be dealt with in much the same way-appear s to owe its origin to the existence of sectarian feeling. better if it had not been framed, because the Government has ample power, under the War Precautions Act, to deal with disloyal utterances, and to protect the interests of the nation. It would be a good thing for all of us if we could turn a deaf ear to much of what is being said. What we want at this period of crisis is harmony. The whole community should be doing its best to assist the Empire and its Allies in the struggle in which we are engaged. Were these regulations repealed, it would conciliate many who, though in favour of the vigorous prosecution of the war, are incensed by the belief that the regulations were imposed to strike at 'them. I hope that even now the Government will go further into the matter, and see if these regulations cannot he repealed. what any section is doing. It is one of This Government has certainly endeavoured to meet the position, and I should be pleased if I could say as much of the New* South Wales Government. At the Conference, its representatives promised to make arrangements for the re-registration of de-registered unions. That was to be done as early as possible. Therefore the State Parliament, which was in reces3, should have been convened at once to pass the necessary legislation. Mr Holman, however, had the matter referred to the Industrial Court, which was responsible for the de-registration. That Court had been originally moved to de-register the unions at the instigation of the Government, and, when applied to for permission to re-register, the Judge naturally felt that he could not stultify himself by reversing a decision which he had based on his interpretation of the law, and he declined to do what was asked. He pointed out that it was for the Government, not for a Court, to do what was deAfter having placed him in a very invidious position-becaus e I think he was perfectly right in the attitude that he took up-the New South Wales Government has now called the State Parliament together to consider the matter; but it proposes to discriminate between unions.

I have always been an opponent of militarism, and an opponent of war-, if it could be avoided.

I do not think that we can bring about peace at the present time, when the enemy is knocking at the door, in the . belief that he is sure of obtaining victory within a reasonable time. The mail news to hand in regard to the Western offensive tells ns that the Germans broke through the 5th Army and created a salient .which, if they had been able to widen it sufficiently, would have brought about the defeat of the French Army on the one side and the British Army on the other, putting an end to the war in a very few months. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the situation is critical. more critical than ever. critical every day. We must face the situation. We must devote the whole of our attention to doing all we possibly can to extricate the Empire from the position in which it finds itself.

The parents of our boys who are fighting are always asking when the next mail will be in from London, so that they can get the latest news of their sons, but in the case referred to by the honourable member delay occurs because of the route over which the mail is carried. That alteration has been brought about only recently. The claim is made that the postal revenue is increasing, or that it is much better than it was two years ago. Of course it is; it could not be otherwise. This increase has been brought about by reason of the fact that thousands of letters are posted every day for the boys at the Front, and thousands of parcels are mailed every week to the Forces overseas. Howmuch revenue does this bring into the Postal Department? As a matter of fact, the war has brought a large income to the Post Office. In these circumstances, why should country districts be deprived of postal facilities which until recently they have enjoyed ? It is our duty to give the fullest possible facilities to the people in country districts. In the case of sudden illness, if there is no telephone service there is no opportunity to communicate with a medical man 'who may reside 20 miles or 50 miles away, and very often if he can arrive within two or three hours there may be a possibility of a life being saved. The Department cannot be made self-supporting by depriving the country people of postal services which they have enjoyed for years past. I remember the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) speaking in tlie House when he was a supporter of the Labour Government. He said that, as far as he was concerned, he had made ample provision for his electorate, and that it was fully supplied with post-offices and telephone services from one end to the other. If his district is so well pro' that it shall not discontinue services which vided for, he should have some thought for other, constituencies. fore he became Postmaster-General. he was Minister at the time. good representative of his district he must have been.

I counsel the Government in tlie opposite direction. It is not my desire to create dissension between sections of the community, but I remind honourable.members that the regulations to which objection has been taken were introduced at a time of considerable excitement, in Melbourne at any rate. In consequence of certain things which had happened, ill-feeling was being engendered, badges which were disloyal in their significance were being worn openly iu the streets, and utterances which were hostile to Great Britain were being made in certain quarters. The regulations had the effect of preventing a continuance of those things. To-day it is not lawful for a person to wear any badge or fly any flag which is calculated to create disloyal sentiments in the community. If we are to win the war, one of the first essential's is that every true loyalist should feel that the Government are strong enough to maintain law and order against any set of disloyalists who may be in the community. That is all 1 have to say in regard to this matteT. In regard to postal facilities in country districts, of course, as a country member, I deplore the fact that facilities which have existed in many places for ""a considerable number of years are being discontinued. But it is futile to talk of carrying on the Post Office as a business proposition and at the same time claim are not paying. A business proposition demands that a concern shall be made to pay, and.

I turn now to another matter which has exercised my mind for a considerable time. In my opinion, it is a crime against our nation that we should permit persons of enemy nationality to occupy important positions in the Defence Department. the proper attitude for the Government to have adopted towards every German employed in this country was "" Your nation, has made Avar upon us; it has forced us into this conflict. While that condition exists it is not fit and proper that you, who are of enemy nationality, should be drawing money from the public Treasury."" Whatever may be said in that way of the Public Service generally applies with greater force to the Defence Department. For a period of nearly twelve months I have lieen in correspondence with that Department and the Prime Minister's Department in regard to this matter, and certainly some changes have been made. Some persons with, names which were particularly objectionable have been removed, but enough has not yet been done. In May last I called for a return of Germans employed by the Defence Department. That return was tabled about three weeks ago, and showed that there are still thirty-one Gerbeen living before the people of England mans in that Department, three of whom were born in Germany, whilst the others are Australian-born Germans of the firstgeneration. I hold the opinion that persons of British birth of the first generation, who hear from their parents of the glories of Old England, or Scotland, or Ireland are, as a rule, more loyal to those countries than were their parents, and I believe that the same sentiment operates in the case df children of German parentage. fathers and mothers speak of the traditions of Germany they must grow up with feelings of loyalty to the Fatherland of their parents, and 1 would deplore the fact if they did not. We have to remember what the Germans have proved themselves to be. I do uot think that if we searched the German army through and through we should find a Britisher in it ; certainly we could not No ; but the-more find one occupying a position of command. Germany boasts that she has spies in every land. President Wilson, of the United States of America, very recently made a declaration on this point, and pointed out that German spies are to be found in every branch of industry and also i u the Civil Service. Testimony comes from all quarters that of all nations Germany has the most perfect system of espionage. A man who is given a position in the Defeuce Department, if he happens to be ""When the war broke out more loyal to Germany than to Australia, has facilities for rendering service to Germany. I do not accuse the 25,000 Germans in Australia of beiug disloyal to the British Empire. Probably many of them are truly loyal to Great Britain, but in a military Department we should take no risks. Officers in that Department can obtain knowledge which would serve German interests, and I have been surprised in the correspondence I have had with the Defence Department to find that, in respect of every German mentioned, the authorities have replied that they have investigated the case of that man, and proved him to be loyal. No spy can be of any service to the nation that employs him unless he is a man able to hide his identity and purpose.' Secrecy is the essence of success in his occupation. Only in to-day's paper we read of the case in Great Britain of Sir Joseph Jonas, a Rhineland Prussian and an ex-Lord Mayor of Sheffield, whom our Sovereign had knighted. For many years he has as a loyal Britisher-loyal , of course, until he was found out. That is the danger. Every German in our Service to-day is a loyal man until he is found out. This ex-Lord Mayor of Sheffield has been found out, and is to be tried. His bail has been fixed at Â£.3,000.

We were satisfied that this man was not employed in the Defence Department, and allowed the matter to drop. the later return, to which I have referred, and which came to hand only three weeks ago, shows that Mr Ampt is employed in an advisory capacity by the Defence Department, although he has beeu loaned for some little time to another Department. It would appear that the position taken up by the Department is that this man occupies merely a consultative position. He is not actually engaged in departmental work; but he is certainly employed in a capacity that is a menace to us. When inquiry was made last February, the Department should have come out boldly with, a statement as to what this man was doing, rather than lead us as it did to suppose that he was no longer in the Service. He is still in the pay of the Department. I maintain that such a position is untenable, and that it is unwise in the extreme that it should be allowed to continue. In the interests of our Empire, and of the very life's blood of the 300,000 men and more whom we have sent to the Front, every German ought to he weeded out of the Defence Forces..

The menace is. a. double one when we allow such men to enlist under an assumed name, and so to hide their nationality. I do not know what this practice has led to on the field of battle.

Surelyi t is unwise to allow this sort of thing to be done. It is done, however, and done with the sanction of ithe Minister for Defence. There is a regulation which provides that no man shall change his name without the consent of the Minister.

I propose now to refer briefly .to the fixing of the price of meat. If the honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) and the honourable member for Calare( Mr Pigott) had not spoken on the subject yesterday, I should have had a good deal to say with regard to it ; but they have put the case so clearly that I shall not occupy the time of the Committee at any length in discussing it. Sufficei t to say that the question bristles with technicalities. It is difficult to arrive at any conclusion that would be satisfactory to all classes; but two_salient points in -conof a Gernexion with the problem are deserving of special attention. In the first place, I would remind honourable members of the 1 importance of .the primary ""producers to the welfare of the -community. The fact is that owing to certain conditions which .have been evolved the producers of meat large prices for their stores, and a regulation which is going to have the effect of largely reducing the selling value of fat cattle will very prejudicially affect them, and in many cases occasion them very serious loss. It is suggested that consumers are paying a high price for meat; but when we look into the question we discover that, whatever the price of the beast may be, the cost to the consumer is about 100 per ceut. more than what the producer receives. This means that between the time the beast leaves the hands of tlie actual producer and when it gets into the homes of the people for consumption, the beast has by some process or other practically doubled in value; and inquiry should have been made as to the possibility of reducing the intermediate cost. If some reduction could be made in intermediate charges, the people would get cheaper meat, and those engaged in the production of both cattle and sheep would not suffer materially. An announcement has been made by the Government that under certain conditions they propose to fix a cash price over the counter, approximate to the export value. Government? Individually there nounced ; but we know pretty well that it is to be something of that nature.

Apparently, the InterState Commission has not considered how the price to the public might be reduced by a judicious control of intermediate traders, because, had it done so, I am satisfied we should not have had the almost farcical, if not laughable, report placed before us. The idea of gentlemen such as those who constitute the InterState Commission-me n without anytechnical knowledge of cattle or sheep, who trust entirely to evidence submitted from day to day-presumin g to.suggest to the people of Australia that the price of meat can be reduced by fixing the price of meat,on the hoof!

The Commission say that this declaration must be made by an impartial expert, forgetting, apparently, that the only experts are those who have had a life-long experience in the cattle trade. These men pass their eye over a beast, and form a more or less accurate estimation as to what its dead weight will be; and I venture to say there are not half-a-dozen disinterested men in Australia competent to assess the value of a beast. cannot do it. mistakes. blamed for refusing to accept a stupid recommendation like that of the Commission. at any rate. At a time when we require nothing 'but what is practicable, no impracticable suggestions should be entertained; and the Government are much to be commended for refusing to attempt the impossible. A man in Sydney or Melbourne might be found to make this calculation; but we have to remember the thousands of markets all over Australia, and also the fact that it would be necessary to bring an expert 50 or 100 miles in some cases to value stock on the hoof. The Government are taking a very much wiser course. They suggest that the retail price is to be fixed at something or other, for cash, though what the scheme is as a whole has not yet been determined. Had the Government attempted to act on the recommendation of If the the Inter-State Commission, they would have been landed in a difficulty. A shortage would certainly have been created, and the price of meat, instead of being reduced, would have been further enhanced by the increased demand, while that spirit which is necessary to create The only increased production would have been killed. It is unnecessary for me to go into the technicalities of the inatter, in view of the splendid speech of thc honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) yesterday; but I must say that, in my judgment, whatever delay has taken place, the Government are perfectly justified in obtaining sound data, as against the unsound data in the Commission's report. I now wish to say a word or two in regard to the returned soldiers, whom we cannot honour too much. Unfortunately, a number of the friends of these men think that they can best show their regard by treating them. In Great Britain there is a no-"" shouting "" law, and no man there may pay for the drink of another. I would not suggest any invidious distinction between the soldier and the civilian; and I think that the bulk of thc people of Australia would The Government cannot be be prepared to impose upon themselves a self-denying ordinance, in order to save us from the distressing spectacle of wounded and maimed men going about our streets intoxicated.

During the absence of the Postmaster General( Mr Webster) from the chamber, representatives of country districts have been making severe remarks about his administration, and declaring'that the metropolitan areas are favoured as against the country districts. I do not think, that that charge is true, for there are many postal grievances that require setting right in the cities. For instance, in Sydney there was at one time a machine in operation for transmitting telegraph messages from the central office to a suburban oflice; but, on the advice of some one, two boys, with bicycles, were substituted to do this work. The route which the boys have to traverse is one of the steepest and most dangerous in all Australia, and though as yet no accident has happened, I am daily expecting to hear of one. Apart from that, however, if, while these boys are away, any urgent telegrams arrive, delivery is delayed for a considerable time. I never remember a Postmaster-General having so many shots fired at him as there have been fired at the honourable [222] gentleman to-day, and I never knew a Postmaster-General take so little notice of shots. Honourable members opposite have the matter in their own hands, for the Postmaster-General is virtually a servant of the party, and might be replaced at any time by the Caucusi f he gave any ground for dissatisfaction, just as any ordinary employee might be replaced. The attitude of his supporters towards him reminds me of some Chinese in Sydney, where there is a very nice joss-house. They appealed to the Joss for rain, and when it did not come they installed a new Joss, which, as rain fell soon afterwards, they retained, chopping up the old one. If honourable members opposite cannot get what they want from ""their present postal Joss, why do they not try another ? My view is that the Postmaster-General is as generous to the country as to the cities. Country members are always firing shots at him in Parliament, and I have done my best, by personal representations, to get certain results, though I have not succeeded. Some day the officials of the Department will find out that they have been making mistakes, and that what I have suggested is right. To come to another matter: About two years ago it was decided to strike and issue medals to the mothers and other relatives of our soldiers, a proposal which met with the approbation of Parliament and of the public. Those medals have not yet been issued. A very good design was. chosen, and tenders were called for, but the Department, although several firms of repute, possessing the necessary machinery and material, tendered, gave a contract to a man who styled himself an engineer, but had neither dies, machinery, nor material for making the medals. The matter having been brought under my notice, I made inquiries, and asked questions on the subject here, and had other questions asked in the Senate. "" From the answers it appeared that this engineer was fined Â£200 early in the war for trading with the enemy, and had broken the Wages Board regulations of Victoria. The Department consequently has to exercise a certain amount of supervision to prevent a further breach of the law in connection with the manufacture of these medals. I . think that when tenders are called, the Government should get what it wants from those who specialize,in the kind of work",50,Enlistment Of Men Of Enemy Origin

210,Mr West (East Sydney) [4.12],"(hat is to be done. For a supply of building stone the Government should go to the quarry masters, for jewellery they should go to a jewellery firm. They have not done that in this instance. When I asked why the medals had not been issued I learned that the necessary enamel is not obtainable. Now, at no time in our history has the encouragement of local industry been more important than at the present time. Enamel has been largely made in Germany, sent to England, and shipped thence to Australia; but a reputable firm in Sydney, which employs a specialist at high wages, makes an enamel which,' I am told-and my observation confirms the information-is in some of its colours even better than the imported article. Indeed, the firm contends that its enamels are second to none in the world, and will meet all requirements I wish once more to enter my protest The successful tenderer for the making of the medals to which I have referred cannot get all the material that he needs for their manufacture, and will not be able to get it, because those who should have been given the contract are holding it, needing it for their own work. It is the military officers who guide the Minister for Defence in matters like this, and I am beginning to think it would be far better if the business transactions of the Department were intrusted to civilians. The Department says that it will see that the wages conditions are observed in the carrying out of this contract, but had the work been given to persons who are specialists there would have been no reason to fear a breach of the law. The Government should see that the conditions of its various contracts are carried out in the spirit and to the letter, and, when conditions are not being fulfilled, the conwas given by preceding Governments. I tract should be broken. There have been plenty of opportunities for breaking this particular contract, but the Government seems to think the delay in the issue of the medals unimportant. At the next election, God help the Minister if the women of Australia get to know of this. Nothing annoys a woman more than to promise her something, and not to keep the promise. The Department wants waking up. I am a loyal Australian and a lover of the country, and for years past everything I have worn, from hats to boots, has been of Australian manufacture. The encouragement of Australian industries, both primary and secondary, is of the greatest importance, and a contract should not Sir. West. have been given to an American gentleman who had been found guilty of trading with the enemy, when the work could have been done by a firm which has spent hundreds of pounds in producing the enamel necessary to carry it out. A so called "" National"" Government should not do anything likely to lessen national feeling. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) may have no knowledge of this matter personally, but I hope it will be brought under his notice. I introduced a deputation on the subject to the Assistant Minister( Mr Wise), but nothing appeared in the newspapers about it. The jewellery industry is one which should employ a great many persons. It is light work, and would give employment to women as well as to men. against the manner in which the Estimates are dealt with in this Parliament by successive Governments. Here we are discussing Estimates when half the members of the House have gone away to their homes, though it is the only chance that is presented for bringing really vital matters before the Government and the country. It is just about time this system was entirely remodelled and honourable members were given the fullest opportunity of dealing with important matters which they wish to bring under the notice of the Government, without having to wait until the expiring hours of the session to do so. My remarks do not apply to the present Government more than they do to the Governments which have preceded them. I think that Ministers on this occasion have allowed more time for the discussion of the Estimates than remember that a Labour Government "" bullocked "" the whole of the Estimates through the Committee in one night. Estimates every time a Supply Bill is before us? Supply Bill comes forward it is the opportunity for a free-and-easy discussion, and nothing comes out of it. I hope that honourable members will insist upon opportunity being given to discuss the Estimates before we are met with the taunt that it is useless to discuss the items upon them because the money provided, or, at any rate, most of it, has already been spent.""",51,Enlistment Of Men Of Enemy Origin

Every other problem will be child's play to them compared with this. Take the difference between Queensland and Tasmania. fattened naturally in winter, but in Tasmania that cannot be done, except by means of artificial feeding. If a Tasmanian grazier wishes to fatten sheep for the market he must commenceoperations at least twelve months ahead. He must plough his ground and cultivate it , and sow rape or artificial grass for the purpose of feeding his sheep during the winter, and it is fully twelve months before the beast is ready to go on the market. Compare these conditions with those which prevail in Queensland, where the climate is such that stock can be fattened during the winter on natural grasses in the open without costing the grazier ls. One of the best experts dealing with stock in Tasmania, a man who has spent the whole of his life in dealing in sheet. But until we can get out of the stock, has told me that it would cost about Â£7 per beast to move cattle from Queensland to Tasmania, when the freight and loss in weight are taken into account. I remember coming down the coast of Western Australia on a steamer which was conveying 178 head of cattle from Wyndham to Fremantle. No less than forty-seven of the cattle died during the voyage, and had to be thrown overboard. Such losses as these will make the task of the Government extremely difficult. It is an unquestionable fact that the price of meat is too high. I know that it is sold in Melbourne' at a price which is altogether out of proportion to the return secured by the producer. I agree with those honourable members who say that it will be utterly impossible to fix the price of meat on the hoof. But if it were possible to do so, how would it give relief to the consumer, in face of the enormous leakage that takes place between the time when the animal is sold under the hammer and the time when the meat is sold over the block? The only way in which the consumer 'could obtain any benefit would be by fixing retail prices over the counter, but I venture to say that if that were done the system would break down, because the prices would have to be altered so continuously, and because the enormous variations in the climatic [222]a conditions of the different States render it almost impossible to arrive at anything like parity. member believe in fixing the price of the live animal by weight!

The system which the Postmaster General has adopted is absolutely rotten. He is no more entitled to make the disposal of the postal facilities in the back blocks of Australia the subject of his balance-sheet than a Treasurer would be in making the educational system, the police force establishment, or the Judiciary subject to the national balanceofficial mind-and the Ministerial mindthe idea that this is the policy which Bhould be pursued, there will always be the complaints which honourable members are voicing to-day.

We hear great talk of what America is doing in shipbuilding, but Great Britain to the end of April had built as much shipping as the rest of the world, including America. I repeat that the one country that has done nothing in ship construction is Australia. We must all take our share of the responsibility for that. It will stand io the discredit of this Parliament that when the people of England were short of food, although we had several of the best timbers in the world, and although hundreds of men were prepared to enter into the shipbuilding business, we have done nothing.

It cannot be pretended, however, that he represents the public of Australia, or that he has had any experience of mercantile shipping or of the trade between the States. It is impossible for a Board such as this to continue if this Parliament is to have any control over these matters. I have suggested to the Minister that a workable Board would be one consisting of Admiral Clarkson, as chairman, four shipping men, and four members of this Housetwo from each side, representing the trading and the consuming public.

These are the men who are to regulate fares and conditions. made before the Board .was appointed. the least affect my argument. The very people to whom we should have to apply, tb settle a dispute in this regard are the members of tiie Board who, before their appointment, made this increase. Then, again, take the increase in the freight on timber. I have shown that there has been an increase of, roughly, 60 per oent. in the freight on coal between Newcastle and Melbourne, and I have here a telegram, which I shall hand to the Minister, showing that the freight on timber from Hobart to Melbourne and Sydney before the war was 3s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, whereas it is to-day 4s. per 100 super, feet. under a War Precautions Act regulation, which permits of an increase of 10 per cent. ther the increase in the freights on timber from Hobart to the Minister's own State, South Australia, comes within that regulation. As a matter of fact, before the war freight on timber from Hobart to Adelaide was 3s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, and occasionally 4s. per 100 super, feet. It is now 6sl And so with fares. Under our mail contract the contracting shipping companies were not allowed to increase fares as between Australia and Tasmania, and the eastern States and Western Australia. They have not increased the fares, but they have abolished return tickets, and now compel passengers to take out single tickets. In this way they have increased the cost of travelling. finance."" would call it by another name. have taken the same action with regard cases the companies that are represented to Inter-State tickets. while passengers are required to take out watch-dogs of the people? single tickets, no increased cost is involved. Two single tickets are supplied for the price formerly charged for a reto some of my honourable friends opposite turn ticket. seems to think that all services can be bitterly that the price of milk had been run for nothing. am not questioning the service. I am simply pointing out that the Government have placed the whole of the Inter-State shipping trade of Australia in the hands of a Board, consisting, 'with the exception of its Chairman, solely of representatives of the shipping companies. If there was a case in dispute in regard to any shipping matter, to appeal to this Board would be very like going to law with his Satanic Majesty, and holding the Court in Hades. The Act providing for the creation of this Board declares that no increase in excess of 10 per cent, shall be made without the consent of the Prime Minister. If the shipping companies wish to increase their rates beyond 10 per cent, they apply for permission to the Prime Minister, and the only men to whom he can go for information on the one side are the representatives of the companies, who are in reality the Board. Whetheri t be the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) or the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) that is appealed to, he cannot have time to deal with such a matter. He has so much to attend to that it is impossible for him to go into any question of disputed shipping rates. In such a case the complaint would have to be handed over to another authority, and the whole of the evidence would come from the companies of which the members of this Board are managers. I do not wish to say anything harsh concerning these companies; but I certainly think they have had an exceedingly good innings' in the Australian coastal trade. As the result of the increase in coal freights, as between Newcastle and Melbourne, from 5s. 6d. to 8s. 5d. per ton, we find that within 50 yards of this.building, third-rate coal is being supplied at 34s. per ton, and in the suburbs up to 42s. the price of coal on the Board are the suppliers.

It seems to me that honourable members of the Labour party believe that all reductions in prices should be borne by the producer. They demand that the producer shall pay the highest price for everything he requires, and be content to receive the lowest price for everything he sells. Surely that is not equitable. Returning to the question of shipping, I propose to give some figures showing the profits that Inter-State shipping companies are making. I read a few days, ago that a vessel loaded 4,400 tons of coal at Newcastle in ten hours by the use of four electrically-controlled cranes. Melbourne she discharged the same quantity, and got away in four days. The increased time occupied in discharging here was due, not so much to any fault on the part of the workers, but to the fact that on the wharfs of Melbourne today they are using the same old whip and basket that was employed fifty years ago. I have seen coal being discharged from a ship here in such a way that a party of schoolboys would have pelted it out almost as quickly. Until the recent strike, wharf labourers engaged in discharging coal worked only six and a half hours out of the twenty-four. able member think that six and a half hours is long enough to work when discharging coal? gesting that it is not. I am only pointing out that, prior to the strike, the wharf labourers would work only one shift a day, with the result that for the remainder of the twenty-four hours the ship and its officers and crew were idle, and costs were thus increased. They are now working a second shift. It would take a vessel about three days, steaming 10 knots an hour, to come from Newcastle to Melbourne, and she would go back in the same time. Assuming that she loads 4,400 tons in a day at Newcastle, and discharges here in four days, her earnings in that period, allowing 2s. for loading and discharging, and about ls. for wharfage dues, would be roughly Â£1,200; whereas, according to figures I have obtained from the very best 'authoi'ity, the wages paid for officers and crew on a vessel of that tonnage would be exactly Â£472 15s. per month. office work? the wages of the whole ship's crew. .

Her return freights will be greater, and she will make two trips in the twelve months. On her return trip she will earn Â£15,000, or Â£30,000 on the two trips inwards, while she will earn Â£20,000 on her two outward trips, making Â£50,000 in all, whereas before the war she was not earning a quarter of that in the time, and were it not for the war, she would not be worth a quarter of the money.

The last Commonwealth steamer leaving Australia took over 8,000 tons of wheat at 5s. per bushel, earning, roughly, Â£80,000 cash for her freight. That is the freight we are charging; and the British Government is paying millions in order that her people may get the loaf at something like a reasonable price. It is a disgrace to us that this question of freights has not been considered. I do not desire to see the Commonwealth fleet paying for itself in two years, at the price of starving the people in England. Ministers boast of what our ships are earning. From whom do the earnings come? From the Mother Country-fro m the poor of England. We may do without most of our luxuries, but people cannot do without bread. If the British and American Governments will not take the lead, then, for God's sake, let Mr Hughes, when in England, see what can be done.

There is not one item showing an increase since the Board has been formed. comparison between the rates prevailing prior to the war and those which have been imposed since the war began. the fact that if the surplus profits are going into the Consolidated Revenuei t is time the Government, and the people responsible, should bring about a radical alteration: I do not desire to have the people paying extra freights any more than I desire to see them being exploited by the meat profiteers. I am very dubious as to the value of the proposed scheme for fixing the price of meat. My view is that we cannot fix the price in a way which will benefit the public generally unless we take control over the businesses affected. If we propose to give the public the benefit' of cheap meat by fixing the price on a fair basis, it will call for so much investigation in regard to the. various companies and individuals concerned, and the addition of such a large army of officials to the already existing great army of Commonwealth servants, that I cannot see the difference between adopting that course and going the whole hog-takin g f u l l control. To get an effective system of price-fixing w ill practically mean taking f u l l control, but I do not think that the interests represented by honourable members who sit behind the Governmen would permit such a system to be inaugurated. If they would do so, the method proposed would prove to be so little different from actually controlling the whole industry that we might as well go the whole hog. The honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer), in his remarks concerning the I employment of the descendants of alienenemies in the Defence Department, wasreally reflecting upon His Majesty the' K i ng and the Royal Family. The honorI f , as able member, said that he could not trust people of German extraction. He said that there was something in the blood in their veins which prevented him from reposing any trust in them. I am reminded of an incident that occurred the other day. A friend of mine was having a drink with another man, and he said, "" To hell with the Kaiser!"" The other man said, "" He a r , hear!"" to that, but when/my friend added, ""and all his relations "" he objected strenuously. When the honourable member said that people whose forefathers might have been GermansM y figures gave a many generations ago could not be trusted, he was reflecting on H is Britannic Majesty, and also on Lord Milner, a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, beI t does not alter cause, on-page 91, of Stead's War Facts, I find the followingAccording to the British law, that is to say, jus soli, he wonld be so regarded, as he was born in Bonn, in Germany. According to German or French law, that is to say, jus sanguinis, he would be regarded as an Englishman, for his father was British in the eyes of that law-although , according to English law, he, too, was a German. Lord Milner's grandfather, an Englishman, settled in Germany and married a German lady. They had a son, Charles Milner, who went to London, where he practised as a physician. Later he returned to Germany and became reader in English at Tubingen University. He married a daughter of Major-General Eeady, at one time Governor of the Isle of Man. Their son Alfred, now Lord Milner, was born on 23rd March, 1354, at Bonn, on the Rhine. He was educated at Tubingen, but later went to King's College, London, and then to Balliol College, Oxford. He was assistant editor of Pall Hall Gazette, under W. T. Stead. Then he became private secretary to Mr Goschen, when the latter was Chancellor of the Exchequer. He spent four years in Egypt as Under-Secretary of Finance, under Lord Cromer. On his return to England he was made Chairman of the Board of Inland. Revenue. He went to Africa as High Commissioner and Governor of Cape Colony in 1897, and remained there as High Commissioner and Administrator of the conquered Transvaal and Orange Free States until he retired in 1905. Since that time he has held no public office. The matter of nationality should be determined according to an individual's actions.

It is a very temperatelywritten article, and, although I do not endorse the views expressed, it deals with the matter from a very reasonable and sane stand-point, and honourable members would do better to study it than to persist in attempting to persuade the people that those who urge that peace should be considered from the most favorable stand-point at all times, are working in the interests of Germany. The article statess Yet Bolshevikism, riddled though it is with inconsistency, has a unity of its own, and the inner forces that conies from unity; and with that force it may yet make much history in Europe.

It is the emotion expressed in the simple battle-cry which to-day, as when Marx penned it seventy years ago, can set the an article in the Nineteenth waves of passion surging, at moments of crisis dealing with the espionage and suffering, in any crowded concourse of wage earners: The writer of the ""Workers of the world, unite!

The aspirations of the Russian peqple to establish a democratic form of organization, and to achieve the same freedom as we enjoy in Australia, were thwarted by the Czar, and in the end they destroyed him and his Government. member forget that the British Government recognised the first revolution as justified ? soon as the Kerensky Administration, known as the Provisional Government, was established, and stated its intention to continue the war, the British and other Allied Governments recognised it . But as soon as that Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviki, and the vested interests of the Allied Powers were menaced owing to the repudiation of the debts incurred, not by the Russian people in their struggle for freedom but by the Russian Czar, in order to enable him to engage in war and hold down his own people, the Allied Governments no longer recognised the revolution. But the chief cause of the Allies' hostility to the Bolsheviki was that the new system of society introduced by them meant the termina1 tion of the capitalistic system. It meant that a new form of society would emerge from the war, and that not only political, but also industrial freedom, was to be born of the sufferings and trials of the Russian people, and the massacre of their sons in this international war. What is happening to-day? I said on a previous occasion that ultimately it will be found that the doctrines of the Bolsheviki would not be confined to Russia, but would cross the frontiers of Italy, France, Germany, and Austria. To-day the cables tell us that Austria is rendered impotent for an offensive against Italy because of the internal unrest. Austrian prisoners, who have returned to their country from Russia, have been interned because they are infected with the doctrines of the Bol-' sheviki. Men are being shot in Germany because they are trying to overthrow the autocracv of Germany as the autocracy of Russia was overthrown. many, and we will forgive you a lot. able member will be here when it does take place. I hope that, when the revolution spreads from Russia to Austria and Germany, he will be here to endorse a reconstitution of society in accordance with the principles enunciated by the very people who will -have brought about in those places what, from his point of view, is so desirable an effect. I do not suggest that the reconstitution of society should necessarily be brought about by the same means; but I should like to see the accomplishment of the same objective in not only Continental countries, but every part of the world. It would then be impossible for dynastic ambitions, or the-struggle between conflicting groups of commercialized countries, to bring their working men and women into conflict one with the other. ber would not expect the honourable member for Kooyong (' Sir Robert Best) to become so civilized as to approve of that. had I been reared in the same environment-ha d I imbibed the same views that he and others like him haveI would most likely have to-day the same mental outlook. I find fault with no one for the views he holds; but I do find fault with those who attribute to me anti-British motives when I urge that the interests of the workers of, not only the Empire, but of every country where they are engaged in producing surplus profits, do not lie in fighting one another, and that any system that makes for war should be put an end to. one has found fault with the honourable member for holding such an opinion. to remarks made by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Sinclair), and to his attempt to connect, at all events, some honourable members on this side with the views expressed in the article from which he quoted. My main object in speaking as T have is to show that our wars with Spain, with the Dutch, and with France-wha t are termed wars for colonial expansion, which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries-were largely the result of conflicts between trading companies.

367,Mr Considine,"My allusion wasbetween the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company-bot h trading concerns. Disputes' arose again over the Mississippi, and the rights of various trapping companies in Canada; while in regard to India proper conflict occurred over the rights of the British Chartered Company and the French company in opposition to it. We all know the story of Olive's conquest. ber has some nasty information. point out that the wars of those days arose from conflicts between trading companies, whereas our war to-day is caused by a totally different set of conditions. wars? suing this line of thought, we find that after the French Revolution Europe was devastated by war from 1805 to 1875. It was convulsed by wars in 1859, 1864, 1866, 1870-1, and there was also the American Civil War of 1860-64. While the commercial future of Continental countries was 'being interfered with by these devastating wars, industry in Great Britain flourished, because after the battle of Trafalgar Britain held the supremacy of the sea. was not a good thing. If the honourable member follows my line of argument he will recognise that during all these years until the Crimean war took place Britain enjoyed an era of prosperity and peace. During this period we had the Liberal party in power with their slogan of ""Peace, retrenchment, and reform."" After the Crimean war a complete change took place in the methods of fighting, or rather in the nature of the armaments used. Until then wooden ships had been used in war, but in OUT contest with Russia it was found that wooden ships could not withstand the fire of the Sebastopol and other forts. The American Civil War disclosed the same fact. The Alabama was brought into existence, and ironclads began to supersede the wooden ships, which until then had been used. A. new departure then took place in manufactures. The development of the textile industry in Great Britain necessitated the employment of more machinery, and this in turn necessitated improved methods of transport in England. Owing to the inventions of Stephenson and Watt, translated into the s'team engine and the railway system, there arose a demand for steel to build our railways, and to make machinery for our expanding industries. In this way huge steel manufactories were brought' into existence. The developments of industry involving the use of much machinery resulted in the establishment of great steel manufactories such ias those of Vickers Limited, Cammel's, Baird's, Schneider's, Krupp's, Skoda's, and the Bethlehem Steel Corporation of America. Every one of those owed their origin as steel manufacturers to the requirements of peaceful pursuits. They were engaged in the manufacture of steel rails, machinery, and so forth. But, with the development that took place in armament and the building of ironclads, these enterprises were converted into armament manufactories. They devoted their factories to the building of battle-ships, cruisers, big guns, and small arms. The American Civil War led Hotchkiss and Company, and all such firms that were previously manufacturing sewing machines and agricultural implements, to convert their establishments into factories for the making of small arms, just as similar works in Britain"" and on the Continent' have been converted into munition factories during the present war. In the course of time an international armament ring was formed. Japanese, American, German, Russian, French, and British armament manufacturers formed an armament trust. And what policy did they pursue? They appointed to their Boards of Directors Tetired British Admirals and other men of influence in other countries, so that they should have ready access to Ministers and heads of Departments They knew that in this way they would be able to facilitate the granting of contracts. These factories which had their origin in peaceful pursuits became then one of the immediate causes leading up to the war, for armaments, like wool and meat, are produced for profit. Scare articles were written in the German newspapers, and Germans subsidized French newspapers to make attacks on Germany, so that Krupp and Company would secure contracts; all this was exposed by Liebknecht in the Reichstag, and by Ramsay",66,Enlistment Of Men Of Enemy Origin

373,Mr Considine,"I do not say i tMacdonald in the House of Commons, before the war. Ramsay Macdonald dealt with the international ring, and pointed out the dangers of it. Justbefore the war he asked in the House of Commons where the next war was going to take place, being led to put that question by the activity that was being displayed in. armament manufactories. Let me show now how modern armaments affect the peace of the world to-day. Among the essentials of the equipments of modern warfare are steel, copper, manganese, cotton, oil, and rubber. Combinations of powers that build up huge armaments-that go in for defensive, naval, and military works-if they have not within their own territory oil deposits, deposits of iron, copper, and manganese, and also cotton growing country, must "" seek to gain such country. Any power that occupies country producing all these commodities has necessarily an advantage over a nation that does not. quently modern armaments play an important part in war making. The nations struggle to obtain, either by actual annexation or by bringing within their sphere of influence, countries where these essentials are produced. What, may I ask, was the trouble in Morocco which brought France and Germany to the verge of war? The origin of the trouble was a quarrel between Schneider and Company, a French firm, and Krupp's, in regard to mineral deposits in Morocco. Both companies were backed up by the nations to which they belonged, and in connection with that incident the verge of war was reached. Then there is the Persian Oil Company. Why is it that we insist on Mesopotamia being under British influence, and occupied by British troops? son, but the presence of oil deposits in the vicinity has something to do with it. The Navy to-day is in need of oil. right. ing to point out that the modern development of armaments has made it essential that each group of Powers should have within its control country which produces the essentials of modern armaments. The Powers try by secret diplomacy, and by other means, to secure this, knowing that if they succeed they will take from their opponents an important weapon. Take Alsace-Lorraine for instance-'Sitting suspended from 6.30 to p.m. dinner I was pointing out that the controversy between France and Germany over Alsace-Lorraine is not so much concerned with the population of these countries as with the large iron and coal deposits there found. In this connection, I shall quote from an article that appeared in the Age of the 4th May lastPeace and Iron must be Combined. At a festival conference of the combined iron and steel industries of the German Empire, held in Berlin, and attended by the leading representatives of the mining and smelting concerns in Westphalia, Lorraine, and Silesia, Dr. Reichert, chairman of the various indusConsetries, addressed the gathering on Ore and Iron in Germany's future. He said. . . . ' . "" Since the outbreak of war we have known how to appreciate the fact that in time of peace we were able to conquor the world's market. The iron industrialists of England, France, Italy, and Russia combined had been unable in this war to produce more iron than Germany alone. At first we thought it a danger that our greatest iron region lay so close tb the frontier. Had Lorraine been lost to us-the German ore land-w e would not have been able to produce more than a quarter of the iron and steel produced in peace, or have been unable to supply our army and navy."" Dr. Reichert added that in the heavy Flanders battles more iron was used in a few hours than in the entire Franco-German war. "" An industry which employs 2,000,000 men and gives bread to 8,000,000 of the German population must be placed in a secure position, and have a foundation on which it can build a future. The extension of our frontier, necessary for securing our industrial future, must not be spoken of as annexation. Only narrow strips of frontier are in question, and these may be won in the shape of rectifications of frontiers."" As I previously pointed out, the minerals and other products that are essential to the conduct of modern warfare have become one of the main cause9 of international conflict. Lands which yield coal, cotton, rubber, iron, manganese, and other essentials in the production of explosives, guns, battleships, and so forth, and which are outside the jurisdiction of any particular power, are made the subject of secret diplomacy. This causes friction, and eventually ends",67,Enlistment Of Men Of Enemy Origin

From the time of the Crimean war to the present, fhe steel manufacturing establishments, which were originally established for the purpose of providing steel rails when the railway system was introduced, and heavy machinery for use in coal mines when coal replaced water as a power-producing agency, have been transformed into huge establishments for the creation of machines intended for the slaughter of the human race.

Realizing that the inevitable war would strip Italy of her men, they broke all Italian industrial precedents and hired women workers. During""the ten months that Italy was neutral the Ansaldo works built more than 1,000 guns of all kinds and laid down and partly completed a small fleet of warships. Most important of all, they pointed out to the Government that, whatever contingency might arise, Italy had one industrial asset to hurl into the breach. When Italy did declare for honour the Ansaldo organization was placed unreservedly at the disposal of the Government. Armaments, like other commodities, are' the author whom the honourable member produced for profit, and those producing quoted on the economic interpretation of them have an interest in .subsidizing history. newspapers to stir up national strife. Thus the German Government subsidized French newspapers to attack Germany for the purpose of giving an opportunity to German armament agents iu the Reichstag, to quote these newspapers, as an argument for further naval and military expenditure, with the inevitable contracts for ammunition firms such as Krupp's. The same game was. played in Japan, where huge bribes were offered in connection with contracts of the kind, and it is clear that those interested in producing armaments, naval or military, are naturally interested in creating strife between nations.

On the 8th May, the preceding month, he had sent this communicationIt is incontestable that during the last fewthe various countries were facing inevitmonths the French nation has become more Chauvinistic and more confident in itself. The same men, instructed and competent, who, two years ago, showed lively anxiety at the mere mention of possible difficulties between France and Germany, have changed their tone. They now say they arc certain of victory. They dwell largely on the progress, which is truly very real, accomplished in the Army of the Republic, and contend that they could at least hold in check the German Army sufficiently long to enable Russia to mobilize, to concentrate her troops, and to fling herself upon her western neighbour. One of the most dangerous elements in the situation is the re-' enactment, in France of the Three Years Law: It was imposed light-heartedly by the militarist party, and the country cannot sustain it.

My object has been to show that, months before this calamity overtook humanity, there were persons who were anxious to protect themselves, and to prevent the slaughter that has ensued. I . do not doubt that the French correspondence referred to may show that the same sort of thing was taking place on the other side. My contention is that the secret diplomacy of both sides brought about the war, or was one of the principal causes of it. Each group of Powers was afraid of the other. This engendered hatred and suspicion. Then there was the commercial competition, the desire to acquire territories producing the requirements of modern warfare, and the intriguing and diplomatic interchanges which this occasioned resulted in the expansion of armaments. The arming of Europe had become a thing of such magnitude that able bankruptcy. The breaking point must have come. I do not minimize or apologize for German militarism, which is the most brutal manifestation of militarism that the world has seen. the honourable member, Germany would have been in England before this. to make an' interjection of that character, but the interjection does not throw light on the situation; it merely manifests a spirit of spitefulness, which is not creditable to the Minister. My opinion is that the present constitution of society breeds ""the conditions which make war inevitable. Secret diplomacy, and the hatreds engendered by modern industrial conditions foster militarism in every country. tion. The war is upon us; what are we to do? tions the honourable member can answer for himself when I have finished my speech. Militarism will always breed the brutality and cruelty which characterizes German militarism. It is because it has not been known to the British people until lately, that we have not developed the same system that they have on the Continent. The Dreyfus case, in France was a manifestation of militarism as bad as anything in Germany. Here in Australia we have had a similar manifestation in connection with child conscription, and the callousness of military officials in their bearing towards the civilians. It is because militarism has not taken root in British countries hitherto that it has not borne with us the* fruit it has borne on the Continent. Let the war be brought to a conclusion, and Germany be defeated, and what will happen ? We shall hear again of the balance of power-that great fetish of European government. We shall be told that to maintain it there must be a new arrangement of the nations, and to prevent any Power from becoming a menace to the world we shall be asked to accept conscription, and to build up fresh armaments.",70,German Ironmasters Ambitions French Lorraine Must Be Annexed

Honourable members may know the story of the young nigger who was brought before a magistrate for throwing a brick at another boy. When asked why he had done this, he said that he had been called a black rascal. "" But,"" said the magistrate, "" surely you are one?"" "" Yes,"" he answered, "" I may be; but suppose he called you a black rascal?"" "" O h , "" said the magistrate, "" I am not one."" "" No,"" replied the young nigger, after a moment's hesitation, "" perhaps you are not; but suppose he called you the sort of rascal that you are, what would you do then?"" British militarism may not be the "" black "" rascal, but in all countries militarism is a rascal, and when it has taken hold of the people it becomes a "" black "" rascal. We may not have the brutal and vicious militarism of Germany, but everywhere when militarism is given time for development, and the minds of the people are suitably moulded, it becomes as brutal and as obnoxious to those who suffer under it. the German militarism to begin with. to do that if you were not engaged in producing militarism here; in moulding the minds of the people on military lines, and in abusing the Defence Act to brutalize youngsters by putting them into gaols for failure to attend drills, and punishing their parents as well. honourable member belongs has always claimed all the credit for our compulsory military service law. credit for it. I am sorry if this pafty has been associated with the penalizing of parents and the punishing of young-' sters by imprisonment in forts. When the separation of Sweden and Norway took place, it was expected that there would be war between the two countries, and their respective armies were marched to their borders. working men and women, through their trade unions and political organizations, raised such an agitation that when the conflicting armies marched to the frontiers there marched with the soldiers mothers carrying their babies in their arms. The women appealed to one another and to the men, and asked that their flag should not be stained with the blood of one another. They held up their babies, and asked the soldiers not to fire. The result was that the Norwegians and the Swedes fraternized, and there was no conflict. These people did not have flying over them the flag of any country that would ask them to shed their blood, or create widows and orphans or cripples because there was a desire on the part of some of them to separate from the others. But over them floated the red flag of international brotherhood have been asking myself whether it is the desire of the honourable member to prove that in this terrible crisis-the most terrible in our history-ou r attitude is right or wrong, or whether he"" is' with us or against us. He has told us a long tale of the horrors of militarism; but we are in this war, and how are we going to get out of it? .Not with speeches of tiie kind that the honourable member has delivered, nor with the help of men like him. The question that every one should ask himself is: Are we justified in the action we have taken; should we have sent our boys to the Front; and, having sent them there, should we support them ? History, as I have read it , ' has proved quite clearly that the word of Germany cannot be taken in one single respect. She guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium, and she agreed to abide by the decisions of the Hague Conference, but has she kept her word in regard to either matter ? So far as Germany's conduct of 'the war has been revealed to us it is not"" civilization, not even barbarism, but Hell itself. Has there been any act too vile or atrocity too bestial for the German hordes ? Yet we have the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) trying to raise doubts in the minds of the people as to whether we are right or wrong in our attitude towards the war.

If we cannot keep our boys at the Front supplied with reinforcements within the next few months, I am going to do my best to force this Parliament back to the country, so that the people may decide whether they will have a Ministry in office with the power that they think is absolutely necessary for the protection of this country, or whether they will place the conduct ""of affairs in the hands of honourable members opposite. If we had submitted that question to the people, they would .have given a very different answer to the one they gave last year in connection with the conscription referendum. The hour is late, and I have promised the Acting Prime Minister that I will speak for a very short time only in order that other honourable members may be enabled to speak: before the, conclusion of the debate. It is a pity, in dealing with the Estimates, that ""the whole of the financial position of the country, especially at a time like this', when our obligations are so.enormous, cannot receive the proper consideration that should be given to it. We are in a""bad way at the present time. Certainly we have not been short of money, but we have been going to the Old Country for loans. We are able to produce so much in Australia, yet we have to go cap in hand to the Old Country, which has done so much in connection with the financing of the war, in order to borrow money for the purpose of carrying out public works. I am sorry that the last Loan Bill did not include 1 a provision which is. to be found in a New Zealand Act, namely, that every person with an income of Â£700I would mate it Â£300 here-wh o dees not contribute to the war loans is compelled, through the Commissioner of Taxation, to lend in his just proportion. Australia should be compelled to finance its own requirements. There is something contemptible in having to go to Great Britain for money at the present time. Our obligations will be enormous. We will require jnoney for war pensions, and for repatriation, and I assume that large public works will have to be commenced in order to absorb our men temporarily when they return. Enormous sums of money will be required, but I hope, that wei shall be able to finance ourselves, and at the same time exercise economy in"" connection with our public works. I have heard Ministers boast of what Australia has done, but it makes me ashamed to sit behind thero, because we find that we have not sent one bit of war material to the Old Country. We are not even manufacturing the shells or the rifles Which our boys are using at the Front. The wealth of Australia is due entirely to its primary industries-agriculture , grazing, mining, and timber. These are the great industries that have made the country as prosperous as it is to-day. Rarely do we find any mention in a Tedr-Booh of the export of any of the products of our secondary industries. The curse of Australia is the abnormal growth of the big capital cities, caused wholly by the consideration that is extended to our secondary industries, and creating political influences which are a menace to our primary industries and to our future. People are drawn from the-country to the city, to the great detriment of the primary industries. when the primary producer has often to suspend operations for six months in the year because he cannot get roads over which to cart his produce. address myself to the need for developing the primary industries, but my promise to curtail my remarks will allow me to only do this briefly. It may be a subject of interest to the Postmaster General( Mr Webster), who has done so little to induce a single man to go out into the back country. A penny stamp should enable a letter to be sent to any part of Australia, but we find that the man who dares to take up the responsibilities attached to the development of the resources of the country is asked to pay so much each year for tiie privilege of having a letter delivered to him.",72,German Ironmasters Ambitions French Lorraine Must Be Annexed

413,Mr Gregory,"It was my desire toDealing with the Government's proposal to fix the price of meat, history has shown us the result of price fixing when applied in the early days, and I think that the policy as now carried on is a grave mistake. compelled to adopt that policy because of the war. progress one may he compelled to do things that would not be attempted in normal times, and, perhaps, it is wise to take action in many directions, more especially when we find people, joining together and endeavouring to reap an advantage from the fact that there is a war in progress, as we find profiteers -doing in many instances to-day. For that reason I quite agree that action must be taken in many directions, but the question is how best it can be done. I am quite satisfied that the enormous prices of meat to-day aTe not due to the pastoralists or graziers. I believe that they have been brought about by a combination, and by reason of the existence of the wretched regulations which control trade in Australia to-day. There are too many regulations governing the handling of all goods. We have factory laws, and industrial laws, which occasion expenditure in all directions. It is the trivial regulations that have to be observed, which considerably, add to the cost of living. A little while ago an application was made to .the Federal Arbitration Court for an award in connection with the"" Wharf Labourers Union, and a large number of people had to come from Western Australia to attend the Court. They came to Melbourne early in March, and it is only within the last few days that an award has been given, and they have been able to return to their State. Parties had to attend the Court from all the States, accompanied by solicitors and barristers, and so on. I .suppose that the cost of those proceedings would amount to nothing less than Â£15,000. Some one has to pay for it. It is the general public who will have to pay in the long run. I believe that there are many combinations in connection with various businesses. One of the first actions of a Government should be to make any combination in restraint of trade absolutely illegal. tempt to fix a price other than that which is fixed by law, whether it be among grocers, or butchers, or in any other line of trade, should be made the subject of a criminal charge, for which the penalty should be imprisonment. If meat is bought wholesale at 6d., and retailed at ls. or ls 3d. per lb., the difference is not going into the hands of the grazier or small farmer. But I am afraid in our attempts to regulate this matter we may do an injury to agriculture, and I refer more particularly to the mixed f armer, who is the man who makes the greatest success at agriculture. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. I have no desire to make offensive reference to the gentlemen who comprise the Inter-State Commission, but a perusal of their reports show that they have been anything but practical in the manner in which they have dealt with the meat question. They started off on wrong premises. They strive to show that although there was a very bad drought in Australia.in 1914, the flocks and herds are now^equal to what they were in 1913. A glance at the statistics in Knibbs will show the number, of sheep and cattle we had in Australia in 1911, the year which preceded the worse year' we had in Australia so far as our flocks and herds were concerned. In 1911, which was"" our best year in this regard, we had 345,000 more cattle, and 8,000,000 more sheep than in 1913, the year upon which they based all their calculations in regard to the stock-carrying capacity of Australia. IE was on the figures, for that year that they were trying to show that although Australia suffered a serious drought in 1914, it had made good since owing to the intervening good seasons. According to Knibbs there were in 1911, in the four States dealt ""with by the Commission, 10,298,000 cattle, and in 1917, 8,995,000 cattle, or a reduction of 1,303,000. Of sheep there were in 1911, 85,000,000, and in 1917, 69,000,000, showing a decrease of 16,000,000 sheep. Isi t fair in'those circumstances for the Commission to base its arguments on the figures for 1913? As an instance of how unpractical the members of the Commission are, they reported that in three States the limit of safe grazing has now practically been reached.

There are a number of other matters upon which I desired to speak, but I have promised to make my remarks as brief as possible. Probably the Estimates will be passed to-night, and they include provision for some very large public works. There is page after page of details in re. gard to wages and other small amounts, but at the end of the Estimates we find one item for Â£200,000 in connection with the Naval and Defence Departments, and not the slightest information is given to the Committee as to how the money is to be expended. Then there is to be a large expenditure in connection with the building of an arsenal. By the time the arsenal has heen completed, and provision has been made for the employees, it will cost the country something like Â£3,000,000 to Â£4,000,000. The township alone will cost from Â£1,750,000 to Â£2,000,000.

I should like to know whether we are to come to a decision on that item to-night, because I fear that, if we pass the item on the Estimates, this House will be definitely, committed to the scheme. assurance that nothing will be done until Parliament meets again. mise I have made, I shall not further prolong my'Temarks; but I hope that in considering the fixation of meat prices, the Government will take all possible care not to injure to any greater extent than is necessary, the great industry that has done so much to produce Australia's wealth. About two years ago my attention was directed to the lack of appreciation on the part of the Navy Department of the necessity for some cheaper form of coastal reconnaisance than that which might have been thought to suffice some twenty years ago. I found in port a number of small armed vessels, some of which were built in the early* nineties, and all of which are of no military value atall to-day, but were-carrying crews, at great expense to the Australian taxpayer, and making believe that they were doing valuable war service on coastal reconnaisance. My mind was naturally directed into the channel to which any honourable member would turn , in such circumstances. I asked why the work of coastal reconnaisance could not be done in the same way as in every other country of the world, namely, by aeroplanes ? I was told in the first place that the difficulty of procuring aeroplanes was insurmountable. Subsequently I found that that was mainly an excuse, and that there were plenty of aeroplanes everywhere except in Australia, where a few were needed for this purpose. I then approached the Navy Office and found there was a gentleman of wide military experience in this branch* who already had been urging upon the Department the necessity for taking steps now while the war was on to acquire the information necessary to enable our returning military flyers to be converted into the type of flyers required for naval reconnaisance. This gentleman had been active and energetic in pressing his views, even offering to sacrifice himself individually for the good of the Department. He AfterI had pressed the .point for a few months I began to realize that the central administration of the Navy Office was against any reform in this direction. As with almost everything else in that office, the whole of its energy was devoted to keeping out new forces and new activities. devoted to keeping out new men from overseas. a special officer, recently imported, who is a very gallant gentleman with a distinguished naval career, but with this question as it has come to me. _ I very soon began to find that the Minister who was then in charge of the Navy was allowing the Central Administration to remain in charge of itself. sent Minister? kinds of Ministers.

426,Mr Kelly,"There are variousare Ministers who supervise their Departments. I am afraid that my personal friend the Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook), so far as I can ascertain his administration from my own experience, is a gentleman who neither slaved nor supervised, but slept in his Department. I could get nothing done. To show the stubborn and stupid resistance of the Central Head-Quarters to this proposed stepa step absolutely necessary unless the whole of the experience of our military fliers is to be wasted, since they w ill all grow stale and get off the job unless we keep them togetherI may say t h a t when I suggested to the Ministerf or the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook) that he should call for applications from a l l returned aviators, select the best and attach them to the Royal NavalA i r Service, to get this information, the proposal was turned down. from the gentleman to whom I have referred-and who was the first to approach the Minister-to go, at his own expense, to England and find out for the Department some of the things that would be useful to them, was rejected. That offer was actually turned down, and turned down in a way that could hardly have been encouraging to the gentleman who made it . It may be said by honourable' members that perhaps this gentleman had no experience. I have here a copy of a letter he wrote to the Department on 3rd September last. I shall not wearv honourable members by reading the whole of it , but in order to show them the experience of this man, who was willing to make these inquiries for nothing, and whose offer was ignominiously turned down, I shall quote the following from itI graduated in England in the military wing of the Air Service, gaining my certificate on the 31st March, 1916. I was about five months on active service on the Egyptian front, and some three months mainly employed flying new machines across to France. ' I have flown all types of machines, and have carried out work on active service in all branches, namely, artilduce, their Estimates. That was a long lery co-operation with field batteries and monitors, bombing raids, reconnaissances, night flying and photography. I have also been employed test-flying new machines and old ones which required adjustment before being taken on service. I have been mentioned in despatches for ray work in the field, and have also done work as instructor in advance flying and lecturer on engines, and the care and maintenance of machines. I have also been through a course or scries of examinations at the University of London, by which I am qualified as Inspector in thc Aeronautical Inspection Department. This Department inspects all materials used in the construction of aircraft and engines, both before, during, and after con_ struction. He then went on to deal with his in debtedness to private firms who had provided certain facilities and so on, and concluded by telling the Minister who has asked for this informationI may say that Captain Thring, R.N., has a copy of my certificates, but I would be happy to forward the originals should you so desire. He then proceeded to set out the matters which the Navy Office might, in his opinion, care to know about. He wrote1. The training necessary to convert military aviators into efficient Naval airmen. 2. General organization and administration of Royal Naval Air Service. 3. Most efficient methods of equipping and maintaining Naval Air Stations (bases) and Outpost 'Stations (detached squadrons or I find that an actual offer flights). 4. The most suitable types of machines for different classes of work, dirigibles and observation balloons, in addition to heavier than 'air machines. 5. Latest and most efficient methods of manufacture and construction. He offered to do this for nothing, but has received no satisfaction from that day to this. He has not even had an expression of regret that so handsome an offer could not be accepted. I mention this merely f o prove the stubbornness of tlie Navy Department. WhatI urged at the time was that we should start to get ready to establish and organize a coastal aerial reconnaissance. I was not so much concerned then, nor am I now, as to the establishment of the naval air service for use with our naval unit, since our naval unit is dispersed to the ends of the earth, and will be u n t i l after the war. My chief concern is that there shall be no waste of the experience of out military aviators, and of the enthusiasm, engendered by the training they have received. A fte r a good deal of trouble, I threatened in a letter to the Navy Office to move to retime ago. Since then there has been a succession of political troubles, and this was so essentially a non-party proposition that I did not want its consideration to be in any way tainted with the party feeling which existed in this chamber about that time. I consequently desisted. But I find now that unless some pretty straight talking is indulged in here it is practically certain that the first plank in the Government's platform-the policy of preference to returned men-is going to be thrown over, by this Department, so that I feel it necessary to speak. I have no word to say against tiie very distinguished and excellent gentleman who has been imported by tiie Navy Office-no t to carry out any policy arrived at by the Government before he was asked to come here, but mainly and solely, I believe, to defend the Minister against myself, in our mutual correspondence and interviews. This gentle-man will almost certainly ""have the keenness of his branch of the profession to establish an efficient flying adjunct to the Australian Naval ""Unit. ' But I do not see in the Department's attitude the slightest sign thati t proposes question of an excess of esprit de corps to do much to organize our returned military aviators for the work of coastal reconnaissance. should like to say that the Department appears to be blindly unaware that unless it gets the whole control of aviation in"" Australia it is only going to do what this House has declared against over and over again; in other words, it will simply effect a duplication ""of Departments. We have had to compel the Navy Department to give up the policy of having its own separate works branch. There was a ridiculous system by which it kept a works manager and a whole host of men under him. The dividing line between' these -men and those employed in the Works Department was that the moment the water level was reached, in came the Navy works men to work underneath. As soon as they got above water level, -the Works Department came in and finished the job! ranged that a conference shall take placebetween both branches of the service before anything definite Ts decided in regard to construction so as to prevent the very thing that the honourable member is talking about. May I say that 1 am also edad that my honourable friend ( Mr Poynton) is. administering this Department. I wish to assure him that no word that I am uttering now is intended to Teflect upon him. He is new to the Department, and I am making no charges or suggestions against him. The works branch of the Navy Office has been abolished, but under the beneficent and slumberous influences of my old friend the Minister for the Navy, what has happened ? No sooner was the Works Department abolished than a super-spy staffa new anti-spy Department-wa s established in the Navy Office. We thus have two sets of sedition and enemy hunters, both travelling over tbe same ground, both getting in each other's way, no doubt, and turing each other ? being done for the prestige of each Department! That service should be under the one roof. Both branches of aviation should also be under the one roof. No as between either branch should stand in the way of common efficiency. It is Further than that, I c here that a' difficulty occurs. A navy aviator will sometimes say, "" A military aviator is no good so far as our work is concerned; he has not had to do the things we have to do."" And you will sometimes hear a military aviator say, "" The navy aviators have a very easy time of it. They never have to do what we have to do."" In England, in order to stop the mischievous operation of this service jealousy a new authority has' been created, and both branches have been put under that one authority. The service here is not big enough to warrant the creation of a Ministerial Department to handle it . but it is most important that we should wipe out this jealousy and bring the two branches under the one roof. I do not hesitate to say that the Navy Office ought to control this service. It must realize, however, that it has a twofold duty-no t only the duty of making its sea-going naval unit efficient by the addition of aerial observation; but the duty of seeing that a coastal reconnaissance around Australia is carried on as well. -when the Flying School was established at Point Cook that it would provide for both I am glad to hear it. branches of the service. under the control of the military branch of the service at the time.

443,Acting Minister For The Navy ( Mr Poyn,"Minister' ( Mr Poynton) know anything ahout our differences on the subject. For that reason no one must entertain other than a feeling of generous and sympathetic hope that the Acting Minister-will rise to the occasion, and avoid anything that may militate against the efficiency of that common scheme of Australian coastal reconnaissance that I have all along desired to see established. The honourable member who has just spoken, like others, finds himself in the unfortunate position of not being able to devote sufficient time to tlie discussion of themselves to be dominated by the rich topics of public importance. I regret very much that that honourable member did not explode on the particular question to which he has referred long ago, because it is necessary to ventilate one's opinions very vigorously here before reform can be brought about in some of our Departments; and I can only hope that his words to-night will have due effect. I am glad to notice that some honourable members opposite are prepared to take the stand that might naturally have heen expected of them, in days gone by at any rate, and that they do not support those who are endeavouring to depreciate the efforts of the Ministry to fix the price oi meat. Not only in respect to meat, but in regard to all commodities, it will be absolutely essential, for the Government to take some action to protect the people of the country against those who continue to fleece the public. It is no argument to tell the people df a country overflowing with the gifts of Providence that food is cheaper here than in other parts of the world. With our great supplies we ought to be able to distribute the necessaries of life at prices that are fair and reasonable to producer and consumer alike. The remarks of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner), and others, recall to my mind the bitter complaint uttered"" by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) at Bendigo only a few months ago. I do not know whether at that time there was any engineering going on, or what influence was at work, but it is rarely we find gentlemen of the calibre of the Prime Minister speaking so vigorously of those who support him. He declared that he would not be dominated by rich men, or by the Conservative element in the National party-that if he had to be dominated he would go back to those with whom most of his political life had been spent. There was evidently some special meaning in those words. So far back as last October, the Government had in their possession the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission regarding the price of meat, and I wonder whether the Prime Minister was thinking of those recommendations when he spoke of ""domination."" It is my hope that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt), and the Government generally, will not allow people of the country. I am out to-night to do a little special pleading on behalf of a long-suffering community. Members on this side of the House are not intent on downing the producer, but we believe that with proper organization there would be a better time for both producer and consumer. tail price can be regulated? mended in the report. 0 wholesale price or the retail price, one must have an effect on the other. the retail price of butter has been regulated by the wholesale price, and the price is now fixed by the Government. follow. case of butter, and that is a line of production in which organization, especially on co-operative lines,has gone furthest.

I am glad that the Commonwealth has now a number of Government factories, because the experts in those factories will be able to determine what ought to be charged by those who conduct private establishments of a similar kind.

I am not particularly concerned about the site, but as we have land at Tuggeranong, near the Federal Capital site, we can make that asset very valuable by establishing a great arsenal there, with workmen properly housed and employed under proper conditions. One of the first activities of the arsenal should be the production of steel for ship building. Let us not run away with the idea that the engineering and steel works of the arsenal must be devoted exclusively to defence objects. Our navy and our mercantile marine will require repairs from time to time, and will have to be . supplemented. apart from defence, the Government will need large quantities of steel plates and other steel material. We have delayed too long in this matter. The Broken Hill Steel Works and the Lithgow Steel Works cannot supply us with all the steel that is . needed. To-day-probabl y because little railway construction is going on-w e can supply ourselves with all the rails that we need. But for other steel material we must establish more steel works. I trust, therefore, that for industrial as well as . for defence reasons the arsenal will be proceeded with. The manufacture of woollen materials of various kinds should prove of great value to Australia. Here wool is plentiful, and of good quality. spending millions of pounds in importing woollens, although we are the biggest, pro-, ducers of wool. Were we to manufacture wool in all branches of the trade we would be able to give employment to thousands of persons, and would increase our revenue by millions of pounds. The cement industry is the third big industry that should prove of great value to us, and, of course, there are many more. Therefore I urge the Government, even at the present time when every penny counts, to' establish' works which will Mr Ffinton. afford employment for our people, and for the soldiers who are soon to return to us.

The Treasurer in his statement on the finances gave us a sugar-coated pill, and left out of account the municipal and private borrowing of Australia. In about twelve months' time the loan money on which interest will have to be paid will be no less -than Â£800,000,000, and within the next six .years State debts amounting to Â£78,000,000 will have matured. To renew these loans we shall have to borrow at 6, instead of at 3 and 3^ per cent., and this will greatly Therefore, altogether increase our interest bill. To meet these heavy obligations we must increase our primary and secondary production, and only by the establishment of industries can we do this. Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) may congratulate himself on the fact that members have agreed"" to curtail their criticism of the Estimates. No doubt, he is a hard working man, and is satisfied .with the administration of his Department, but .very few other persons in Australia are satisfied with it. The other day it was published in the newspapers that a man had just enlisted in Victoria who had heard of the war only quite recently. No doubt, the administration of the Postal We are now Department was largely responsible for his ignorance. I protest strongly against the way in which the country services of my electorate have been treated, and the same criticism applies to the treatment of the country services throughout Queensland and in the other States.

In the interests of those who, at great inconvenience, have gone out into the country, the Postal Department should do what it can to extend the means of communication. The Departments usefulness should be judged by the measure of the conveniences it affords to the people.

There are many reasons for the drift of population to the cities, but the lack of conveniences is a great cause in this country. The Postmaster-General can do something to rectify this state of affairs. He should strongly represent to the Government the need for advancing more money for the development of the means of communication in the country districts. An amount which appears upon the Estimates for the erection of a post-office at Caboolture has been the subject of correspondence between the Department and myself, but nothing has been done in connection with the building. the Estimates for post-offices in my own electorate since 1913-14, but on accouHt of the war I have done nothing with them. that this money should be spent because the present building is used, not only for the postal and telephone service, but also as a residence for the postmaster and his family, and there is nothing but a pine ' partition dividing the postal part of the building, which itself is a'small wooden affair^ from the apartments used as a residence, and the telephone switchboard is on that partition. The Department should either find the postmaster another house in which to live or spend the money provided .on the Estimates for the purpose for which it is intended. It is quite evident that the official who recommended the expenditure was convinced of the unsuitability of the present building. I have used every endeavour to get the The Australian Year-Booh Deputy Postmaster-General to make a start with the work, but he says that the fault lies with the Central Office, and . when I have approached the Postmaster General he says that he is acting on the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster General. I propose to put the correspondence bearing the Minister's signature in Hansard, so that the people in my electorate will be able to judge the real position for themselves. shall watch closely what I will send to the honourable member in future. ister does not desire to intimidate me or accuse me of not playing the game with",82,German Ironmasters Ambitions French Lorraine Must Be Annexed

On the 8th February, 1918, I received the following letter: With reference to the inquiry preferred on the 5th instant by the Caboolture Chamber of Commerce Secretary ( Mr J. J. Kipping), rergarding the position of affairs in regard to the proposed erection of a new departmental building for postal purposes at Caboolture, I regret to inform you that after approval had Been received for the erection of the building in question, it was found that the expenditure involved-owin g to increases in the cost of material and rates of wages-woul d be seri-ously in excess of the authorized amount. Tlie matter was again gone into by the Central Office, whicli has since intimated that in the circumstances the proposal will have to stand over until the construction of tbe building can be carried out at a more reasonable cost. I shall be glad if you will advise the Caboolture Chamber of Commerce accordingly. Yours faithfully, J. McCONACHIE, Acting Deputy Postmaster-General. A f t e r using every endeavour with' the Deputy Postmaster-GeneralI submitted the matter to the Postmaster-General, and on the 4th May, 1918, I received the following letter:With reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo regarding the desired erection of a new building for postal purposes at Caboolture, Queensland, I beg to inform you that an amount of Â£460 was provided on the 1917-18 Estimates â for the erection of a new building at that place, but on 31st October last, the Deputy Postmaster-General reports that the estimated cost of construction was then set down at Â£567, and in view of that increase he recommended that the question of proceeding with the work he ' allowed to stand over until -the building couhi he erected at a reasonable cost. 2. In reply to an inquiry by this office as -to how the office work would be conducted if the proposal was postponed, the Deputy Postmaster-General stated that the work would be conducted in the existing building, and that, although tbe office space was"" rather limited, the work could be performed there without inconvenience to the public until normal conditions again prevailed, and better accommodation eould be provided at a reasonable cost In the circumstances, the Deput> Postmaster General's recommendation was approved. The Deputy Postmaster-General has been advised of your representations, and asked for A further report in the matter, on receipt of which you will be again eommunicated with. The enclosure to your letter is returned herewith, as desired -get down to a common ground where we Yours faithfully, Ur. Mackay. I take it that when he writes an 1 received a further letter dated the 17th May, 1918, as follows: With reference to my letter of the 4th inst., If he writes letters regarding the desired erection of a new building for postal purpose at Caboolture, Queensland, I beg to inform you the Deputy Postmaster-General, Brisbane, reports that the building,, which is an old one, is quite suitable under existing conditions for the conduct of the business of the Department and the public, and that the only strong reason put forward to him during his visit to Caboolture, some time ago, in favour of a separate office for the transaction of public business, was that owing to the close proximity of the telephone switchboard to the postmaster's quarters, the postmaster was apt to be disturbed at night time. The Deputy Postmaster-General adds that until a more reasonable tender is obtained, he cannot recommend that this work be proceeded with. Yours faithfully, I regret to have to speak out so plainly, but in the interests of my constituents it is i.ecessary to do so. The matter has been hung up for a long time. My predecessor ( Mr Stumm) endeavoured for a long time to get something done to have this state, of affairs rectified, and I ' submit that it is nearly time the work was commenced. There were some difficulties in ""regard to the transfer of the adjoining block of land owned by the Police Department, but that trouble has been overcome, and any delay which has since occurred has been due to the Department. There has certainly been an increase in theÂ» cost of labour and material, but there is not likely to be any alteration for the better in that respect' for a considerable time to come, and the longer the matter is delayed the greater will be the inconvenience to the people of Caboolture, add particularly to tlie postmaster and his family who are compelled to live in this small building.

Not far from Maldon the anti-copscriptionists decided to erect, a monument to commemorate the great victory of Democracy when conscription was defeated. I can quite understand the local people having a difference of opinion on the subject, and some of them considering the monument an eyesore, but one of the recruiting parties sent out by the Government deliberately demolished the monument. was rebuilt.

With them in the car were six soldiers, named Trickett, Graff, Jenkins, Fraser, Gregory, and Paxton. They held forth in Maldon, but found that, because of the peculiar action [223]2 of the previous recruiting party, the enthusiasm of the young men had fallen off. They were so enraged at the failure of their efforts that they decided to again destroy the monument, and, I believe, that they stole the dynamite with which they blew it up.

The heinousness of the offence lies in the employment of' soldiers for the purpose, and the men who took the soldiers to that monument in order to destroy it ought to be punished. Unless the Government discountenance actions of that kind, they cannot expect that harmony which they say they are so anxious to create in the community. I have a few words to say in regard to price fixing. The Government fixed the retail price of rabbits at ls. 6d. per pair, but the combine have been allowed to but they did not fix the wholesale price. I believe that the people ought to get qheap food, but I do not' think that the retail traders should, suffer whilst the wholesalers are allowed to go scot free. A common sense policy would be tofixboth wholesale and retail prices. Instead of doing that, the Government fix a retail price, which the vendor must not exceed or he will be punished, but the wholesaler is allowed to do as he likes. I have not a great deal of love for the shop-keeping class, because they are a lot of Conservatives, but they, are respectable in every way, with the exception of their political opinions, and they ought to have a fair deal. I ask the Minister in charge of prices why he did not also fix. the wholesale price for rabbits? riopose to do with meat also? will take good care that Parliament adjourns before they tackle the meat question. They ought not to be allowed to hurry into recess without announcing tueir decision, but they have the numbers, aud they have cracked the party whip. Budget, [REPRESENTATIVES.] 1917-18. The price of bread has,, been fixed at 7Â£d. over the counter. In certain circumstances a man who delivers bread in the country may charge 8d. Why the people in the country should pay more for their bread I cannot understand. According to a letter I have received from Ballara,'the one baker in the district compels his customers to pay 8d. per loaf over the counter, although the fixed price for the district is 7id. It is the duty of evade the law, and that one section of the community is not penalized because of living in a district which is not under close Government supervision. I admit there are bakers who suffer certain disadvantages, but if one man may break the law, all may do so. Prior to Government intervention to make illegal, the increase which had been made in the price of tobacco, the combine was giving to the retailers a discount of 2 | per eent. and a rebate of 3d. per lb. But the moment the Government interfered, the combine got even with the retailers by discontinuing the rebate. Everybody knows that in tobacco retailing there is a very small margin of profit, flout -the Government regulation by .depriving the retailers of the 3d. jjer lb. which they used to get by way of rebate. Owing to the high cost of living, it is the duty of the Government to fix prices according to the cost of production, and then take steps to insure that no section of the community is imposed upon by another. A few evenings ago we had the laughable spectacle of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) condemning the attitude of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) upon the meat question, and urging those who, like himself, represented working-class constituencies, to show their objections to the policy of those who were adverse to the fixation of meat prices. But, after the honourable member had given expression to his opinion, we heard no more from him, or from any o'ther member on the Government side, although they well knew that a section of the community are making fortunes, to the disadvantage of all other sections, and that no attempt is being made by the Government to prevent this sort of thing.

483,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"that the site of the arsenal should not be determined until Parliament had had an opportunity to voice its opinion. time has since elapsed, but nothing has been done. In 1915 it was said, "" W h y talk of establishing an arsenal now that we are at war?"" Had we made a start then we should have been able by now to construct both large and small guns, and to provide many essentials-to the conduct of this great war. The Special Commission made most exhaustive inquiries, and a remarkable feature of the whole matter is that it. has visited the Tuggeranong site ous public servants taken from Melbourne again and again as if there were a desire on the part of some one to reject it in favour of some other site. In every instance, however, it has reported in its favour. After inspecting suggested sites at Lyndhurst, Bathurst, Albury, Cootamundra, Lithgow, Yass, and other centres, it has come to the conclusion that while some of them are fairly good, none is as satisfactory as the Tuggeranong site. As the honorable member for Maribyrnong has said to-night, Tuggeranong is within the Federal Territory. The surrounding country belongs to us, and by the establishment of an arsenal there a large area of land which the Government resumed at a cost of Â£5 per acre would enormously appreciate in value. An arsenal in full swing would involve the employment of 4,000 or 5,000 men. That would mean a population of 20,000 or 25,000 in the arsenal town, so that by accepting tlie recommendation of the Committee and establishing the arsenal at Tuggeranong the Government would greatly 1 enhance the value of property which it has already purchased. I fail to understand why the Comniission has been sent round the country searching for something better than a site which the Commonwealth itself owns. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) said he was not particular regarding the site, neither am I as long as the best site is chosen. from a Victorian representative! Victorian view, as far as I can gatherand I want to speak candidly-is that the Federal capital should not be built. The people of Victoria want this Parliament to continue to sit in Melbourne till the day of judgment. If the representatives of this State had to travel a thousand miles every week, as some of us have to do turned soldier yet settled on it. in order to attend to our Parliamentary duties, they would take a different view. SomeI willingly admit that Victoria has treated us most hospitably. The State Government has given us the use of these fine buildings and has extended to us the most generous consideration, but Melbourne lacks the Federal atmosphere, and I invite my honourable friend who laughed to adopt the Federal, and not a merely parochial, view. Why should he be afraid to see the Governor General and the Commonwealth Departments, with the numerto the Federal Capital? If Melbourne cannot afford to lose all these, then it should wither and die. Behind these genial laughs, on the part of representatives of Victoria, there is always a sinister desire to keep the Seat of Government in Melbourne. After seventeen years of Federation we are no nearer our permanent Federal home than we were at the outset. What is the use of spending over a million of money at the Federal Capital if the compact we made is not to be kept? The world to-day is engaged in a terrible war over the tearing up of "" a scrap of paper,"" and yet there are some honourable members who would tear up the agreement that was made with the people of New South Wales, with regard to the establishment of the capital in that State? The Commission estimates that the construction of an arsenal would involve a 1 first expenditure of Â£1,440,000, and that 1,200 employees would be at once taken oa in connection with the manufacture of arms* and munitions. A great industrial centre would in this way be established near the Federal Capital, where we have our own land and a railway running into the very centre of it. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) should say "" This site is within 10 miles of the capital; its selection would industrialize the capital."" How can he hope to establish a big capital city unless we The have there opportunities for employment. And where is there a better opportunity to find work for our returned soldiers than we should have by establishing them on Commonwealth lands? We have 600,000 acres of good land in the Federal Territory.",87,William Websteb

Instead of only flocks of sheep we should have troops of happy children there. In Canberra there is some of the best agricultural land in New South ""Wales. I have travelled over scores of old farms in the Territory where men have made a good living on 200 or 300 acres The old homesteads are'still there, and it is time that we re-established them. It is true that Canberra is over 2,000 feet above sea-level, but the climate is invigorating, and it would do some indolent Victorians good to visit such a district. -the Government propose to do in the way of preliminary works at the arsenal ? Amongst others there are a railway to cost about Â£90,000, water supply to the arsenal to cost about Â£25,000, the construction of the town Â£650,000, and all these would give employment of a reproductive character to thousands of men in a good climate. We cannot establish a capital unless we have plenty of work and men, which are the basis of success of any city. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), referred to the establishment of steel works there, but he forgot to mention that there is in the neighbourhood of T u g geranong one of the best ironstone deoosits in New South Wales. is also plenty of limestone for the manufacture of cement, and amongst the railways projected is one to Jervis Bay, which is one of those natural ports which w ill be established some day notwithstanding the opposition of the great cities. The curse of Australia is centralization; and why should not Jervis Bay, Portlaud, and Port Stephens be developed ? The present is the best opportunity we could possibly have for the establishment of the arsenal; and I should like to know from the Assistant Minister for Defence <"" Mr Wise), and the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton), who up to the present have been giving us d Â° i aud n J not words, when we are likely to have some work done. We are promised a financial session in eight or ten weeks' time, though I hope it w ill be twelve, for 1 do not clamour for a short recess when I desire a spell, and, in any case, an opportunity should be afforded us to do the Holdbest we can for recruiting. I suggest that the Postmaster-General should ask the Government for a grant of, perhaps, Â£250,000 in order to provide proper postal facilities for our pioneers of civilization in the back country. I do not join in the cry against the Postmaster General, because I have held that office myself, and know its difficulties; but there are other honourable members wlio, like myself, are dissatisfied with the whole administration of the Department; in fact, some of the administration is absolutely rotten, though I do not blame the Postmaster-General particularly. If the Government do not hearken ""to the voice of reason in this connection there is What do a majority on this side who are dissatisfied, and may send them where other Governments have been sent. I am only pointing out what might be done, and in what I am prepared to take a hand myself; my only fear is that if we did put this Government out we might get a worse onefrom the other side. New members of the House may think they are doing a great thing in obtaining postal facilities for various districts, but really that does not count for very much beyond giving a feeling of satisfaction that, one is helping those who require help.

I am not the only one who feels their importance, though many of the others will not speak during this debate. It is not pleasant to have to speak harshly to Ministers with whom I am on terms of good friendship, but something definite, must be done. I must insist also on a definite statement about the arsenal. Is it going to be established at the Federal Capital site, or are Ministers frightened of the bogy which the proposed establishment of an industrial centre within 10 miles of the Capital seems to have created? Personally, I think the bringing of a large industrial population near to the Capital should make it a success. It is three years materially liberalisedits provisions. Many last May since I succeeded in getting the matter referred to the Public Works Committee. We have now been in temporary residence in Melbourne for over seventeen years. Age running the Victorian members. not run one or two of them very far. Still, the Victorian newspapers do not create a Federal atmosphere. We should not have got Protection had the first Federal Parliament met out of Melbourne. As a Protectionist, I am glad that we were meeting in Melbourne when the Tariff was under consideration. member think that the Tariff will be repealed when we get to Canberra? we to establish and keep our industries without a protective. Tariff? Why should we send our wool and other products overseas to be manufactured and brought back to us ? No Government will be able to live in this country which will not give a Tariff under which our own people can be employed. lengthy support from me which will not foster industry. Let us have ringing anvils and the smoking stacks of factories and foundries throughout the country, giving employment to our own people, instead of sending our raw material to be manufactured in other countries. [10.38] -The references to the Postmaster-General and his tendency to spend all his money near thFmetropolitan areas remind me that in a populous centre in my electorate within easy distance of Sydney, you must, to telephone on Sundays, arm yourself with ten pennies, and drop them one by one into the box attached to the instrument, before you can make connection. It costs three or four times as much, to use the telephone there as it does to use telephones much further out where more fortunate terms have been secured from the Postal Department. I wish to call attention to a few matters affecting our soldiers which should have immediate attention from Ministers. Our pensions law is not creditable to the Parliament that passed it, and we shall, not .have done our duty towards 'those who have fought for us until we have pensions of only 7s. 6d a week are being given, and still more of only 10s. a week. The Act is inelastic, so that fair administration to meet the varying conditions is impossible. The proposed recess is needed to enable Ministers to give a continuous consideration to these various problems, which is impossible when Parliament is in session, and I hope advantage will be taken of the opportunity to carefully review the treatment of returned men. In many cases dependants have been deprived of separation allowances and allotment money because the soldier at the Front has been punished for some infringement of military regulations abroad. bungling of the London office. something about that if I have the time. The matter to which I am now referring affects an immense number of innocent persons. Had their menfolk remained at home, pursuing their ordinary civil avocations, they would not have brought themselves within reach of the law. But when men who have been used to indeNo Government will get any pendence and freedom come suddenly under military discipline, such as that of the British Army, many of them: do things which, though not evil in themselves, Bring upon them punishment. It is quite wrong, however, that their dependants should be deprived of sustenance because of these breaches of discipline.

The time has come when consideration should be given to the question of the increased efficiency to the country . that would result from a cessation of the heavy expenditure in connection with indulgence in intoxicating liquors. From the beginning of the war there has been an agitation to secure a further curtailment of the opportunities presented to soldiers, and also to civilians, to spend their money on intoxicating liquors, when it could be spent to more advantage to the country, .whose efficiency would be vastly improved if the opportunities to indulge in intoxicating liquors were curtailed. One of those opportunities falls more strictly within the realm of State activities; but the Commonwealth government might properly legislate on the lines of antishouting during the war. I am quite certain that the passage of a Bill in' that .direction would immensely increase the efficiency of the people who have to bear the burden at home, while at the same time it would materially assist the soldiers in returning tb their occupations when they come back. -I know that all the proposals we make at the present time are made under the shadow of what is going on in Flanders, but we have the right to ""assume that, however-great may be the disasters that fall upon our armies there, and however the war' may be prolonged, the end of 'it will be victory for those who are associated with the Empire in upholding the rights of free peoples; and whatever else we may lay aside, matters affecting pensions for our .soldiers and their dependants, and the re-settlement of our soldiers in the country for which they have fought, should have our constant -attention, so that the financial burdens which the country has to bear may be equally distributed among all sections of this people, and so that there shall not be found in Australia, when the men come back, such a state, of unemployment as has usually followed wars in other countries. -hoped to have something to say on the question of price-fixing, and especially in regard to meat, but at this late hour I shall content myself by saying that, in view of the high prices which are being charged for meat throughout Australia to-day, I feel it is incumbent on the Government to do something. ""We have their assurance that they will do something, and if if be possible to make some alteration in the prices without at the same time seriously affecting the primary producer, I hope that they will so act. Those of us who were privileged to hear the speech delivered by the ner) yesterday realized, as we had perhaps not realized previously, the extent to which Australia depends on the primary producer. A number of the speeches that have been delivered during this debate have followed the line that one of the greatest curses in Australia at the present time is the concentration of population in the capital cities. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) laid particular stress on that matter, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) advocated an increase of postal facilities, arguing that it would bring about an exodus of people from the cities to country districts. Nothing would do more to induce people to settle in country districts than would an improvement to our main roads. I realize that these roads do not come under the jurisdiction of this Parliament; but experience has shown us that neither the local authorities -nor the State Governments will act in the matter, and to-day we have in Australia a continent of magnificent distances and disgraceful-roads. I would like to see the Federal Government approach the State Governments with a view to taking over the maintenance and construction of main roads. Europe has always been famed for its roads, and their value has been proved, first of all in times of peace, but latterly during the war. During the defence of Verdun, the railway was cut, and it was impossible for the French to convey any material to the fortress by rail. However, convoy after convoy, 10 yards between each section of ten motor cars, passed over the road to Verdun, and conveyed food and munitions to the men in the fortress, enabling them to withstand what may be regarded as the mightiest attack that has ever ""been launched against any fortified position.",91,William Websteb
503,"Mr Bayley (Oxley) [10.45],",I had,93,William Websteb
504,Honourable Member For Hume ( Mr Falki,"o Those who have motored from Melbourne to Sydney know the condition of the roads lying between these two capital cities. Looking at the matter entirely from a military stand-point, I am sure that it will be agreed that it is absolutely necesthe other hand, the roads through those sary to improve our main roads. How does our railway system compare with European systems? into view the scarcity of our population, we have a magnificent system of railways, but those who travel from Melbourne to Sydney week after week know the inconveniences that have to be put up with, and those of us who went north during Brisbane Cup week know that the Railway Department was taxed to its utmost to convey'a few hundred pleasure seekers. ""What would happen if this country, in time of war, found it necessary to transfer men and munitions from one'part of Australia to another? would break down. We must therefore depend upon our main roads from a military aspect. But what about the commercial and economical aspect? members have dwelt upon the concentration of population in our cities. Queensland is favoured in that respect, because Brisbane was not made the only recognised centre of the State in the early days. Men realized thatconcentration was a curse, and, when laying out the various lines of railway, they decided that there should be more than one system. Consequently we have in Queensland the finest railway system in Australia; and as a result Brisbane contains only 22 per cent, of the entire population -of Queensland, whereas Melbournecontains 47 per cent., or nearly half of the population of Victoria. I am aware that suggestions have been made at various times that the Commonwealth should assume control of the various railway systems, and that the States have refused to hand them over, because they are revenue producing. No such argument can be applied to the Federal control of the main roads. The States would be only too glad to hand over to the Commonwealth the construction and maintenance of the roads, and if we have the best interests of Australia at heart and wish to make it economically secure we must develop our roads. We are crying out for land for soldiers; yet within a few miles of railway lines are millions of acres of land superior to any in Australia, but not capable of Ur. Bayley. utilization. Men who have gone upon the land have found it impossible to engage in mixed farming at a greater distance than -five miles from the railway, because the roads are impassable. If , on districts were improved settlers could go. out twenty miles beyond the railway, and Taking the land bordering on the roads could be brought under cultivation. One of the reasons for the present high cost of living -and it is increasing by leaps and bounds -is that the men in the country have to carry upon their backs too many of the dwellers in the cities. We must offer attractions for men to leave the cities and settle in the country. I believe that when the war is over there will be a great exodus of people from the older countries of the world to Australia. In the past we have played more or less with the The railway system matter of immigration. We have brought some hundreds of thousands of people to Australia, but the stream of immigration has, nevertheless, been very thin. But Honourable to-day there is at work throughout the British Isles and Europe the greatest army of immigration agents that the. world has ever seen. I refer to the Australian soldiers, each one of whom is loud in his praise of his own country and tells the people of other lands of the wealth that awaits the energetic settler here And population will come. At the present time numbers of men are leaving the' cities and going upon the land, but there is a stream, almost as large, if not larger, in the opposite direction-me n leaving the country and coming to the cities because the conditions of rural life are not satisfactory. Honourable members have appealed to the Postmaster-General, and through him to the Government, to increase the postal facilities in order to make country life more endurable. What would be the result if the people could be induced to go in large numbers into the country and we had closer settlement? Educational and social facilities would be improved. At the present time children must go very many miles to a small school, where the teachers may be doing excellent work, but where the scholars 'cannot expect to receive an education equal to that which may be obtained in larger centres. Multiply the number of units in any community and we at once make it possible to provide increased educational facilities. Further, than that, we shall strike a blow at the increased cost of living. , Therefore I hope the Government may be induced to approach the State Governments, and, through them, the various local authorities, with a view to at least taking oyer the main roads of Australia and seeing that they are put in a state which will make possible traffic over them. Several honourable members, amongst them the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch), mentioned the Northern Territory. Grampians ( Mr Jowett) at one stage of our proceedings sought to place before honourable members a suggestion to give assistance to Imperial soldiers on the same footing as to Australian soldiers in connection with repatriation. But it was pointed out that the Bill then under discussion was for the repatriation of Australian soldiers, and, in the circumstances, his scheme could not be entertained. The honourable member for Werriwa argued that we should do more for the utilization of the Northern Territory. Why cannot the suggestions of the two honourable members be operated together. There are in India many Anglo-Indians, both in the Army and the Civil Service, who at the end of their career in that country have little or no-desire to return to England, because they have become unacclimatized. Australia appeals to those people. Why cannot we lay ourselves out to do something with the Northern Territory? It has been said that it is impossible for the small man to make a success there. There is in the Territory a very large firm, Vestey Brothers, who have invested in freezing works and pastoral holdings close on Â£1,000,000. That firm has' sufficient faith in the Northern Territory to invest its capital there. National Government can do what a private concern can do? Why cannot we form a company, as it were, of returned soldiers, and .men from overseas, the Commonwealth finding .the capital for the development of the Territory ? Of course, men will not, of their own accord, leave other portions of Australia to go to the Northern Territory until the conditions there are equal to what they are in the more settled parts of the Commonwealth. Buti f the Commonwealth will stand bebind these men and say to them, "" We will employ -you until the time has arrived wheu you feel disposed to go out and work for yourselves,"" I make bold to say that the claims made by the honourable member for Werriwa and others will be realized. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the payment of pensions to the inmates of institutions. A t Dunwich, in Queensland, is an institution originally founded for old men and women. But there has always been amongst the inmates a small percentage of younger men and womenwho, through accident or illThe honourable member for ness, are incapacitated. When the Old age and Invalid Pensions Act was instituted, an arrangement was made with the State Governments whereby the pensions of inmates of institutions should be paid over to the State Governments, who would accept the responsibility of looking after the pensioners. Many people apply for a pension, being convinced that they aro capable of looking after themselves, or have some one who will look after them. Should those people, later on, enter an institution, the whole of their pension is not taken from them. They are allowed 2s. per week to enable them to buy little luxuries, such as tea for the old women and tobacco for the men. There are, however, a number of persons who entered the Dunwich institution prior to the inception of the Pensions Act, and they are denied by the Commissioner of Pensions this amount of 2s. per week. I have brought this matter before the House on several occasions, but, so, far, have been unable to get ah undertaking from the Government that they will take action in the direction I have suggested. I have here a "" notice of rejection of claim ""To Mr Chas. FurlongT have to acquaint you that your claim for a pension has been rejected on the ground that Surely the you are sufficiently provided for in Dunwich. Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. The Commissioner does not take into consideration the fact .that a number of the inmates of the institution have left it, and remained out for a few weeks, baving either relatives or friends with whom they could stay, and havo then claimed a pension. When they have received it, they have at once returned to Dunwich, and have beeu entitled to draw their 2s. per week. But, because Mr Furlong and scores of other men have no friends to whom they can go, and cannot look out for themselves for a period in order to enable them to apply for a pension, the long's case is a deserving one, and I 3hall that have built up Australia. read to the Committee a letter I have reon to sayceived from h i m : Sir,My pension has been lately refused by the This shows that he recognises what a fine Deputy Commissioner here, as you will see by the enclosed letter.

Is no action to be taken by the Government to free our correspondence, telegraphic and postal, from the kind attentions of the censor? By what right or reason does the censor send to this House for copies of members' speeches? Acting Prime Minister) [11.31] I have myself been somewhat surprised in scanning the Estimates at some of the items against war-loan expenditure, and I promise the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) that I shall scrutinize them very carefully before the presentation of the next Estimates. As to the censorship, I can readily understand that the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) is somewhat upset when he thinks that he is singled out for the special attention of the censor. I have made inquiries, and I can assure him that he is wrong in that respect. The censorship of letters, telegrams, and the press, is general; and the rule is that, if any matter deals with military or other defence affairs, it shall be referred to the censor.

Government have, given careful consideration to the matter, and, after a thorough investigation by a competent Committee, it has been decided that the best site is at Tuggeranong, in the Federal Territory-. The matter has also been referred to the Imperial authorities, and the necessity for this work is thoroughly recognised: the Government intend to proceed with the work there at once in accordance with the announcement made by my colleague when the Loan Appropriation Bill was before, us. I desire to invite the attention of the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) to some questions I addressed to him iu the House. on Sth August last, and his replies thereto, as reported in Hansard, page 828, for that year. Amongst the questions I asked was, how many persons were then interned at the concentration camps in Australia, and I was informed that there were 5,400 men, and 101 women and children. I also asked how many pf these were born in Australia, in enemy countries, in territory of the Allies, and in neutral territory, but the Minister was unable to give me any information, as only nationality, and not birthplace, was considered in the classification Amongst those interned is a friend of mine, whom I have known for over twenty years. He is an Australian-born gentleman of German parentage, and I have had some correspondence with him for over two years, at any rate. I have sent repeated letters to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and had repeated interviews with him, in seeking to have this gentleman released from internment. yielded to the persuasion of a deputation of Queensland members, and allowed an inquiry to take place in Brisbane in regard to this gentleman's position. I attended that inquiry, and gave evidence on character. I believed then, and I believe now, that he is wrongly interned. I claim for him, a3 I claim for others, that, as au Australian citizen, he is entitled to special consideration. However, there he is, and my efforts, and the efforts of others also, on his behalf have proved unavailing.

537,Dear Mr Finlayson,"I am still alive, andyou could sec Dr. Mannix and ask him to give you the information he got in Sydney about this camp, it would open your eyes. I have written straight, but I am compelled to; there are about 1,100 more coming in next week from the east, this the dumping ground; and if the party stands this waste of millions of money here, then I am done with it for good; where is the sense in keeping about 6,000 persons idle? 90 per cent, of them could be earning their own living. I trust you will read this to the members, and that they will be men enough to fight for their own people. I have as much right, and more than Hughes and Pearce together, in Australia. You will know who this is from. Remember me to Bill Wright, and I trust you will all fight hard. I saw in the paper this morning the total cost of internment was less than Â£800,000; that is a bare-faced lie. This place costs over Â£1,000,000 a year;"" we know that; and then there is the thousands lost to Australia through these men being unemployed. I dont know how you people let Pearce gull you like that; no wonder the party is going down when there is in the party mongrels like Maloney, who wants to hang everybody who don't bark Britain*. Hughes and the rest of them bark Belgium; but he has' done worse, he has made paupers of his own people, deported them away from tbeir own family in their owri country, and there isn't a man game to bring it up and protest; talk about Germany and Russia! Why, this Hughes has more power and doing more brutal things than the two of them together, and the lot of you let him do it. I just got a letter saying my wife has had to give up working on account of .ill-health; that means starvation;, and I am wasting my life here, and on the rottenest food they could put before a man; why don't you get a pass and come in here? That would make you sing out in the House, I bet. They give work here-Is. , four^ hours making roads. 1 will never come at it ; you get that two weeks out of ten. Kelly, Orchard, Sinclair were here, but not inside. Attorney-General Hall was here the time of the strike to get scabs; he got none; 95 per cent, of them here are workers, and you bet they will be bitter against the lot when they get out. I see Ryan, like a fool, withdrew that case against Hughes. He has the lot bluffed. I could keep on writing for a week about this persecution, so I trust you and the party will do your duty and have me released. I just got word the lad is just sent back to France to fight for the liberty and justice Hughe's and Maloney talk about. God help the liberty!

HALL, Yesterday in the House of Representatives, when discussing industrial matters, I was led to refer to the fact that I had a letter from a Brisbane friend, Australian born, of German parentage, in which he informed me (and here I quoted verbatim from Hansard proof of my speech), "" That during the strike Mr Hall, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, visited the camp and invited the prisoners to volunteer for strike breaking. Tbey refused, because this man tells me that 95 per cent, of them are workers, and would not go out as strike-breakers against their Australian comrades."" * Mr Pigott, member for Calare, has evidently wired you, and last night the memher for Hindmarsh read a telegram from you, received by Mr Pigott, in which vou stated that tlie statement made by me had no foundation The address tO in fact.

To whom do we appeal? To the shipping companies. If the Acting Prime Minister seeks advice, from whom does he get it? From shipping men. who are mo3t qualified to run ships are those who have been running them. most qualified men to run ships in the interests of the companies who are paying them to do it. Every man on the Shipping Board, with the exception of Admiral Clarkson, is a managing director or the manager of a shipping company, and the Board has the power to increase freights to the extent of 10 per cent. Of course, they must apply to the Prime Minister to make any increase above that percentage. that the chairman has the right of veto .within the 10 per cent.

He is a strictly honourable and capable man, but under no stretch of imagination can he be said to be representing the public. When the Acting Prime Minister desires evidence to enable him to decide"" whether fares should be raised or not, he must obtain it from the very companies whose managers are on the Shipping Board. This is an in-tolerable position, and I hope that before the House rises the Minister will give some promise that the matter of the constitution of the Board will be reconsidered. I quite agree that the shipping companies should be represented on the Board. When we are dealing with companies which have spent large sums of money in the construction of vessels, we should certainly give them representation on the Board which has taken over the control of their ships, but it is worse than an absurdity to give them full and supreme control over the Inter-iState trade of Australia. telling the honourable membeT that I will reconsider the whole matter, as soon as practicable, with my colleague who is intrusted with the control of shipping matters. honourable member's offer immediately, and without hesitation, but I would like him to get evidence, and try to ascertain the desire of those who are using the vessels. is a part of the question that must be investigated.

By no stretch' ofimagination can it be said that that boat uses the Derwent light on South Arm, and it would make no difference to the Huon trade if that light were not there at all. But the small boats are compelled to pay the same dues as the ocean-going vessels. As far as I can gather, the decision of the Court was based on the regulation issued by the Department. The company appealed without success, but if the Minister will look up in Hansard the discussion on the Navigation Bill he will see that his predecessor ( Mr Tudor) said that the small boats would be excluded from the provisions of that Bill, and I , at any rate, understood that to mean that they should also be free of the payment of light dues, except in those cases in which the lights were actually used by them.

A little time ago I asked the Postmaster General to give special consideration to what I may term his country policy. He has an ormortunity of making his name a household word in this country. But at the present time he is adopting a pernicketty policy and trying to create a surhis work, and fine manly attributes. He plus in a department that renders direct service to the people. When we make a complaint or statement in the House the only reply we receive from the Minister is that the statement is not correct; we get no further information. That attitude does not satisfy the representatives of country districts, where services are being curtailed and dismantled. sorry that the Acting Prime Minister is not present. It is very unpleasant to be pursuing a Minister who has apparently adopted a policy quite contrary to that of the other Ministers. All of them, with the exception of the Postmaster-General, are extending their activities in new departments and sub-departments. For instance, the Minister for Trade and Customs has had placed under his control quite a number of new departments, which he is staffing and spreading out in a most energetic way. hand, the Postmaster-General, whose Department is the only one which renders direct service to the people, is at work, through his deputies, dismantling and curtailing facilities. ""Sitting suspended from 12.30 to 1 o'clock a.m. stand why the Postmaster-General, who knows that his Estimates are under consideration, and who was here before we adjourned for supper, is not present. His is the one Department of the Commonwealth that cannot afford to adopt the policy of trying to create surpluses by a curtailment of its services. I am more content, now that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) is present, than I should be if the Postmaster-General himself were here. The Postmaster-General has been obdurate to the many representations made to him in this Chamber, as well as in his Department, in regard to the undue curtailment of services. It would be impossible to have a better administrator than the Deputy Postmaster-General for Victoria. No administrator in the Department has a better grip of the service, is more sympathetic towards the requirements of country districts, and more ready to take up a proposition and analyze it in a business-like way. than is Mr Bright. Indeed, I have seldom met a man possessing his rare qualitiesa complete knowledge of the intricacies of a big Department, a good business grasp of is ever ready to assist country members, and, until recently, I have been able to secure his approval to various propositions which are now systematically turned down. ber's complaint relate chiefly to telephonic I am services? . has to do more with deprivation of postal services. I have no desire to waste time. I am as anxious as is any honourable member to assist in carrying out any arrangement that the Government have made with the Opposition, and I am prepared to sit down at once, if the Acting Prime Minister will accept my assurance tnat there is general discontent throughout country electorates like my own in reOn the other gard to this policy of curtailment of services in the very middle of the war. This is a time when every resident in country districts is anxious to avail himself of postal and telephonic services to obtain information as to the progress of the war, the daily lists of casualties, the arrival of transports, and the lists of returning men. A ll this business, added to the commercial requirements of the State, makes a big demand upon the Department. The farming community have for years contributed to the building up of the city services, and they consider the time has come when something should be done for them. I could, if the Treasurer desired it, give an alphabetical list-startin g with the town of Apsley-of propositions that have been turned down. been withdrawn from the honourable member's electorate? a few illustrations.

640,Mr Rodgers,"Yes. Let me give the 6th March last; the alteration of a mail service between Apsley and Hamilton was refused on 19th February last; a supplementary road mail service on Saturday, from Croxton East to Penshurst, was refused on 11th February last. A proposal to re-open the Lake Gonda'h office was rejected on 1st May, and the re-opening of the Lake Mundi and Lyons offices was refused early this year. All these are recent cases. I have a complete list relating to my own electorate, but shall not weary .the Committee at this hour of the morning by reading the whole of it. There may be good reasons why some of these services should be curtailed. I am not going to say that the Department has no right to review some of these services; but the point'I make is that, in many cases, these country districts enjoyed, twenty years ago, better postal facilities than they have to-day. I was then Postmaster-General in this State. the honourable gentleman held the same portfolio to-day. ber suggest that, in the country districts of Victdria, there is practically a policy of deprivation of services? Department, so far as many of its facilities are concerned, seems to be one .of refusal, deprivation, and curtailment. I am not going to urge that the Department is not right in some of these matters, but I object to what is undoubtedly a wholesale policy of curtailment. Country districts deeply resent these curtailments of services, some of which have been enjoyed for ten, fifteen, and twenty years. They wonder why, having regard to the increase in taxation, and the many additional contributions demanded of them, they are deprived of these facilities. The Postmaster-General has been an enthusiast in postal matters for many years, and has doubtless a standard up to which he feels he must live. He may have made good from his point of view, but it is at the cost of impoverished services in the country districts. If it is a considered policy of the Government that every Minister shall conduct his Department from a revenue point of view, then I urge its reconsideration. The Postal Department ought not to be run like an ordinary business which has to provide a profit, because it is not a commercial Department, but one created to provide certain facilities for the public. If it be necessary to increase the cost of those"" services, in Heaven's namelet us increase it, but give us the services. There are districts which are prepared to contribute more revenue if required; and the charge for the delivery of letters might, if necessary, be increased. A t present a letter is delivered in Melbourne for Id., and in Capricornia at the same charge. However, as I say, that is a matter of policy for the Government, but it is more in the parcels post system that the disadvantages are felt. It costs as much to deliver from Apsley, Victoria, a parcel in Frances, South Australia, about eighteen miles from the border, as it does to deliver one in the Northern Territory; and that surely is not I can understand that; common sense. policy that is inferentially suggested is that it means'penny postage in the city, and twopenny postage in the country. parcels are concerned; the delivery of parcels ought to be on a different basis from that of letters. factor, the city can get its work done cheaper because of proximity. necessary, more should be charged for the delivery of letters in war time than is charged now, and I am sure that a twopenny postage would not be felt by anybody. rally by the theory of equalization. that out of the money we are appropriating, or-as that is all spent-ou t of the Treasurer's Advance, a suflicient sum be set aside for the Postmaster-General to work on, so that he may not be restricted in his operations by considerations of revenue alone. Let there be a policy under which the Postmaster General may afford r some compensation in the way of postal facilities for the disadvantageous conditions under which people reside in the far-back country districts. For this purpose something like Â£250,000 might be provided, even at the present time. As I say, I suggest",106,Estimates 1917 18

It is not a matter of spending money, but one of sensible administration on the part of the Postal Department or the Railway Department, as the case may be. I remember reading some time ago about the Postmaster General getting up at 3 o'clock in the morning to do certain work, and, considering that he is so energetic, it is surwith a view to an alteration of the system prising that he should object to attend in the chamber at half-past .1 o'clock in the morning to see his Estimates through. Up to a few moments ago I had intended moving a reduction of this item, but in response to the kindly expressed solicitations of the Acting Prime Minister, I forbear. I must, however, ask the honourable gentleman to place before the Postmaster-Generalas forcibly as he can the matter to which I refer. I asked some time ago if the practice of sending mails by train from one station to another had been discontinued, and the Postmaster-General, saying that certain action had been taken, parried my question by declaring that it was impossible to continue the old order of things. When a man says that it is impossible to do something that has been done for a number of years it looks as though he were trying to dodge a difficulty, or placing rather a low estimate on the intelligence of the man he is talking to. General that there must be a. change, for the people will not stand present conditions any longer. number of instances, one of which is in my own division. If a person posts a letter at Oxenford for Coomera-onl y a mile away-it has first to.be sent to Brisbane, and travels a matter of 100 miles before it reaches it3 destination. Then, the metropolitan journals are sent to Ipswich, from which place they are distributed by agents. Under the present absurd regulation, if one of these newspapers is posted in Ipswich for Bundamba, Ebbw Vale, or neighbouring towns, it has-, as in the case of a letter, to go first' to Brisbane, and then be brought back for delivery. Mail matteitravels three times over the same line before the addressees get it , and as a result Saturday's paper is not delivered until the .following Monday. (Moreton) [1.26 The whole trouble seems to be due to an absurd award of the Inter-iState Commission, under which, I understand, all mail packages are now carried at parcels rates. When a package is sent from one station to the next, it is charged at the minimum parcel rate, and it can be readily imagined that the Postal Department cannot afford to send extra mails at that rate. I want the Acting Prime Minister to give me the assurance that there will be a conference .with the railway authorities of the States by amicable arrangement, and that the mails may be carried as of old on a mileage, or some other rate than the parcels rate. the subject, though I know that the matter was dealt with by the Interstate Commission. much about it.
