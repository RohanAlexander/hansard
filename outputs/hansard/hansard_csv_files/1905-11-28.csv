21,Mr Glynn,"I do not remember thatsion from the Bill. as well to remind honourable members of the real object of trade marks, because that question will affect the constitutionality of this Bill, if it ever becomes law. I do not wish to repeat my former arguments at any length, but I should like to direct attention to the fact that, according to judicial decisions, the object of trade marks is to indicate that the registered proprietor of a trade mark is such by virtue of manufacture, selection, certification, dealing with or offering for sale. Sebastian says that a trade mark isboth a sign of the qualify of the article, and an assurance to the public that it is the genuine product of his manufacture. So that by virtue of the fact that it is the registered proprietor's trade mark, the public may assume that the goods are of a certain quality and finish. No such assumption could be based on a trade union label. I do not say that the work turned out by union workmen may not be of a very excellent character. The fact that they are paid higher wages should insure better work, because, as a rule, the better the wages, the more satisfactory the product of the workmen. The union label would not necessarily indicate anything so far as quality or finish are concerned, whereas the object of the trade mark is to afford these guarantees to the public. not always indicate ""the quality or finish of the goods. indicated on the trade mark itself, but its object is to show that the goods are the product of a particular manufacturer or trader whose business standing as one who has always turned out goods of first class finish and quality gives some assurance to the public that they are getting value for their money. No such guarantee can be given by a union label. Al l that is conve)'ed is that the goods are made by workmen who are members of the trade union. The employer could have no right to a trade mark, except for the purposes I have indicated. tained without inquiring as. to the use to which they are to be put. under the BillI moveI suggest at present under State legislation. member's pardon. He must know more Perhaps it would! be than I do upon that point if his statement be correct. amendment prior to that which the honourable and learned member has indicated his intention) of submitting. amendments to propose. ing my amendment for the present. I wish to direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the terminology of the clause, which' may prove offensive to the Judges of the States Supreme Courts. The insertion of ""the words ""or Judge"" in the first paragraph of the clause, makes a distinction between Justices of the High Court and Judges of the Supreme Courts. . The Attorney-General knows that the Supreme Court Justices are so termed, and I should be satisfied if the words "" or Judge"" were left out. There was no intention on the part of this Parliament, when creating the High Court, to deprive the Supreme Court Justices of any of their titles. I know that their Honours appreciate the use of the word '^'Justice"" instead of ""Judge."" The Attorney-General is not to blame in this matter, because the same wording was adopted when the Bill was submitted to Parliament last year. I move That the words "" or Judge,"" line 6; be omitted. I am thoroughly in accord with the intention of the honourable and learned member, and I think that some such amendment should be made. I would point out, however, that the language follows that' adopted in the Judiciary and other Acts of this Parliament. cause in several cases the word "" Judge"" was struck out at mv instance. the meaning of the word "" thereof "" would be perfectly clear, if the clause were amended as proposed, but apparently it would.

Amendment agreed to. move the amendment which I have indicated my intention of submitting. orable and learned member wishes to insert a definition of ""trade mark."" insert the definition in its proper alphabeti0 cal order in the clause ? ought to define trade mark before we define the clasps of trade mark with which we are proposing to deal. That is what is done in English legislation. When I found that the draftsman had adopted another method 1 I did not at first propose to interfere with it, but I have since recognised the importance of moving my amendment out of its alphabetical order. I have already quoted one or two definitions, of "" trade mark,"" in order to show what objects, such' marks are intended to achieve. I now wish to refer to the judgment of Lord Esher in the case of Richards v. Butcher, 1891, II . Chancery Div., page 543You use the thing as a trade mark if you use it in business, or, as it is often said, in the marbut there was no definition in what are ket, as a mark to denote your goods, and to distinguish them from the goods of any one else. Is it to be supposed that the union label would effect this purpose? I understand that the measure is not intended to shift property, but to indicate where the property really is. According to Lord Esher the primary object of a trade mark is to indicate certain articles as the goods of the owner of the trade mark. Then Kerly saysThe protection afforded to trade marks has for its object the protection of trade only. T h a t is significant In Batt and. Co. v. Dunnett, Lord Halsbury, in the course of the argument, observed : The Trade Marks Acts are not for copyright in marks; they are to protect trade marks. If you have no goods you are claiming copyright only, you are not claiming for the purpose of protecting your trade. When you begin to dissociate the ownership of the goods in the sense Used from the ownership of the mark you are merely claiming copyright. Thus, if the union label provisions mean anything they will amount to a claim of copyright as against: other persons. learned member argue that provision for union labels should be made in the Copy-, right Bill? to anywhere; if they were provided for in that Bill they would still be objected to! very proper to question the constitutionality of making any such provision in that Bill. But in England, where the question of constitutionality could not arise, Lord Halsbury's dictum to the effect that a label is not necessarily a trade mark cannot be questioned. But what is claimed in this case is virtually a copyright. Under the Imperial Trade Marks Act of 1905, if a person be an expert examiner of goods, he can register his trade mark. That is the only exception made by recent English legislation. Bill the union label provisions? bring the Bill into harmony with the latest English legislation. The earlier English' Acts dealing with this subject contained no definitions. It is true that there was a definition in one Act which was incorporated with the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, only for the purposes of that Act, known as the Registration Acts, and the' measure under consideration is, in essence, a Registration. Bill. The English Bill of 1904, However, did include a well-drawn definition, wh'ich is embodied in the Act of 1905. That definition, I think, was suggested after an examination of the Bill by experts. I believe that a Committee of the House of Commons inquired into this matter in 1904-5, so that the amendments made by recent legislation were made with great deliberation best legal thought on the matter. that. I have examined the evidence which was taken by that Committee, and I can see that the amendments which have been/",14,Trade Marks Bill

49,Mr Glynn,"There is no doubt ofmade in the earlier English legislation have been deliberately made with the object of bringing the trade marks legislation of the -old country right up to date. Honourable members, I think, will recognise the effect of omitting from this Bill the definition which I propose to insert, and which readsA "" trade mark"" shall mean a mark used or proposed to be used upon or in connection with goods for the purpose of indicating that Ihey are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark, by virtue of manufacture, selection, and certification dealing with or offering for sale. I say that the effect of inserting that definition will be to confine-the B ill to its proper scope, so that it shall deal only with trade marks which are truly such, in that they indicate, as I have already mentioned, ownership of goods, in the sense defined, or expert examination of goods. finition may have been accidental. when one looks at other portions of a Bill., and finds that a similar accident has led to a like result there, one is naturally inclined to be a little suspicious of the object which the draftsman had in view. For instance, clause 16, which deals with the essential particulars of trade marks, providesThe essentialparticulars of a registrable trade indicates that the proprietor of a distincmark shall be one or more of the following particulars :(c) A distinctive device, mark, brand, heading, label, or ticket. Now, the words "" mark, brand, heading, label, or ticket,"" are not to be found in the latest English legislationi. though undoubtedly they are contained in section 64 of the English Act of 1888. Consequently I am at least entitled to say that this Bill is not up to date. Some people would be inclined to surmise that these words have been inserted-ignorin g the later English legislation-in order to fit in with the union label clause. learned member suggest that? might surmise that. These words-whic h have been left out of the EnglishA c t have been inserted, but to compensate for the words that have been inserted the -draftsman has omitted a definition of -""distinctive"" marks. .learned member say that the words "" label "" and "" ticket "" are left out of the latest English Act? the honourable and learned gentleman that. learned member look at the interpretation section of the English Act? will allow me, I have already given one definition from that section. member's statement is quite wrong,. it is the duty of the Attorney-General to set me right. However, I intend to deal with the points as they present themselves to me. I am referring now to the essential particulars of trade marks, and the Attorney-General is alluding to the definition of "" mark,"" in the interpretation section of the English Act. I say that the word "" distinctive "" is not included in that The omission of this deAct as a special definition of distinctive But mark. member stated that the words "" label "" and "" ticket "" had been: left out of the English Act. as it is used in the English Act, accomplishes practically the same result as does the definition of trade mark in this B ill . It tive mark is also the proprietor of the goods. The definition is not inserted in the English Act amongst the general definitions, but it is specially included in section 9 which deals with the essential particulars of trade marks, and which readsFor the purposes of this section "" distinctive "" shall mean adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark from those of other persons. My argument is that in the union label clauses this special distinction is omitted for the benefit of a particular section. should be designed to exclude a particular section. I said that some people man has adopted the provision which is contained in the English Act. That clause readsA trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods or classes of goods as prescribed. The Attorney-General, however, proposes to substitute "" may "" for "" must.""

Surely the honourable and learned member is not only entitled, but bound, in fairness to the Committee, to give his reasons for proposing the insertion of a definition which will have the limiting effect that he has pointed out. I think that it will considerably facilitate debate if the honourable and learned member is allowed to give the reasons why he believes the definition that he proposes to insert will exclude certain classes of' marks. That is absolutely germane to the amendment. I submit! that he is entitled to reffer to the effects of leaving in the Bill the provisions relating to those marks, as contradistinguished from a proposal to omit them. tion which the honourable and learned member is arguing, there is one point which to my mind is fatal. Eveni f we inserted the definition which the honourable and learned member for Angas proposes, providing in effect that "" trade mark"" shall not include trade union marks, it would not carry us any further, because we find at the beginning of clause 4, the words, "" except where otherwise clearly intended."" Therefore, the amendment would not apply to another part of the Bill where the clear intention was to the contrary. It is useless, to contend tliat reasons may be given why the definition in this clause will or will not include anything else, because it would be perfectly opein to us, under the interpretation clause, to insert anything else that we .please, unless it is otherwise clearly intended. Those words govern the whole matter. My next point is, that whilst the honourable and learned member might be at liberty to show what the amendment would include, and what it would not, he has really been roaming all over the Bill. intention of expatiating on the measure at length. Sometimes an interjection will develop a thesis which one never intended to discuss. In conclusion, I will quote from the report of«the Industrial Commission for 1901, vol. 17, page 627-8, which shows that trade' unioni labels are considered not to be true trade marks. American Commission ? mission. the trade union label is unknown outside the United States. members to allow the honourable and learned' member to proceed without interruption. In Committee honourable members are allowed to speak as often as they please on any particular clause, so that they have ample opportunity to express their views. wish to quote is as follows: The union label has during the past ten or fifteen years become an increasingly common device among labour organizations to influence consumers to buy union made goods, and thus to induce employers to use exclusively union labour. Nearly all of the States have adopted statutes allowing the registration of .union labels and trade marks, and providing for the punishment of persons using these labels without authority. Statutes of this sort, of course, differ from the ordinary laws regarding trade marks, since the union working man is not the owner of the article to which he affixes the label, but simply contributes his labour towards its manufacture. According to the report of the Commission, trade union labels are not considered trade marks, and consequently Congress has not legislated in respect to them, because its power of legislation extends only to trade marks. The Statutes passed in the United States authorizing the use of the trade union labels are State Statutes. The States have not power to deal with trade marks, but Congress has. deal with trade marks within their own areas. the States have both power to deal with trade marks,, but once a Commonwealth"" Act is passed! overriding the concurrent State legislation, the latter goes to the wall. America the States have an exclusive, not a concurrent, power in regard to their own areas. respecting trade union labels is State, not Federal, legislation. Acts have been passed by the Legislatures of the States, not merely legalizing the use of trade uniort labels, but even rendering it compulsory to brand Government goods, as having been made by union labour; though upon that branch of the subject.

The omission of this definition is, in my opinion, a blot on the perfection of the measure. That the following words be added :"" A 'trade mark' shall mean a mark used or proposed to be used upon or in connection with goods for the purpose of indicating that they are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark by virtue of manufacture, selection, and certification dealing with or offering for sale."" I should like to explain to the honourable and learned member for Angas that the Bill was drafted about fifteen months ago, before the English definition to which he has referred existed. Therefore it is hardly fair to blame the Attorney-General for its omission, especially as he had nothing to do with the drafting' of the measure.

It isa mistake to suppose that the trade marks provisions pure and simple are intended for the protection of employers only. The employees will have the same privilege that will attach to employers, so long as they can claim the ownership of the goods to which the trade mark is to be applied. The Bill proposes, however, to adopt a principle which will conflictwith the rights of the owners, of the goods. It is proposed to give to a body of men the power to affix a label to certain goods, because they have been at one stage or another engaged in their production. Itmight be possible to affix thirty labels to some classes of goods. We should define the meaning of "" trade mark,"" firstly, in order that we may know where we stand, and, secondly, with a view to avoiding litigation.

It may be open to Mr Speaker to say, "" I cannot rule this or that out of order, and therefore it may be inserted;"" but the High Court will confine itself to the consideration of the power which we possess to deal with these matters. If the High Court held the union label clauses to be outside the Constitution, nothing that we might do would help us. That is one of the difficulties with which the Attorney-General has been confronted in taking up those clauses, and I think that he has made a mistake. It would be wise for the Committee to accept the amendment, as it would render litigation to determine the effect of our legislation in this respect wholly unnecessary. Unless we have a cleaT definition of "" trade mark,"" it will be impossible to say whether manv of the subsequent clauses relate to trade marks or union labels. The Committee, however, does not appear to be prepared to give any consideration to this point, and two or three years hence I shall be able once more to show that another blunder has been committed by the Parliament. We are entering upon an evil course in refusing to define what we mean. If the question be left for the determination of the High Court, thousands of pounds of the workers' Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. funds will be expended in litigation necessary to obtain an interpretation of the law, and the Court will doubtless declare that the Parliament was evidently unable to make up its mind on the point, inasmuch as it refused to give a clear definition of its intention. I shouldjike to make one or two observations regarding the amendment. I take it that it is our duty when, as a Federal Parliament, we seek to cover the whole ground relating to trade marks-so that there shall be no collision between State and Federal legislation on the subjectto see that we do cover the whole ground. It is for this reason that we use the words "" trade marks."" When we simply use those words, we cover whatever ground the Constitution gives us in this regard, and do The Constitution not leave any room for doubt as to there being only a portion of the field touched by 'the CommonwealthLegislature, and another portion occupied by the States. I take it' that the object Of the framers of the Constitution in giving us this power, was to enable us, if we legislated at all in regard to the question, to so legislate as to cover the whole field and secure uniformity. It is for this reason that we have not given any definition. We cannot extend the meaning of the words ""trade marks"" as used in the Constitution, and we certainly do not wish to limit it. A definition is an excellent thing when the Parliament has power to cover as wide a field as it pleases, or to limit the scope of its law to whatever extent it chooses; but whatever may be the meaning of the words "" trade marks "" as used in the Constitution, we cannot go beyond it, and we have, therefore, refrained from inserting in this Bill an interpretation of those words. When I use the word "" we/."" I have no desire to claim credit for myself; credit is due really to the draftsman. The Bill was framed, not by the late Government, but by their predecessors, and there seem to have been very good reasons for refraining from giving a definition of these words. Another point is that uniform language is not employed in the trade mark legislation of the various States. In the New South Wales Act it is set forth that "" trade mark "" includes so and so; in the Trade Marks Act of another State no definition of the words is given, whilst in the legislation of still another State it is provided that ''trade mark"" means a trade mark registered under this Act.

We wish to cover the whole of the ground included by the use! of the words ""trade marks"" in the Constitution, but we could not, even if we desired, go beyond that. If we cover all trade marks, we cover all States Acts dealing with trade marks. altogether from the difficulties I have pointed out, there is one other very important consideration. I am sure that the honourable and learned member for Angas does not wish to act unfairly; but according to his. own showing the acceptance of his amendment would determine the question of the insertion of provisions relating to workers' trade marks. It would not be fair to have that question decided until it had been properly discussed, and I hold that it cannot be so discussed at this stage.

It is not my intention to discuss it until I can do so effectively, so that I shall bef able to put clearly before the country the views of the Government. It would not be fair to the Committee or to the country to have on this clause, so to speak, a snatch vote upon that question. would not, in my opinion, decide the matter, and, therefore, the honourable and learned member's object would not be achieved. Apart from that question, however, it would be a mistake to insert an interpretation which could not widen, but might, on the other hand, shorten, the application of the Bill. If we do not simply adheres to the use of the words ""trade marks,"" we may possibly fall short of the power given us by the Constitution, and thereby throw the States into confusion. I trust that that will not be done, but that we shall follow the course adopted by the last two Governments, both of which, for what I think are< practical reasons, refrained from inserting in the Bill a definition of the words. ficult for a layman to follow the devious assisfj us to indicate clearly what constiarguments of lawyers on a subject like tutes a trade mark. this. I can speak on the amendment of ""the honourable and learned member for Angas only from the stand-point of an ordinary business man, and it seems to me that stand the honourable and learned member [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. the measure should contain a distinct definition of a trade mark. The Attorney General takes up the position that any definition will reduce the possible applicability of the Bill to the conditions which may obtain in the various States, but that does not seem a satisfying reason why we should make no effort to determine what is henceforth to be understood by the term "" trade mark."" The honourable and learned gentleman 'told us that, when the Committee came to deal with the union label provisions, he would take us into his confiApart dence, and explain the whole position, and I hope that when he has made that explanation, he will give us an opportunity, in the event of the amendment not being carried, to come back to this clause, and insert in it a definition of a trade mark. I know that it is idle for any one who does not possess a legally-trained mind to go into the devious paths of trade marks legislation, but I hope that, in the interests of the commercial and trading community, the Committee will make the provisions of the to resort to the Courts for an interpretation of their meaning. Therefore I feel that we are justified in asking the Attorney General to determine wha't constitutes a trade mark. I think that the honourable and learned member for Angas has done well in asking the Committee to adopt the English definition, to which the Attorney-GeneIn any event, it ral objects on the ground that it may limit the scope of the measure. What we desire is, not to pass the Bill merely to give effect to the trade union clauses which have caused so much obstruction, but to place on the statute-book a measure which will be of benefit to the whole community. Surely the Attorney-General, whose intellectual ability is unquestioned, will help us in doing 'that, and will place us in possession of the information which he can obtain from the capable officers of his Department.

The honourable and learned member for Angas interjected when the Attorney-General was speaking that section 62 of the English Act separates ownership of goods from ownership of a trade mark. It is proposed to practically embody that section in the Bill.

I agree with the Attorney-General that, in view of present conditions, it would not be wise to define a trade mark here, seeing that, for some considerable time, we must carry on the Trade Marks Acts of the States.

The honourable member thinks that this is not the stage at which to discuss the merits of the trade union label provisions, in which I agree with him, because, as the Attorney-General has pointed out, we cannot by definition limit any subsequent provisions of the Bill unless we delete the words "" except where otherwise clearly intended.""

187,I Mr Kelly,"A t present we know the866 earlier in the debate, that each State had its own Trade Marks Act, and that the usages which have prevailed hitherto in the various States would be seriously interfered with if we limited our very wide powers over trade marks generally. I agree with him in his axiom, but not in his deduction. He assumes that we should interfere as little as possible with the trade mark users in the States, but surely we could make the definition wide enough to cover all the different usages in the States, and no more. If we adopt that plan, the holders of trade marks will know exactly where they stand, but if we omit to define trade marks, we shall lead to endless l it i gation. Surely we should not render it necessary for persons to go before the Courts, in order to ascertain their true positions. The Attorney-General told us that any interpretation of the Constitution would necessarily involve immense litigation. never reach any certainty in regard to many of these matters without some reference to the Courts. _ as far as possible to prevent appeals to the Courts. we can do that is by adopting a definition of the term ""trade mark,"" wide enough in itself to embrace all the existing usages in the Commonwealth, and yet not so wide as to leave room for doubt as to our meaning. I do not see why the Attorney-General should object to that course being adopted. I can understand the fear of the honourable members of the Labour Party that any limitation of our powers might prove fatal to the inclusion of the union label proposals; but no such result could accrue from the adoption of the amendment. All we should have to do would be to adopt some wider definition of ""trade union label."" the Attorney-General will see his way to accept the amendment, because it is our duty to make our meaning plain, and to avoid giving rise to complaints that owing to the want of definiteness in our legislation, the public are put to considerable expense in bringing actions at law. say a few words in reference to the remarks of the Attorney-General. He has argued that we should leave the Constitution to operate to the fullest extent of the Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. powers given to us under it , and that if we adopted a definition, those powers might be limited. That argument would also apply to the .definition adopted in the English legislation. The Constitution Act is an Imperial Statute, and the words "" trade marks"" contained therein will be interpreted according to the signification attached to them in England at the time the Act was passed. In 1901, when the Constitution Act came into force, we had various States laws, all based upon English common law, with statutory modifications ; and if I remember aright, the New South Wales Act would exclude union labels, because trade marks could not be registered by any class, but must be registered by a "" person,"" which would include a company. Surely we ought to define what we mean, and not perpetuate the state of ambiguity which existed prior to the passing of the Trade Marks Act in England in 1905. It was in order to get rid of these ambiguities, and the somewhat conflicting decisions, that that Act was passed, and we should commit a great mistake if we failed to accept a definition It should be our object which is a digest of the best of the English decisions. The draftsman .of the B i ll before us may have omitted a definition of I agree with that. "" trade mark,"" because the B ill was first The best way in which drafted in 1903, up to which time there was no English Registration Act that contained a definition of ""trade mark."" We shouM certainly take advantage of the very deliberate judgment of experts as to what is a trade mark. If we include the proposed definition, the B ill will embrace everything covered by the English definition, and if union labels come within the scope of that definition, they will be trade marks. If union labels can be registered as trade marks by virtue of proprietorship, which mav exist in regard to certain classes of goods, we shall not require express clauses to bring them within the provisions of this I hope that B ill ; because, if they are true trade marks, they will come within the scope of the measure in any Case. If they are not true trade marks, we cannot include them within the scope of tbe measure by means of the provisions in Part VII . Apparently the object of these provisions is to give a bias by legislation to the definition of trade marks, and to express our opinion that when the Constitution Act came into force, the definition of trade marks covered union labels.

192,Mr Glynn (Angas),"I should like tois that if under the law of 1901, union labels were not trade marks, our legislation cannot make them such. Not one clause in the 'Bill would legalize the use of union labels, unless they were true trade marks. I would remind the Committee that when I asked the Attorney-General whether this definiton was perfectly consistent with the union label clauses he hesitated to say that it was. My original point was that it would be inconsistent with those provisions. I am aware that in England very conflicting decisions have been given as to what is the real meaning of "" proprietorship "" and ""ownership "" in goods. But that some provision is necessary is as clear as daylight. That is evidenced by the fact that clause 22A, as framed by the Attorney-General, is practically a copy of section 62 of the Imperial Act of 1905, which) was introduced to meet the case of an expert who had been held to have no right of proprietorship in the case of certain goods. Owing to a doubt having arisen as to whether an expert who examined goods and certified as to their origin, mode of manufacture, and so forth-that is to say, whether they were hand-made or machine-made-ha d a right to a trade mark in respect of those goods, the law was declared in section 62 of the Imperial Act of 1905. had a right to a trade mark? was. and learned member referring? expert examiner of goods. A declaratory section was introduced into the English Act, providing that an expert's relationship to such goods justifies the use of a trade mark. able and learned member's amendment inconsistent with the trade mark proposals? with the union label provisions of the Bill, but it is perfectly consistent with trade marks minus those conditions, Kerly saysIn some cases it is difficult to decide what the precise meaning of a trade mark is; for instance, wheTeA has selected and imported goods made by B for many years, and has sold them under a particular trade mark. IfA has been the sole importer, does the reputation of the mark refer to his selection and importation, or to B's manuthat we must not attempt to cure defects of facture? Such a question arose in Hirsch v. Jonas. There the plaintiff bought cigars of a foreign maker, who, at his request, placed a label bearing the words Gloria de Znglaterra Havannah, which had been designed and registered as his copyright by the plaintiff, upon the boxes. Subsequently the maker began to supply to the defendants for sale in the market similar cigars, not purchased by the plaintiff, but bearing the same label, and this the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought to restrain. The name of the plaintiff did not appear on the boxes, but that of the maker did. "" The trade mark of manufactured goods,"" said Jessel, M.R., ""means, I suppose, that the goods are manufactured by the person whose trade mark it purports to be. I can understand a man saying, ' I am not the actual manufacturer of goods, but the selector of goods, and my reputation for cleverness and selection is so great, that goods marked with a mark to show that they have been selected and approved of by me will fetch a higher price in the market.'"" The point at issue was : ' Was such a man, 1 seeing that he had not a direct ownership in the goods, entitled to register his mark under the Imperial Trade Marks Acts of 1883 and 1888 "" ? It was held that he was entitled to register. But to set the matter beyond all doubt a section was introduced which, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says, covers the question of the union label. covered the principle. that even members of the Ministry held that the principle of the union label clauses is affirmed by section 62 of the Imperial Act, I say that that provision has nothing to do with that principle. If there were any doubt upon the point, why was it embodied in a separate part of the Act? The English provision is practically identical with clause 22 of this Bill. The object of section 62 of the Imperial Act was to cover the case thus put by Sebastian, third edition, page s :Again, a trade mark may be so composed as to indicate that the goods have been examined ""and selected by a person of known ability, so that they have attributed to them such value as his approval can give, and his reputation depends on their corresponding to their alleged quality. That covers exactly the case which section 62 of the English Act is designed to meet. I contend that this definition is inconsistent with the union label clauses of this Bill. But, apart from that consideration, it is a definition which ought to be inserted. It declares, exactly what we mean by a trade mark, and its insertion will save an immense amount of litigation. The Attorney-General says the law arising from ambiguity for fear that we may exceed' our legislative powers as defined by the Constitution. I contend",27,Trade Marks Bill

In all our legislation we should aim at simplicity. save an enormous amount of litigation. to the legal profession, but we have to consider not the legal profession, but the interests of the general public. I should like to read to the Committee the definition of "" trade mark,"" which is. contained in Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy. It is as follows :The term "" trade mark"" denotes a distinctive mark or device, showing that tlie article to which it is affixed is manufactured or sold by a certain house or firm. By recent statutes a trade mark must consist of or contain at least one of the f o l probably exclude them; but the Attorneylowing essential particularsIt then repeats practically the provisions of clause 16 of the Bill under consideration. To my mind, no harm can result from the adoption of the amendment. I would further point out that this Bill is not intended to benefit any particular section of the community. by everybody. No matter how poor a man may be, he is at liberty to register a trade mark, so long as this Bill is confined to the true purposes of such a measure; but the moment we introduce the union label clauses it becomes a Bill which is intended to benefit' unionists only. _ Therefore, I trust that the amendment will be adopted. think that the honourable and learned member for Angas. has made out a very strong case in favour of tfie""-adopfion of this defintion. As the"" Bill will be very largelyused by laymen, I think we should be acting wisely by making our intentions as clear as possible. I was surprised to hear 'the honourable and learned member for Angas admit that his definition was inconsistent with the union label clauses of the Bill. the same opinion, and if so, I can understand his opposition to it. If we do not clearly define our intentions in this measure, we shall foster litigation, which is always an undesirable thing. I hope that Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. the Attorney-General will accept the definition, especially as he disagrees with the view of the honourable and learned member for Angas that it would exclude the union label clauses of the Bill. I do not mean to suggest that I approve of those clauses, but taking the Attorney-General's own statement, I think that he ought to accept the amendment. By so doing we shall that the Attorney-General has not yet agreed to accept the amendment. member was not present when I gave my reasons for refusing to accept it. veyed to me, but I do not know why the honourable and learned gentleman should hesitate to accept the amendment.

I think that the definition is inconsistent with the union label clauses, and would General has pointed out that it would apply only "" except where otherwise clearly intended."" The honourable and learned gentleman has said that if we pass clauses authorizing the registration of union labels, we shall thereby show that it was otherwise clearly intended, and that consequently Its provisions can be availed of this definition will not prevent their inclusion in the Bill. Therefore, if his own argument be correct, he can have no fear in that regard. I presume that he cannot complain of being judged in this respect on his own words. The insertion of this amendment would furnish a reason for not introducing in the Bill what I regard as matters foreign to it.

After many years' experience, the Imperial Parliament, after dropping it for a time, has deliberately adopted a definition of "" trade mark."" The purpose is to define as clearly as possible the object at which a measure is being directed. It seems to me that the desirableness of leaving out a definition which would have the great advantage of showing to some extent the boundary lines within which the Bill is to operate, should be justified by argument. The burden of proof does not rest upon those who wish to follow the English precedent, and if the Attorney-General's contentions have been correctly reported to me, it would appear that he has not correctly established that proof. On the one hand, if he says that this definition will not exclude the union label clauses, he can have no objection to it on that score. his contention that it will not interfere with the union label clauses, which he has so much at heart, and which, at intervals, he has presented to us in a new dress, made in each case out of the old material. But, apart from that, it is desirable that we should follow the example set us by those who have had more experience than we have had. I do not suggest that they are better able than we are to form a judgment on the same material, but that they have more material than .we have upon which to come to a conclusion. I therefore regret to find the Attorney-General taking up an attitude of unwillingness honourable and learned memberis fully seized of the reasons I gave for opposing the amendment. thinks that the Bill will be better without this definition. there are a number of States Acts whose definitions vary secondly, that there must be great uncertainty as to the meaning of this definition. as to the meaning of the definition than there would be ' if no definition were inserted as to the scope of the Bill.

The question of whether a trade device is or is not a trade mark for Australia will thus _ depend updri what used to be the law in the State in which the case arose.

It is essential that we should have a definition, in order to show what devices are to be registrable.

The effect of the ramifications of business transactions on that ownership is another and a distinct matter. I think the definition covers, and is intended to indicate, ownership in its broadest sense, whether ownership in the way of manufacture, or of purchase, or of dealing with or offering for sale. At some point there.must be ownership and proprietorship of the goods to which the trade mark applies. Therefore, I think that the union label provisions, which are quite foreign to the purpose of a Trade Marks Bill, should be dealt with in a separate measure. Moreover, since we are anxious to fall into line with the rest of the Empire in connection with trade matters, and as it is part of the policy of this Government to assimilate our trade and commerce more and more with that of the rest of the Empire, to the exclusion of trade outside it, the nearer we can. assimilate our laws governing trade to the English laws, the better it will be. The broad point which I make is that the definition proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas was adopted by the Imperial Parliament within the last six months. that they have very strong trade organizations in the old country. We were told the other night by the honourable member for Yarra that the union label is in use in Great Britain, and has had this and that good result, or, in other words, that it is operative. Yet there is no mention of it in the English' Trade Marks Act, nor was any opportunity given for dealing with it when the Bill was passing through the House of Commons. that the subject was raised then, although there is a good contingent of Labour members there who would have been likely to insist upon the matter being dealt with if they thought it proper to deal with it in such a measure. The fact that the subject was not raised is the clearest proof that they regard it as a matter which should not be dealt with in a Trade Marks The Bill, but, if necessary, in a separate and distinct measure. I think that we cannot do better than follow Imperial precedent. The Attorney-General, in reply to the honourable and learned member for Corinella, said that if the definition were inserted it would be contended that it applied to the provisions of each of the Trade Marks Acts of the States. That might, perhaps., be so, if the definition clause did not comwise clearly intended."" place where it would be clearly intended to the contrary. it might be clearly intended to the contrary in any other part of the Bill. Personally I do not see that the adoption of the amendment would exclude the trade union provisions from the scope of the Bill, unless it can be argued that the words, "" except where otherwise clearly intended,"" imply a limitation, and cover only matters germane to the Bill, and relating to trade marks pure and simple. Looking at them broadly, they might cover anything that might be put into the Bill. Indeed, I am at a loss to understand why these words are used in every definition clause. I take it that it is not good drafting to use such a provision, though I admit that some very eminent draftsmen have used it. They do not, however, seem to use such words in the English legislation, where the definnitions are very precise, as all definitions should be. It must not be forgotten of work to the lawyers in England as we do here? make their own work. If a number of lawyers are let loose on the simplest matter, they soon make it appear difficult and occult. There is this clear distinction, between English Statutes and ours-that in 'the English Acts the definitions are clear and definite. One of the unfortunate results of making I have not heard our definition clauses so loose and vague is that anything mav be introduced into a Bill. In my opinion, however, an Act of Parliament should be very precise, not only in its definitions, but also in its text. One measure should not re-enact the provisions of another.

(2) The application shall, subject to paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of this section, be dealt with in the same manner as other applications for registration of trade marks.

(6) The registration of the trade mark under a State Trade Marks Act shallcease upon its registration under this Act. this clause is deserving of a good deal of bers.

This section purports to cover it, but I am not sure that when it specifically does so, a subsequent general clause may be invoked. I submit this point to the Attorney-General as a matter of immediate importance, and suggest to him that he will be able to recommit the clause if he thinks it necessary, to do so. At present, I think that it is desirable to insert either something showing that ""the general rectification provisions shall apply to the correcting of an error of the kind I have mentioned, or some special provision.

Let us suppose, further, that the proprietor of the trade mark registered in Victoria got his mark extended oyer the Commonwealth, but that in the registration a limitation was made so that it should not apply to Western Australia. I take it that that would mean that the Victorian proprietor must not sell his goods under that mark in Western Australia.

Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -Claus e 8 allows the registered proprietor of a trade mark properly registered under the Trade Marks Act of a State to apply for registration under the B ill ; but a diffiwho are the proprietors of trade marks will culty is created by the fact that in many cases the same trade mark has been registered by different persons in different States. The Attorney-General has taken some pains to protect the rights of such persons, though he seems to think that such cases are not common. My own experience tells me-and I have probably had as much experience in this matter as any member of the Committee-that they are common. happen to know that a star-to take the illustration of which he made use-ha s been registered as a trade mark in several of 8 the States. The question therefore arises, how are the rights of manufacturers in If one of different States who have registered the same trade mark to be determined when application is made for a Commonwealth trade mark? Let me take a set of facts which are within my own knowledge. A was manufacturing in four States under several trade marks, all of which were regisSubtered in each of those States. His business was disposed of separately, B buying the Let us New South Wales business, C the Victorian business, D the South Australian business, and E the Tasmanian business. The purchasers in two at least of the four States are trading with the remaining two States, Queensland and Western Australia, and have a common user of the trade marks in those States. It seems to me that it will be difficult to determine their rights when they apply for a Commonwealth registration. The Bill appears to protect their rights so far as the States in which' they are manufacturing, and in which their trade marks are now registered, are concerned. But suppose they apply for a If be had Federal registration to cover the States of Queensland and Western Australia, what will their position be? exclusive right in the case of Queensland or Western Australia. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -If they both trade in those States? be the same as it is now. I think, so far as I can Mr G. B. EDWARDS -What protection will they have against other persons in those States?

EDWARDS -No doubt all 1 endeavour to obtain a Commonwealth registration, but if the parties to whom I have referred apply for such registration, how will their rights be determined?

Besides, the adI would give priministration of this measure would raise highly technical questions, very different from those which are raised in connection with the ordinary business of the Department of Trade and Customs, and,, therefore, the measure, if it must be allotted to anyi one Minister, should be given to the Attorney-General.

When the Federal Patent Office was established, a number of Patent Attorneys urged that the Commissioner should possess legal qualifications, because the questions that would come before him would require the application of a skilled legal mind. lowed; and, although the present Commissioner is a capable and obliging officer, his want of technical legal knowledge is a great drawback. The Registrar of Trade Marks should certainly be a highly qualified lawyer. It is not sufficient that difficult points should be referred to the Attorney-General. of officials is not to refer any but the most -difficult matters to the law adviser of the -Government, and it becomes the practice of individuals possessing no legal training to settle technical matters for themselves, and very frequently provoke litigation. We should follow in the footsteps of Victoria, and place the Trade Marks Office under the administrative guidance of the Attorney-General. I make no reflections upon the present Minister of Trade and Customs, or his predecessors; but I contend that the Trade Marks Bill should be administered by the Attorney General, because many questions of an exceedingly technical character will have to be decided. This matter may seem of very small importance to laymen, head of affairs. and learned member separate the Trade Marks branch from the Patents Office? see the Patents Office placed under the administration of the Attorney-General. ment, too? unreasonable. The cases arising in the Patents and Trade Marks Offices will, for the most part, involve questions of law; whereas any man of reasonable intelligence, , and of an inquiring mind, could settle for himself most of the matters of fact which have to be dealt with in the administration of the Customs Department. learned member's suggestion worth considering, unless we alter the present arrangement with regard to the Patents Office? matter to pass a short B ill providing that the Patents Office should also be placed under the control of the Attorney-General. able and learned member think that the permanent head of the Trade Marks branch That course was not folshould be independent of the Patents Office? offices under the control of the Attorney General.

It would be improper to first give directions to the Registrar, who ought to decide matters for himself, and to afterwards Hear an appeal from his decision.

In view of the fact that the Patents Office is already administered by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and that the Trade Marks branch would be properly conjoined to it , I see no reason for departing from the scheme laid down in the B ill . It is all very well to say that we might pass a short Act, authorizing the transfer of the Patents Office to the Attor|ney-General's Department,: but I should like to ascertain the views of the Patents officials before I acquiesced in a proposal of that kind. Certainly, unless the Patents Office were transferred to the Attorney-General's Department, double expense would be i ncurred by placing the Trade Marks branch under his administration. The Attorney General is always available to advise the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has his own officers to look after matters of detail. It would not be right for the Registrar to ask the Attorney-General how he should decide in a particular case; and if that were not done there would be no need for the Attorney-General, or any other Minister, to pay attention to the affairs of the office, so long as the Minister of Trade and Customs was willing to exercise his supervision. last statement of the Attorney-General appears to rrie to contradict his assertion to the effect that the Registrar should not come to the Attorney-General for advice.

Under all the circumstances, however, it would probably be better to omit the whole clause, and to allow Ministers to decide the matter amongst themselves. debate upon this question could be avoided if the Attorney-General would agree to adopt the form of wording which is employed in section 9 of the Patents Act, which readsThe Minister for the time being administering the Department of Patents shall be charged with the administration of this Act.

There is no explanation given with regard to it. what "" direct reference "" meant. Then the clause reads, "" and not being a geographical name used, or likely to be understood in a geographical sense,"" whereas the English Act says, "" not being, according to its ordir -nary signification, a geographical name."" I should like to know what is a geographical ijame used in a non-geographical sense? tnade on the Danube were called a ""Danube"" shoe, the name would not be used in its geographical sense. stood that the idea was to prevent the registration of geographical names. If you were permitted to call a shoe a "" Danube"" shoe because no shoes were manufactured there, you would have to discontinue that description as soon as shoes were made there. I prefer the simple and direct prohibition provided for in the English Act. -There is a prohibition in existence against the use of a geographical name as a trade mark, for the reason that no one has the right to appropriate a name or word that belongs to what one learned Judge called "" the great common of the English language."" It would not be fair, for example, to grant an exclusive proprietary right to the use of the word "" Melbourne,"" as applied to soap made in that city. Some words that are geographical names may be used in certain collocations, because they do not convey a geographical signification. I think it was Lord Justice Fry who said that "" Monkey soap "" was a good term for a trade mark, because although there was such a place as Monkey Island, there could be no confusion between the trade article and the geographical name. In another case, a certain whisky was branded "" Magnolia,"" and as there was a town of that name in the United States, it was actually argued that that name could not be used. I must say that I prefer the language in the Bill, because I think it is more easily understood than that adoDted in the English Act.

If the Attorney General will accept the amendment, I shall move it ; but otherwise I do not want to prolong the debate. -This is a very difficult question, and I am not prepared to accept the proposed definition at this stage. I would not like to say that it is wrong, but there are so many decisions as to the real meaning of ""distinctive"" tliat I am not prepared to agree to the amendment without f u l l consideration. The honourable and learned member record tuated the House of Commons in making some of these amendments, apparently at the very last moment. I do not know how far the proposed definition would alter the meaning of the word under our law, and I desire to keep as closely as I can to the decisions of our Courts, in which the word ""distinctive"" is clearly understood. makes a statement which practically covers this definition. think Aye can leave the word ""distinctive"" as it is. I have looked very carefully through the English Act, which contains many alterations which mav or may not be departures from the ordinary law. honourable and learned member proposes that the word ""distinctive"" shall mean ""adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark."" Moulton did not think that that implied the proprietorship of the goods. Act clearly limits the definition to the proprietorship of goods. There is no doubt that the clause as drafted widens the scope of the B ill . As the B ill is drafted, it might possibly include trade union labels, but if the definition were embodied in the measure, trade union labels could not be included in its scope. The Attorney-General has referred to the distinction between proprietorship and ownership. The effect of Mr Moulton's remarks was that a man might be a proAs prietor so far as proprietorship is understood in connection with ownership of the trade mark without being the actual owner of the goods. In the sense of the trade marks law the proprietor of any goods by virtue of their manufacture-althoug h he might have parted with their actual ownership by selling to a retailer-woul d still retain the trade mark. However, I do not wish to press the amendment if it is not acceptable to the Attornev-General. think that the definition suggested should be inserted. In the interests of laymen it is advisable that this Bill should be drawn as clearly as possible. I do hope that the Attorney-General will .see his way to accept the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Angas. knows that there is no attent?on to a fact in connection with one or of the reasons which actwo subsequent clauses, which, at first sight, appears to evidence some inconsistency in drafting. Although the word "" distinctive "" is used only twice in clause 16, in clauses 21 and 22, which are taken from the 1904 Bill of Mr Fletcher Moulton, the word ""distinctive-"" is used in a.much more general way. I venture to say that in those provisions the use of that word is not intended to be limited to the two cases mentioned in paragraphs a and c of clause J 6, but is intended to be used in connection with a trade mark containing any of the essential particulars which are there enumerated. To mv mind, it evidences an omission in draftsmanship that, while clause 16 has been altered so that the word "" distinctive"" does not cover the whole proThe vision as it does in the English Act, clauses 21 and 22 imply that that is intended. learned member will look at the English Mr Act he will observe that sub-sections 1, 2, ?, and 4 do not contain the word "" distinctive.""",52,Trade Marks Bill

That fact-evidences that departures from the English law have been made in clause 16, without corresponding alteratrons being effected in clauses 21 and 22. all right.

Will the Attorney-General explain what is the meaning of the word ""other"" in subsection s of the English Act. -The honourable member is aware that the English Act is a new one, and that it is a little presumptuous on my part, therefore, to interpret its meaning. that the name of a company, individual, or firm represented in a particular manner must necessarily be distinctive. So with' subsections 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are necessarily distinctive. The Act then provides for ""any other distinctive mark,"" with certain exceptions. old marks if they, are special or distinctive. The meaning of the word "" distinctive "" is defined. The same mode of argument is applicable to this Bill. Paragraphs a, b, d, and e are necessarily distinctive.

Under the law of a State, it may be possible for a man or firm to register a trade mark which contains some representation of a living being. But under this provision the Registrar will be compelled to ask the holder of any such trade mark to show his authority for using that representation. I do not suggest for a moment that it should be possible to place the portrait of a man upon a trade mark without his permission; but if people already enjoy that right under the law of any State, we should be very chary about interfering with them. any such representation will probably be dead before the owner of the trade mark will require to re-register it. deal with the question of registrationat all. assures me that it merely deals with the question of registration, my objection vanishes.

674,Mr Mccay,"Would it not be well to provide for that. Clause furtheramended verbally, and agreed to. Clause 33(1) Every application must be lodged by being l e f t at or sent by post to the Trade Marks Office. (2) Such application shall be forthwith referred by the Registrar to an examiner who shall search the register herein provided for and also the various State registers and ascertain and report whether the proposed mark has been already wholly or partially appropriated, and the desirability or otherwise of limiting the grant to one or mere States. cation must be lodged by being left at or sent by post to the Trade Marks Office. I suggest that applications sent by post should be deemed to have been lodged at the time stated on the post-marks they bear. hour ? particulars that are not given on the postmarks., 'only some of which show the hour.' of the honourable and learned member. That all the words after the word , "" shall,"" line 4, to the end of paragraph 2, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words :"" ascertain and report whether'the trade mark is a registrable trade mark and whether it is identical with a trade mark already on the register under this Act or any State Trade Marks Act in respect of the like goods or class of goods, or so nearly resembles the latter trade mark as to be likely to deceive."" ready provided that if a trade mark has been used honestly and publicly by more than three persons in any one State that fact shall be treated as conclusive evidence that it is common to the trade. Suppose, for example, that a trade mark for "" Skylark"" tea has been registered in Victoria and New South Wales, but not in Western Australia, and that some persons in the latter State, knowing of the popularity of the tea, use the trade mark-, and make it common. I presume that under the provision we have already made it will be impossible for that trade mark to be registered in any State except those in which proprietary rights have already been acquired. It appears to me that the Registrar will have to inquire not only into the questions referred to in the amendment, but also .as to whether the trade mark has been rendered common to the whole Commonwealth by user. 8 ter.

(2) The Law Officer shall hear the' applicant and the Registrar, and shall decide whether and subject to what conditions or modifications (if any) the application shall be accepted. (3) Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Law Officer may in the time and in the manner prescribed appeal to the Court. . . . . (4) The Court shall hear the applicant and the Registrar or Law Officer or both, and determine whether the application ought to be refused or ought to be granted with or without any modifications or conditions. toThat the .words "" The Registrar or law officer or both,"" sub-clause 4, be left out; that the word "" granted "" be l e ft out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" accepted'."" that the Attorney-General might consider the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable and learned member for Corinella with regard to doing away with the right of appeal to the law officer, with a view to providing some easier and cheaper method of appealing to the Courts direct.

That the words "" an appeal shall l i e , "" be. left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" he may appeal."" Mr MeCAY (Corinella) -I s the Attorney-General clear that the clauses in this division of the Bill apply only to unopposed applications? in clause 34 it is provided that "" any party aggrieved by the decision of the law officer "" mav appeal to the Court. That seems to imply that there are parties other than the applicant, and that will need to be altered if these clauses are intended to refer merely to unopposed applications. point.
