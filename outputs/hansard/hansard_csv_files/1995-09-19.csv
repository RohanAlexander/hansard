Of course, the students themselves-the perspectives the that has a particularly adverse effect once students have on educational experience and these people finish schooling, because it is the the quality of learning. The report says: rural areas where unemployment is the worse Educational statistics rarely report the point of view and where you therefore need to be better of students. Yet what young people say about their equipped to become employed. experience of learning provides valuable insights into differences in participation and attainment. Today schools are expected to play an Low self-esteem and perceptions of negative increasing role in the provision of vocational attitudes on the part of teachers are linked with under-enrolment in maths amongst girls and Confidence obviously plays an important probably also with poor achievement and lack of role.

Every fifth to what the gentleman from Leichhardt was Aboriginal student has a lower level of confisaying about cultural expectations. dence in academic progress. On the eve of the more specialised subjects It seems to me, as I have gone around many which are introduced in the senior years of communities, that historically it was the secondary school and the greater emphasis on women in the Aboriginal communities who personal responsibility for learning, many looked after the home and did a lot of the Aboriginal students already doubt their ability basic provision and so on-that still appliesto continue. So it is not surprising that we whereas the men traditionally had the men's have lower retention rates in the Aboriginal business and the cultural aspects to attend to, community going through to the senior levels perhaps some of the hunting and so on. at school. Basically, that role has been taken away from Aboriginal students are as likely, or about them, particularly as Western society has as likely, as other students to say that schools impacted upon the communities. Therefore, in are successful in promoting care for the many ways the men find themselves with environment, respect and care for others, little to do, and their self-esteem tends to be taking pride in achievement and valuing low. So there are differences in approach and knowledge and ideas. But in other areas their attitude between men and women, or boys estimations of school success are much lower. and girls, in the Aboriginal community.
