2,Mr Mathews,"On behalf of thethe report and minutes of evidence relating to the proposed establishment of an automatic telephone exchange at South Melbourne, and move That the paper be printed. Motions for the printing of reports and minutes of evidence are made so frequently that the duties of the Printing Committee seem to be almost entirely disregarded. I do not know how much of the document which has just been laid on the table is evidence, and what it will cost An order for the printing of a paper ends to print this evidence; but I think that all the matter so far as the Printing Comproposals for thc printing of papers should be referred to the Printing Committee. accordance with an Act of Parliament. ports of the Committee must be printed, of course; but there is a doubt in my mind as to the need for printing the minutes of evidence. would suggest to the honourable member for Nepean( Mr Bowden) that thc Printing Oommittee haB in its own hands a remedy for what be complains of. If the members of the Committee think that too much printing is being authorized, it can make a report on the subject to this House as to the need for restricting expenditure on printing. I would suggest that for the consideration of the Printing Committee. I beliove that the motion under discussion is being moved in accordance with the requirements of the Publio Works Committee Act. mittee is merely a Committee of this House, and it is questionable whether it could, in any case, override the Public Works Committee. The minutes of evidence relating to tbe inquiry upon which the Committee has reported are already in print, and the ordering of the printing amounts merely to the ordering of a few more copies for the convenience of honourable members generally. On occasions when reports have been presented without the minutes of evidence on which thoy were founded, honourable members havo complained of being deprived of the opportunity to peruse that evidence, and, therefore, it is now customary to have the minutes of evidence printed. Tho honourable memb<v for Melbourne Ports, acting for the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, is simply performing a function which, under the Public Works Committee Aot, devolves upon him. Chairman of the Printing Committee I know that it is considered by the members of that Committee that if the House makes the order that a paper must be printed the Committee cannot interfere. mittee is concerned. [11.6] I would remind the House that the Publio Works Committee in the taking of evidence and the making of reports always pays due regard to considerations of economy; in fact, ib is the most parsimonious crowd that 1 have ever been associated with.

The inevitable result must be the passage of ill-digested legislation that will do more harm than good. In moving the second reading of tbe Bill the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) referred to the consideration due to the members of the Public Service, and I may be allowed to say that I think they are entitled to a great deal more consideration than they are receiving, owing to the action of the Government in deciding to proceed with this measure in the dying hours of this Parliament. The Bill proposes practically to re-organize the whole of the Service, and certainly to make some very radical changes in the conditions under which it is to be carried on. At a time when the elections are approaching, and the minds of honourable members are disturbed, they are presented with a list of thirteen or fourteen Bills, many of which deal with matters of the most urgent importance. In the circumstances, it is impossible for honourable members to give them the consideration they require. The debate on this measure, which is of vital importance to the Public Service, was proceeded with yesterday, when the Minister in charge of it was not present toanswer the questions of honourable members who desired information. The Bill contains 113 clauses. be ninety-five amendments proposed. the exact number of amendments that are to be proposed, but it was suggested in a statement made by the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) last night, that tbe Government had some intention of getting the Bill through to-day, and going on witb tbe next business on tbe notice paper. The amendment of the Publio Service Act has been left in abeyance for something like six years. that period we have carried on with an Acting Public Service Commissioner. No officer was appointed permanently to the position because it was felt that it was necessary to deal with the conditions of the Public Service in a comprehensive way. It is not fair to the Service, nor is it fair to the people, that we should be asked to consider this measure at such short notice. ""We aro not given time to digest its provisions, or to appreciate the amendments of tbe existing law which it proposes. If , because so little time was given for the consideration of tbe measure, its results, when passed, are found unsatisfactory, it will be difficult to suggest how many years must elapse before steps will be taken to pass a satisfactory law for the control of the Public Service. When the Government decided to proceed with a measure of so much importance, why did they not call Parliament together early in March, in order that the business might be conducted in a proper way, and it would not be necessary to rush legislation through in the closing hours of the session. man was in Java at the time he suggests that Parliament should have been called together. have been there if arrangements had been made for the meeting of Parliament at that time. Parliament did not meet until the Supply voted last year had run out. We have done our best since tbe meeting of Parliament to deal witb the measures submitted to us in tbe proper spirit. This is one of the most important Bills wbich Parliament could be called upon to consider. Ib deals not only with the re-organization of the various Commonwealth activities, but with their conduct generally. But I would like to see some definite provision in the Bill, calculated to prevent the present rate of increase in the number of public servants. The Bill should also make specific provision for improving the standard of our services right through. What is required is not quantity-not large numbers of men drawn from productive occupations-bu t a high quality of public officialdom thoroughly well capable of carrying out the most important functions of govern-' -ment. At present the Public Service is practically a dead-end occupation for During about 80 per cent, of those who have entered it. This is singular, as compared with other avenues of employment, because of the fact that practically all entrants must pass a qualifying and competitive examination. The Public Service draws upon a very high average standard from among the youths of our schools. These have been attracted, in",16,Foster N O The Second Reading A N Instruction To The

But what is the position of the public sermaster-General. vant after twenty, thirty, or forty years' service? Generally, as I have said, he is at a dead end. Men who would have been very much better employed in other activities are unable, after a few years, to change their occupations, because they have weighted themselves, probably, with family responsibilities, and are in a cul de sac. Honourable members should be afforded the fullest opportunities for discussing this measure in its every detail, and much more information should be made available to enable us properly to handle the whole subject. First, consideration should be given to the cause of the increase in our Public Services, both State and Federal. In the last twenty years, since the inauguration of Federation, there has been a total increase from 89,831 to 248,976. This represents something like 260 per cent. But tbe population, meanwhile, has grown to the extent of only 45 peicent -fro m 3,373,000, in fact, to 5,416,000. In the Federal Service alone the increase of permanent public servants, outside of such trading Departments as the Postmaster-General's Department-thos e especially under the control of the Public Service Commissioner -ha s been from 1,417 to 4,573, which represents an expansion of more than 300 per cent. include railway servants? pendent of them, altogether. ber's statistics take into consideration the and it indicates a most serious withdrawal various services which were taken over by the Federation from the States? instance, 3,500 employees came over to the Commonwealth in connection with the transfer of State activities alone. number of public servants, whose total I have just given, is exclusive of those who were taken over in that manner. orable member's total is inclusive. upon those servants under the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Works and Railways, and the Minister for Trade and Customs; and I have excluded those under the PostTrade and Customs has taken over quite a number of services, which has entailed the transfer of 3,500 former State omcers. That factor makes a tremendous difference in the honourable member's comparisons. with the employees of the Postmaster General quite separately. I repeat that the total number of State and Federal servants has increased in twenty years from almost 90,000 to just under 249,000. member is including all those additional employees who have been required in connection witb the tremendous expansion of State railway services. fact is that tbe Public Service has ex ' panded to the extent of 260 per cent., wbile tbe population of the Commonwealth in twenty years bas increased only 45 per cent -that is to say, the increase in State and Federal services has been six times as rapid as is the total of our population. Salaries paid to public servants bave gone up from £11,733,000 to £55,000,000 in that same time, wbich represents an increase of 500 per cent. One among every twelve adults in Australia to-day is a public servant; and since the greater proportion of our publio servants consists of males, it would probably be correct to say that one out of every seven adult males in the Commonwealth is now a State or Federal servant. That .is an enormous percentage, of our manhood from the active ranks of For producers, and their utilization, in tbe main, in non-productive employments. What can be done to put a stop to further increase -in the same direction 1 What can we do to diminish the total ? If duplications were eliminated there would immediately be brought about a marked diminution of these non-productive public employees.

Now and again some small alterations are brought about, but these have never represented anything material. method of alteration will be in the direcbe given to the deputies? tion of amendments of the Constitution, so that State and Commonwealth activities shall be more strictly defined. In this connection, by the way, the people were promised, both before and after tbe last Federal elections, that tbe Commonwealth Parliament would be given an opportunity to deal with the matter of Constitution amendments. Apparently, bowever, that promise is not to be honoured, because the Prime Minister made no mention of the subject when he placed before the House his list of business to be dealt with before the end of the session. There will never be any very marked decrease in Government expenditure until we have some means of proper supervision-as the honourable memher for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) suggested-secure d by some method of reducing the unwieldy areas of our States. In those huge territories embraced in the larger States there is inevitable circumlocution, delay, and unwarranted cost in carrying on public concerns. In the smaller States-as Victoria and Tasmania-muc h less expenditure is incurred in removing public servants from one post to another. With a uniform size of State, or the division of the Commonwealth into zones, approximately equal in size, it would be possible to make comparisons in standards of departmental efficiency in areas of something like the same size and population. A t present we have such centres as Tweed Heads under administrative control from Sydney, though it is most difficult to get in touch with Sydney. Some of the Federal departmental beads have never been through the districts under their control, because of tbeir inaccessibility and the fact that, though we are supposed to be a Federation, we are doing what Sir Robert Anderson pointed out in bis report on tbe Postmaster-General's Department seven or eight years ago-controllin g areas as though we were a series of isolated States instead of a Federation. We axe keeping in existence for Federal administrative purposes the old. State bounthere is no need whatever to do so. Altogether the present system interferes materially with the attainment of high standards of administrative efficiency combined with economy. The only effective member think that more authority should intend to suggest later, when we come to deal with the administrative clauses of urged in his report to the Government in 1920. Apparently we are not going to have an opportunity to deal with Constitutional amendments in a way that will enable us, in the immediate future, to make the necessary alterations in State boundaries, and make possible a comparison of standards of efficiency and economy in the Public Service administration of smaller areas. In the absence of any such change, the time has come, with tbe present strangling taxation on the people, for some self-denying ordinance to be imposed by all the Governments of Australia on themselves witb regard to the appointment of additional members of tbe Public Service in connection with the ordinary business of government. It is impossible to prevent new appointments to such Departments as the Post Office and the railways, which are continually expanding, to meet tlie increasing requirements of the people, but in other ordinary administrative Departments there should b« no reason for the present steady increase in „the personnel of the Publio Service. are baving representations<made to us by honourable members to haye the postal staff increased in different places.

57,Dr. Eaele Page,"The Governmentremember is that we must in some way or otber reduce the cost of government, and lighten the taxation burdens of the community. If we wish to bring additional people to this country, we must hold out some inducement to tbem. We should be able to show them that if they do come here, the taxation levied upon them will be less than in'any other place, and that their opportunities bere will be greater than elsewhere. .In addition, it seems to me that we could effect some improvement aud secure increased efficiency in the service by the abolition, as far as possible, of the system of temporary employment. At present there are about 15,000 temporary employees in the various branches of our Public Service. sions dealing with that matter. member suggest that we should make all temporary employees permanent employees ? the Government would get a great deal more efficiency if they re-organized the Service, and, instead of having such a large number of temporary employees, made the employment of those absolutely essential to the work of the various Departments permanent, and therefore continuous. The Government might very well consider also the wisdom of increasing the hours of work in the Public Service to 5 o'clock in tbe afternoon, so as to bring them into conformity with the hours worked by employees in the Public Services of the various States. This suggestion was made by me last year, and I notice that it is also recommended by Mr the Government departed so definitely McLachlan. Let me read what the Commissioner had to say on 'the subjectAs a general rule the hours of duty of officers engaged in clerical or professional work, and also those of many General Division officers, are from 9 a.m. to 4.'30 p.m.; with three-quarters of an hour interval for the midday meal. In two States these officers are allowed a meal interval of an hour, and remain on duty until 4.45 p.m. The actual working hours of these officers are six and three-quarter hours a day, Monday to Friday, and three hour's on Saturday, or a total of 36} hours in a week. In four of the six States the practice in the public Departments controlled by the States Governments is to employ clerical staffs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday in each week, and from 9 a.m. to 12 noon on Saturday. Reasonable warrant exists for amending the present arrangement, and providing that the ordinary working hours for such classes of officers in the Commonwealth Service shall in future be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with an allowance at one hour instead of three-quarters of an hour for a meal, and that on Saturdays the hours should be from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. The present provision as to meal interval is more honoured in the breach than the observance, as many officers actually take a full hour instead of the three-quarters prescribed, and the actual effect of the suggested alteration would he to obtain from such officers half-anhour's daily extra service. It is recommended that in any amendment of Public Service regulations, following upon the passage of new legislation, the question of revision of hours of duty on the lines indicated should be gives consideration. As the Minister has stated that he has en'deavoured to follow the ex-Commissioner's recommendations in the main, I trust he will not neglect this phase of Public Serhonorable vice administration, whicb is so definitely The proposed change would involve no hardship on anybody^ and probably it would do away with any necessity to reduce salaries as deflation progresses. I bave not yet been able to satisfy myself as to the exact purpose of the Board of Commissioners-whethe r the functions of that body are to be executive or not. I did not have the opportunity of hearing the Minister's second-reading speech, but I have read his remarks, and I am not at all clear on this point. Will the Board simply replace the Public Service Commissioner in every respect, and will it also be a Board of Management, as was suggested by the Economies Commission, and, in addition, be charged with outside supervision? I think the House; s entitled 'to some explanation as to why from the recommendation of the exPublic Service Commissioner. orable member think that one man will be better than three Commissioners?

65,Dr. Earle Page,"His suggestionof accountancy rather than by a Board of Management. His remarks ou that 'subject are worth putting on record. saidIn my opinion there are strong reasons against alteration of the present system of management of the Commonwealth Public Service. Control by a Board of three members necessarily involves a more cumbrous procedure than by a single Commissioner, and consequent delays in settlement of questions of administration. In addition, the important factor of direct and personal responsibility would be sacrificed by the appointment oif a Board. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the 'Commonwealth Service differ very materially from thOBC of a State Public -Service, seeing that the former service is spread over all the States forming the Commonwealth, necessitating the location of a Public bervice Inspector in each State, exercising delegated powers of the Commissioner. In providing for the future administration of the Public Service Act. it would be disadvantageous to establish a Public Service Board, with thc consequent inelasticity of control and the diminution of personal responsibility, 'ine existing system of management by one Commissioner will undoubtedly better meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Public Service, provided that the .necessary assistance is given him to carry out the duties and extended functions to be conferred upon him. lie pointed out exactly what he had done is Public Service Commissioner, and then . MI t will be of obvious advantage to -the Commissioner to have the assistance of a professional expert in a particular section of 'tlie work of a department. At present, the Commissioner is at a disadvantage in combating the views of officers whose interests may lie in the continuance of existing methods and whose professional knowledge of the subject might carry weight when expressed in opposition to the views of a layman. In regard to the tenure of office, he saidUnder the provisions of the Public Servico Act of 1902, thc tenure of office of the Commissioner and Inspectors is limited to a period of seven yeara, and power is given to re-appoint these officers for a further term or terms. It is difficult to understand the reason for such a condition of tenure when it is remembered that no statutory limitation is imposed in the case of the Judges of the High Court or of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. 'Whilei t is questionable whether any -advantage accrues vfrom -.the existing provisions >of 'the .Act, J am convinced that serious disadvantage /results from .the fact .that .experienced .officers of .the Federal and 'State Services, or -men of high standing outside ""the'service, will 'hesitate 'to accept appointments involving <a Mhriiteu tenure. It is within my recollection .that in 1902 a prominent.omcer.of the Post .Office Service withdrew his application for-appointment as Public Service Inspector because of the condition imposed by the Act as to a seven years' [120] tenure. Thc limitation of the period of appointment is particularly unwise from the stand-point of independent administration, and He although my own experience in this respect when holding office as Commissioner was satisfactory, and such as to give 'no cause for complaint, it may readily he -understood that the possibility of non-renewal of appointment is likely to -affect the independence of a Commissioner or Inspector, and to prove detrimental to the public interests. The Royal Commission on the Victorian State Public Service, reporting on this subject last year, stated:""'The Commissioner sliould in our opinion have real power and should be really independent. Nominally he is independent, .but as he cannot be appointed for more than seven years at a time it will be seen that he is not really independent. He cannot help feeling that if he does not endeavour to please the powers that be, he may not get a renewal of his position when his term expires. And he should be paid a salary befitting his important office. There is no good reason, so far as wo can see, why he should net be appointed to hold oflice during good behaviour, as the Auditor-General is. Of course, we do not suggest that the administration of the present Commissioner or any of his predecessors has been influenced in the slightest degree by their insecurity of tenure, but 'we feel that thc oflice should be placed in such a position of strength that there would be absolutely no colour for the suggestion that in some particular case or cases the Commissioner's action was not altogether disinterested."" In the report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service of Great Britain (1914), it is pointed out that the members of the Civil Service Commission (two in number) hold their appointments direct from thc Crown, and that like other members of the permanent Civil Service, these omcers hold oflice during .His Majesty's pleasure, this meaning in practice until they are retired owing to age or invalidity. About 1918 or 1919 the Government of New South Wale3 appointed Mr G. M . Allard a Royal Commissioner to repert upon the Public Service of that State, and he reported as follows in regard to the tenure of office of the members of thc Public Service BoardThe present limited tenure makes it possible for periodical pressure to be applied to the -members .of ithe Board, 'especially when the -term .of office .is approaching completion. .1 consider it imperative that the tenure of oflice should be such as to make the Board indetpendentiin spirit as-well, as in.letter, -and that, -subject.to removal .by,a vote of both-Houses of iRar.liament, the tenure of office should be from the date of appointment until the date upon which each Commissioner shall attain the age of sixty-five years. In the face of such unanimous testimony it is strange that the Minister sbould bring down a Bill under which the maximum period of appointment will be five years. If the Government are determined to proceed with the appointment of a Board of Management we shall not get applications for appointment from men of wide outside business experience if they know that in four years' time their appointment will be jeopardized if some act of theirs has rendered the Administration of the day hostile to them. If a singlo Commissioner is to be appointed, the length of tenure should be materially lengthened, even if it be not made continuous during good behaviour, so that he Bhall be independent of political pressure. It is hopeless to attempt to reorganize the the various Departments. It seems abwholeServicei f we are unable to secure the services of the best men available. Wc bave already had experience of appointments that were' unsatisfactory, largely because the salaries and conditions ofappointment were not such as to attract men of the right stamp for the work to be done. We cannot expect a manager of a big business firm to sever his present asall they want.

Such familiarity as the inspector would thus get in handling smaller areas, would tend to increase efficiency. I am also in favour of throwing responsibility upon the heads of the Public Service in each State, giving them very much wider powers than at present, and decentralizing to a greater degree their control in surd that an officer should one day be a Deputy Poatmaster-Gcneral, and only able to spend a limited amount, wbile the next week, by accident of time, he might, as secretary to the whole Department, be called upon to deal with millions. peal on behalf of men who cannot get General and ask for it.

I sball mention a case that has come under my notice in connection with a State Department, and the same thing is practically true of the Pederal sphere.

An architect was obtained from Lismore to examine the counter, and altogether about £30 was spent in preliminary expenses prior to accepting a tender for 30s. for the necessary alteration. Such things nre constantly happening. occur in a Federal Department. an instance in thc Federal sphere. Two and a-half years ago I secured from thc Postmaster-General a promise that tenders would be called for the erection of a post-office at Wingham. After a long lapse of time tenders were called. Then suggestions were made for alterations to the building, involv ng an expenditure : of something like £25 or £30, in order to provide greater convenience for the public. Owing to the system that obtains in the Federal Departments concerned, the whole scheme was delayed for about nine months to get proper official sanction at the source, and only now is the building being commenced. I went to three or four Departments in endeavouring to push the work ahead, and I was assured on every hand that, if there had been greater power to deal with the matter locally, it would have been attended to eighteen months ago. During the whole of that time the people have been inconvenienced, and no money has been saved. postmasters should have the right to deal with tenders? ' the local inspector who controls a district that is about twice as large as Tasmania, and has about tbe same population, sbould be able to deal with a matter of that kind. If it is not possible for men in receipt of large salaries to do such work, it is time we had a better system. Although at the beginning of an officer's career the Public Service is moderately attractive as regards salary, compared with private employment, we find that at a certain stage officers come to a dead end.

There was, in the first place, the suggestion that a business Board should be appointed in connection with the Defence Department and a I similar Board for the Department of the Navy, and also a Board in connection witb the Post and Telegraph Department, which employs by far the largest number of public servants. In addition, they proposed, to-have a Board of. Management for the Public Service, and when the matter was first mentioned there was ah outcry against the appointment of such a Board in addition to the Public Service Commission. The Government have evidently decided to dispense with, the Commissioner, and to make the Board of Management carry out his duties as well whichreally means that three men will be called upon to-do the work, which has been efficiently carried out by one man.

Yet a little further on they say28. In some Departments, such as the Law Department, Quarantine, Lighthouses, Science and Research. Home and Territories, Treasury, Audit, Wireless, and Navy, it is not possible for the Permanent Head of the Department to compare the economical working in the above manner. Although, as I pointed out, they have just stated it was his duty to do it. The report goes onThe most suitable method of securing economical working is by the exhaustive inspection of each office or section by Inspectors with the experience and mentality necessary to enable t.hem to satisfactorily criticise and make helpful, constructive suggestions in regard to thc staff employed and work performed. 29. In Departments such aa the Works Department, the Naval Construction Branch, the Ship Construction Branch, and thc Engineering Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department, the economical performance of work can best be measured by a satisfactory and detailed system of costing. The costs of work performed should be closely scrutinized by t.Ii"" head of the Department; this duty' should not be delegated to subordinate officers. First of all, they say that the checking should be done by the permanent head, and then immediately point out the number of Departments in which he cannot do it; and then they say that the proper way is to secure thc services of qualified inspectors. They then go on to say that the -.vo""k can only be carried out by an ilr. Wise. 33. The Commission, whilst recognising that that there shall be unimpaired Ministerial 34.

This duty should bo performed by n tirement should be on the principle of rotation to insure continuity of policy, and with eligibility of rc-appointmcnt. 38. Upon any indication of costly worsing. it should be immediately investigated by inspection by qualified officers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the high costs arc due to unavoidable causes or to extravagance. 40. It is necessary that tliere shall bo attached to the staff of the Board of Management a small staff of technical officers expert in different classes of work. These officers should not only be utilized continuously for investigating the economical efficiency of tlit work in which they are expert in the various Departments of the different States, but should bs utilized for the purpose of advising tlio Board in regard to the rates of pay and efficiency of officers of the Public Service in the technical grades, as it is impossible under the existing system for this work to be otber than a pretence. 41. Attached to thc staff of the Hoard of Management thero should be a small staff of officers expert in thc science of modern office systems and appliances. This staff should be utilized for the purpose of overhauling the office work of every Department periodically in order to insure(i) That the office organization and tlie methods followed aro efficient; (ii) That advantage is being taken of all modern methods and appliances which would secure more economical and efficient results: (iii) That the work performed justifies the number of staff employed and the remuneration paid to that staff; (iv) That the work performed is necessary, and is utilized for some useful purpose. Why should these three men be appointed when the Commission say that experts are i*equnred to do the work? What is the use of saying that inspectors must go through the Departments and do what tbey previously said should be done by the permanent head ? The Commissioners further report51. ' A Board of Management constituted in the. manner we have suggested would continuously perform the duties that this Commission had been appointed to perform in a spasmodic manner, and should also be used by the Treasury Department to assist in the annual scrutiny of the Estimates of Departments beforo submission to Parliament, and otherwise act in conjunction with the Treasury Department in investigating, not only general questions affecting the Public Service at largo, but also specific matters on which expenditure is proposed. 52. It should also be the duty of the Board of Management to assess salaries on the basis of a fair deal to all concerned, instead of thc haphazard, unfair, and non-uniform system uxisting at present. All that has been done previously by inspectors, and the real trouble is not due to having one Commissioner, but to tbe fact that there are not sufficient qualified inspectors. If we had qualified inspectors witb a thorough knowledge of modern methods, we would achieve all we require under the present system and the appointment of a Board of three would be obviated. It is also suggested that the Board should consist of a member with outside business experience, but those appointed to the Board from inside the Service would soon prove to tbe other member that business methods employed outside could not be applied to Government Departments. for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has not, apparently, had much to do with the administration of Government Departments or be would not ask such a question. The Government sbould appoint only one Commissioner, because when the Service tihe work was very satisfactorily pelforrned, and if complaints bave recently arisen it is becauso the chief officer!"" in the officer's breast for the rest of bis life, If Public Service Commissioner's office have been only acting. We have had an acting Commissioner, an acting Secretary, and an acting Chief Inspector. Ministers have been perfectly aware of thc position for tonio time past, but have experience! considerable difficulty in dealing with the situation; because they contemplated acting on the advice given by the Economies Commission upon this point, and could not, therefore, make any permanent appointments. I think the situation can be met quite well' by having a thoroughly qualified Commissioner and thoroughly expert inspectors, intrusted with greater power than they now have. That system should give us exactly what the Government hope to secure by appointing a Board of Management, as recommended by tbe Economies Commission. The Board must spend most of its time in Melbourne. It cannot journey all over the Commonwealth. It will probably adopt tbe procedure of sending a. Commissioner to one State, and another Commissioner to a second State; and when a Commissioner returns to Melbourne with his report, the Board must swallow it, otherwise the Commissioner will gay, "" Why are you making a fool of me by sending me away to furnish you with a report ? "" When' a Board of three Public Service Commissioners was first appointed in the State of Victoria, they adopted this method of classifying the Public Service. One Commissioner visited one locality, and a second Commissioner visited another. I have a distinct recollection of the way in which one oflicer was classified. The Commissioner had visited Bairnsdale, and was on his return to Melbourne. It was his duty to classify the office of Receiver and Paymaster at Sale, but, as it did not suit his convenience to stay overnight at Sale and catch the train to Melbourne on the following day, he telegraphed to the officer who was filling the ^position, and asked him to meet the train. During the twenty minutes' train stop at Sale, among the crowd on the platform, the interview took place, and the Commissioner classified the office on that conversation, without seeing the work which was being done by this mau, who was in my opinion, one of the finest officers in the Victorian State Service. The contemptible way in which the position was classified rankled sorely in that we appoint three Commonwealth Commissioners, they'must not absent themselves from Melbourne at the one time, otherwise the general administrative work of the Department will be neglected.

117,Mr Makin,"seems that the Government, recognising that it is overwhelmed with sins of omission and commission, for which we hope it will shortly be required to answer to the people of this country, seeks as far as possible to be relieved of the responsibility that should rightfully belong to it . We ought to realize that we get no further by delegating our powers to another body that is responsible, practically, to no o?ie. The Bill proposes to establish a Board of three Commissioners. In the form in which the Board is proposed to be constituted it certainly does not meet with .my approval, and wilL not have my support. I hope the House will give a very clear and distinct indication to the Government of. its views, and will declare that it will not consent to the building up of a useless form of oversight of the Public Service that will only lead to further dissatisfaction, and will not give us that form of efficiency that we have a right to expect from this measure. one of the biggest and most costly Departments in the Service. it is allowed to pass in its present form it will create a bureaucracy. We cannot tolerate, or allow to be tolerated, circumstances which will, lead to the establishment of anything of that description. that we do not add to the overhead charges and make the Service top-heavy. If the House is determined to stand by the provision for the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, then I think that the Board should be so constituted that employees in the Service will bave a voice in the determination of the methods by which they are to be controlled. part of large industrial concerns is to give thc employees some voice in their control and management. The adoption of that course has been attended with a great measure of advantage to both employers and employees. In Great Britain the Public Service is now administered by a series of councils, consisting of direct representatives of the employees and the Government. In that way considerable dissatisfaction has been eliminated from the Service. If a representative of our public servants can be trusted with the responsibility attaching to membership of the Board of Appeal, as well as to membership of the Classification Appeal Board, surely a member of the Service should be worthy of appointment to the Board of Commissioners. On behalf of the united organizations of the Commonwealth Service, I make the suggestion that the Government should provide in the Bill that one of the persons appointed to the Board of Management shall be nominated by the Commonwealth Public Service organizations. I understand that the High Council of the Public Service organizations is prepared to submit to the Minister a list of persons, the appointment of any one of whom would be satisfactory to them as being truly representative of the employees in the Service. The Bill discriminates in a way that is not desirable, since it has one set of provisions governing the permanent heads or chief officer staff, and quite another relating to those lower down in the Service. This discrimination relates more particularly to appeals and to grievances that employees of the Commonwealth may have in regard to promotions and increments. Thoso lower down in the ServiceI am satisfied that if are not afforded the same opportunities to have these matters dealt with as are the permanent heads and the higher officials. So far as questions in regard to appeals, promotions, and increments aro concerned, all should be on an equal I hope the House will see footing. Any attempt to discriminate would croato dissatisfaction, and would certainly bo unworthy of a Democracy. Then again the Board of Commissioners may give important decisions affecting large bodies of the Public Service. will do so. missioners will not only have to deal with The general tendency on the individual eases, but to give decisions of a far-reaching character. There is no reason why the right, given by this Bill to a permanent head, or chief officer, to request that a recommendation made by an individual member of the Board under clause 15 shall be referred to the f u l l Board, should"" not also extend to organizations representing the whole of the officers engaged in the work to which such a recommendation relates. As the Bill stands, this right is given to a permanent head or chief oflicer, but is withheld from those who arc lower in the Service, and who might be equally",29,Foster N O The Second Reading A N Instruction To The

It is desirable that the High Council, of these organizations, which is the custodian of the welfare of the public servants, should be represented on appeals from the decisions of the Board of Commissioners. Under the Bill as it stands, an officer appealing against a decision of the Board in respect of his classicommendation may be withheld if a perfication has merely the rigbt to submit his case for tbe reconsideration of the Board. I do not think that it would satisfy any of us to be told that we had the right to appeal to an authority that had already judged our case. We should not feel confident that any measure of success would attend such an appeal. Tbe Board is to consider thc appeal, so called, with a representative of the permanent head and of tbe organization. Thus an officer would have to appeal to a body consisting of five persons, four of whom had already taken an active part in regard to the classification against which he was appealing. In such circumstances there ° would be little hope of securing favorable consideration for an appeal against the decision of the Board. from CfBsar to Csasar. existing Act the provision for appeals against promotion is infinitely more just than the system provided .in the Bill for appeals in regard to classification. Section 50 of the Act gives an officer the action has been taken to his prejudice. It is strongly urged by the public servants that classification is a matter as important to them as the fixing of remuneration, because it vitally affects the careers of those in the Service. They think that an officer who is dissatisfied witb his classification should have the right to submit his case to an independent Appeal Board; and I think the House will recognise the merit of this claim to have classification appeals considered by a tribunal which will bo distinctly impartial and independent. missioners. peals against decisions given by the Board and affecting classification. If the classification of an officer docs not give satisfaction to him, he has merely the right to appeal to the body responsible for that classification; but in tbe Act provision is made for appeals to a special Board, differing in personnel from that which arrived at the decision appealed from. The Bill makes the granting of increments to officers dependent on fhe recommendation of the permanent heads. This remanent head thinks that there has been dereliction of duty, or that the officer's conduct, diligence, or ability is not satisfactory. The withholding of an increment from an officer seriously interferes with his advancement, and, in addition to affecting his seniority, amounts to the infliction upon him of an annual fine. It is only fair, therefore, that he should have an opportunity to rebut any charge laid against him by the head of his Department.

I shall do all I can to secure provision for the appointment of only one Commissioner. can do the work very much better than three. Tthere is an old saying that one boy is a boy, that two boys are only half a boy, and that three boys are no boy at all. Three Commissioners will not do their work so quickly or satisfactorily as if it were concentrated in the hands of one. There are many first class men in the Commonwealth Service, qualified in every way to hold the post. agree with other members who have said that the great fault of the Service is its concentration in the centre; decentralization of authority is wanted. For instance, the various Deputy Postmasters-General -might well be clothed witb much more power than they possess to-day, while still remaining responsible to their Ministerial head. The inspectors also should be given much greater powers. One inspector would be able to cover his job in a small State like Tasmania, but several should be appointed in each of tbe larger States. These should be permitted to make their reports direct to the State Deputy Postmaster-General or Federal Inspector, and that official should possess the power to act thereon. Honourable members, upon more closely examining this measure, may very well come .to the conclusion that, instead of its purpose and intention being in the direction of improving the Service, revolution and chaos might well follow its enactment. I have previously protested against Parliament surrendering any portion of its powers or permitting the Ministry to do -so. Tn order to provide an illustration of my point, I need only refer to tbe War Service Homes muddle. No matter what may have been tbe blunders, Parliament is always met with the Ministerial excuse that it deliberately gave full powers to the -Commissioner, and must now accept responsibility for what has followed. I may mention also the provision in regard to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. That official has been given authority to do almost anything he likes. Not long .ago he tossed aside the whole of the plans which had been submitted by the Department of Works and Railways, and approved by the Public Works Committee in connection with the building of the .Notes Printing Office; and he approved new plans, the acceptance of which will cost the Commonwealth several thousand One pounds more than would the original proposition. When complaint is made, however, the Government say, ""Wby complain? Parliament deliberately gave away the power. Parliament must accept whatever is done under cover of that power."" If Parliament now places complete power of reclassification in the bands of three men, who will concentrate their task in Melbourne, trouble is bound I to accrue. How can these three hope to gain the necessary information to enable them to deal, for example, with cases at important centres far away in tbe north of Queensland and Western Australia? How can the Commissioners secure requisite particulars of each case unless they employ an army of inspectors? Andi f inspectors must be employed, why should tbey not be given authority to do the wholo of tbe work? The existing system has worked fairly well. for. the Public Service; but, with tbe amendments proposed to-day, we run the risk of greatly harming the Service. It is essential that.we should build up and maintain a first-rate Public Service. Governments come and go; Ministries continually change, and policies vary; but the Public Service must carry on its uninterrupted task of conducting the administrative machinery of government. I do not believe that this Bill will give the Service a greater measure of satisfaction than that which exists to-day. Rather, I see the risk of our, creating a great deal of discontent; and I see also the danger of our tremendously enhancing the cost of the Service with respect to automatic increases. It is an absurd system which will blindly transfer a capable and experienced man from one position in which he has proved a marked success, to another in which he has had no experience and of which he possesses no knowledge, merely because he has become automatically due for promotion. In business, and in the Army, chaos would follow. system of promotion. Mr Mc WILLIAMS -The Army does not promote a capable and experienced transport officer to the command of troops. Seniority deserves consideration, but .seniority and fitness should be the guiding factors in every instance. Not ouly is a",32,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where
134,Mr Bell,"But that is the Armyvery great deal expected of an officer who has been automatically transferred to a position where he is entirely unused to nnd ignorant of the nature of his work; but it speaks volumes for the loyalty of public servants in the lower ranks that these automatic transfers do not arouse trouble. I warn the House against any further surrender of its powers. Control by one Commissioner will make for greater rapid'ty and accuracy in the settlement of all niatters relating to the Service. Not one convincing argument have I heard in favour of the appointment of three men to do work which, in my opinion, can be done infinitely quicker and better by one. When the Bill reaches the Comm'ttee stage the opinion of honourable members will bo tested as to whether we shall appoint a Board of three men or make permanent the office of Public Service Commissioner, and leave it to the appointee to carry out the reforms referred to by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Wise), such as the appointment of highly' trained and skilled inspectors. We have those inspectors already. doing excellent work, and they could do hotter if they were given greater authority ancl responsibility. worth it. To his credit the former Postmaster-General( Mr Wise), very shortly after assuming office, increased the authority and power of his deputies with resultant benefit to the States, and the whole of the Service. I know it is the opinion of the present Postmaster-General( Mr Poynton) that the deputies should be given greater authority, and held resnonsible to the M nister for the success : of the postal service in their respective States. puty turns down a proposal put before bim by an honourable member, the latter appeals to the Postmaster-General. be devised which will relieve members of Parliament of the obligation of doing what they consider to be tbeir duty. If by reason of their local knowledge they bel eve that a certain public work is necessary, anrl the deputy does not see eye to eye with them, it is quite proper that they should appeal finally to the Minister, who is responsible to Parliament. I see nothing wrong in that. ber does not agree with the decisions of the deputies in respect of matters over which they have authority now. peals made to the Minister probably relate to matters in regard to which the deputy has not power. I am quite sure that if they were given more power the Minister would be relieved of a lot of detailed work which should not fall upon h m. If the present deputies are : not competent to do the work, appoint others who are, pay them well, and give them full authority and responsibility Only by a system of decentralization of authority can we hope to evolve a Pederal Service tliat will be satisfactory throughout the enormous area of Australia. We sometimes forget that a centralized system, which is successful in England, France or Germany is quite unsuited to a country of such enormous extent as Some of them aro the Commonwealth. The Federal Service extends from Cape Otway to Cape York, and from Fremantle to Zeehan, and it is essential for its efficient administration that we should have in each State competent local officers exercising greater authority, and carrying increased responsibility. I can see nothing but risk to the Service and to tbe country in tbe proposal to appoint the proposed Board of Management. Every such appointment we have made has led to the creation of another Department. To-day common sense tells us that our every effort should be in the direction of reducing the number of Departments and public servants. My idea is that we should reduce unnecessary public servants as far as practicable, make no new appointments, pay well the men who are retained in the Service, and as -far as possible decentralize the details of administration by giving increased authority to a well-selected deputy in each State. The country would benefit more from that policy than from a proposal to further centralize the administration, and create a new large and costly Department.

A Board of the land proposed by the Bill means additional expenditure,tbe extent of which we do not know at present. I take it that it is left to Parliament to fix the salary of the chairman and members. If there is to be a Board of three, I submit that the public servants ought to be asked to recommend a representative, who should then be appointed by the Government. I do not think that the Government would be justified in asking the Public Service to submit a number of names, and then to select the representative from that number; public servants, as I say, should be at liberty to nominate their own representative. one appointment to be made? would then be the responsibility of the Government. The Bill makes the double furlough provision retrospective to the year 1919. There are, however, a number of public servants who retired during recent years, and who do not come under the Superannuation Bill, though some of them have pensions under. State Acts. These men contend that they should be emI t is apparent that braced by the double furlough classes. They regard it as unfair that, after they had given the best years of their life to the Public Service, they should suffer beI do not say that those cause of a difference of opinion on the subject. An endeavour is made by the Bill to do justice in this regard, but justice is not done if the Bill is retrospective only to 1919. It has been held on different occasions that there is no power to grant double furlough; but I find the following opinion given by the then Attorney-General on 30th November, 1917: The Attorney-General has advised that an officer is entitled to a second term of furlough or to leave under Public Service Regulation A t any 89A, or pay in lieu thereof, in respect of the period of service following upon the granting of a first term of furlough. That makes it clear that a man who bad served a given time was entitled to both furloughs, or. to payment for the time. In face of that opinion, the Bill is made retrospective only to 1919. of the present Attorney-General( Mr Groom) ? t who was the Attorney-General in 1917. ter ( Mr Hughes) .was Attorney-General all through 1917. on the point.

185,Mr Watt,"The present Attorneythe Attorney-General would require no higher authority than that of the Prime Minister. I do not say that he is not liable to error, but nevertheless he was the highest authority in the Commonwealth at tbe time the opinion was given, seeing that he was not only at the head of the legal profession, but also at the head of the Government. The officers who have signed this memorial advance a number of reasons, which I need not detail, and they conclude as follows:For tlm above reasons it is respectfully submitted tliat, in relation to furlough or payment in lieu thereof, it wonld be just and equitable that thc provisions of the Public Service Amending Uill, referring to thc second term of furlough, should be made retrospective and applied to all officers who had served the State and the Commonwealth for over twenty yours at thc time of their retirement, and not to a portion only of the retired officers. If the provision is to bo made retrospective in any respect, I concur that those who havo given twenty years of tlieir time to tbe Commonwealth and the State have earned their furlough, and should get it. But thc matter should be dealt with on grounds of equity. I sliall clo all I can to help tliese officers to obtain what thoy have asked for in this reasonable way. Ono other matter I wish to discuss Speaker under the Bill. utmost confidence in Mr Speaker; I believe that he would give a fair deal to every one under his jurisdiction, but I am not too certaiu that the time has not arrived when those who are employed in Parliament House should be placed under the Public Service Commissioner. They are confined to this building. They may spend all their lives hero, .and be unable to secure promotion outside. trouble is that they do not always get the best treatment here. ""While I know that Mr Speaker will always treat them fairly, I am sorry to think that the same consideration is not always extended to the officers of Parliament by another gentleman iu the building. I have a lively recollection of what happened recently to one young lad whom I always found was obliging and attentive to his duty. Because of some little trouble that arose between himself and the President of the -Senate he had to go and take his chance in the cold world outside. persecution. was never satisfied with the decision given by tbe President of the Senate in his case, and it is for that reason I mention this matter of dual control to-day. AlthoughI would be quite prepared to leave such cases to the decision of Mr Speaker, who will always give the officers a fair deal, there is another gentleman who has control over certain employees of this Parliament with whom Mr Speaker may sometimes come into conflict. This dual control leads to endless trouble, and I take this opportunity of referring to it so that the gentleman on the other aide of the building may see that notice is taken of the treatment he is meting out from time to time to men in the employ of Parliament. Tbe Bill is clearly a Committee measure, and when we get into Committee we must give its clauses every consideration with a view to improving them. Therefore, having dealt with the two cardinal points, namely, the creation of a Board of Commissioners and its -personnel, and also tbe dual control of the offioers of Parliament, I shall defer any other remarks I may wish to make until the Committee stage. I havo the is my intention to vote for the second reading of this B ill ; but I wish to emphasize one phase at this stasp, that is, that every public servant should have an equal right to approach the Arbitration Court to appeal against anything be may contend is wrong in the Bervice in which he is employed. The B'll limits the right of approach to the Arbitration Court to men drawing up to a certain But the salary; but I contend that, if it is right for an officer who is drawing a salary of £300 to approach the Arbitration Court to appeal against the conditions under which he is working, or against the salary fixed for his services, it is equally right that every other member of the Commonwealth Service should be entitled to approach the Court irrespective of his salary. Therefore, when we are in Committee I shall vote against the clause imposing a limitation in this respect. When a measure dealing with a similar question was before the Western Australian s Parliament, of which I was a member,",38,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where
186,Mr Charlton,I am sure that,39,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where
187,Briefly. I T Refers To The Position Of Mr Mr Foley (Kalgoorlie) [3.19],It,39,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where
188,Dr. Malokev,It was a case of cruel,39,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where
189,Mr Charlton,"I think it waa. Iit was strongly debated, and I did not bear any sumcient reason advanced for making the differentiation established in the Bill before us. The Premier of Western Australia said at the time that he would give consideration to the representations made for the abolition of the differentiation, and, although he did not make any alteration to the Public Service Bill itself, which was then under discussion, he subsequently embodied in a Public Service Appeal Board Bill the right for any civil servant, irrespective of his grade of employment, to approach the Arbitration Court set up by the State Government to deal with wages and conditions in the Public Service of the State. It was not the ordinary Court that deals with every industry. It was a special Court, as I have described, and it has worked very well. Every one has a desire to see the public servants treated properly, but at the same time it should be every one's duty to see that the -public servant gives a fair return foT the remuneration he receives from the public of Australia. It is said throughout Australia that members of Parliament pander, to a great extent, to the public servant. I have a fairly big electorate, and there are a lot of public servants in it, but I have not been afraid to say anything to any section of the community when necessity arose. There was recently an upheaval amongst the civil servants in Western Australia as .a protest against the treatment they were receiving. It was a debatable question as to whether they were right or wrong, but I freely expressed the opinion that they were wrong, and never neglected .the opportunity to tell them so. However, the result of that strike was that the Government took steps to give public servants the right of appeal, irrespective of grade or salary; and I would like to see the Attorney-General put this phase of the question before his Government. If it is good to give the man on the lower scale of 'wages the right of approaching the Arbitration Court, it is equally good that tbe man receiving higher pay should have the same right. But the wiping out of the limitation would do more than that. Whnn an officer goes into the Arbitration Court he has to put up a case to justify the rate of salary he is receiving. If the lower-pa d officers are obliged to do this, ; Mr Foley. wby should not the public have, by the same means, a guarantee afforded to them that good service is being rendered for the money paid to the officer on the higher rate of pay? In these circumstances, even at this late hour, I would like the Atforney-General'to discuss the matter with the Government with a view to doing something in the direction I am urging. Every honourable member who has spoken upon this Bill has complained that lack of opportunity has been given for its discussion. But I have not heard of any member being stopped from discussing it ; in fact, we have had greater opportunity of debating this Bill and expressing an opinion on it than we have Arbitration had upon many other measures. The subject-matter of the measure has been before Australia for many years, and there may be some ground for suspicion in the fact that it has only been brought forward for enactment on the eve of an election; but the same suspicion will apply to anything this Parliament probably may do between now and the forthcoming election. I should hope that there was sufficient loyalty among all parties in this House to combat sucb an accusation. I trust that, during the forthcoming campaign, those who are opposing one another upon the platforms will have very little to say in criticism of the manner in which the Government have introduced this legislation. We all know that at the end of every session the same thing occurs. At the end of last session I expressed my regret that this Parliament was following tbe same procedure that has been adopted by every Parliament in the British Empire, that is to say, we talk a lot in the first part of tbe session and do nothing, and at the fag end of the session endeavour to get through a great deal of work, with the consequence that it is not done as well as it should be done in a National Parliament. k great deal has been said with reference to tbe fact that this Bill is being discussed so close to tbe end of the session, and I agree that this is a measure for the discussion of which plenty of time should be allowed, but I do not think it can be claimed we have not had sumcient time for its consideration. It is over twelve months since it passed the Senate, where the discussion upon its various clauses was long and ample, and we in this House",39,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where

194,Mr Bowden,"Our experience hasofficers in country districts. Such omcers do not get into touch, to any extent, with the metropolitan areas, and have consequently to take upon themselves a great deal more responsibility than have those who are stationed within the metropolis, pnd therefore come under the immediate superintendence of the heads of their Department. The Senior Postal Inspectors in each State, having regard to their increased responsibilities, ought to be reclassified and raised in status. Postal Department would do well if it established district superintendents, who could take complete charge of large districts, and in respect of those districts do work very similar to that which the Deputy Postmasters-General are at present transacting in the several States. Sooner or later, we shall have to face the question of whether or not, in connection with the Postal administration, we aro going to adhere to State boundaries. If we created postal districts independently of State boundaries, and increased the numbei of our deputies or superintendents so that they would have more immediate control over large districts, irrespective of the State boundaries, thc administration would be very much better than it is. We should get a better service and better remits. The only other quesriou with which I wish to deal is that of dual furlough. I recognise, with the Attorney-General, that there is always a difficulty in attempting to apply any provision in a Bill to a date prior to that on which the Bill will come into force. We shall be up against such a difficulty in the clause relating to dual furlarly to the suggested appointment of a lough, since it goes back to 30th November, 1919. We have in the Public Service of the Commonwealth many men who have done good work, and who have contended all along that they are entitled to dual furlough. the Department for years on this very question. Some of them who, at the end of twenty years' service, were entitled to take their furlough were requested by their respective Departments to postpone it from time to time. they were told definitely that the departmental arrangements would not permit of their taking their furlough as it fell due. Their furlough, in this way, has been postponed from tim<* to time, so that, on Mr Howden. their retirement, they havo been granted only six months instead of the extended furlough to which they were entitled. These men still have their case before the Government, and the fact that they may have retired before the dato now fixed in the clause relating to furlough does not alter fhe equity or justice of their claim. I hope that when we go into Committee the Attorney-General will be aJble to tell us what amount would be involved in The making the clause wholly retrospective. I admit that the proposal is surrounded with much difficulty, because the moment we extend the provision for double furlough to retired public servants who are still alive, we shall probably have a suggestion that compensation in liou of furlough should be given to the widow or next of kin of any deceased public servant who was entitled to dual furlough. thing to apply it to the widows of such men. present only that retired public servants who are still alive should have the dual furlough provisions of this Bill extended to them, irrespective of whether they left the Service before or after 30th November, 1919. There cannot be a great number of them, and if that is so, the Government might well extend the dual furlough provisions of this measure so as to include all who have retired, irrespective altogether of the date of their retirement. remarks I have to offer on this Bill will bo brief, and will relate more particuBoard of three Commissioners. When a similar Bill was brought before us last year by the present Attorney-General( Mr Groom), I expressed the opinion that one Commissioner would be better They have been fighting than three. I still feel that it would be better to appoint one Commissioner with ample power than to appoint a Board of three. I regret that the Attorney-General saw fit to withdraw the previous Bill, because a great Service like that'of the Commonwealth should be conIn other cases, trolled by a Commissioner of considerable power and ability, capable of so guiding the responsible Minister as to enable him to maintain the efficiency of the Service.

Australia should buy the services of the most capable man-n o matter what the cost-that is to be found in the world. member go outside Australia to find a Commissioner ? in the inteiests of Australia. I should do so. The Commissioner should be. empowered to choose an assistant, who also should receive a good salary. Neither the Commissioner nor his assistant should be subject to the Public Service Act and regulations, and should be subjected as little as possible to political influence. Unless we have as Commissioner a man whcse knowledge qualifies 3 him to advise the Government, and to take action wherever necessary, there is little use in making an appointment. It was said when the last Public ServiceB ill was before us that we should bave a Board of three, so that it would be competent to deal with the various Departments. If we secured the proper man for the office of Public Service Commissioner he would be competent to determine whether or not the system in operation in any Department was up-to-date and effective. The appointment should be a permanent one, and a man of outstanding ability would soon put the whole of the Commonwealth Departments on a basis that would be satisfactory alike to public servants themselves and the country as a whole. No public servant is satisfied when his Department is simply bungling along or is in a chaotic condition. Tbere is a .certain degree of Freemasonry amongst all public servants. They do not "" s p l it "" on each other if anything goes wrong, and so the trouble goes on. I am not blaming the Minister for this; I have already said it is unreasonable to expect the Minister to go into details such as a competent Public Service Commissioner would be required to consider. I would ask the A t torney-General, therefore, to give serious consideration to the question of so amending the Bill as to provide for the appointment of one competent Commissioner at a salary high enough to insure his independence, and to command the qualifications necessary for the occupant of such an office. If , however, the honourable gentleman still considers I believe that we ehould have that a Board of three Commissioners is necessary to place the Public Service on the business footing that it should occupy, I shall not oppose the B ill . I am sorry that be saw fit to throw under the table the measure that the honourable he introduced last year, and I am glad that he bas resurrected it . I hope he wil l at least make the experiment of placing the Service under one Commissioner. Applications for the position should be invited by . public advertisement, and in order to secure a man of exceptional ability a salary approaching £5,000 per annum should be offered. He should also be given an assistant, w it h a salary of, say, £1,000 a year, to save the Commissioner's valuable time by attending to t h * more minor details of his administration. Where so many millions are involved the Commonwealth, in doing that, woidd be taking a step that would make for efficiency. The appointment of a Board of Commissioners consisting of three members will amount to the creation of a Department which would be less efficient than one Commissioner. . -Unlik e many of those who have spoken during the debate, I take no exception to the introduction of the B ill at this time. Hadi t not been introduced, some other measures just as important would now claim our attention. Ever since I have lieen in Parliament measures have been introduced at the end of the session.

Public Departments cannot be run, in every particular, like a private business. Tbere are many duties required of public servants wbich the average business man would not undertake. I can imagine how a business man placed at the head of a public Department would act if he were required, at the request of a member of Parliament, to prepare some voluminous or detailed return. A capable head of a Department keeps his staff up to the point of efficiency and preparedness, not only to carry on its daily duties, but to undertake, at short notice, intricate work of this character. I am not prepared to say that the average business man presents a model of the type of individual required to run a public Department; but there are undoubtedly some business concerns which set a splendid example. There aro the cable companies, for example, and I may mention particularly, the Eastern Extension Company. It affords its oflicers far more, and more liberal, concessions than are available to public servants. Cable Company's employees are bettor paid, and are given longer furlough and more attractive working conditions than is the case in the Public Service. Such an example might well be f ollowed; but. I do not suggest that we should take business methods generally as a guide. member favour a Board to consist of three Commissioners, or the retention of the one Commissioner? to carry out duties of a varied character, I should say that three Commissioners would be necessary; but, if its actions and the Department who has laid the charge. responsibilities are to be similar to those of the present Commissioner, one man should be adequate for the task. In any case, the Board should be assisted by an efficient body of trained inspectors, for whom there would be ample work. But I would not have the inspectors placed in positions of authority where they could overrule departmental chiefs in technical departmental matters. Why should an inspector be called in to decide whether an additional operator is required in a Post Office? Shouldi t not bo suffie'ent for the head of the Department to act in this respect upon the experienced advice of bis senior branch officer? In every instance care should be taken to provide the head of a Department with an adequate staff. It was probably a lack in this direction that I recently had cause to complain of the delivery of mails in the suburbs of Hobart. The suburban delivery was being made as late as 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and thc first city delivery was not being completed until inordinately late. I havo now been informed by the Postmaster General( Mr Poynton) that reform has been brought about, and that, for the future, the first city delivery will be over by 9 a.m., and the early suburban delivery by 11 o'clock. I welcome the Bill for one reason-be causo it will embrace a greater. number of servants than is coveredby tbe Act to-day. Those to be included will feel, no doubt, that they are being properly treated as units of the Service; and, as a result, the loyalty and discipline of the whole should be enhanced. I trust that the Commission, or Commissioner, will The appoint Boards in the various Departments to deal witb the petty cases whicb continually crop up. I do not know of anything more dcplorablo than, an experience which came undor my notice in a State Department. There, the head had the power to fine men or order reductions in their salarios. When a public the honorablo sorvant has committed a breach of the regulations he should be tried by a body of men who will not be* subsequently responsible to the head of the Department in which they are employed. Officers cannot be expected to give unbiased consideration to a case if they are required to work afterwards under the head of Considerable improvements and many savings should be effected if the right men, or man, can bo selected to sit upon thc Board. I desire to make a brief personal cxplanation. In the course of my speech on this Bill last night, possibly owing to my own want of lucidity, or due to interruptions in the chamber, my. utterances were not correctly reported by the Age.

Up to the present time, we have managed very well with eontrol by one Commissioner. No doubt, the Attorney-General will try to convince a majority of honourable members that this Bill will allot so many and varied duties to the three Commissioners that it would be a physical impossibility for one Commissioner to perform the tasks wbich. the Government propose shall be intrusted to a Board. He will require, however, to put forward stronger arguments than he advanced when moving the second reading of the Bill, to convince honourable members that it is desirable to have three Commissioners instead of one. I anticipate that there will, be very little, if any, difference in the number of officers required to assist a single Commissioner and three Commissioners respectively. The honourable member for Denison( Mr tbe AttorneyLaird Smith), speaking from a wealth of experience as a public servant, said that sometimes interference by officers in the higher grades of the Service militates against the expeditious and efficient carrying out of work. Wise supervision of Public Service operations is very necessary, but undue interference and meddling with men who are carrying out technical work is unjustifiable and unprofitable. I do not believe for a moment that the number of public servants will be reduced by the appointment of three Commissioners instead of one. The chances are that the three Commissioners will require more assistance than the single Commissioner has required hitherto. Under the present system, the Commissioner delegates power to an Inspector in each State; in fact, the present Acting Public Service Commissioner graduated from the position of Chief Inspector, and he has, so far as I know, following the lead of bis illustrious predecessor, carried out his duties faithfully and well. It may be true that the Bill is enlarging the duties of tbe conwhether it be a Board of three Commissioners or a single Commissioner, will be dependent, to a -large extent, upon the advice of subordinate officers in thc dif ferent States. For the greater part of their time, the three Commissioners will be engaged in the administrative centre which to-day is Melbourne, and in a few years' time may be Canberra; and, for their knowledge of what is being done in the different States, they will be dependent upon advice and reports submitted from time to time by subordinates. As control by a single Commissioner, witb Inspectors in each State to whom he ha? delegated powers, has operated fairly well in the past, I see no reason for incurring the extra expenditure that will be involved in the appointment of three Commissioners. Each Commissioner may require a secretary, and each one when be goes on tour, may require a whole retinue of officers to accompany him. will create a big Department. more easily manufactured by three meu than by one, and. each one will, doubt-",47,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where

As the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has said, this question has been pretty fully discussed, but I should like to add a few words by way of justification of the attitude of the Government. The amendment touches a fundamental provision in the Bill, a provision which was inserted in view of fche experience of the working of the Public Service Actsof Australia. Since 1902 until the present time we have been carrying on with one Commissioner. There has been a natural growth of the Public Service with the growth of population, and witb the transfer from time to time from the States of various departmental activities which properly belong to the Federation. This has resulted in imposing increased duties on the Commissioner. transferred has created new work, on different lines, involving transfers, promotions, fixing of salaries, and a whole series of fresh obligations. We bave had in is the Acting Commissioner, two men who have given the most f a it h f u l service to Australia. was administering the Act he was rarely able to visit any of the other States. He made only one visit to Western Australia, and in that time be was able to visit Queensland twice only. I mention this to show the difficulties of the Commissioner in dealing with the classification of duties, transfers, promotions, appealsand' so forth, and in obtaining first-hand knowledge of the conditions throughout the Service. Then Mr Edwards, during the six years he has been Acting Commissioner, has been so tied down by his routine office duties that he has never been able to leave Melbourne.. That, is not because Mr Edwards does not desire to visit the other States, but simply because his routine duties are so heavy. doing 1 lent the assistants may be, I am sure honwhich he thinks the Commissioner will orable members realize the difficulty of administering affairs in Queensland by exercise its good sense if it agrees to the means of assistants, while the responsible appointment of one official, becausethis, head is in Melbourne, and never sees tbe I am sure, would prove to be to the beat other portions of the Commonwealtli. I take Queensland as an illustration, because there is a great diversity of settlement and population under temperate, semi-tropical, and tropical conditions. Commissioner might go to Queensland, leaving his assistants to carry on in Melbourne. done. duties so tie him to Melbourne it means that one of tbe three members of the Board would always have to be here. point presently; I am just nowasking honourable members to realize the enormous'amount of work of an ordinary routine character that has to be performed. McLachlan himself recommend ? Every Department Commissioner only, but, while not doubting the value of his opinion, my reply is that there are duties necessary to the administration of the Public Service other than those of mere classification and routine work generally. The burden on the Commissioner grows as Australia grows in population, and as those 1 I find from inquiries that activities increase which are the natural outcome of a healthy community... During the. last twenty years there have been complaints connected w i th the administration of the Public Service.

227,Mr Groom,"He recommends onea wide experience in the conduct of financial matters and general management. I admit, of course, that Sir Robert Gibson had had practically no experience of the inside working of Government Departments, and that very often men from the outside do not sufficiently appreciate the value of the services rendered in thc Departments of the Commonwealth. But many business men who were associated with Commonwealth administration in connection with the war have expressed their unbounded appreciation of the high character and ability of thc public servants of Australia; and it is a pity that the encomiums passed by men like "" Mr George Swinburne and others have not been made known in thc press and elsewhere. period, great Departments are growing up and covering the whole of the continent, it is necessary from time to time to have examination, revision and checking of the work of administration, in order to see Avhether Australia is getting thc best results for her expenditure on the Public Service. Thc Economies Commission, with Gibson as chairman, went into the various Departments, and gave ns of their best in the inquiries they instituted. Clause 16, together with the proposal to make the Board act as Commissioner as well as a Board of Management, have the approval of the Chairman of the Economies Commission. The members of that Commission had no other desire than to give their best services to this country; and this is what they say on page 85 of their first progress report1. The outstanding feature in connection with the conduct of business in those Federal Government Departments which have been investigated by thc Commission to date is the absence of systematic control or check upon the economical working of the Departments. 2. Not only is there no systematic, comprehensive, and continuous check upon the economical and efficient working of thc Departments individually by hcadB of Departments, or as a whole by the Public Service Commissioner, but this duty is not recognised by those officers as part of their work. 3. This does not necessarily mean, nor is it intended to convey, that all branches of thc work of all the Departments is extravagant and inefficient, for we have had thc pleasure of investigating some branches which are admirably managed, the work being economically and efficiently conducted, in spite of the absence of any satisfactory control over economy Mr Groom. and efficiency by the head of thc Department and Public Service Commissioner. 4. Such results, however, arc attributable to some officers satisfying self-imposed standards. only a placard after a l l ! statutory direction as to what the specific ; duties are. On page 86 they say34. It seems to us that thc duty of maintaining such safeguards upon the economical and efficient working of the Departments should be performed by some authority quite independent of the Departments themselves, and as free from the possibility of its powers of healthy criticism being in any way impaired or intimidated, as the Auditor-General is in regard to his check upon 'accurate and honest accounting. The clear suggestion is that there should Wliere, during a long be, throughout the Commonwealth Departments, some system of standardization, some uniform method of costing, and some means of checking waste, so that it may be seen that each Department is giving value for the money spent. This is necessary in such Departments as the Worlcs and Railways Department, in the Postal Department, and in the subSir Robertsidiary branches of the Defence Department. Those Departments have already systems in. operation. It w ill be the duty of the Board to see that a properly efficient system is adopted by every branch of the Public Service. quite obvious that we shall need a Commissioner to carry out classification work, and a separate Board of Management for doing the other work to which the Minister has just referred < is quite righ t in one respect, b u t he w i ll sec that under the B ill it w ill be possible for the Board of Conmrssioncrs to apportion the different classes of work -among the individual members of the Board.

The Board will look at the work of each Department from the outside, and call upon the adnrnistration of that Department to justify its methods and procedure. It will also have power to hold an inquiry within oach Department in order to ascertain oxactly how it is being conducted. It is obvious that where there are three Commissioners the Board will allocate to each individual Commiss oner certain : duties to facilitate the work at meetings of the Board, and they will insure that when they meet .as a body they will be able to do their work efficiently. Board the Government will look for men with those qualifications which are most likely to secure a thoroughly efficient Board. Honourable members talk about trying to get economy and efficiency in publio administration and about doing away with surplus, officers. They make all sorts of suggestions for reform in that spectors cannot make an adequate inspecdirection. The Board to be appointed will carry out the whole of those reforms which experience has shown that a single Commissioner cannot undertake. single Commissioner could not carry out these reforms, for thc simple reason that he cannot sacrifice his duty of dealing with promotions, transfers, &c, by devoting weeks of his time in an endeavour to ascertain whether mora efficient or economical methods of conducting their operations cannot be adopted by the various Departments. That will be the task of the Board, and it will be of advantage to the Departments themselves to have an independent body bringing outside .criticism to bear upon them. Every permanent head who is anxious that his Department should be the best in the Commonwealth will welcome any suggestion tending to make it more efficient and adding to the kudos attaching to work that is being done in the interest of the public. In vestigation by a Board of Commissioners is the only means I know of by wbich we can secure that efficiency and economy desired by honourable members. For instance, although there is a costing system in operation in the Department of Works and Railways, thero are different opinions as to who should be responsible for operating it, whether it should be the works officers or the Accountancy Branch. A question of this character would be determined by the Board, which will see that a uniform method is applied tbroughout the whole of the Public Service. A great reform should thus be brought about. At any rate, the proposal carries the imjmmatur of the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Economies. It may be contended that the appointment of a Board of Commissioners will lead to the creation of a new Department, and we may hear honorablo members repeating the old and familiar story of the appointment of some one who commences with an office and a desk and a messenger, and then proceeds to bu ld up a huge : Naturally, in the choice of a staff around him. As a matter of fact, the Public Service Commissioner already has a staff-h e could not do without one -and obviously thc Board of Commissioners must have a staff. I may point out that it is proposed to repeal the clause dealing with inspectors. We believe that the present number of n : tion of the Public Service great for them. We have as Public Service inspectors men of the highest quality who are carrying out their work as well as they possibly can, but a different system of inspection must 'be set up.

250,Proposal As Put Forward By Mr Mclach,"there should be a single control. I do not think that the arguments put'forward by the Minister have answered.his contention. In fact, the whole of the points advanced by the Minister are answered where he saysIn my opinion there' are strong reasons against alteration of the present system of management of the Commonwealth Publio Service, Control by a Board of three members necessarily involves a more cumbrous procedure than by a single Commissioner, and consequent delays in settlement of questions of administration. In addition, the important factor of direct and personal responsibility would be sacrificed by the appointment of a Board. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the Commonwealth Service differ very materially from those of a State Public Service, seeing that the former Service is spread over all the States forming the Commonwealth, necessitating the location of a Public Service Inspector in each State, exercising delegated powers of the Commissioner. l n providing for the future administration of the Public Service Act, it would be disadvantageous to establish a 'Public Service Board, with the consequent inelasticity of control and the diminution of personal responsibility. The existing system of management by one Commissioner will undoubtedly better meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Public Service, provided that the necessary assistance is given him to carry out the duties and extended functions to bo conferred upon him. He then proceeds to describe exactly the than will be required if the proposed new plan difficulty that has been experienced in of organization be adopted. the preliminary work of making the Service thoroughly efficient.

The pressure of official duties upon the Public Service Inspectors has reacted upon the Commissioner, who must of necessity pass in review much of the work of his Inspectors, and accept the final responsibility for all administrative action. After a careful analysis of the position, and keeping in view the necessity for bringing the whole of the Commonwealth services under one general authority, I am satisfied that full justification exists for relieving the Commissioner and Inspectors of some uf the detailed work at present required of them, and in particular that connected with promotions, transfers, and increments to salaries. These are matters the handling of which, fhe Attorney-General has just said, are likely to weigh down the three Commissioners who are to be appointed. Mr. McLachlani n his report went on to state thatLater sections of this report dealing with the classification of the Service and promotions and transfers of officers will disclose the burdensome requirements of the present procedure in relation to promotions, transfers, and increments; and from these it will be evident that if these requirements are to be still demanded of the Commissioner and Inspectors, they can only be met either at the continued sacrifice of other important functionsa sacrifice which would be detrimental to the economical and efficient working of Departmentsor else by making provision for an increase to the inspectorial staff to a far greater extent It is mainly in the direction of largely transferring to heads of Departments existing reinvolving, in many cases, heavy expenditure in the removal from one station to another of officers and their families; and, under the they will be placed in a position to deal with right of appeal being extended to officers under conditions to be prescribed, and the",52,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where

The mended that there should be a re-arrangement of the work of the Commissioner and his staff, so that the Commissioner himself would not be clogged with details. This B.ill, as outlined by the Attorney General, however, means a continuance of the present centralization of control. many of the reforms suggested in Mr McLachlan's report are embodied in the Bill. Dr EARLE PAGE -Then I can only say that the honourable gentleman was most unfortunate in his explanation of this part of the B ill . I listened most carefully to his second-reading speech, and I understood him to say that it was neoe3sary to have a Board of three Commissioners so that certain work could be allotted to each and the whole work of the Department handled in the one central office. That is altogether different from the procedure suggested by Mr McLachlan. suggests for the simplification of procedure are included in the B ill . Notwithstanding that, there is still a heavy balance of work on the Board of Commissioners. sioner, in his report, points out that nearly all these matters which we are told will be attended to by the additional Commissioners to be appointed should be dealt with by the Public Service Inspectors. He says that there should be an.Assistant Commissioner, and that' The Assistant Commissioner should he responsible for. the carrying out of thc details of administration as prescribed by regulations, subject to decision by the Commissioner as to policy matters; he should direct and check the work of Public Service Inspectors as well as that of the head office staff, and in the absence of the Commissioner on official duties or during recreation or other leave he should discharge the functions of the Commissioner. The Commissioner should be empowered to delegate to the Assistant Commissioner any of -his duties or powers considered necessary from time to time, but only in his absence should his arbitral or appellant functions be exercised by the Assistant Commissioner. Further on in his report he states thatThe duties of Public Service Inspectors should be primarily to inspect Departments and report as to improved methods of organization and possible economies; they should be responsible for the control of temporary employment, and generally act as representatives of the Commissioner in their respective States in ex-Commissioner there recomall matters affecting the administration of the Act. In another part of his report he suggests the utilization of the services. of outside persons to discharge practically tbe additional functions of which the Attorney General has spoken. It seems to me, after a careful scrutiny of the report qf the Economies Commission, that the Board of Commissioners will be called upon to exercise functions different from those of a Commissioner in complete control of tbe whole Service. I tried this morning to elicit from the Attorney-General a statement as to whether the Board's functions, from beginning to end, would be of an executive character-whethe r the Board would have complete control or whether it would merely report to the responsible Minister and have no executive power. power. It is to be responsible for the reclassification of the whole Service.

The first of these relates to the question of whether or not the Public Service of the Commonwealth is to be controlled and managed by a Board as is now proposed or by an individual Commissioner. I am not convinced by the arguments of the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) or by those of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) in support of the appointment, of only one Commissioner. Board of three. We have suffered rather over much in this Commonwealth from dictatorship, aud considering that we have in the Public Service now some 24,000 individuals coming within the Public Service Act. There are also exempt oflicers. have a very large number, so that the responsibilities of the Board are very great, and the effects of an economical administration of this great instrument upon the interests of the country as a whole are important and far-reaching. I can well understand the frame of mind in which the ex-Commissioner, Mr of the State they meet to collate the inMcLachlan, approached this subject. He had held the oflice of Commissioner, and I have no doubt, although I have no particularly convincing evidence of it, that he was a very able administrator. On that point I accept the word of those who pretend to know. doubt, a very faithful officer of the Commonwealth, but he approached this question from the point of view of one who for a considerable time had exercised these dictatorial powers. The difference between a Board and an individual Commissioner is to me parallel with the difference between allowing a Judge to give decisions on certain questions of fact and having a jury to do so. The honourable meinber for Fawkner( Mr not necessarily to be the one man at all; Maxwell), by interjection, has anticipated naturally stand strongly for the retention of the jury system. There is a feeling that a Commissioner with powers that are almost absolute is likely to be what is commonly known to the working classes as a "" boss,"" and he sometimes becomes a very severe one. As to thegeneral administration of the Public Service, whether it be by an individual or by a Board, there must be many delegated functions to be performed by representatives of the Commissioner or the Board in different parts of Australia. The Commonwealth is too wide, its Public Service is much too far flung, to permit of even the three members of the Board having immediate personal knowledge of its"" workings in every part of the Union. They must rely, as every other manager has to do, upon their represenI welcome the change to a tatives and agents, but in the last resort it is quite clear that the final word in the management of the Service must rest either with the Board, as is now proposed, or with the individual Commissioner, as has hitherto been the practice. I think we should distribute the responsibility between at least three Commissioners. I need go no further for a parallel than to our own Victorianrailway service. There we have, as ,1 understand is the case iu the other' States, a Commission of' three gentlemen, who learn to apportion their work according to conditions aud, possibly, according to taste and ability. Having discharged their separate functions in different parts formation they have gathered, to compare notes, and to avail themselves of each other's knowledge in order that they may have a perfect system of administration. That system obliterates the tendency that any one man will have to He was, no give expression to his own prejudices, his own idiosyncrasies, and it better reflects what is b°st in the public mind in regard to the administration of the Service. I am opposed, therefore, to gathering these great powers into the hands of an individual Commissioner. I welcome the change proposed in this Bill.

With a Board of three Commissioners the cost of management will not be greater than with a single Commissioner, but the responsibility will be thrown on three men instead of on one. If we find that mistakes are being made in regard to one section of the Public Service, Parliament will not have to remove all three Commissioners; we shall be able to put our finger on the place where the mistakes are happening, and can remove the man responsible for them.

So far as the reclassification of the Service is conof a long and great experience, says that) it can be most efficiently done by a single Commissioner, and, on the other hand, the members of the Economies Commission, looking at the matter from a different point of view, and considering rather the efficient working of the Departsent Commissioner-, would be absorbed in ments than the classification of the Service, recommend the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, whose duties should be to supervise the Service and to make recommendations in regard to various matters, with a view to its more efficient and economical working. It seems to me that the work of classification is distinct from that of management, and I should think the ideal arrangement would be to have one Commissioner charged with the duty of classifying the Service. He should be a man possessing an intimate knowledge of the Public Service and of all its intricacies and peculiarities, who would be able to do this work efficiently. also be a Board of Commissioners charged with the other functions that are specifically set out in the Bill. Tbe result of that arrangement would benefit the whole Service. I understand that, in the past, the one Commissioner system has, on the whole, met with the approval of the Public Service. Certainly I have heard no general dissatisfaction with it expressed by the public servants themselves. the three Commissioners undertake the work of classifying the Service? the Minister, the present Public Service Commissioner finds himself practically tied to Melbourne from one year's end to the other., attending to the particular duties of his office, without regard to the additional duties whose performanceis contemplated by the Bill. The Minister in answering my question whether, in the event of a Board of three Commissioners being appointed, it would not be found necessary to apportion the task of classifying the Service to one of the Commissioners, who would not be tied to Melbourne, said that the work 'would be apportioned among the three Commissioners, and that one would probably be different class of work, and the third something else. sioners would, of course, sit as a Board. they could do that, each man being saddled with a very important set of functions. Each man's work would be all-engrossing to him. He, like the pretbat work from one year's end to the other, and the three Commissioners would have no opportunity to meet to discuss matters common to them all; indeed, they would have nothing in common. _ If the Commissioner to whom tbe classification of the Service bad been assigued were to ask his fellow members to meet him, of what use would their advice be to him unless he had put them into possession of all the information that was before him, which would be quite impracticable. an ex parte statement. There should to me that if we agree to the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, and allot specific duties to each, all of them will be working on their own. Railways Commissioners are in the same position as these Commissioners will occupy. about that.. Their duties as Railways Commissioners would not be as dive-se as those pertaining to the members of the proposed Board. The tasks of the latter would be so varied that it would be impossible for the three to take counsel together with respect to the results of the work of any. one of them.

The Acting Commissioner is, presumably, carrying out his duties in the matter of classification, and the like, with adequacy and general satisfaction to the Service. But Parliament and the public have expressed a desire to import business methods into the administration of Government Departments. It would be impossible for the Acting Commissioner to undertake that task. I suggest, therefore, that he be permitted to remain where he is, and to carry on his particular functions of classifying the Servioe, but that a business Commissioner be appointed also, who will insure that the Service shall be run on business-like lines. With that provision, the one Commissioner for each function would be better than three. ber is now suggesting two. pointment of one mana "" big"" man, not a man for detail, but one who will be capable of putting his finger upon defects in any and every Department, and who would have the capacity to reconstruct the Service upon strictly business like lines. ber know of any one man in Australia wbo could "" stand up "" to such a job ? number, I am sure. I do not suggest that this individual should have intimate personal knowledge of every Department and branch of a Department; but he should be capable of applying business methods in any and every direction. I may mention the case of an accountant who can step into any class of business and point to weaknesses of business administration. An accountant will come in from a softwoods house and audit the books of an insurance company, and thence he will go to a shipping company. He knows in every instance whether the business is being run on sound lines. ancy view-point. point of view of economical business management. That is the type of man who should be appointed in this instance. If several men of outstanding capacity are appointed they will not be likely to agree; and, the greater their individual capacity, the more likely will they be to differ in their opinions. ber suggest that his proposed two Commissioners shall be of equal standing? tinue his own special work of classifying and the other could enter into the business side of the Service. There could be conferences between what I might call the "" business "" Commissioner and the "" cleri. cal'' Commissioner. The former, in the course of his business investigations, might be of opinion that a Department was over-manned, and he could bring that point under the notice of the other. [5.371 -Ho w the Attorney-General can disagree with those members who advocate the appointment of one Commissioner, in view of the fact that the Bill proposes that one of the three shall receive a higher salary and be regarded as tbe superior of the others, I cannot understand. Some honourable members have contended that one Commis3ioner could not possibly doall lan carried out his duties very ably; but I doubt if he, with all his experience, or any other individual, could take up the task outlined by this measure. If three Commissioners are decided upon, the Government will select one as Chairman, who will receive more pay than the other two. The Chairman will at once be stamped as the "" Chief"" ; he will run the Board, and that means that the Board will be a one-man Board. In addition to a Board of that character, there would certainly need to be a body of advisers for every branch of the Service. the honourable member upon the Public Works Committee was that be bad just as much "" say "" as the Chairman.

These two could enter one of tlie foundries in my district, and mould their maii out of iron, with the clockwork arrangements inside. That is the only way in which the Government will be able tn get over the one-man difficulty. This is not an age of supermen. I was amazed at the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt). The right honourable gentleman bas bad Ministerial experience, both State and Federal, yet he suggests that tbe scope of the Board's duties should be so comprehensive than there would surely be no need o.ther for heads of Departments or Ministers; the Board would have complete control of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The honourable member's views, are absurd. The Government's proposals, aa outlined in this clause, will satisfy nobody. 'opinion that tbe duty of classifying the Service, and of controlling the machinery for promotions' and the like, should be separated from the function of recommending economies and efficiency in the various Departments To that extent I agree with the remarks of the honourable members for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) and Swan( Mr Prowse). there has been a demand for the appointment of a Board to investigate the Commonwealth Service and recommend M'here and how so-called business methods can be applied. The suggestion that business methods should be introduced into the Commonwealth Service is rather overdone. The adoption of the same methods as are operated by business firms would not give satisfaction to the public. The function of a Government Department is to give to the people facilities that they demand, but the methods -employed by certainly achieve efficiency, but gain for the individual is the objective. The Public Service is not operated for the sake of making profit, but we do require efficiency in the rendering of service to thc public. I am doubtful whether control by a Board of three Commissioners will improve the Public Service to any great extent. Economy and efficiency sbould be insisted upon by the Ministerial head of a Department, but he is dependent upon advice that can be given only by experts in the Department. How can a functions and methods of a Department make recommendations to the departmental heads as to how greater efficiency and economies can be achieved? I am not convinced that we would be justified in placing the control of the Service in the hands of a board of management. Such a Board would take several years to go through the whole of the public Departments and understand them sufficiently well to make recommendations that would be worthwhile. If the Committee decides to continue control by one Commissioner, the duties of his office must be confined within present limits, namely, appointments, promotions, and classification, and the idea of control by a business Board must be abandoned. If business control is necessary, it will have to be introduced in some other form. The two functions-administrativ e control and business management for the sake of economy-canno t be combined. For that reason I shall support the amendment. ney-General) [5.50] The. honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has suggested that there should be a Commissioner to do the classification of the SerNo doubt vice and to make appointments and promotions, and that, in addition, there should be a business board of management. We could not have two authorities over the Public Service, each with distinct functions, which, however, would be liable to come into conflict.

It would not do to bave another authority coming in and saying that in order to secure coordination and economy this office and that office should be abolished.

Classification is one of the duties which will require its underlying principles to be determined by the whole of the Board. That body will also hear appeals, except where a delegation takes place. If we try to give half the proposed duties to a Commissioner, and another half to a Board of Management, practical administration will be almost impossible. authorities work in harmony? mate power and authority must rest with somebody. rest with the Minister. upon the Commissioners, but the carrying out of the reforms must become ultimately a matter of Ministerial responsibility. If two authorities are appointed to carry out different duties relating to the same service, there may be conflicting recommendations, and efficient administration will be difficult. If the Committee decides to strike out the provision for the appointment of three Commissioners, I cannot see how all the duties that are set out in this Bill can be performed by one Commissioner. sball practically have to fall back upon the existing Act, and adopt a certain number of recommendations that will facilitate administration. All the talk about business methods, economy, and greater efliciency will have to be cast to the wind. One of the vital issues involved in this amendment is whether we are to try to introduce into the Public Service administration business methods which will insure greater economy and efliciency. mittee decides upon control by one Commissioner instead of three, we must of necessity drop many of the other provisions in tbe Bill and practically continue tbe present Act with necessary amendments. three Commissioners have over and above that which tbe present Commissioner has? missioners' will be to go through all the Departments, revise their methods, and consider questions of costing, contracts, methods of obtaining supplies sioner do those things under the existing Act? and he has not sufficient authority to do them. missioners will play "" Old Harry"" with the two the Service. will bring about a more equitable administration and a more contCTited Service. Ou the whole, the administration will be found to be more liberal than under the present law, because this Bill introduces provisions which will facilitate administration. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that one of the first duties to be performed by the Board will be the reclassification of the whole of the Commonwealth Public Service. That will be a' very big responsibility, and the Commissioners will have to bring their special knowledge to bear upon it. Minister anticipate the work of reclassification will take? twelve months. begin to think of other duties until the reclassification is complete? tion and other preparatory work will have to be clone.

In fact, there is nothing State. that the new Commissioners will be called upon to do that the old Commissioner has not done for many years, through the instrumentality of his inspectors in the various States. The new Commissioners are to advise upon systems and methods adopted in regard to contracts for obtaining supplies, and upon contracts referred to the Board by a Minister, and tp see to the establishment of systems of 'check in order to ascertain whether the return for expenditure is adequate. In this the new Commissioners are called upon to enter into the work of the Audit Office; so that, after all, they are only to do what is now supposed to be done by an existing Department. There is no reason why there should be any increase in the number of those called upon to supervise the Public Service; and I shall vote for the retention of one Commissioner only.

If the ComW it h a little experimittee decides to strike out the word "" three,"" and insert "" one "" in lieu thereof, thus re-establishing the old system,it is deliberately putting its imprimatur upon a system which a Commission' of business men has said bas already produced the very abuses the Commission was appointed to point out and recommend means of remedying. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) complained to-day that the Public Service was overmanned. I do not think that the figures he quoted prove his case. On the contrary, I think they proved the opposite. He said that the number at the beginning of Federation in tbe parsay, 1,111. and Federal figures. 0 ber took four Departments, and pcinted out the increase in tbe number cf officers, but, as a matter of fact, the number of officers taken over from additional DeI f the Commission partments absorbed since Federation, together with the number employed by the Commissioner of Taxation, whose staff has come into existence since then, practically account for the whole of the increase. The honourable member was complaining that the Public Service was overmanned, yet I understand he is supporting an amendment which would, if carried, deliberately resurrect the very system under which the abuses about which he bas complained have grown up, and would",63,Smith Th E Honourable Right To Appeal To A Special Board Where

If we created separate bodies dealing to some extent with the same body of men their work would overlap, and instead of having accord, coordination, and smooth working, we should probably have the two bodies up against each other, and fighting one another all the time for their own ends, which is exactly what we want to avoid. In creating this body of three men, and giving them the powers of management which are proposed, Ministers will have available to them a body to which the hundred and one questions that crop up in the administration of Departments from time to time may be referred. All sorts of recommendations will filter through their hands, and I feel confident that, although the cost to the country may be a little more, that money will be saved many hundreds of times over in the course of the year. The honourable member for Kooyong has also referred to the position in the State of Victoria, in which there is only one Publie Service Commissioner, but he has forgotten to mention the fact that there are only a little over 3,000 public servants in the State Service who come under bis control. On the other hand, there is a Board of three Public Service Commissioners in New South Wales, controlling over 16,000 public servants, and we are proposing to appoint three Commissioners, and to give them additional duties for the purpose of controlling 23,500 Commonwealth servants.

By dividing the functions of management among three Public Service Commissioners, we shall run the risk of failure. The Railway Department of New South Wales was never better conducted than when it was controlled by one Commissioner, Mr Eddy. The State reverted to the three Commissioner system, but I cannot say that there has been any improvement. If we are to have a Board of three Commissioners to control the Public Service of the Commonwealth, we should insist that one shall be a representative of the public servants themselves. The public might, be represented by an outside business man if honourable members so desired, and the chairman should be appointed by the Government. No such provision is .made in the clause. We are told that the Service is over-manned and that the three Commissioners w ill reorganize the whole of the Departments. What are the functions of heads of Departments at tihe present time? Surely it is their duty to carefully organize their Departments and to reduce their staffs where reductions are necessary.

Prom that list the Government themselves would be free to make a choice. There is a tendency, in many industrial enterprises to-day, of providing for a voice in the boards of management by those eniployees engaged in the industry itself. My amendment, if accepted, would amount to a recognition of that principle on tbe part of the Government. Surely no one can be more competent to deal with the problems and difficulties which the Commissioners will be required to solve than an experienced public officer.

Where public servants are entitled to representation, it is to be given to them under this Bill-for instance, in regard to appeals against classification and punishments. In regard to classification, the Board may in a judicial capacity consider tbe appeal of a dissatisfied officer in conference with a representative of the Department concerned and with the appellant, or a nominee of the organization to which he belongs, or with an agent of the appellant. Also, if the public servant desires to appeal from the punishment imposed upon him for an offence, he may do so to a Board comprising a stipendiary or police magistrate, a representative of the Department, and an elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs.

There must be, first of all, the classification of the Public Service, which may, of course, involve alterations in the terms of an award, but when the classification is completed the Arbitrator will continue to make his awards as at present. Only those servants drawing salaries of £ 3 1 0 per annum and upwards will be excluded from the Arbitrator's Court. For the reasons I have given I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh anticipates one that 1 had intended to propose. TheA t torney-General has not slightest reason wby the amendment should not be accepted. He has told us about the representation to be given to the employees in connection w it h appeals against classification and penalties, but he has not dealt with the principle underlying the amendment. The public servants of the Commonwealth are in the same category as employees in the State railways. railways do not appoint one of the Commissioners. able member's friends have prevented tbem from doing so, but I am hopeful that in the course of time the friends of the railway employees will take their seats upon the Treasury bench in the State Parliament, amd will give to them the right, which we are claiming now for the Commonwealth publio servants, to appoint a representative on the body which controls them. It is a very small thing to ask that the employees should have a consultative voice on the Board which will control their every-day lives, and lay down the conditions of their service generally. The public servants are so modest and moderate in their request that all they ask for is representation. TheA t torney-General rightly said that the proposed Board of Management will not be on a par with the Whitley Councils. The latter were introduced as a sort of social insurance scheme-as another red herring to be drawn across the economic path in order to divert the activities of the in dustrialists. The trend of development in other countries, especially in Europe, is for employees to be given a share in the control and management of industry: and I welcome the amendment before the Committee as a step in the right direction. I remind the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) that in Italy the railway employees have representation on the body that controls the railways. have not one representative; they have complete control. But if the bonorable member is not in favour of the Red objective at this stage he may be disposed to attach some weight to the Italian approximation. I understand"" that the Italian workmen also have a say in the control of the Post Office. offered the very bad Post Office. an innovation for employees to claim a share of the representation on the Board controlling their employment.

But the employees in the Representation is given on the appeal Boards only. vice is governed by a Council, on which the publio servants have representation. orable member's statement. But, irrespective of whether or not this principle obtains in It a l y, Russia, or Great Britain, it is a proper one and should be applied here. The Attorney-General has not stated one valid reason why tbe amendment sbould not be accepted, nor did he touch upon the principle of conceding the right of the public servant to ba represented on the Board of Management.

The public servants are just as necessary as are the workers in other industries, and it is quite right that they should have representation in the management and control of the services they render, just as it is right that miners, railway men, transport workers, seamen, or any others who carry on the industrial life of the country should have a say as to the conditions under which they shall work and the governing of an industry. It goes without saying, -1 think, that those who claim to represent the workers must vote for this amendment. I have no donbt that the Government majority will be registered against it, but the discussion to-night will show the workers outside that their representatives here, at any rate, are voicing their demands even though they be couched in such moderate language as the amendment presents. hope the Minister( Mr Groom) will give the amendment further consideration. 1 am disappointed witb the honourable gentleman's reasoning in favour of its rejection. He sought to make it appear that the Bill as drawn did not necessitate any direct representation of the public servants; but, in my view, the day has arrived when it must be recognised that the Government, as well as private employers, if they wish to get the best out of their employees, must give them recognition in cases of this kind. We cannot hope to make a success of the Public Service without due recognition of the public servants, who nre the men best informed as to the condition of the various branches. It has been decided that there shall be a Board of three men, and we ought now to decide that at least one shall be appointed by the public servants to look after their interests. It is idle to deny that this Bill touches matters which not only affect the interests of the public servants but also vitally affect the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. Quite a number of the duties allotted to the Board practically necessitate the appointment of a man with practical knowledge of the Service. The Government may appoint three men who are really not in touch with many branches of the Service, and possibly know little or nothing about the whole business. Such appointments hold some high position, and are, therefore, considered to be suitable. There has been too much of this sort of thing for a considerable time past, and men have been appointed to responsible positions at high salaries for which they are absolutely unqualified. thing that has been said against the Government during these discussions. it is well known that such has been done in many cases.

That is one danger attaching to the 'amendment. 'always putting forward the view which is always advanced by employers. employers are the Commonwealth of Australia, the people who are endeavouring to have their Service managed and controlled in the public interest. The honourable member has made reference to Whitley Councils, but those bodies have nothing whatever to do with the management of an industry. Those councils may consider certain matters relating to employment in an industry-for instance. wages and working conditions-bu t they do not control the management of an industry, nor do they fulfil similar functions to those which this Board will have to undertake, namely, the complete control of the hundred and one matters which relate to the administration of the ComI have in my remonwealth Public Service. For this purpose we must not appoint men who are advocates of any particular class. The dangerof appointing an advocate of the interests of one particular class is that there may be a conflict between his duty and his interests.

The persons who are appointed to the Board of Commissioners will be expected to fulfil the purpose for which they are appointed, and will not be expected to represent the interests of any particular section of the community. The honourable meinber has also referred to the British Public Service, but he was wrong in implying that there is any nominee of the public servants in charge of the management of that service. There are certain departmental committees and councils upon which the employees are represented, but no such body is in charge of the whole of that service in the manner in which our Board Commonwealth Service. It is the British Treasury which controls the British Public Service. Again, under our Bill power is given to the Board to delegate to one Commissioner the power to investiTake, for instance, the case gate certain matters and carry out special functions..

It is only natural that individuals sbould have different political views, but there are honourable members on both sides of this House who are, nevertheless, capable of giving an impartial judgment upon facts. That, however, is not the point at issue. Where a Beard is appointed to carry out very important public and judicial duties? and to hold the balance impartially, it would be falsifyin g its position if we were to have one of its members representing the interests of one particular, section only. respect of other Boards? representation to the public servants on the Superannuation Board, but they are entitled to it , since tbey are equal contributors with the Government to the Superannuation Fund. the publio servants have an interest in the administration of the Public Service? is of a different character from that which they have in respect to the administration of the Superannuation Fund. The trouble is that an organization of the public servants may be advancing certain claims which may or may not be in tbe public interest, and it is only human nature that their nominee on the Board of Commissioneia would beinclined to support those claims. We are all liable to make demands which we believe to be right, but which others may not consider to be right. In any case, as f a r as the Public Service is concerned, we provide an Arbitration Tribunal to deal with matters relating to wages, salaries, and so forth, so that there is really no necessity for the application of the Whitley Council system on that account. the whole of the representation. We are simply asking for one man out of three. dicated the duties whicb the Commissioners will be asked tb perform.. Tbey will be of a varied character, and the power of the Board may, in certain cases, be delegated to one a reCommissioner. If we appoint u nominee of the Public Service whose principal .duty, will be to safeguard the interests of the employees, he may be the Commissioner chosen to carry out the task of safeguarding the interests of the public. Tbat would obviously lead to a conflict of duties and place him in a position which he should not be asked to occupy. head, or chief officer, would have the right of appeal to the f u l l Board of Commissioners. the argument. We are discussing tbe fitness of a certain person to occupy a certain position. I contend that the man selected should be absolutely free to give H a v e you not done so in a judgment according to what he believes to be in the public interest, whereas the honourable member would appoint some one who, instead of keeping the public interest solely in mind, would be constantly swayed by the fact that he had been appointed to represent a certain class interest and whose first thought D o you nob think that would be whether he was serving properly those who had nominated him. In the circumstances, I cannot see my way to accept the amendment. Minister( Mr Groom) has demonstrated forcibly that be is quite out of touch with all modem thought on this question. His arguments are such as should not be seriously p u t forward on a proposition like this. The only criticism I have to offer upon the amendment is that it is rather moderate. I think that the -employees should have equal representation on the Board with the Government. The Minister has certainly not met the argument advanced by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr. Makin), by way of interjection, that he is merely asking for one Commissioner out of three. He has only attempted to do so by saying that this one Commissioner might be the one chosen to function on We are not. asking for behalf of the whole Board.

453,Mr Scullin ( Y A R R A ) [9.28],"Th ehe admits the same principle in the appointment of the Classification Board and of the Appeal Board. Having practically approved of the principle in these two Boards he then proceeded to say that a man nominated by the Public Service to a Dosition on the Board of Commissioners could not be expected to be judicial; that is to say, he could not be expected to take a place on a Board having a judicial function to perform. But will not the Aopeal Board bave judicial functions to perform ? Does the Minister suggest that the nominee of the employees, when acting upon the Board, will be absolutely partial and onesided on every question ? I cannot understand the attitude of the Attoney-General, and would like him to reconcile the two views. sided over by a magistrate, and each side is represented. It has to deal with a purely judicial matter-a n appeal relating to an offence. pect the three members of the Appeal Board to exercise judicial functions, and to take an honourable and impartial view of the matters submitted to them. The honourable gentleman's argument is that tbe representative of the employees must necessarily be biased-that he must necessarily be an advocate; but that the representative of the Government in every case will be absolutely impartial. If the Attorney-General says that only one side can be impartial, his argument is not sound. have said that if a man is appointed to represent a special interest, he will naturally do so. the Public Service would not be appointed to this Board as an advocate of the Service any more than the Government nominee would be appointed to advocate, in the interests of the Administration, or of economy, something unfair to the Public Service. I wish, however, to come to what is a bigger question than that relating to conflicts that may arise between the Public Service and the Commonwealth. If it is fair that the Public Service shall be represented on the Appeal and Classification Boards, where conflicts will arise, there is a stronger reason why the Public Service should be represented on the Board of Commissioners. representative of the Public Service on the Board of Commissioners might obviate a number of appeal cases. scarcely a thinking man in Australia today who does not recognise that it makes for efficiency to call into the councils and the administration of his business a representative of his employees. I have been reading lately a good deal of what is taking place in Germany. Germany is out. not only to recapture her old trade, but to secure much of the new trade of the world; and whilst she may have done many things that we would not like to copy, we cannot afford to treat with contempt her methods of efficiency. We have been dealing in this House with legislation to meet particularly the dumping of German goods in Australia; but one of the things we have to fear far more than Germany's depreciated currency is the efficiency of German methods. I read that German manufacturers, although they dislike the principle even more than the At-"" torney-General dislikes the principle embodied in this amendment, have decided to take their employees into consultation. They are forming throughout Germany Workers Councils, and the workers are being represented on Boards and Councils controlling German industries. .That procedure is being enforced by Statute in many parts of Germany,' and manufacturers there are accepting it only because they know that when the currency question rights itself they will have to compete Avith the rest of the world. lute benefit to the "" boss."" the ^boss"" is the people of Australia.

He seems to take up the attitude that the Board should be an external body dragooning the Public Service. suggest to the honourable gentleman that we have got beyond a condition of that kind, and that we have to-day, and should encourage, a spirit of absolutely loyal co-operation throughout the Service. The Commonwealth Service should be trusted. 1 There should be cultivated amongst its members an esprit de corps, so that they would realize, as I believe they do already, as an appeal to their honour, that the country looks to them to give loyal and devoted service. But the Minister says, ""No. We must beware lest we sbould have to exercise disciplinary measures upon the Service. A representative of the Service on the Board could not be depended upon for disinterested or impartial advice or administration."" The Minister is taking an entirely wrong stand, and his case is undermined by the fact that already in connection with Appeal Boards we have admitted the principle of representation of the Service. I would be content, and so, no doubt, would the mover of the amendment, to have this representative chosen, not necessarily from the members of the association, but by a plebiscite or any other method of ascertaining the will of the whole Service. I would allow every .member of the four divisions created by rhe Bill to vote in his selection. I do not know whether tbe Minister is immovable on this point, but I suggest that his determination to make the Board a body external to the Public Service is a clear indication that he expects that it will be compoped of men who are not in sympathy with the Service, and possibly do not understand it ; that they will be the representatives of persons outside the Service, looking to effect economies for the [123] general public without regard to the efficiency and good feeling of the Service.

A t one time there was a Public Service Boardi n Tasmania., consisting of three individuals. One of these was selected directly by the Public Service. I am. bound to say that while tlhat Board remained in existence No matter what may be the Service representative did his duty fearlessly! and honestly; and, to give point to my remarks, I may add that tbe functions of that Board were largely the same as will be those of this proposed Board. But the Tasmanian Board of three broke down; not because of any injury arising from the fact that it embraced a direct representative of the SerThey cannot vice, but from sheer weight of numbers They concentrate concentrated upon the work of one man. A one-man Board is now operating in The proposed Board Tasmania. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggested that if there were a direct representative of the Public Service upon the Board there might be all manner of intrigue. He suggested that it would not be possible for the Government to secure a man, either from a State or the Commonwealth Service, who would be able to rise above sectional interests to. the truest responsibilities of his office. The n fche honourable Sucb an accusation amounts to a slander upon our Public Services. I had said anything of the kind, but I advise the honourable member to refer to Hansard.

497,Mr Foley,"On a point of order, Ithe facb that the honourable member for franklin has accused me of making a statement wbich amounts to a slander on the Public Service. That remark is offensive and I desire that it be withdrawn Mr Mc WILLIAMS -If my interpretation of what the honourable member said is regarded as offensive, I withdraw it, of course. But if the honourable member did not mean' what 1 have indicated, he certainly meant nothing. If the argument of the honourable member meant anything, it was that it was not possible to get in the Public Service a man who could do his duty ou the Board honestly und fearlessly. The honourable member said that no man could serve two masters, and that a representative of the Public Service would truckle to those who had appointed him, to the detriment of his position and the public interest. I believe the Committee has made a fatal mistake in deciding upon control by three Commissioners, but if there are to be three it will make for the benefit of tbe Commonwealth and contentment in the Public Service if the employees know that there will be at least one man on the Board who will be able to state their views with knowledge and without fear. I hope the Minister will accept that amendment.. Everybody who knew the representative of the Public Service on the Board in Tasmania knew that he would do his duty fearlessly on any body to which he was elected. And there are, in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, hundreds of men of similar capabilities and integrity. If one thing would between the lines, and I foresee the cry give the public servants confidence that they would be treated fairly by the Board it would be the fact that, at least, one member of the Board could state their claims in regard to any issue that arose. Good work cannot be got out of any discontented body of men, and because I believe that representation of the Service on the Board would conduce to efficiency and contentment amongst the public servants, I support the amendment. I am surprised that a reasonable and sane amendment was not accepted readily by tbe Government, or alternatively, that they were not forced to do so by tbeir supporters.. I remember sitting on the Ministerial side n few years ago with some honourable members who are there now, and on more than one occasion forcing the Government to do things which they did not want to do. But now it seems sumcient for the Prime Minister or the Minister in charge of the House to say, "" I must have the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill,"" or "" I must have the whole clause and nothing but the clause as printed"" for Ministerial supporters to troop behind the Government when the division bells ring. A request has been made by fourteen Public Service Associations that if the Board of Management is to comprise three members one shall be a representative of the public servants. Throughout the whole of the State Public and Railway Services that principle has been applied. Nearly everything that has to do with the welfare of State school teachers in Victoria is administered by a classification Board to which the teachers t r i cnnially elect a representative. The new Victorian Railways Act provides for a Board to determine many of the most important matters in connection with the operation of the railways, and upon that Board are representatives of the railway servants. It would appear that the Government are afraid to select any Commissioner from the Public Service. O cannot help coming to the conclusion that the Government have made up their minds in regard to two of the appointees who they expect will prove to be strong men, but, in my judgment, the public servants may look out for trouble if those two men are appointed. I can read in of "" excess of officers."" That is the usual cry raised by a Government, and some Boards who are under them, when they wish to bring about a reduction of the Public Service. That was the cry when the land boom in Victoria, collapsed, and what did the Government do? They sent notes to hundreds of public servants advising them that, owing to the imperative necessity for retrenchment, tbeir services would not be required after a certain date. Those men were thrown out of permanent positions, but within a week of their services being dispensed witb they were asked to return to temporary employment.
