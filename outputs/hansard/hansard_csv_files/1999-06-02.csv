It being 8.00 p.m., (2) A message be sent to the Senate acquainting5876 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 Wednesday, 2 June 1999 National Organ Donation Awareness Day Ms O'BYRNE (Bass) (9.40 a.m.)-Last Sunday in Launceston, we celebrated National Organ Donation Awareness Day with a thanksgiving and remembrance service conducted by the Australian Kidney Foundation. They are a not-for-profit organisation who have been in existence since 1968. The service allowed us to pause and reflect on the advances which have transformed so many lives in the second half of the 20th century. The development of dialysis and transplant technology has given a second chance at life to people with kidney failure. Just a few decades ago, those lives would have been cut tragically short. Now there is the capacity to extend their life expectancy, which can even outstrip many of their contemporaries. One Tasmanian woman who was just 21 when she suffered terminal kidney failure celebrated this week the 31st anniversary of the transplant operation which has extended her life into her fifties. While that may have been something of an exception at the time, successful transplants have now become commonplace. But all of them, of course, require uncommon generosity in the form of organ donation. The service provided an opportunity for us to acknowledge the gift of life, to remember those who gave and to give thanks for the lives extended. It was also an opportunity to reflect on the extent of the needs and how we in the wider population can help to address them. Every year, 500,000 Australians consult their doctor with some form of renal infection or associated problem. In total, kidney and urinary tract problems are the cause of 8.4 million visits to the doctor, or 32,000 consultations each weekday. The annual cost to the health system of kidney and urinary tract disease is more than $900 million. While the goal remains to prevent kidney disease and renal failure, for thousands of Australians it is already too late. There are currently about 3,000 people on the national pooled waiting list for a transplant operation. The waiting time is about three years. Governments now, though, are turning their attention to organ donation. The Australian health ministers conference at its next meeting in Canberra on 4 August will consider a South Australian proposal to increase the rate of organ donation. The South Australians have reported extraordinary success from a three-year trial. The. organ donation rate has increased in the trial to more than double the national average and almost three times the rate in Tasmania. The South Australians have done it by establishing an independent agency to promote awareness of organ donation in the community, recognise and meet the needs of recipients, fully preserve the dignity of donors, and recognise and meet the needs of donor families. The new approach has shifted the emphasis to supporting families. It ensures a sympathetic and understanding approach to the families of potential donors and offers a full counselling service to provide support and backup. The results are impressive and I support its adoption on a national basis. Researchers around the world are working on many exciting possibilities in transplant technology. Internationally, biotech companies are working on the developing science of clonal",149,Adjournment Amount When You Think What He Has Lost And

Work for the Dole: Hawkesbury Skills of the Hawkesbury Skills Work for the Dole program running in my electorate. Hawkesbury Skills have been implementing Work for the Dole since its inception and have an innovative and highly successful program. It provides a valuable combination of work experience, choice, vocational and social development and active pursuit of employment with projects of genuine benefit to the local community. This approach, along with its number of different strands, allows it to cater for the broad diversity of background, skills and interests of its participants and is part of the reason for its success. The current program offers to participants a number of projects. The horticulture, landscaping and environment strand has already completed a number of successful projects and has greatly improved and enhanced the physical amenity and usefulness of several key sites in the local area. The desktop publishing service provides a valuable resource to non-profit community organisations, producing for them quality promotional material, pamphlets and brochures. The added benefit of this has been the strengthening of links with the local community. The next step in this area is the extension to more sophisticated promotional material such as video and/or CD-ROM production under a program they have called Totally Motivated Design. This is an exciting development which is attracting a lot of interest both locally and further afield. Fourthly, their construction and property maintenance strand has provided valuable work experience and skill development for the young people as well as producing much needed maintenance for some local facilities and construction of valuable improvements such as the installation of disability ramps completed as a result of work with the Hawkesbury Access and Equity Forum Committee. Fifthly, their local arts project was an important feature within the rejuvenation of part of Richmond's central business district. Hawkesbury Skills' success has been outstanding. Of the 208 participants in the previous and current Work for the Dole contracts, 54 per cent have gone on to further study or employment. At Hawkesbury Skills, they display a victory board which lists the names and the progress of people who have left Work for the Dole and gone on to further study or to employment. They have completed three full boards with names of successful graduates from their Work for the Dole program and are on their fourth board of people moving on to study, to full-time study or to employment-that is, over 100 people have achieved success out of Work for the Dole. The wide range of occupations, study courses and the start of worthwhile careers shows a fascinating insight into the range of interests and the employment opportunities available and is a tribute to the hard work of the team at Hawkesbury Skills.

(Time expired) Coastal Surveillance a record four Customs ministers to address the issue of Port Kembla's lack of surveillance and the stress the five Customs officers covering Sutherland to the Victorian border are forced to work under. Australia, because of its lack of coordinated coastal surveillance, has become a popular destination for refugees and a money spinner for unscrupulous smugglers dealing in human cargo. Just yesterday came news that another 13 illegal immigrants had penetrated Australia's coastline in the west. This comes on top of the human cargo vessels that have plied the Australian coastline in the last month. It really has become a case of 'another day, another boat'. With this year having hit its mid point, we have already seen a 122 per cent increase in illegal immigrants arriving on our shores. It will come as no surprise that there are more on the way. Despite all this and despite the government having been warned, our coastal surveillance has been diminished rather than enhanced. It is seriously underfunded and seriously underresourced. The answer so far by the government has been the establishment of a prime ministerial task force, due to report findings by the end of this month. The Customs minister has now been saying publicly that the report deadline may have to be extended. What for? The minister already has a series of reports but she is determined not to release them publicly. The reason is that the reports will reveal that the government was warned to expect this plague of human cargo arrivals long ago. While they were being warned, the government continued to penny pinch from our front-line coastal defence agencies. This is what will be revealed by the reports that the government refuses to publicly release. These reports reveal that no surveillance of major ports like Port Kembla has left communities absolutely vulnerable to the smuggling of drugs, people and contraband. The message is out there in Asia, Africa and the Middle East that Australia's coastline is an easy touch. It is a message heard loud and clear by smugglers and the people with limited confidence in the future of their current homelands. Protecting Australia's territorial integrity does not come cheap, but this government does not appear to recognise that effective coastal surveillance cannot be achieved on the cheap either. You will need more than an aeroplane buzzing around the sky to ensure territorial integrity and need more than the five dedicated Customs officers undertaking their duties with one h!lnd tied behind their backs to protect the community. It is time for the government to forget about reports and instead act now to defend the coast against an ever increasing incursion of human cargo headed for Australia. While the government does nothing, it is leaving our coastlines vulnerable. There are boats even today off the top end of Queensland, and what is interesting is that the boats are now coming down",151,Representatives Main Commitiee

They are still coming down the west coast, but they have added the east coast to their itinerary, and the fault lies with the government and its penny-pinching methods. (Time expired) Crimes Against Older People: Sentencing I believe we as a society have to urgently address-that is, the criminal activities directed at one of the most vulnerable groups in our community, the aged. The latest figures from the Bureau of Criminology reveal an alarming rise in the incidence of crime against older citizens. It is something that all decent Australians find appalling and outrageous. Occasionally we see a story on the news about one of our senior citizens who fought off an attacker. We condemn the cowardice of the criminal and marvel at the tenacity of the older victim, as well we should. But, sadly, for every one of those high profile incidents there are thousands of victims who simply could not fight off the offender. In this the International Year of Older PersonsI believe we need to look at new ways to help solve the growing problem. While police and sentencing are state government matters, I feel compelled to speak out on behalf of the thousands of older people I represent. This generation of seniors have earned our respect and admiration. Many fought in the Second World War. They worked hard to build Australia into the fantastic country it is today. They are very strong, tenacious individuals, but physically-simply by virtue of their age-many are frail or just not as able as they once were. They do not deserve to spend their retirement either fearful or having to lock themselves in their homes with expensive and invasive security measures. They should not have to worry that someone will try to swindle them out of their life savings or snatch their handbag when they go shopping. In my view, one part of the solution is to set in place much tougher sentences for those who commit crimes against people over 60 years of age. It is not the whole solution. I think as a society we have to reinstil values of decency and respect for our elderly. This starts in rebuilding family relationships and ensuring children have a loving family environment in which they can learn such values. However, I think we can start to tackle this problem. I am calling on all state governments to look at doubling the sentences given for a particular crime if it is carried out on someone over the age of 60. If someone was convicted of assault and would have normally received five years and that assault was carried out on someone over 60, then the sentence should be automatically doubled to 10 years. Let us face it, people who prey on this age group are cowards. They figure they are going to get the same sentence if they try to mug a robust 25-year-old who might fight back or an 80-year-old, who physically has less chance of doing so. So they go for the easy option. But they may think twice if they know that they will get a much tougher sentence if caught targeting older people. It is incumbent on all of us as law makers to lookÂ·at ways of addressing the concerns of this generation. I have written to the Queensland state Attorney-General asking that he look into this option as a way of protecting our elderly. It will send a strong message to criminals that, as a society, we will not continue to tolerate their targeting of this age group. Tougher sentencing and, may I add, truth in sentencing is one way we can tackle the growing incidence of crime against our seniors. I calion the state governments, which are responsible for sentencing, to look into this matter with urgency and to take action to protecour elderly.",152,Representatives Main Committee
195,Mrs Elson (Forde) (9.49 A.m.),"I rise today in this House to speak out on an issue that5880 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 Parents Anonymous: Funding Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (9.52 a.m.)-I raise today the lack of funding for Parents Anonymous, a service in Victoria which, after 25 years of service to the Victorian community, has now lost its funding. That funding was $100,000, which was provided by the state government in Victoria to provide detailed counselling services to parents who were in crisis. As a result of the funding being cut by the Victorian government, there is no phone counselling service available in Victoria for parents in crisis. There is a parent help line which the Victorian government has been telling us is the equivalent. However, that help line provides only referral services. It does not allow a mother or father in crisis to call and talk through with a trained counsellor the issues that they might be dealing with in such a way that they can handle those issues, rather than taking it out on their children if they have got to that point in their crisis. This service closed on 14 May this year, after 25 years of operating at the presbyterian church in Collins Street, Melbourne. Over 70 volunteers worked for this service. That is why a service could be provided from 7 a.m. until midnight on the small amount of $100,000. A large number of those volunteers live and work in my electorate. Certainly, a large number of the callers live in my electorate and have found this service to be of great value over the 25 years. I am very concerned. The reason I raise this matter in this federal parliament is that Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services, said in the recent budget statements that the government have great concern for parenting issues and that a large amount of money should be put into educating parents and providing counselling and mediation. I would urge the minister to intervene in this matter and either encourage the Victorian government to reinstate the funding or provide the funding themselves so that Victorian parents are not disadvantaged compared to parents across the rest of the country. In New South Wales and Queensland, Parent Line is funded to provide counselling services as well as advice and referral. In Victoria, the Kennett government has not seen fit to provide sufficient funding for those counselling services to be available immediately for parents at the time of their crisis. In recent times we have even seen a hotline set up for AFL footballers if they are having trouble dealing with drug ana alcohol issues, dealing with family crisis or dealing with difficulties in being away from their family when they travel. AFL footballers can ring if they are experiencing any difficulties or are in crisis, but parents across Victoria do not have a similar service. I think $100,000 is not too much to ask this minister to intervene, and I would encourage her to do so. Pratt, Mr Steve Wallace, Mr Peter CARE workers Steve Pratt and Peter Wallacby Yugoslav authorities is appalling and almost beyond our understanding. The most charitable and forgiving interpretation of this miscarriage of justice is that it is a result of a misunderstanding of what these two fine Australians were doing. .

My local newspaper in Mackay, the Daily Mercury, galvanised the feeling of outrage in the local community and organised a petition calling for the release of Peter Wallace and his colleague. The overwhelming response, 6,500 signatures, was a testimony to fine reputations so deservedly earned by the Wallace family. I circulated that petition to all members and senators and I want to. thank those who so willing signed it. The response was tremendous and it gave heart and encouragement to Mr and Mrs Wallace.

We were given a most courteous and sympathetic reception and I was impressed by the ambassador's obvious personal distress, not just as a representative of his country but as a parent who loves and cares about his own children. The ambassador is a man of culture, a celebrated poet in his country, and is keenly aware of the anguish of the families of our two CARE workers. I know that he would have conveyed that petition to his government in Belgrade with his personal observations. I would now like to mention the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer. He has defended Peter Wallace's and Steve Pratt's innocence without indulging in intemperate remarks. Mr Downer's calm, compassionate and common sense approach to this distressing matter has been a great comfort to the families, friends and supporters of Peter Wallace and Steve Pratt. I also want to thank the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, for their ongoing efforts to obtain the release of Peter Wallace and Steve Pratt. Mr Fischer and Mr Downer both met Mr and Mrs Wallace while they were here in Canberra and assured them that the government was leaving no stone unturned in the unrelenting campaign to have them freed.

I simply make the point that there is no insidious motive in suggesting this reference. This bill cuts across radio spectrum and radio licences. It has been something of a practice in the past that where technical matters such as these cut across spectrum issues they do get the scrutiny of a committee. In recent times, we have seen radio telecommunications legislation so referred. It does give the industry the opportunity of commenting on the detail of the government's proposal with which, I must say, at first sight there seems to be no difficulty. I suspect that reference to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee could effectively be done by way of written submission and on the papers. I indicate that to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is at the table, but I do not expect at the end of the day that will either delay the passage of the legislation or cause the government any great difficulty. a.m.)-I would like to thank all participants in the debate on these measures. In conclusion, I would like to summarise the merits of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1999. Firstly, this bill contains provisions for the tax treatment of domestic spectrum licences. I note the comments of the member for Perth, and I thank him for that contribution. I understand the referral in the Senate to a committee. This bill will allow a deduction for expenditure incurred in acquiring a spectrum licence, amO(l:ised over the effective life of the licence. In addition, the bill will ensure that Australia is able to assert its taxing rights over income from the use of spectrum where the spectrum licence is owned by a non-resident and includes payments for the use of spectrum licences in the definition of royalty under the income tax law. Secondly, this bill will make a number of technical corrections to the tax law arising from the tax law improvement project. There will also be technical corrections in relation to the introduction of youth allowance and the Austudy payment. Thirdly, this bill will enable the calculation of the provisional tax uplift factor using the new single measure of gross domestic product as part of the change in the presentation of the national accounts published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

The amendment I have moved will amend existing paragraph 3(11A)(b) of item 34 to ensure preservation of Australia's taxing right in relation to relevant spectrum income under the 'business profits' article of all double tax agreements which are attached to schedules to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953, whether or not the agreements are with cou-tries or territories and whether they have entered into force at the time when spectrum amendments in TLAB6 take effect or do so later. As not all double tax agreements are with countries, the amendment will ensure that the existing amendments extend to residents of territories with whichÂ· there is a double tax agreement. Otherwise, such persons could gain a tax advantage in auctions for spectrum licences as compared with Australian residents and residents of tax agreement partner countries. The amendment will also ensure that the TLAB6 amendments apply not merely to those agreements in force when the legislation takes effect but also to those coming into force later. There are currently some agreements substantially negotiated but not yet in force, and to leave these agreements unaffected could give residents of those countries an unfair advantage in auctions for spectrum licences.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Hockey: That the bill be now read a second time. Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999 but will be seeking the support of the Main Committee for a second reading amendment that condemns the government's sloppy taxation administration in failing to act quickly to close a tax avoidance loophole which now requires transitional provisions. The bill has three main purposes. First, it amends the early release of superannuation provisions of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995, which governs funds held in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve to make them consistent with the early release",156,Representatives Main Committee

202,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (10.07 A.m.),"The opposition will not be opposing the5884 MAIN COMMITI'EE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 provisions applying to other superannuation funds. Second, it amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to close a loophole which allows certain distributions of trust income to superannuation funds set up for the benefit of trust beneficiaries under non-arms-Iength arrangements to be taxed at a concessional rate of 15 per cent. Thirdly, it amends the superannuation guarantee regulations to continue, with effect from 1 August 1996, an exemption from the superannuation guarantee charge for employers who hire senior foreign executive employees who meet the criteria for former class 413 overseas executive visa. I will address each of these subjects in order. The first provision of the legislation relates to applying the early release provisions to the SHAR. When Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee reforms, many workers who did not previously receive superannuation contributions became entitled to contributions made on their behalf by their employer. The success of the superannuation guarantee and Labor's other superannuation reforms is widely accepted. Superannuation coverage increased from around 40 per cent of the work force in the early 1980s to the current level of over 90 per cent of all employees. In particular, part-time and casual workers were also able to access the benefits of saving for a retirement income through a tax advantaged superannuation account. This included the wider benefits of death and disability insurance and a host of other services offered by superannuation funds. The coverage of women workers in particular increased dramatically. Because part-time and casual employees became eligible for superannuation contributions, employers were required to contribute small amounts due to the smaller wages of these employees. Unfortunately, not all privately operated superannuation funds would accept small amounts and some employees may not have been able to find an appropriate superannuation fund that would receive small contributions. The Labor government responded to this policy challenge by creating the SHAR in 1995. The SHAR exists as a low cost, safe haven for employees' superannuation contributions which ensures that the contributions will not be eroded as a result of excessive fees and charges. Labor also introduced member protection rules applying to all superannuation funds that prevent the erosion of small balances, thus ensuring that workers' retirement incomes are preserved. SHAR accounts have interest calculated on the daily balance of the account which is then credited to the account on a quarterly basis. The interest is exempt from income tax. Employees are encouraged to build their SHAR balances up and transfer them into a superannuation fund other than SHAR. However, if an account balance exceeds $1,200, interest is only credited on the first $1,200 of the balance, which also acts as an incentive for employees to transfer their funds to another fund which allows the retirement savings to compound. Labor also recognised that some workers may need access to their superannuation savings before retirement in limited circumstances, such as in times of financial hardship as a result of being unemployed or being retrenched. That is why we introduced measures which allowed access to not only account balances in SHAR but also superannuation funds in general. When people are down on their luck, Labor's early access provision allowed limited access to superannuation generally by applying to the Insurance.and Superannuation Commissioner. An applicant was required to prove that they were suffering from financial hardship. Having proved that to the ISC, the applicant was then entitled to access some of their superannuation. Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5885 It was also possible to access superannuation accounts with less than $500 in them if they changed employers and also if a person was permanently leaving the country. In other words, if a person was no longer going to be a burden to the Australian taxpayer, they could access their superannuation contributions. The government changed the early release provisions of superannuation moneys with effect from 1 July 1998. The new provisions are: applicants suffering from severe financial hardship must meet an 'objective test' of 26 continuous weeks on a Commonwealth income support payment if under 55, then prove to their superannuation trustees that they are suffering from financial hardship; if leaving an employer, the $500 threshold for receipt of monies was reduced to $200; and, if permanently leaving Australia, access is no longer available to those aged under 55. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation examined the regulations and recommended a similar although slightly less onerous set of criteria. Labor senators, seeking a practical solution to the government's policy, proposed that the objective test should be reduced to 12 weeks. While not being the ideal situation, at least it was a better deal for people suffering from financial hardship than the government's original position of 39 weeks on a Commonwealth income support payment. The final result was that the original 39 weeks on income support test was reduced to 26 weeks, the $500 threshold was reduced to a $200 threshold, and persons leaving Australia were allowed one year's grace period to sort our their affairs while still being able to access their superannuation. The bill provides the same provisions to the SHAR. While Labor is not opposing these provisions in the bill, I wish to bring some issues tp the attention of the government that it should consider closely. People should be encouraged to leave their superannuation funds in their account to compound so it is there at retirement to provide a decent retirement income. However, those in severe financial difficulty should be able to access small amounts of superannuation to get through a difficult period. The government has introduced provisions allowing access to superannuation on compassionate grounds through the APRA. The access conditions are strict and often people in financial difficulty do not meet those strict criteria. For example, those who cannot pay their rent are not able to get access to their superannuation but those who have a housing mortgage may qualify for access if their mortgage is about to be foreclosed. There are cases where people will run up credit card debts to pay their mortgages but cannot access their super to pay off their credit card debt. Instead, this policy encourages them to use available funds to pay off their credit card debt but let the bank move to foreclose so that they can access their superannuation. That policy makes very little sense. Like many of my parliamentary colleagues, I am aware of people who have claimed to be in financial difficulty but who have had to wait the full 26 weeks before being able to apply for access to their superannuation funds. I suggest that the government might like to review the activities of this legislation and report to the parliament on how these provisions are working. The second provision in the legislation relates to the closing of the tax loophole. Schedule2 of the bill proposes to close a tax avoidance loophole, and this is welcomed by the opposition. Section 273 of the ITAA currently does not prevent the distribution of trust income to a superannuation entity set up for the benefit of the trust beneficiary. The income of a superannuation entity is generally taxed at the rate of 15 per cent if there is no 'special income' component, which is usually taxed at the rate of 47 per cent. Special income is income 5886 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 derived from certain non-anns-Iength transactions that fall within the provisions of section 273, which are designed to prevent tax minimisation. However, if certain non-anns-Iength income is distributed to a superannuation fund set up for the benefit of a trust beneficiary, it may be possible to have it taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent rather than 47 per cent. This bill is designed to close this loophole by ensuring that income derived from certain types of non-anns-Iength transactions that is distributed to a super fund from a trust will be treated as special income and will be taxed at the rate of 47 per cent. While this measure is welcome, the government is guilty of sloppy administration by having to retrospectively apply this measure. Let me showcase this example of poor tax administration for the benefit of the Main Committee. In November 1997, the Assistant Treasurer issued a press release announcing the closure of the loophole. Although this was a case of government by press release, it was a warning that a loophole would be closed and that was a welcome announcement. However, the original bill giving effect to the announced measures was not introduced until some seven months later, in July 1998. The bill concerned, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1998, lapsed when the election was called by the Prime Minister. If this was not bad enough, the measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1998 and in the bill currently before us were different from those announced in the press release of November 1997. That means that those people who acted in good faith on the government's press release of November 1997 could, in some circumstances, now be in breach of the bill currently before the Main Committee. Fortunately, the government addressed this issue by including transitional provisions for unit holders who derived income complying with the November press release that would have been in breach of the bill. The point is that these transitional issues should not be necessary. It is a very good example of worse practice tax administration. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for sloppy taxation administration by delaying the closure of a tax avoidance loophole and being forced to introduce retrospective legislation and transitional provisions"". Of cours'e we are used to sloppy taxation administration from this government. The Treasurer has been unable or unwilling to answer simple questions relating to the GST on food ih the House this week, for example. We should not forget the government's record on the superannuation surcharge, which has caused and continues to cause enormous problems for the administrators and members of superannuation funds. However, one would have thought that, given this measure is supposed to prevent the loss of some $15 million in revenue, the government would have given it a policy priority rather than waiting over a year and a half to implement it. The third provision of the legislation relates to the continuation of the superannuation guarantee exemption for employers of foreign executives. The final schedule of this bill makes amendments to the superannuation guarantee exemption on foreign executives. From August 1996, new visa classes 456 and 457 were introdu<;ed which replaced the visa class 413 applying to senior executives visiting Australia. Visa class 413 was recognised in the SG regulations as exempting employers who employ senior executives who make provisions for their retirement in their country of origin. However, the SG regulations do not exempt employers with executives employed under the new visa classes from the SG charge. Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5887 This measure continues the exemption for employers under the old 413 visa class and extends the exemption for 456 and 457 visa class holders. A question arises as to whether, although they are exempted from having to pay the superannuation guarantee contributions on behalf of their employees, those employees can salary sacrifice into superannuation to gain access to tax concessions, as has happened in the past. However, the provisions restricting access to superannuation moneys after leaving Australia permanently until age 55 are expected to prevent this practice from continuing. That concludes my observations about the legislation. accepting the amendment by the honourable member for Melbourne. he has moved is obviously completely unsuitable to the government's purposes in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999, which is submitted for consideration in the Main Committee today. I want to make a couple of comments about the member for Melbourne's contribution, some general comments about superannuation and a couple of specific comments about the bill in my contribution in this place today. Administration by press release, as I think the member for Melbourne put it, is standard practice, In relation to taxation matters-matters which affect the way in which income for the government is collected from Australian citizens and companies operating in this countrythe practice has been a matter of usual course for a long period of time, and I cannot see how it can be done any other way. When rules change, the announcement of the change in itself signals essentially the change in the rules, and legislation always follows. This is a practice which was used by the Labor Party when in power,it is a practice which makes sense and the government will continue to use it. Just as budget announcements on the second Tuesday in May have always produced a series of immediate changes to taxation rules, so too did the press release of 17 November 1997 which announced various changes to tighten rules governing access to moneys in those small superannuation holding accounts reserve funds. In the general sense, changes to superannuation I do not really like. I think people expect greater certainty, and they lose faith with, superannuation each and every time a change is wrought to the system governing superannuation. I know that in 1996 I was elected, in part, on the platform of there being no more changes to super-<:ertainly not following the processes which the Australian Labor Party followed during their 13 years in power with introducing laws, amending them, changing people's expectations and changing people's operating parameters, all of these uncertainties having been built into the superannuation system in this country by the Australian Labor Party. In this regard, I acknowledge the government's 15 per cent superannuation surcharge. It was not voted against by anybody in either House, as I understand it, but I think just about everybody in this place would hope it disappears one day. We all accept the 15 per cent superannuation surcharge was brought in as one of the many measures behind the government's determination to overturn the $10.5 billion Beazley black hole which we found when we came to power. That an amount of $23 billion was added to the government debt in the last two Labor budgets in this country is a matter of history, and the 15 per cent surcharge was one of the measures introduced by this government to overturn the debt and",157,Representatives Main Commitiee

207,Mr Hardgrave,"I thought I might have surprised you. Nevertheless, the amendment5888 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 create a surplus inside three years. WhilstI would like this surcharge to disappear down a black hole in itself because I think it sends the wrong signal to people who should be encouraged to put money aside for their retirement years, I accept it was a measure made necessary because of the economic conditions the Labor Party left this government with. Superannuation should be all about encouraging thrift, encouraging saving and encouraging people to put something aside for their retirement years. I suspect I am of a generation-in fact, I know I am of a generation-which is constantly being told I will not access a pension from the government. Rather, my superannuation contributions will be the basis on which I should retire one day about 40 years from now. I guess this is in stark contrast to a lot of older Australians who had an expectation built out of measures introduced by governments earlier this century of there being a universal pension. In fact, for many years in this country a percentage of the tax taken was a contribution to a universal pension scheme. A lot of Australians continually argue with me that, having made their contribution through the tax system, they should be entitled to a retirement income. Theirs is an understandable sentiment, it is one which I support in general terms and it encourages me to aspire to making sure I have sufficient income to look after myself and those I care about in my retirement years. Superannuation should also be about, therefore, rewarding effort. For those who have bothered to do something for themselves instead of waiting for their nation to pick up the tab of their retirement years, superannuation should ensure they be rewarded for their effort. They should be given stability in rules and regulations which govern both the money going in and the money coming out. They should be able to plan with some certainty that their expectations will be met. A very wise and, in fact, quite wealthy man-I knew him about 20 years ago-said to me when I first entered the work force, 'Don't take out superannuation until you're about 10 or 15 years shy of retiring because the value of money changes.' This was an understandable comment in that high inflation era. I guess one of the best things this government has been able to achieve is a low inflation environment, which means people taking out superannuation today can now set a benchmark for the performance of future governments to meet: to keep inflation low, to keep interest rates low and to keep the economy stable so as to ensure the expectations they have as they contribute to superannuation are met. ,The Australian Labor Party's compulsory levy-which has meant every worker in this country has forgone a wage rise over quite a number of years now in order to make sure of their having money put into a superannuation account-has had a great deal of success because of its compulsory nature. The member for Melbourne commented that we have gone from a 40 per cent superannuation contribution pool amongst Australia's work force to well over 90 per cent. Naturally, because it is a compulsory contribution. But, again, a number of people have made the comment to me that their wage increases were traded off by the people who ran the unions and Industrial Relations Commission hearings year in and year out; a compulsory superannuation was taken away from people's expectation of a certain level of earnings in order to ensure there was a compulsory saving for retirement. The fact of the matter is every small business in this country is still meeting the cost of that wage rise without actually giving the incentive to the worker on a weekly basis of the benefit of that wage rise. The compulsory superannuation levy is a wage rise forgone. There is no reward to the worker on an every-day week. In fact, in a lot of ways, the Australian Labor Party have sent a signal of devaluing Australian workers as a result of this deal. Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5889 My cynicism extends to another extent: superannuation funds administered by union officials of course have done very well as a result of the system the Australian Labor Party established. Union superannuation funds management fees which they rake off each year now contribute towards the cost of the Australian Labor Party's election campaigns. Workers in this country have their savings locked away in superannuation funds and, as some of the measures in the bill before us today dictate, it is very difficult for them to meet the criteria which may be applied in order for them to access funds because of compassionate reasons. A lot of people would like to have access to the money which they have had to give up through a compulsory levy-to pay off bills, to perhaps get rid of certain personal credit costs, or to lower personal debt. They have not had the benefit of accessing increases from their boss in the form of wage rises because they are forgone as a compUlsory super charge. They cannot direct these funds directly to paying off personal debt. It is an absolute irony that the national debt and each person's personal debt in this country have gone up while, at the same time, compulsory savings have produced an increase in the overall savings in this country. So it is an interesting point to make: we have this amazing irony that, yes, savings through the compulsory superannuation levy are up, but debt is also increasing. At the same time individual Australians would like to be able to access some of the money to repay their own personal debt-and I think this would be a very good thing. But understandably, because of the overall objectives of superannuation which are now clearly understood by a lot of people, it is difficult for them to access those funds. I suspect in a lotÂ· of ways the jury is out on superannuation and a lot of people remain somewhat sceptical, particularly as changes continue to come in. As a government, we have had to continue to deal with a number of necessary changes in order to fix up things which . were left unfixed by Labor's rush into super. Those necessary changes include those matters before us today. ; \ There is the matter of small amounts held in the superannuation holdin-s account reserve. This was a response from the Labor government after it became pretty -bvious to a lot of people that, for a long period of time, small amounts of super were bfing milked dry by management fees and people were losing their wages into superannuati(i)n accounts to have management fees drawn off them; in fact, the total amount of benefit t'-y were getting was becoming zero at a rate of knots. This was fixed back in about 1995 by the Small Superannuation Accounts Act. I What we are doing here today in amendment to this particular act is/'to keep faith with the changes announced in November 1997 tightening the rules governing access to moneys in this superannuation holding accounts reserve for the purpose of strengthening the government's retirement incomes policy and addressing abuses of various arrangements; in other words, this relates to false claims by individuals who say they are departing Australia permanently in order to access the SHAR accounts. Also, we are looking at tightening section 273, which is an existing anti-avoidance measure, so as to close a loophole which allows certain distribution of trust income to superannuation funds made under non-arms-length arrangements. They are taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent. . I would like to highlight the third part of the bill before us, which is the exemption of senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee. At the heart of this is part of the government's ongoing program to encourage further foreign direct investment in this country 5890 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 to ensure that the government's objective of internationalising the Australian economy is realised. Minister Hockey, who has been in the chamber this morning, is spearheading the government's efforts to get more direct investment in this country to make this the financial centre of our region; he is doing a very good job at exactly that. It is a well-stated intention of the government to get more foreign direct investment in here. As a result, senior foreign executives are likely to come into Australia and leave. To have them 'making a contribution to compulsory super which they cannot access until aged 55 or more is of course a more than-pardon the pun-'taxing' situation for them. What the government is attempting to do by the particular measures in this bill is facilitate the movement of highly skilled business executives and specialists; and the exemption only applies to senior foreign executives to limit the potential for labour market distortions. The matters in this bill are made necessary to fix things left unfixed, as usual, by the previous government. I commend the matters to the House. 2) 1999 before us has four limbs. It tightens the rules applying to early release of funds from small superannuation accounts by reducing the threshold below which account holders can access their money before retirement from $500 to $200; by replacing the current subjective financial hardship test with an objective test already in place for the wider super industry; and by restricting access to funds in small superannuation accounts for non-residents until age 55. It also closes a loophole in the current law allowing favourable tax treatment of trust distributions to super funds, which I certainly welcome; and it exempts senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee charge. Let me say from the outset that I welcome the second limb of this bill, that part that does close the trust loopholes. The changes proposed will ensure the right amount of tax is collected from trust distributions to super accounts. These changes will save the government approximately $15 million and obviously are a step in the right direction. However, I want to make some brief comments on the bill's other changes of which I am not so supportive. What we have here is a seemingly innocuous bill, making relatively minor changes to the superannuation l-ws. But what the bill starkly demonstrates is the growing gap in the treatment of the haves and the have-nots in our increasing1y globalised society. By 'the haves', I mean that global citizens' employers will do seemingly anything for them, be it arranging visas, accommodation, schools and ever more lucrative packages. These include the highly educated, highly skilled corporate executives to whom this bill refers, but also the ever increasing number of lawyers, accountants, engineers and IT professionals for whom national boundaries mean very little. By 'the have-nots', I mean the ever increasing number of people left behind by globalisation-those on the fringes of employment in casual or part-time employment. While we can bellow the virtues of the wonderful American miracle and others around the world, we must remember that four per cent unemployment these days does not mean that 96 per cent of people have all the employment they want, as perhaps in the past it did mean. That is the difference, and that is where the figures can hide the -true picture of gross underemployment in many economies, including, I would suggest, America. For the unskilled, the uneducated, there are fewer and fewer meaningful occupations in the ever more competitive and technological global economy.",161,Representatives Main Commitiee
208,Mr Andren (Calare) (10.32 A.m.),"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE 5891 On the one hand, this bill ensures that senior foreign executives working in Australia are exempted from the super guarantee. On the other hand, the bill proposes changes that will make it even harder for people with money in small superannuation holding accounts to get that money out before they reach retirement age. The minister in his speech introducing the bill stated that the purpose of continuing to exempt foreign corporate executives from the super guarantee charge is to 'help the internationalisation of the Australian economy by facilitating the movement of highly skilled business executives and specialists into Australia', the rationale being that such foreign professionals generally 'have equivalent or greater retirement income. arrangements in place in .their home countries'. I suppose that, were Australia to impose the charge on such executives, it might discourage them from bringing their specialist skills and experience into Australia. But I wonder, given the salaries that these executives attract, whether it would be a significant factor in their decision to come to Australia or not. However, I have no objection to measures designed to entice such workers here, so long as they pay their fairÂ· share of income tax while they are in the country. After all, in many cases our organisations need their skills and expertise to keep up with developments overseas. But I think it is interesting to contrast the favourable treatment these corporate highfliers receive in this bill as opposed to the ordinary Australians affected by the other changes. The proposed changes to the early access rules applying to small super accounts will bring them into line with the changes made to the rest of the super system by regulation a few years back. Those changes saw the replacement of the subjective financial hardship test with an objective one which looks simply at things like the length of time an applicant has been in receipt of social security benefits, or whether the applicant's bank has threatened to foreclose on their mortgage. They also restrict access to non-Australian residents so they cannot access those funds until they reach preservation age of 55. The stated aim of these changes was to streamline and tighten arrangements for the early release of super so that it is better directed towards provision of retirement income-all very laudable. But, in other words, they were designed to make it harder for people to access their super prior to reaching retirement age. Again, it sounds good. From experience in the electorate, though, they certainly have had this effect. The super accounts covered by the bill before us are those established under the superannuation holding accounts reserve set up in 1995 to protect very small superannuation holdings. We are talking about accounts containing typically up to just $1,200. In fact, to encourage holders to move them into normal super funds, interest is only credited for the first $1,200. Currently holders of such accounts can only access the funds where their account balance is under $500, where the holder has been forced to retire because of penrianent disability, where they are suffering severe financial hardship, where they have turned 65 or where they are no longer an Australia resident or employed in Australia. As far as I am concerned, superannuation has two purposes. First and foremost, it aims to provide for people in retirement. Second, it is meant to reduce future government outlays, especially when faced with supporting an ageing population. However, after witnessing the workings of the early release rules applying to the broader industry since 1998, I have my doubts about whether the changes in this bill, mirroring, as they do, those earlier changes, do anything to achieve either of these goals. Invariably, the early release of super cases my office 5892 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 has dealt with since the recent changes have suffered enormously at the hands of bureaucracy administering the scheme. In one case I recall a couple with a child in intensive care in Sydney. They came to my office seeking assistance after weeks of getting the run-around from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the agency tasked with deciding where funds can be released. I think the father had about $2,000 in his super account. He had not been unemployed for 26 weeks, he did not have a home loan and, on the so-called compassionate grounds, it looked like there was only a slim hope he qualified for early release. The father had just started working, but had not yet drawn a wage. The family needed to travel to Sydney to be with their child and simply could not afford to do so. Besides charities, their only possible source of money was through the father's super. My office tried to expedite matters, making direct contact with officers in APRA and explaining the urgency of the case. But it hit the typical bureaucratic brick wall. Some six weeks later, after giving up hope, I received notification the release had been authorised. WhatI am trying to say is that, even with the streamlined objective test proposed in this bill, the time delays for decisions are considerable and make a joke of the sums of money involved and the urgency with which that money needs to be accessed. Besides that case, my office has dealt with innumerable cases where workers have been retrenched or where unforeseen expenses have arisen as a result of a physical or mental illness of the applicant or a dependent family member. In the majority of cases, the applicants fail the objectivity test and the decision seems to take a painstakingly long time. In most cases, too, we are not talking about much money-a few thousand dollars at most. I think the maximum that can be released is $10,000. People usually want to access their super only as a last resort, and the type of people who have a lot of money in super are not usually the ones that reach that last resort position. The anguish, the uncertainty and the delay applicants face when trying to have the funds released seem to only exacerbate what are already exceedingly stressful times. In cases like these, it is very difficult to explain that the government has tightened up the rules to better direct their funds towards their retirement or, for that matter, why politicians can access their very generous schemes well before age 55. The bill before us plans to introduce the same rules to even smaller accounts. The question I ask is: why bother? One must seriously question the need for an objective test, or any test for that matter, for the amounts of money typically involved in these small super accounts. At most, we are talking about $1,200. I ask: how much does it cost the government to provide the bureaucracy to assess these applications? What are the social and other costs associated with not letting these people get access to these sums? What about job mobility? The Minister for Employment Services has made a large play on the 'job snobs'. What about seasonal workers and such accessing this money if it is available to help them relocate to look for these jobs that are supposed to exist in the big cities? I suggest the government should lend its bureaucratic expertise and its wealth of experts in superannuation, some of whom I gather are sitting here today, to look at that particular avenue of access to help people become more mobile in our work force Does the government seriously think that people who are so desperate that they need to access a few hundred bucks from their super accounts are not going to be a burden on the state, or at least have to access state help at retirement? More and more of them certainly will Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5893 if we do not let them access that money, at least to relocate. Does the government seriously think the sums we are talking about are going to somehow push these people over the pension asset test? In many cases, it would surely make economic as well as social sense to allow the withdrawal of these amounts. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Treasurer delivered a budget he described as 'a budget for the new millennium': a surplus, low inflation, low interest rates and good growth-but growth, I should say, largely based on domestic consumption and imports. Therein lies a danger-looking at the upside of those numbers does not tell the stories of some of the little people who have suffered at the hands of policies required to deliver these numbers. On a daily basis, my office deals with these stories. The hard-won gains made over the last three years have come largely at the expense of many people at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, with seemingly little sacrifice made at the other end. It is telling that, at a time when the government is keen to make it harder for the growing underclass to access what little super they have, it has shown a complete reluctance to bring politicians' super in line with the rules applying to the general population. I recall the comments of one MP recently, who asked me whether I realised that, if the preservation age for MPs' super was increased to 55, party politicians would just hang around until they turned 55. It says something, doesn't it, about the preselection process of the parties. The argument was that allowing early access lets the parties get rid of their deadwood. As far as I am concerned, reasoning like that is a sick joke, an insult to the taxpayers and voters of Australia and an indictment of the party system. I wonder what the government's response would be if the private sector came to them with the same arguments. The fact is that the same rules must be applied to early access of parliamentarians' super as to others. Let me conclude by saying that, in the globalised new millennium we are moving towards, one thing does appear certain: instead of closing the gap between the rich and poor, the gaps are increasing as those people left behind by the rapid technological and other marketplace advances struggle to find a meaningful place. Regrettably, all too often government policies seem to only compound these differences, and this seemingly insignificant, innocuous bill is a case in point. It will make life just that little bit harder for those at the bottom, while for those at the top it lets the new global citizen write their own rules. What is more, it is doubtful it will achieve much because of the likely administration costs and because, no matter how hard the government makes it for these funds to be accessed, the majority of their holders will access government support at some time in the future. I commend the government for the action it has taken on trusts in this bill, but ask it to note well my comments on the other proposed changes. (No.2) 1999 is an example of the government moving to resolve problems-to carefully fix and address identified difficulties-and to carefully move in areas where we have seen, over the 13 years of the administration of the previous government, a reluctance to do anything quickly or thoughtfully. An example is the very area we are dealing with today-the small superannuation accounts reserve. This reserve was established by an act of parliament in 1995 after seven years of paying for people who were holders of small amounts in superannuation. Year after year there were debates in the parliament about the losses being incurred by people who had contributed small amounts to superannuation funds-where interest charges and fees that were taken out by the funds were far more than were being contributed by the",164,Representatives Main Commi Itee
209,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.46 A.m.),"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill5894 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 itinerant or casual worker. In 1995 the Small Superannuation Accounts Act was passed, and a process was put in place whereby people who were making a compulsory contribution of small amounts to superannuation had a place to put their funds where they would be preserved and where there would be a benefit at the end of the day when they came to retirement. It took the previous government seven years to realise that the super funds were ripping off those small individuals with fees and charges. I do not know how many accounts I brought into this parliament to demonstrate to the then Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer the fact that people had .a declining amount in their super balance. In fact, the harder they worked, it seemed, the less money was left for them to retire on. Eventually, with the support, I have to say, of the opposition of the day, this legislation was passed, and there is a preservation process for people with small amounts. Those small amounts are being made on a regular basis by itinerant workers, casual workers and people in part-time work. That is a sensible administration-a sensible solution-except I do not know whether the tax office is the right place for it to be kept. It has not been too entrepreneurial in investing funds, as far as I am aware. But it should be put in context of us assessing the totality of what is happening in superannuation in Australia today. One must look at the total super statistics if one is to appreciate the movements of large amounts of money. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has released statistics on superannuation for 1997-98 and for theJune 1998 quarter. The contributions to superannuation in Australia in 1997-98 were $33 billionhuge amounts of money going into super funds. The net contributions-that is, the contributions less the benefits-were $11.8 billion in that year. The contributions in the June quarter alone in 1998 were $9.5 billion, comprising $5.8 billion in employer contributions and $3.7 billion in employee contributions. Roughly 60 per cent of the total has come from the employer. Self-managed funds were the fastest growing, and this is the area that I have a particular interest in because I think the growth in self-managed funds indicates that people feel they can produce a better result by managing their own retirement investments than many of the institutions can. As at 30 June 1998, there were 181,700 excluded funds and 3,300 industry retail and public sector funds. The total amount of superannuation assets as at 30 June 1998 was $359.4 billion. That is a huge amount of Ill6ney stored in institutions. It is interesting to note that the breakdown of investments at that time was roughly 37 per cent in equities and unit trusts, 24 per cent in interest bearing securities, roughly 12 per cent in cash deposits and placements, roughly seven per cent in direct property investment, and a total of 16.5 per cent was invested overseas. That is the context in which we look at the affairs of today which relate, really, to the small amounts-the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve, the SHAR-as the government moves to be consistent and close loopholes and fix up problems in superannuation. The limited circumstances in which an individual could draw small amounts from these small amount funds have in the past been these: the balance in the account was less than $500 and the contributor had ceased to be employed by any of the depositors, the individual is in severe financial hardship the individual has retired because.> of permanent disability, the individual had turned 65 years of age, or the individual was not ail Australian resident and not employed in Australia. The government has moved to tighten up some of these things. As previous speakers have indicated, an objective test is to be applied to the process. The severe hardship test has been removed and, where the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority determines in writing that an individual is in severe financial hardship, the objective test is that an Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE 5895 individual, for a period of at least 39 weeks or two or more periods that add up to 39 weeks since the person had turned 35 years of age, is in receipt of welfare or benefit payments or for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks a person had been in receipt of payments. When one comes to look at the examples given in the explanatory memorandum, one starts to realise the wisdom of this tightening up process. It is all very well to say, as some members have in this debate, that people should be allowed access to their super. That is a subjective judgment, and the conditions under which they could be allowed access would vary, depending on the outlook and attitude of every member of the parliament. The fact of the matter is that there are some circumstances under hardship where individuals can gain, and have gained, access. But if one is 30 and one has run up a bill by buying a new motor car and then suffers financial hardship through those causes, is that any less a circumstance of hardship where penalties and fines are being confronted and a young family may be involved than somebody of an older age who has an illness? These are judgments that must pose great difficulty for the regulators-saying that one hardship is more worthy than another. So the process which is to be put in place is to say that, if a person has been on welfare payments for an extended period, if there has already been an assessment that they are suffering difficulty and financial hardship and if there is no recourse to any other funds whatsoever, then they are entitled to draw on their retirement benefits, on the stored benefits of their work over a period of time. I find that not hard to accept, because the fact of the matter is that if a 30-year-old is out of work and thinks the best thing to solve particular shortages of funds is to get into their small super savings, they then come to the end of their life with nothing left because, at every period of hardship in their life, they have drawn on their super funds. This is not a process of a casual bank account. This is a process of storing up funds in a particular account and by a particular process for use by the individual on retirement. The introduction of the legislation made that clear back when the government chose eventually to instigate a mechanism for people having small amounts of superannuation to hold for retirement to store it in one place, to store it so that a mUltiplicity of contributors could add to it-an example would be fruit pickers moving from one orchard to another, having one place in which their super funds could be deposited; they could be deposited with the SHAR. That is fine for them. I have another instance within my own electorate, that of part-time teachers at TAFE. It is a similar thing. Many of them are married women, teaching on a regular basis at TAFE. They have a small amount of income, but it is enough for their family needs. They are not looking for full-time work and this family arrangement suits them just perfectly. These small amounts that are compulsorily taken out of their salaries are deposited with the SHAR. They may move from one TAFE to another or they may move from one educational institution to another, but instead of having a diversity of funds soaking up all of these small amounts, making huge charges on them, these funds that are compulsorily deducted by employers are deposited in one place and are there for the person's retirement. They are not a casual banking account to be drawn on at the whim of an individual suffering momentary financial hardship. That is not the purpose of this legislation, that is not the purpose for which the previous government introduced it and it is not comparable in any way with the spurious analogy with members of parliament. It is a special circumstance which has been thought through by this parliament to assist those people who are employed, either by poor fortune or by good 5896 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 management, on a casual or part-time basis. Some of the greatest growth and opportunities for women in Australian society have been through casual and permanent part-time work, and maQy of them are in the circumstances of needing to have access to the SHAR. They have taken great advantage of it, much to the benefit of their families. To present it as solely the area and the habitation of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged is a completely wrong concept. Hound great enlightenment in reading in the explanatory memorandum the examples of how the new Commonwealth income support test would actually work. There is an example there of a woman aged 55 who has been on a service pension, no doubt a war widow on a Department of Veterans' Affairs benefit, for 26 weeks. That person in those circumstances can access the superannuation funds, provided there is less than $200 in the account. The same circumstances apply to the example of a person over the age of 60 years. She received social security pension payments for 20 weeks from Centrelink when she was 61 years of age and for another 20 weeks when she was 62 years of age. She can access her super fund. But Simon, aged 20, who has never had social security benefits or who was put off benefits because of his failure to comply for some reason or another and is not actually on benefits at the time that he applies for relief or to gain access to his super savings is not eligible. I find that satisfactory. I think the government has been thoughtful in its processes here, in what it has done and the amendments that have been made. The second part of the bill relates to the non-arms-Iength trust distribution to superannuation and other funds. The announcement made by the Treasurer on 25 November 1997 was that the tax law would be amended so that trust distributions made from all trusts other than unit trusts to a superannuation entity should be treated as special income of the fund and taxed at the non-concessional rate of 47 per cent. Everybody seems to be in agteement with this measure, which seeks to patch up what the government saw as a disadvantage to the Australian community. The government has moved sensibly to repair that process. Another part of the legislation relates to the exemption of senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee charge. That is an on-balance judgment, saying that the retirement package of somebody who is not a resident of Australia is a matter for that person and their employer. Under the migration law a person coming into Australia as an employee has very narrow limitations placed on them as to what they can and cannot do. The retirement arrangements should not require that individual to make a contribution to Australian super funds or to prepare for their retirement in Australia, because it is never the intention that they retire in Australia. This legislation makes sure that there is no compulsory removal of a superannuation levy from that person. I have got no problems with that; I think it is reasonable. It means that working in Australia is more attractive for foreign executives or highly skilled individual sports men and women, coaches, or whoever. Under immigration law, there is a limited number of opportunities for people to come into Australia as non-residential workers. Of course, as soon as somebody becomes a resident, they will be paying the super guarantee levy and they will be treated in the same way as everybody else. In conclusion, I was pleased when the former government decided in 1995 to deal with the problem that was confronted by many casual and part-time workers. It was slow in acting, and the process has worked satisfactorily. I believe that the lower limit was too low. This government moved to increase that, although it should have happened before the change of government. I am pleased that today there is now an objective test available which makes it easy for administrators and members of parliament to assess whether a person is eligible to Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE 5897 draw on their super funds. That objective test is easy to assess. It replaces a non-objective test which was extremely difficult to apply and very hard to manage for someone seeking to assist a person in hardship. At the end of the day, the objective test will work better. The amount of money available in the account has been reduced and the objectives of the legislation are preserved. People who are making a small contribution towards their retirement have those funds preserved for the benefit of their retirement. The account is not to be used as a casual bank account which can be drawn upon in times of misfortune or circumstantial hardship. Those funds should be preserved for retirement or for times of hardship for which there is no other solution than to draw on those funds. I have no trouble in supporting the legislation and in completely rejecting the amendment moved by the opposition. because, as the honourable member for Mitchell and other people who have participated in this debate are quite correct in saying, superannuation is becoming more and more important not only for the economy of Australia, in b09sting our national savings, but also for the future of individuals upon their retirement. Whilst agreeing with many of the comments made by members on both sides of the House, I indicate that I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for finance, the member for Melbourne, which outlines that, whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, we are seeking to condemn the government for sloppy taxation administration by delaying the closure of a tax avoidance loophole and being forced to introduce retrospective legislation which, if you read through this bill, you see that this certainly is. This bill seeks to amend the Small Superannuation Accounts Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act. Once every sitting, it appears, very broad legislation such as this, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), is introduced into the parliament. I note that this bill is not the only superannuation amendment bill put forward already this year. Unfortunately, I think this is once again a lost opportunity. These bills provide an opportunity for the House to consider anomalies and small changes which are primarily of a non-controversial nature and to ensure that superannuation legislation is up to date. But there is one area which is glaringly out of date in 1999. Once again, the government has failed to introduce another clause; instead of four clauses, we have today three clauses. Firstly, the Small Superannu-ation Accounts Act is being amended to change the amount that can be withdrawn from the SHAR when an individual ceases employment; to restrict access to moneys in SHAR when an individual is not an Australian resident; and to replace access to moneys in SHAR on the grounds of severe financial hardship, with a new objective test based upon whether an individual has received specific government payments over a period of time. Secondly, this bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove an anomaly in relation to non-arms-Iength trust distributions to superannuation and similar funds. Thirdly, the bill contains a provision which would exempt senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee. I suggest to the House that this bill should contain a fourth clause-a clause which would amend the Superannuation Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act to make provision for same sex couples to get the same benefits currently enjoyed by heterosexual couples. At the moment we have a situation whereby there is no encouragement for people in same sex",167,Representatives Main Commitiee
210,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (11.05 A.m.),"I am pleased to speak in this debate today5898 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 relationships to contribute to superannuation. That is because discrimination occurs on a number of levels. On one level, upon the death of one partner, superannuation fund trustees have refused to make a payout to the surviving partner. When payments have occurred, the tax treatment is very different; and that comes down to the fact that, in the relevant legislation, de facto relationships .are defined on the basis of someone of the opposite sex. In 1999, that is very sad. That is not a view which is held just by the Labor Party; that is a view which is held very broadly, by people such as Christopher Pearson, the editor of the Adelaide Review. He wrote an article in the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 3 May. This article was headed, 'Saving not such a super idea for samesex couples' . In it, Mr Pearson, not noted to be a supporter of the Labor Party but indeed very much a part of the Adelaide establishment, said: Most people are legally obliged to contribute to superannuation schemes but same-sex couples are not entitled to the same benefits as those in the most directly comparable heterosexual category, childless couples in de facto relationships. The discrimination takes two main.forms. On retirement, super funds haven't been paying a lump sum or joint pension to contributors and their partners. On death, funds haven't paid death benefits to same-sex partners, even where specified as the intended recipients. For all its caution on social issues, the Howard Government is not indifferent to equity arguments from self-funding retirees. The Senate's resident expert on superannuation, John Watson, a very conservative Tasmanian, has surprised colleagues by defending the entitlements of same-sex couples. Other ministers and members who've argued the case include Amanda Vanstone, Judi Moylan, Brendan Nelson and Christopher Pyne. Christopher Pearson goes on to basically endorse the private member's bill which I have before this parliament and which up to this point has received only very minimal debate. He outlines, I think very clearly, a call for a conscience vote on this issue. As Christopher Pearson argues, it is simply the case that you do not have to endorse people's lifestyles; you simply have to accept that it is occurring and accept that people are entitled to the same financial benefits regardless of their sexual preference. Discrimination distorts the superannuation industry. It is not surprising that the Australian superannuation funds have all come out in support of changes to legislation which would remove this inequity. It is not surprising also that this bill has received very strong support not just from the gay and lesbian community but also from the private sector. In this regard, I wish to congratulate and note the support of The Body Shop in their 'same sex, same rights' campaign. On 27 April, I attended in Melbourne the launch of a campaign for a petition to be signed calling upon the parliament to debate this legislation. The Body Shop are indeed a company which the Australian private sector could have a very close look at-it could be seen as a role model. They have a trading charter, and their trading charter says that their trading principles should reflect their core values. It says: We ensure that human and civil rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are respected throughout our busineSS activities. We have established a framework based on this declaration . to include criteria for workers' rights embracing a safe, healthy working environment, fair wages, no discrimination on the basis of race, creed, sex or sexual orientation, or physical coercion of any kind. We support long term, sustainable relationships with cOIllIlJ,unities in need. We will pay special attention to those minority groups, women and disadvantaged peoples who are socially and economically matginalised. What an entirely appropriate statement for a corporation in Australia to have. They sponsored this campaign. They put petitions in each of their shops throughout Australia. The petition was launched by Simon Crean, the shadow Treasurer, and there were a number of other people Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5899 present such as the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, and a number of state parliamentarians including, I note, the Liberal member for Prahran. The Victorian State Council of the Liberal Party, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, will probably be aware, has carried a resolution with the endorsement of the Premier of Victoria for changes to superannuation legislation. The member for Prahran was successful in having that moved and carried by the Liberal Party State Council. SoI congratulate her and the Liberal Party State Council on showing this leadership in this way. The Body Shop petition was also launched in Sydney, and the member for Bradfield, Brendan Nelson, and I helped to launch this petition calling on this bill to be debated. I thank him for having the courage to stand up and be counted on this issue. If we are serious about superannuation, we have to be serious about superannuation for all in our community, not excluding one section and not saying that you are less important than someone else. In terms of what is happening in politics in Australia today, it is very unfortunate that this federal parliament lags behind and has to be dragged kicking and screaming to legislate to remove discrimination of a fashion which we all know will occur. The days of discrimination, be it on the basis of gender, race or sexual preference, are numbered. Given that I think there is a broad acceptance of that, that change should happen sooner rather than later. I note that, in the current sitting, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly has passed comprehensive legislation recognising same sex de facto relationships. This legislation passed with the support of the coalition. In the Legislative Council, the legislation was opposed by only Fred Nile, David Oldfield and John Tingle. Unfortunately, this parliament seems to be with that group, with that troika, and what a fine troika it is in modem Australia-One Nation, Call to Australia and the Shooters Party! They are the only people in the whole New South Wales parliament-three of them; none in the Legislative Assembly-who say that change should not occur on the basis of recognising de facto couples as having the same rights. It really does show that people in same sex relationships should be given the same rights in organising their property and their financial affairs. New South Wales is not the only state in which we have seen bipartisan support. In 1994, the ACT Legislative Assembly passed the Domestic Relationships Act, which provides a system for the division of property and payment of maintenance when a samsex relationship breaks down. In 1996, the Carnell ACT government amended the Administration and Probate Act 1929 and the Family Provision Act 1969 to provide access to inheritance for de facto partners. These amendments, which had bipartisan support, put same sex and heterosexual de factos on the same footing by defining a spouse as a partner whether or not of the same gender, which is precisely what my private member's bill on superannuation seeks to do. In 1997, in Victoria, the Kennett government passed changes to the Wills Act 1997 to allow family provision orders to be made for the proper maintenance and support of any person for whom the deceased had responsibility to make provision. The focus of this change is to ensure that the legislation operates in a way which is tied to its purpose and leaves out irrelevant factors such as the sex and marital status of the applicant. The Queensland governm-nt has also begun moves in this area. An industrial relations bill introduced by the Queensland government last week proposes to recognise same sex relationships under state industrial relations law. 5900 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 The various developments in the recognition of same sex relationships mean that the Commonwealth parliament is now lagging behind. There is broad community acceptance of the right of same sex couples to be recognised, at least in relation to property and financial matters. This is demonstrated by the fact that even the Anglican Church in New South Wales did not oppose the legislation which went through that parliament. There were a number of speeches given which are very relevant in terms of financial matters and superannuation in relation to that bill. I wish to quote from a couple of those speeches. One is from Mrs Chikarovski, the Leader of the Opposition for the moment in New South Wales, who is getting every chance she can to give a speech to show that she is more progressive than the person that we saw during the state election campaign. She said: We accept that, in seeking to define a de facto relationship, the amendments will clarify these property and financial arrangements for a range of people in a range of relationships, and rightly so. If it is good enough for her, why isn't it good enough for this parliament? I want to go a bit further and quote Mr Turner, the member for Orange. He is not a member of the Liberal Party, it is true; he is a member of the National Party. The elected member of the National Party said: I agree with the honourable member for Gosford, who spoke on behalf of the Coalition, who said that we should deal with the issues in a non-emotive way, stick to the facts and not make personal interpretations. He went on to say: I have yet to come to grips with some of the very extreme views held by some of the churches and community groups. We are all supposed to love one another. God has made us who we are and is supposed to forgive us for.everything that we do, yet certain people who supposedly follow God's laws will not accept that God has made these people and haS made them a little bit different. I believe that gays and lesbians, like us, are members of the community and are loving people, and that we have gone a long way towards recognising that they are part of our community. I would not have wished to have been involved in the gay community to, 15 or 20 years ago when many were basically forced into a marriage to satisfy the community and their relations. For many years they have had a sham marriage. The children cif such unions' have suffered because of the frustration of the male or the female partner in the marriage-because many females have gone through the same process. I believe that society is much more enlightened today but it has some way to go. I believe that the bill is a step in that direction and I support it. _ What an entirely appropriate statement to read into Hansard, given the nature of this parliament and the fact that in this parliament there are people who duck for cover when you mention the issue of same sex relationships and who think that to mention it is to somehow draw into question people's own sexual preference. Perhaps that is what they are scared about. I think the concern which some people have over these issues really is quite amazing. There is no discrimination clearer than that in superannuation. Anyone who believes in the level playing field in terms of the market should support the amending legislation as part of one of these bills that come before the House. If my private member's bill is not voted on, I give notice to the House that on the next occasion that we have a superannuation legislation amendment bill I will be giving this speech but I will be giving it in a different way. I will be giving it as the mover of an amendment to that bill. The government will have to make a decision as to where it stands on these issues. .' You have now been given the opportunity. You have been given full notice that you have the opportunity as a government to change what is discrimination, to change to what state and territory parliaments, coalition and Labor, and people of goodwill in our community are saying should occur-that is, to remove this discrimination. You are being given the opportunity to Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE 5901 do what businesses such as The Body Shop and others in corporate Australia say should happen. You have the opportunity to support reform and to take the initiative. You are also being given the opportunity to do what the superannuation industry itself says should happen, by doing the right thing. I urge the government to do that to avoid making this issue one which is an issue of difference when it should be an issue which is bipartisan before this parliament. Administration) (11.24 a.m.)-At the outset, the government wishes to reject the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne which, while not declining to give the bill a second reading, sought to condemn the government for sloppy taxation administration by delaying the closure of a tax avoidance loophole and being forced to introduce retrospective legislation and transitional provisions. I will come to the reasons that we reject this particular amendment. The amendment itself has no value and is in fact not even a correct statement of the situation concerning the measures curr-ntly before the chamber. When one looks at the approach of the Labor Party in relation to superannuation, it is interesting that they have clearly forgotten their sad and sorry record over 13 years of government in this area of superannuation. Labor speakers have made some unsubstantiated claims in relation to the government's superannuation policy. Let us just pause for a moment and consider that it is only about three years since Labor left government. When they did so, they left Australians with unfair taxation concessions for superannuation contributions skewed to higher income earners-the people whom they accuse us of supporting at every opportunity. Their legislation also contained lack of flexibility in choice and the inability to divide up superannuation upon marital breakdown. The government has put in place a number of policies to overcome these problems and consequently in yet another situation the government has not created the difficulty, but we do accept the responsibility to fix it. Contributions have been made in the second reading debate by the honourable members for Melbourne, Calare, Grayndler, Moreton and Mitchell. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank all of them for participating in this important debate. This bill contains a number of measures which make miscellaneous amendments to superannuation legislation. The first measure tightens up rules governing access to moneys held in the superannuation holding reserve accounts consistent with arrangements already applying to superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts. This will strengthen the government's retirement incomes policy and address abuses of the current arrangements. The second measure closes a loophole which allows certain distributions of trust income to superannuation funds made under non-arms-Iength arrangements to be taxed at a concessional rate of 15 per cent. The honourable member for Mitchell made a most erudite contribution in relation to this particular area. It is expected to result in a revenue saving of about $15 million a year. The third measure continues a former superannuation guarantee exemption for senior foreign executives who meet the criteria for the former class 413 overseas executive visa. This will help the internationalisation of the Australian economy by facilitating the movement of highly skilled business executives and specialists into Australia. Any reasonable person would accept that this is a very positive move and that those international executives should be encouraged to participate and compete for jobs in Australia's world-class corporations. A number of speakers in their contributions asked questions in relation to the legislation. Indeed, the honourable member for Calare asked why the amendments to the Small",171,Representatives Main Commitfee
211,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and5902 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 were needed. These amendments are needed to ensure consistency between the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve and other institutions collecting superannuation moneys such as superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts. We do not make any apology for the inclusion of this particular provision. Honourable members would recall that the government announced in the 1997-98 budget, with modifications made on 17 November 1997, changes tightening the rules governing access to moneys in SHAR, superannuation funds and RSAs. Amendments were made to the superannuation industry supervision regulations and retirements savings account regulations on 9 December 1997 to implement the changes for superannuation funds and RSAs. The amendments in this bill will implement the changes for SHAR. The honourable member for Calare also claimed that the gap between the rich and the poor is increasing and that this bill will make it more difficult for people at the bottom end of the scale. The government absolutely rejects that particular contention. It is interesting that during the 13 years of Labor government the gap between rich and poor did widen, and that was a matter for regret. But it ought to be considered and recognised that this bill is a responsible bill. We have adopted a responsible approach towards encouraging people to save for their retirement. Whether people are on high or low incomes, this bill does not discriminate. One could argue about the gap between rich and poor, but this bill certainly does not in any way, shape or form adversely affect people who are at the bottom end of the scale. The honourable member for Melbourne, who has returned to the chamber, claims that we have been guilty of sloppy taxation administration. That is the pot calling the kettle black, given the sad and sorry administration of this area by the Labor Party during its 13 years in government. We have also been accused of being forced to introduce retrospective legislation and transitional provisions. The suggestion is that we have been guilty of delay in some way, shape or form. Firstly, let me deal with the situation relating to the amendment of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995. Quite frankly, there has been no delay whatsoever in introducing these amendments. These amendments were announced in the 1997-98 budget on 12 May 1997 and introduced into the parliament on 29 May 1997. As occurs when an election is called, the bill before the chamber lapsed and the amendm{<.nts have now been introduced as part of this particular bill. The delay in passage of the amendments was due to the referral of the amendments to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and the lapsing of the amendments on the announcement of the last federal election. The amendments with respect to the non-arms-Iength trust distributions to superannuation and similar funds have also been introduced to the parliament as soon as possible. The amendments have been delayed by modifications to achieve the position announced in the Treasurer's press release. The modifications were required to ensure equitable outcomes for genuine arms-length investments by superannuation funds in trusts. This was achieved by more closely targeting the legislation to the nature of trust distribution rather than to the type of trust. These modifications also require transitional arrangements to ensure that superannuation funds which relied on the Treasurer's press release would not be unfairly treated. The measures were announced on 25 November 1997. The amendments were introduced on 2 July 1998 and lapsed when the 3 October 1998 federal election was announced last year. The amendments currently before the chamber are unchanged from the amendments which lapsed. Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5903 The third item, the exemption of senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee, is another area where we have been accused of bringing in retrospective legislation and also of being guilty of delay. The delay in introducing the amendments was due to two factors. Firstly, there were other more urgent matters being given priority, particularly upon election of the government to office in October last year. Secondly, these amendments required significant at-length consultation with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. It ought to be seen, recognised and accepted by the opposition that no detriment has been caused by the delays: The amendments are straightforward and continue an exemption well understood by employers. In other words, world high-class, high-flyer executives who have a contribution to make to our corporations have not been shut out of Australia, and they continue to be welcomed here to compete for jobs in the marketplace. The continuation of the exemption was well publicised by the government, and employers have acted in reliance upon the government's announcement. The Assistant Treasurer did announce on 25 June 1997 that an exemption for foreign senior executives from the superannuation guarantee would be continued with effect from 1 August 1996, the date that the exemption lapsed due to the renumbering of the former class 413 visa. The suggestion by the honourable member opposite is that these amendments are retrospective. I am someone who. in general does not support the principle of retrospective amendments, but it ought to be recognised that these amendments do follow long standing practice in this place. The date of the announcement with respect to these matters concerning non-arms-Iength trust distributions to superannuation and similar funds is the date of the Treasurer's media release No. 123 of 1997-2 p.m .. on 25 November 1997. It ought to be recognised that the closure of this particular loophole-and it is a loophole-will save some $15 million per annum. The amendments are anti-avoidance in nature, and apply from the date of the press release to deter taxpayers from entering into arrangements which are the subject of the amendments. People have not acted on the law in a belief that it was not going to be changed. We have made the announcement, and these amendments will take effect from when the announcement was made. This is in common with usual practice. With respect to the exemption of senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee, these amendments will not retrospectively reduce the superannuation guarantee coverage by senior foreign executives. The amendments do maintain the Australian superannuation guarantee exemption of senior foreign executives, and it ought to be appreciated that senior foreign executives typically have equivalent or greater retirement income arrangements in their home countries and do not wish to be subject to Australian arrangements. One would have been excused for appreciating that the honourable member for Grayndler perhaps did not really understand that the amendments will relate to the matters which are the subject of this particular bill, because his whole speech was predicated on his proposed private member's bill concerning the situation of same sex partners. To achieve the outcome wanted by the honourable member, there would have to be a whole of government approach to change the definition of 'dependant' as it appears in tax, superannuation, social security legislation and family law. The honourable member's bill is before the House. He is perfectly entitled to argue it, but the fact that he comes into this debate and, to a certain extent, abuses the forms of the House by speaking on his bill when it does not relate to the provisions of this particular bill indicates 5904 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 that perhaps the Office of Parliamentary Counsel ought to look more closely at the current means of wording the long titles of bills, because the incorporation of the words 'and for related purposes' tends to mean that members of parliament are able to stand up in the place and talk about almost anything, as long as it is marginally related. I do not believe it enhances the debate in the parliament if members are able to participate in such a wide-ranging debate right away from the particular provisions of the bill. Returning to the question of exemption of senior foreign executives from the superannuation guarantee, these amendments are to apply from 1 August 1996. They will continue. The superannuation guarantee exemption for employers lapsed due to administrative change of immigration visa classes. If the amendments did not apply from 1 August 1996, employers who relied on the new immigration visa classes announced in the government's press release of 25 June 1997 may be subject to the superannuation guarantee charge. So this particular amendment is totally acceptable and in keeping with usual practice. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to commend the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999 to the chamber. Amendment not agreed to. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Hockey: That the bill be now read a second time. Bill 1999 proposes to implement the 1998-99-budget announcement to ensure that a negative CPI result, which did occur for the 12 months prior to 31 March 1998, would not produce anomalies in taxation measures linked to the CPl. Problems arise in the following three areas: (1) car parking benefit thresholds, which determine the exempt amount of car parking benefits, are indexed to the CPI and would reduce, thereby increasing FBT liability; (2) dependent rebate amounts-for example, for spouses, housekeepers, invalid relatives, et cetera-would fall as they are indexed to the CPI; and (3) the wholesale sales tax quarterly remitter threshold is indexed to the CPI. If this were to fall because of a negative CPI result, some taxpayers on the margin may be forced to adopt a monthly remittance schedule instead of the quarterly one they currently enjoy. The solution proposed is for the three amounts to remain at the 1997-98 level for the 199899 inc:ome tax, fringe benefits tax and sales tax years. In addition, all CPI indexations for later years will be set at the previous year's level where a hegative CPI occurs. In addition, drafting errors in the previous FBT legislation are corrected to ensure that references to provisions in the legislation are correctly specified.

It is a necessary bill because it will prevent taxpayers being disadvantaged by a reduction in the level of thresholds in rebate amounts which arises from a fall in the consumer price index, the CPI, as happened in the 12-month period ending 31 March 1998. As we know, a reduction in the CPI is usually a good thingand I will elaborate on that in a moment. However, the fall in the CPI could, if not addressed, have a negative impact for taxpayers in certain situations. The government's amendments will prevent the fall in CPI from being anything but beneficial to taxpayers. There are various thresholds and rebate amounts in taxation laws that are currently indexed annually in line with movements in the CPI, and this bill will ensure that certain thresholds and rebates do not fall because of the decrease.in the CPI for the 1998-99 income year. This bill is how we will ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged; this bill is how we will protect taxpayers against the impacts of reductions in the CPI. The need for this legislation comes about as a result of the fall in the CPI of approximately 0.1 per cent for the four quarters to 31 March 1998. Compared with the preceding four quarters, certain thresholds which are indexed against the CPI would, according to the relevant taxation laws, be automatically reduced from the 1998-99 year as a result of the fall at 31 March. As a result, certain rebates which stem from these thresholds would otherwise be reduced, disadyantaging the taxpayers. At last year's budget, the Treasurer announced that these amounts indexed against the CPI would be maintained at the 1997-98 levels rather than being reduced in line with the fall in CPI. The amendments will provide that indexed thresholds, fringe benefits tax, car parking benefits threshold, sales tax quarterly remitter threshold and concession rebate amountsdependant rebate-in the taxation law will remain at current levels where there has been a decrease in the CPI. The amendments also make minor technical corrections for the fringe benefits tax law by correcting references to provisions in that legislation. Taxpayers will receive a small benefit for the 1998-99 year as a result of the indexed thresholds and rebate amounts being held constant at the 1997-98 level. The indexation amendments will apply to the 1998-99 and later income tax, sales tax and fringe benefits tax years. A direct example of how this bill will protect taxpayers against the reduction in thresholds and rebates stemming from the reduction in CPI is in the fringe benefit tax on car parking facilities. FBT is payable if car parking facilities are provided by an employer within one kilometre of a commercial parking station which ordinarily charges more than the CPI indexed threshold amount for all-day parking at the start of the FBT year. Under existing law, the threshold is indexed by movements in the CPI and would be reduced should the CPI fall in the 12 months preceding the start of the FBT year. The government's amendments to the tax law will ensure that the CPI indexed threshold amount for all-day parking at the start of the FBT year will remain unchanged if the movement in the CPI in the 12 months preceding the start of that year is negative. To expand on the example, although the CPI fell by 0.2 per cent in the 12 months to the March quarter 1998, the threshold amount for the FBT year ending 31 March 1999 will remain at $5.25 per day-the same threshold as for the period ending 31 March 1998. The bill also addresses the impacts of the reduction of the CPI in relation to dependant rebates for 1998-99. The government's amendments, through the CPI indexation bill, will ensure that dependant rebates will also remain unchanged in the event of a fall in the CPI and 5906 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 that there will not be a reduction in the dollar value of these rebates. The rebates concerned include the dependent spouse rebate without child, the child housekeeper rebate, the invalid relative rebate, the parent of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse rebate, the sole parent rebate and the housekeeper rebate. The bill will also assist those in the position of remitting wholesale sales tax in some instances, and this amendment will ensure that the CPI index threshold amount for quarterly remittances of wholesale sales tax will remain unchanged if the relevant movement of the CPI is negative. The way the taxation law is now, the threshold would be lowered in 1998-99 because the CPI fell over the year to the four quarters ending 31 March 1998. As a result, more taxpayers would be forced to pay sales tax monthly rather than quarterly. However, the government's amendment will change this law so that the threshold will not fall in 1998-99, hence keeping the quarterly remitter threshold at the 1997-98 level of $57,570. I take this opportunity to point to another piece of legislation implemented by this government that assists where similar impacts are caused by the stability or, indeed, reduction of the CPI. Those on fixed incomes, such as our age pensioners, have become accustomed to intermittent rises in their pensions as they rise in accordance with the CPI, albeit in minor amounts sometimes. This government-and I point out that this is the only government that has done so-has by legislation set the benchmark rate of the age pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This means that although the CPI did not increase last year, the rate of the age pension did. This delivered an increase in the pension of $6.80 per fortnight in March 1998, and the government has also provided for this increase to flow to the recipients of war widows pensions. So the government has measures designed to protect those who may have otherwise been negatively affected by the fall in the CPI, just as it has worked hard to ensure that generally the CPI and inflation and interest rates and debt also fall for the benefit of all Australians. How did we reach these reductions that benefit all Australians? Ms JULIE BISHOP-I will. The government's economic policy framework has been directed to keeping the economy growing at a strong but sustainable rate. After growth in excess of four per cent in the past two years,..the Australian economy is forecast to grow by a solid three per cent in this coming financial year. Such a growth performance at a time when many of our Asian trading partners have been in recession and overall world growth is below trend at about 1% per cent is testimony to the policy framework of the Howard government. This framework has delivered improvements in the fundamental features of the economy that drive economic growth. Our sound policy framework has meant that we have maintained the . confidence of those who invest in Australia, the decline in the dollar has been orderly, and interest rates have remained low-in fact, they are the lowest in nearly three decades, which has underscored continued growth and spending. ' The government's debt reduction program is also paying dividends, for since coming to government, debt totalling $24.2 billion has been repaid, with the expected debt reduction of a further $20.5 .billion in the years 1999-2000. We. will have seen a $44% billion reduction in net debt in just four years. It is within our gras{r-with the further sale of Telstra, by the end of the forward estimates period in 2002-03-to completely eliminate Commonwealth general government net debt. Budget surpluses and lower debt are particularly important at this time in reducing Australia's vulnerability to international economic and financial volatility.",178,Representatives Main Commiitee
213,Mr Slipper,"Tell us, tell us.Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5907 This bill is not a revenue raiser; it is not a revenue saver; and it is not a burden on expenditure. The financial impact of this bill is not significant, but the acknowledgment of the impact of the level of the CPI on taxpayers by the government is significant. It is a Vyry fair measure and will be of benefit to Australia and all Australians while they are protected against the otherwise extremely positive impacts of stability or reductions in the CPI. I commend this bill. Administration) (11.51 a.m.)-I would like to express my appreciation to the honourable member for Curtin and also the honourable member for Melbourne for supporting this legislation. In summing up I would like to emphasise some of the merits of this bill. The bill will ensure that various thresholds and rebate amounts in the taxation law that are currently indexed annually in line with movements in the consumer price index will not fall because of a decrease in the CPI. These thresholds are found in the fringe benefits tax law, the income tax law and the sales tax law. This will prevent taxpayers from being disadvantaged by a reduction in the level of thresholds and rebate amounts. The amendments to the indexation provisions apply to 1998-99 and in latter years. Some of the people who would have been adversely affected without the amendments include certain dependant rebate recipients and sales tax quarterly remitters. The opportunity has also been taken to make two minor technical corrections to the fringe benefits tax law. The purpose of the bill is to ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged by falls in the consumer price index in relation to fringe benefits tax on car parking arrangements, the level of certain indexed income tax rebates and the frequency of sales tax remittances. There are no losers from these legislative changes. Rather, they are designed to ensure that taxpayers are not adversely affected by movements in the CPI. I am very pleased to commend this bill to the chamber. . Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

215,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.54 A.m.),"This bill proposes to introduce a generic taxation5908 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 The new framework applies to demutualisation that occurs under one of three specified methods. It will only apply to those demutualisations where broad continuity of beneficial interest is maintained. It provides that capital gains tax will not apply to the surrender by a member of membership interests in the demutualising entity. Any CGT liability will therefore be deferred until disposal of the demutualisation shares. The framework establishes for CGT purposes the date and cost of acquisition of shares, including bonus shares acquired by members as part of the demutualisation process. And it will allow demutualising entities to retain any franking account surpluses accumulated before demutualisation. The amendments will apply to demutualisations that are completed on or after 12 May 1998. A mutual company is a company without issued stock capital, owned by its members. A mutual company's ownership structure distinguishes it, of course, from conventional corporations. Voting rights in most companies are determined by shareholdings, with one vote per share. Mutuals have one vote per member, regardless of each member's financial commitment to that company. In a mutual company ownership arises from membership which is based upon the acquisitionÂ· of a product or service from the company rather than by the contribution of capital. Many mutually owned financial organisations were originally established as cooperatives. Members pooled their resources to achieve specific objectives, such as providing marketing of primary produce or low cost housing finance. Mutuals distribute profits through bonuses or reduced premiums andcharges. Profits are also commonly reinvested in the company. The accretion of reserves in this way is the main avenue available to build capital. The decision to demutualise may be driven by many factors, including the need to access external capital to finance expansion, diversification, or to enable a mutual to compete more effectively in the market. For the purposes of this bill, an entity will be a mutual entity if: it is a body corporate; it is not an insurance company or a mutual affiliate company; it is not carried on for the object of securing a profit; it does not have shareholders; and it does not hold property in which its members have a disposable interest, except. in the event of a winding-up. The new division 326 sets out the taxation consequences of the demutualisation of mutual entities other than insurance companies. The new provisions will apply if the following criteria are satisfied: the demutualisation resolution day was 4 February 1999 or later, the entity was a resident immediately before the resolution, the demutualisation was implemented in one of the three specified methods, the continuity of beneficial interest test is satisfied, and the demutualisation was or is completed on or after 12 May 1998. The proposed framework will apply under one of the three following methods. First is the direct method, with the issue of demutualisation shares directly to members. Under this method ordinary shares of one class in the entity are issued within the limitation period to existing members. In return membership rights in the entity are extinguished. Shares of the same class may also be issued to new members. The second method is the holding company method, whereby the holding company is interposed between the mutual entity and its members. Under this method, shares of one class in the entity are issued within the limitation period to a holding company. Shares of one class in the holding company are then issued within the Umitation period to existing members. In return, membership rights in the entity are extinguished. Shares of the same class may also be issued to new members. Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE 5909 The third method is the distributing trust method, whereby the distributing trust is interposed between a mutual entity and the members. Under this method the entity issues special shares, which carry only voting rights with respect to the entity, within the limitation period to the trustee of a distributing trust to hold for the benefit of existing and new members. This issue takes place before the issue of ordinary shares. After the issue of ordinary shares to the trustee, in return for which membership rights are extinguished, the rights attaching to the special shares must become the same as those attaching to ordinary shares. The special shares must then be treated as ordinary shares. The capital gains tax consequences of the legislation are that the proposed measures will: provide that a capital gain or loss arising from the surrender of a membership interest in a mutual will be disregarded; ensure that, on the issue of demutualisation shares, no amount is included in a member's assessable income; and prescribe the date and cost of acquisition of shares, including bonus shares, acquired by members in an entity, including its holding company, as part of the demutualisation process. Basically, the cost base will be determined by reference to whether a member is a pre-CGT or a post-CGT member. Generally for pre-CGT members, the cost of acquisition will be determined by reference to the member's share of the market value of the entity immediately before demutualisation. For post-CGT members, the cost will be determined by reference to the non-deductible costs incurred by the member in acquiring and maintaining membership. Where a member acquires a right to the issue of shares and the member disposes of that right of interest other than by receiving the shares, the date and cost of acquisition will be determined as if the member had disposed of'the shares in the entity. It will ensure that, where the distributing trust method of demutualisation is used and special shares are converted to ordinary shares, no disposal will be taken to have occurred for capital gains tax purposes. Finally, it will ensure that a payment out of the assets of a demutualised entity after demutualisation to a shareholder will not be taken to be a payment of dividend. The payment will not be assessable as a dividend, but the cost base of the shares will be reduced by the amount of the payment. If the payment is more than the shares cost base, the shareholder will make a capital gain. No representations have been received from any business groups opposing the legislation, nor have there been any suggested amendments. Accordingly, Labor is happy to support the legislation. Taxpayers can now proceed to demutualise, if they so choose. That is entirely their option. This bill should ensure that a fair taxation regime exists which facilitates this process rather than complicates it. Therefore, as I said, the opposition supports the legislation. (Demutualisation of Non-insurance Mutual Entities) Bill 1999, which is before the House today, do in fact allow for relief from capital gains tax where an organisation such as a cooperative is demutualised. I believe that these provisions, where the members of a mutual organisation so decide, will favour the corporatisation process if that is to the advantage of the organisation. The organisations that seem to be most in line for this beneficial treatment are cooperatives and perhaps even credit unions. Whether they take advantage of that process or not will depend on the members of the mutual organisations. Huge amounts have been taken from investors in situations such as the St George takeover of Advance, Westpac's acquisition of the Bank of Melbourne and the more recent AMP offer for GIO.

216,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (12.01 P.m.),"The proposals in the Taxation Laws Amendment5910 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 mutual owners, has been a very strong detriment to people wanting to invest in companies or to gain the benefits of a mutually owned organisation. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Demutualisation of Non-insurance Mutual Entities) Bill 1999-huge title-has a range of advantages, and they are obvious when one comes to assess them. The key considerations in this legislation are whether or not changes to the capital gains tax would encourage those changes in a wider field, and I refer now to the Ralph committee, which was charged by the government to look at business taxes. It is fascinating to read the attitude of the Ralph committee to the matters of capital gains tax because the capital gains factors must be considered with regard to demutualisation if people are to move from a mutual organisation to a corporate structure. In his consideration of the capital gains tax, John Ralph considered things such as would capital gains tax relief encourage savings and investment, does relief from capital gains tax produce net economic benefit, would capital gains tax relief encourage long-term investment, does relief from capital gains tax encourage high risk investment or attract mobile international capital, and should small business capital gains tax concessions be rationalised? John Ralph, in his consideration in his publication A platform for consultation, discussion papers with business, came down on the side of favouring a change in capital gains taxes. This government has moved very quickly and very well in this narrow area to make sure that, where cooperatives-whether they be fruit packing houses, building societies or any other structures where a number of people have come together for mutual benefit, where they all directly participate in the ownership and structure of the organisation-decide that they wish to sell that organisation, provided that they sell it to the original mutual owners, they are free of capital gains tax. In my mind, this seems to be a step in the right direction, and it is one that we need to be encouraging in Australia. The fact that we have a very high capital gains tax regime is one that has been used by governments. The House will remember the introduction of the capital gains tax. That was the tax we were not going to have in 1984. I do not think it was ever mentioned. Suddenly, during an election campaign, the government of the day lobbed on us a capital gains tax. Nobody predicted it. There was great fear and concern that it would be on the family home, and it took some time to rectify. that the Australian Labor Party's secret plan is to have the family homeincIuded in the capital gains tax. It might suit the Americans with their tax deductibility for interest payments and the other concessions that are made to home buyers, but it does not suit Australians. Australians have a right to feel secure and certain about the largest investment they make in their lives-that is, the purchase of a home. Paul Keating said at the time the capital gains tax was introduced by the Australian Labor Party that it was not going to be a major factor in revenue gathering. It has turned out to be a multimillion dollar tax gatherer for the Australian government, and it is time to consider whether or not it has acted as a barrier or an inhibitpr to investment, particularly for people wanting to change their investment. After purchasing shares in the Commonwealth Bimk, one dear old man was so fearful of the capital gains tax that he sold his shares within a short time-he took a terrible loss; it was his life savings-only to find that no capital gains tax was going to be applied in those",183,Representatives Main Commitfee

218,Mr Cadman,"He wanted to extend it to the family home, and there is always the fearWednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5911 circumstances. It was a tragic decision. He bought the shares for his family. He wanted to distribute them to his family but the capital gains tax scared him off at the end of the day. The government has moved to make sure that does not happen for cooperatives, and maybe for credit unions, where people are seeking to demutualise the process, where there is a gain in the value of the asset, provided that the ownership within the corporate structure is the same as the one within the mutual organisation. I refer the House to some of the aspects of the changes that need to be undertaken in capital gains tax. We have seen this change today and it is obvious that, in making the change, the government considers that it will encourage savings and investment, that it will produce an economic benefit to relieve people from capital gains tax in these changes and that it will encourage longer term investment. When one looks at the changes made to capital gains tax in the United States during the 1980s, one has to observe that, where capital gains tax was reduced, investment actually increased and the tax gain also increased. So in some strange way, by reducing capital gains tax the diversity of investment increased and the tax gain actually increased. Where capital gains tax was increased in the United States in 1987, there was an actual fall in the amount of tax collected. Many countries give a more favourable treatment to capital gains taxes than to personal income tax and ordinary taxes. They do this to encourage savings and investment. For those in a mutual organisation, whether it is a co-op or a credit union, who gain a mutual benefit from the process and where there is a benefit in that investment, this legislation allows that benefit to continue by removing capital gains tax altogether. If that same principle is applied more broadly, I believe-and it is evident from an examination of capital gains tax regimes around the world, particularly in long-term or risky investments-that there is encouragement for investment if there is a moderate capital gains tax regime. The incentive to save rather than consume is obviously strengthened by some relief of capital gains tax. If one compares Australia's capital gains tax regime to the rest of the world's, one would have to look at the United States and Britain. As most of our capital has been invested from Britain, I guess we need to look at their regime. The Australian Labor Party ought to seriously consider the modification of capital gains tax. Tony Blair has taken some very significant steps to encourage investment in Britain. His regime has been pretty thoughtful in the way in which capital gains taxes have been treated. The regime in Britain seeks to spread a progressive tax relief from capital gains tax for individuals depending on the number of years a particular investment is held. That same regime also applies in the United States. So the longer an inv-stment is held, the less capital gains tax is raised on it. Also an interesting circumstance in the United States is that the first $1,000 or $2,000, I think it is, of a capital gain is relieved entirely from taxation. That encourages the small business person-the person who could invest in pome fruit or a stone fruit grower investing in his local co-op-to invest because they will be relieved from capital gains tax in this instance. But I would argue that the principle being applied here needs to be extended further still so that a small amount of money invested in something that shows a capital gain should be relieved of capital gains tax completely. That is the situation in the United States. They have a regime where the marginal rate of taxation varies from 15 per cent through to about 40 per cent, but the capital gains tax on medium-term investments-that is, longer than 18 months-ranges from 10 per cent to 20 per 5912 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 cent. There is a concession which amounts to almost a halving of the capital gains tax for a medium-term investment. For a longer-term investment, it is even lower. So there is a gradation which favours long-term investment. There is a gradation which favours the amount of money earned by the person making the investment. I feel that this legislation is very significant. It starts the change in the regime that I want to see happen and that I believe many people on both sides of the parliament want to see happen. We want to see a relief of capital gains tax. It is far too harsh. It gives us a competitive disadvantage. It discourages investment in more risky ventures. One only has to refer to comments that have been made by those who are specialists in small business investment to understand that a change in taxation would be an advantage to things such as the Business Angels Services. Bob Beaumont, project manager for Business Angels Services established by the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is quoted as saying in an article by Kath Walters that the anomaly in our capital gains tax regime discourages business angel investment and forces those who are tempted into the market to head to its highest risk end. He is quoted in that article as saying: ""Investors find it is hardly worth investing after they do the sums, or they can only invest in companies returning 30-50%."" So patient funds and money being invested in innovative projects are just not there because of the capital gains tax regimes. According to research conducted in the United States referred to in this article by Kath Walters, the lowering of capital gains tax increases the investment activity in tax revenue. Barry Westlake, the national manager of Enterprise Market, the matchmaking service run by the Australian Stock Exchange-a very fine program which has been in place for a little over 12 months which has been very successful in matching investors with innovative or small firms-wants industry to snatch the opportunity for reform, that John Ralph presents and suggests that two of the tabled options from Britain and the US to which I have just referred have been shown to work. He believes that the federal government is offering one general capital gains tax reduction and one industry specific concession. The article states: ""I am a pragmatic businessman,"" Westlake says. ""'I'Rather than argue the toss, I prefer to take the opportunity now for a big stepin the right direction."" So for those people servicing small businesses, long-term investment or somewhat more risky investment, there is a favouring of reducing capital gains tax in an understandable and common sense way. The Australian Labor Party should be attracted to this process. This bill today for the relief of capital gains tax, as a process of demutualisation takes place, is a worthy and laudable piece of legislation. I think it is a precursor to an ongoing consideration that this government, the parliament and the nation at large will give to the taxing of capital. Australia is a capital scarce country. We need capital. We need to develop our commodities, our roads, our infrastructure, our ports, our shipping and all of those aspects of life in Australia which do require capital. To be taxing capital at the high rate introduced by .the Australian Labor Party under Paul Keating as Treasurer at that time was a step in the wrong direction. We ought to rectify that not by wiping capital gains tax but by having a somewhat more lenient regime of taxing capital which will make us more competitive and more attractive for both Australian and international investors. Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5913 Administration) (12.17 p.m.)-At the outset I would like to thank the honourable members for Melbourne and Mitchell for their positive contributions and their support of the legislation currently before the chamber. The proposed measures seek to remove impediments to demutualisations and to introduce a broad generic framework for future demutualisations. Summarising the merits of the bill, the bill introduces a framework for the capital gains tax treatment of particular transactions associated with the demutualisation of mutual non-insurance organisations where the demutualisation occurs under one of three specified methods and where broad continuity of beneficial ownership is maintained. . The purpose of the amendments is thus to provide a framework which specifies the taxation consequences of certain transactions likely to occur in relation to such organisations. In general terms, a mutual company is a company without issued capital stock, owned by its members. In a mutual, capital ownership arises from membership which is based upon the acquisition of a product or service from the company rather than by the contribution of capital. In the past three years a number of large insurance companies have become demutualised. The decision to demutualise may be driven by many factors, including the need to access external capital to finance expansion, diversification or to enable the mutual to compete more effectively in the marketplace. The taxation treatment for the demutualisations of these organisations is currently prescribed by division 9AA of part III of the 1936 act. It ought to be recognised that there are no similar legislative rules at the moment applying to noninsurance mutual organisations. These provisions are necessary to deal with anomalies that arose from the application of the capital gains tax provisions to such organisations covered by the legislation, including the possibility of double taxation. There are difficulties in the existing tax law as it applies to demutualisation of non-insurance organisations, including this double taxation, which is clearly not in the public interest. These amendments thus continue the government's ongoing commitment to taxation reform and, in particular, to eliminating anomalies which have arisen in the administration of the current taxation laws. The main features of the framework included in the legislation are, firstly, that a member who disposes of a membership interest in a mutual non-insurance organisation in the course of a demutualisation will not be subject to capital gains tax on the disposal. Any capital gains tax liability will therefore be deferred until the disposal of the demutualisation shares. Secondly, the issue of shares in the new organisation will not. give rise to a taxable capital gain at the time of issue. Thirdly, the amount paid for the acquisition of shares in the new entity will be determined according to when the original membership interest was acquired. Fourthly, there will be specific provisions establishing the amount paid for shares in cases such as mergers or takeovers. Lastly, and importantly, franking credit surpluses of demutualised entities will be retained. These measures were foreshadowed in the 1997-98 budget and announced in the 1998-99 budget. The government has consulted with interested parties in the preparation of these measures, which will apply to demutualisations completed on or after 12 May 1998.
