16,Mr Speaker,"Does the honorableplace, I draw attention to the fact that the statement of the Minister which I contradicted was not identical with that which he has made this morning, because in his original statement he said that '73 per cent, of the fit men of Australia had volunteered for overseas service. That was incorrect. If the statement was intended to be confined to the Militia, as I thought it was, it would also be incorrect. Iu my statemeut, I mentioned that the Army consists of lines of communication units in addition to operational units, and I alleged that it was incorrect to say that 70 per cent, of the total number had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. It would be wrong to suggest that more than 30 per cent, of the total has so enlisted. ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it is necessary for an honourable member to obtain leave of the House to make a personal explanation. The Minister for the Army did, in fact, ask for leave. I seek your direction, sir, as to whether or not an honourable member may make a personal explanation, irrespective of the view held by a minority of the House. If an honourable member asks leave to make a statement, the position is different, is it not? In that event, if objection is voiced by one honourable member it is sufficient to prevent the honourable member from making his statement. making a personal explanation is in the out with the minimum of delay, and that gift of the House and not of the Speaker; the men concerned will be given their but leave is granted so consistently that X numbers as soon as practicable. in practice Mr Speaker assumes that the approval of the House has been given and calls upon the honourable member. Should doubt exist, or the slightest dissent be indicated, Mr Speaker asks the the Army have inquiries made into the House to express its approval or othermost valuable real estate properties in wise. I did so in both instances this Brisbane? Could not less expensive promorning.

When men are called into the Citizen Military Forces they are given the opportunity to volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force or the Royal Australian Air Force, according to their preference. I shall discuss with the honourable member the activities of the recruiting committees. the Minister for the Army expect that approval will be given for the thousands of transfers that are pending from the Citizen Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force? regarding the lag in the transfer of men from the Citizen Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force. The number of men awaiting approval of their transfer to the Australian Imperial Force is negligible compared with the number of those who have transferred. I am assured by the Adjutant-General's Branch that there is every justification to believe that the men whose transfer has not yet been approved are scattered all over Australia and that it necessarily takes some time, after they have filled in the transfer forms, for the forms to reach head-quarters from the various commanding officers.

Has the Minister given f u l l consideration to the effect which any increased sowings will have upon Australia's already enormous wheat surplus? tion referred to w ill apply only to Queensland. It has been found that not nearly enough wheat is grown in that State to meet local requirements, and the greatest difficulty has been experienced in obtaining transport for the bringing in of supplies. A t one time this season there was only a little over a week's supply of wheat in Queensland. It is desirable to increase the acreage in that State, and so this arrangement, which is of a temporary nature, has been made. surer say whether interest is now being charged on advances made to wheat pools to cover the period in which wheat is held before sale? exact position in a prepared reply. for Commerce and Agriculture explain why the price of wheat to millers has been reduced from 4s.

Isi t a fact that under this scheme many industries are carrying surplus labour, including men who had been trained as coal-miners, and whose services are now required in the mines to make up the shortage due to the compulsory retirement of miners at the age of 60 years ? If that be the position, will the Prime Minister consider revoking the regulation which forbids experienced miners from transferring from other industries, back to the mining industry where their experience would be of greater benefit to the country? tain, of the industrial activities associated with, the war are being conducted under what is called the cost-plus system.

Can he give an estimate of the cost involved, and does he not think that, in view of the heavy taxation forecast by the Treasurer yesterday, this money would be better spent on Australia's direct war effort rather than on paying the expenses of delegates to a purely party conference? a conference of trade unions representatives from the United Kingdom and the Dominions was first brought to my notice by the High Commissioner in London, Mr Bruce. The suggestion was that three delegates should be sent from Australia. The Governments of New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom have holding of this conference, regarding it as an invaluable contribution to our total war effort. It is to be held in London in April next, and three delegates are to go from Australia. In the very nature of the problem, transportation could not be provided except by the Government, and the Government proposes to provide it. All other costs, including is absent on account of illness, and who those for loss of time, hotel expenses, travelling allowances, &c., are to be borne sought a pair, but was unable to obtain by the trade unions. If the Government did not provide transportation, the delegates could not go, and the conference could not take place. We regard the holding of the conference as a valuable contribution to the solution of the problems which the governments of the Empire have to face. The solution of the problems involves the co-operation -of trade unions in the war effort of each Empire country and of all the countries among the United Nations. The conference is being sponsored in the best interests of ultimate victory. USE OF HOTEL IN SYDNEY. the Army investigated allegations that, a large residential hotel in the heart of Sydney, with accommodation for 500 guests, .has limited the number which it will accept to 150, who are mostly country visitors, and refuses to admit servicemen on leave, including Americans of all ranks ? If the facts are as alleged, will the Government consider taking over the botel as a temporary hostel, or at any rate, requiring the management to admit members of the .services ? made, and when I am able to give the honourable member some definite information on the subject. I shall do so. sonal explanation. In at least one newspaper published this morning it is stated that the honourable member for Balaclava { Mr White), who is serving in the Air Force overseas, had paired in favour of the amendment which the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) approved of the moved to the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Bill. That is incorrect. I , as Whip of the Opposition party, had no means of ascertaining the views of the honourable member for Balaclava, and it is not correct to say that he was paired.

If so, who is responsible for the choice of this very select band? In view of the great importance of the trade union movement to the war effort, which of those members of the committee may we regard as the representative of the trade union movement? Committee does not come under the control of my department, but I understand that its personnel is as the newspaper report has stated. The committee was appointed on the decision of the War Cabinet, but I cannot say on what basis representation was decided. the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, Mr J. V. Stout, is reported to have said that the War Commitments Committee should have the responsibility "" of advising the War Cabinet in the work of policy, formation and planning of work associated with the subtraction of additional labour from civil industry and industries only directly connected with the war effort"". If that statement be correct, I ask the Prime Minister in view of the immense importance of this problem to the Labour movement, to explain why no representarive of the trade union movement has been appointed to the committee? Clarey, M.L.C., were misinformed, and, in consequence, their criticisms were unwarranted. Last Monday, I explained to the president and secretary of the Ausonly with matters of major policy. tralasian Council of Trade Unions the functions of the War Commitments Committee, and they agreed that the proposals were satisfactory. The purpose of the committee is to ensure that projects involving the extensive use of man-power shall be examined by all the departments whose work will be affected by the jobs. In addition, the committee will consider the order of priority to be allotted to them. If the strength of the Army were to be increased by 50,000 men, they would have to be drawn from industry, and that would affect the production of food and elothing, or even munitions. The purpose of the War Commitments Committee is to review all these problems, technically, as a whole. The committee will meet as or when I direct; but the direction of man-power will not be one of its functions. Prime Minister would not often reject the recommendations of the committee. seen. include a representative of the Labour movement. posed of officers of the Commonwealth Government. WOOL APPRAISEMENT CENTRES. ter inform me whether the War Commitments Committee will examine the Government's project for the erection of country wool appraisement centres ? The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has informed honourable members that the initial cost of the projects will be £180,000, and I understand that ancillary stores will have to be built by the Central Wool Committee, at considerable cost. This work will absorb 1,000 men for a y ar. As the Prime Minister has r declared that the man-power position is of the utmost gravity, will he say whether this work has been examined by the War Commitments Committee, and if it hae been approved, what order of priority has been allotted to it? ments Committee, which has been established within the last fortnight, will deal £300,000 or £400,000 major projects? deal, not with the details of projects, but with matters of strategical and economie significance involving the employment of not merely 1,000 men, but 10,000 or even 20,000 men.

So far as I am able to discover, the mulgation of the Wheat Harvest Employment promulgation of these statutory rules is regulations and therefore could not have been in no sense necessary to the prosecution referring of the war, and consequently I am of too true that the Commission acted more exopinion that these powers have been impeditiously than the Arbitration Court would properly taken by the Commonwealth have done in the determination of harvest Government.

The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) appears to be jealous of the honour and reputation of the Government in respect of the use of war-time powers for other than war-time purposes as is indicated by the following newspaper report:Sydney, 17th January -The Government did not enact regulations for any ulterior motive but solely for war purposes, the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) said to-night. Regulations which caused unnecessary hardships could be and were withdrawn. It was wickedly false to say that the Government was using wartime powers to sneak in socialism. He urged Australians to study the real meaning of words and phrases. [ do not think it can be denied that wartime powers were used for the purpose of appointing the Wheat Harvest Employment Commission, but until this moment we have not had an opportunity to discuss the subject in this House. I have no doubt, that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) will contend that the commission was established at the request of the wheat-growers. Such a statement would be a half truth, which is worse than a lie. I shall indicate to honourable members exactly what occurred, but before I proceed to read a long statement giving all the details of the negotiations, I point out that when the representatives met to consider the subject, the chairman of the meeting, Mr Murphy, who represented the Minister for Labour and National Service, informed the delegates that if they did not participate in the proceedings certain history, of which we all are well aware in connection with the, Women's Employment Board, might be repeated. In other words, the representatives of the wheat growers were threatened in an objectionable manner. Undoubtedly, the meeting was packed. The following statement deals with all the details of the case:"" It would appear that the Minister for Commerce, Mr Scully, is armed with sufficient copies of a statement made by Mr J. Hazelton. State secretary of the' Wheat growers Union of New South Wales to send to all those who complain about the harvest wages determination."" -So said the president. cated was in duty bound to accept and abide Mr J. W. Diver, at a meeting of the Wheat Executive of the Primary Producers Association last week. The statement referred to was placed before the executive by Mr E. A. from the Minister in reply to correspondence of farmers held at Dalwallinu recently. Mr Hazelton's circular reads as follows:"" It is desirable because of the extent to which the matter has been misrepresented that the factors which led up .to the fixing of a harvest award should be outlined. When the New South Wales Harvest Advisory Committee met in August last it reviewed the man-power position and decided that if farmers were forced to outbid one another for the small amount of labour available the effect on wheat-growing would be disastrous. The only practicable means of overcoming this problem, it believed, was to fix an award. The representatives of the New South Wales Wheat-growers Union and the Farmers and Settlers Association accordingly joined in a recommendation to the Government that it establish a wage-fixing tribunal, expressing the opinion that this was preferable to asking the Arbitration Court to adjudicate. The exact terms of the telegram despatched on 1st September, 1942, were as follows: 'Wheat growers Union Farmers and Settlers Association and Australian Workers Union consider it imperative that immediate action be taken fixation wages Commonwealth wheat harvesting. Suggest competent authority be appointed under National Security Regulations. Competent authority could be conference three representatives of employers and three of employees presided over by independent chairman appointed by Government. Signed Tilson (Wheat-growers Union), Cambridge (Farmers and Settlers Association), McNeill (Australian Workers Union) ' "" . Later, the Wheat-growers Federation, in the terms of the request, appointed two representatives, the Australian Workers Union two representatives and the Minister for Labour a. chairman. The award was determined by this body. Commenting on these happenings, and the subsequent criticism, Mr J. Hazelton, State secretary of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales, says^-""We cannot gather our harvest without employing labour, and the question is not what we can afford (we cannot afford anything) but what the man we must employ w ill need to provide a reasonable living standard for himself and his dependants. To determine .this the Government recently invited wheat-growers to confer with, employees and elect a tribunal which, after considering the many aspects involved, would be in a position to frame conditions of payments equitable to both farmer and employee. All wheat-growers' organizations participated in the election of our two members to join the tribunal and all knew the conditions under which the tribunal was to be set up. Under such circumstances every intelligent member participated, and every organization impliby decisions made. But what happened? Wheat-growers' representatives failing to impress the tribunal with their views, hurried off and with two or three others claiming to speak for the Australian Wheat-growers of the Australian Wheat-growers FederaFederation hurled abuse at the tribunal and decisions reached.

100,Mr Prowse,"-Then the honorableI continue the quotation from the speech of the Minister for Labour and National ServiceI hope the time is not far distant when we shall have in this Parliament a government which is not dominated by that particular section of the community. This is a very serious matter for the Prime Minister. I expect that his Ministers have informed him that this action was taken at the direct request of the growers themselves. It may have been requested by unionist wheat-growers who were seeking certain favours from the Government in return for support that had been promised and probably had already been given. How would the Prime Minister like to be judged according to his relations with a section of the Labour party which recently held up the business of the country for approximately a month while it determined Labour's attitude towards a certain matter? The wheat industry is the second largest industry in Australia, and its very existence is at stake; yet this -determina tion has been forced upon it by a packed tribunal. The Minister for Labour and National Service waited a long time for the fulfilment of the desire that he had expressed on the 13th March, 1936. When he had the opportunity to act, he misused war-time powers. I suppose that he is now satisfied. But he cannot claim that the wishes of the primary producers have been met. What he has done illustrates the bitterness of the feeling that he has towards the wheat-growers. He does not consider that they should ride about in motor cars; only city folks should have that privilege. He said'They are always talking about their povertythe cost of a regimen of food, clothing and stricken conditions; yet, whenever one visits a country show or race meeting, one cannot get near the entrance gates because of their motor cars. I have the names of approximately I maintain that economic factors were twenty roads boards which object to not taken into consideration when this what has been done.

This price is equivalent about Is. 9d. prior last war. The decision of this tribunal is contrary to the accepted practice of all properly constituted tribunals, including the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. ber in favour of an approach being made to the Arbitration Court for an agricultural award? From the Arbitration Court we may expect justice to both sides. Here is a pronouncement by Judge Piddington that has a bearing on the matterThe view acted upon by every arbitration tribunal in Australia up to the present-that the two fundamental functions of a court in declaring a living wage are(1) To secure the economic consequence of adequate maintenance for the worker and his family; and (2) To secure the economic consequence of prosperous industry for the employer. A statutory tribunal which fails to consider either of these consequences when declaring a living wage fails to discharge a. primary function. The Chief Judge of the Arbitratio n Court, Sir George Beeby, has put on record the following statement:The court has always conceded the "" needs "" of an average family should be kept in mind in fixing a basic wage. Buti t has never, as a result of its own inquiry, specifically declared what is an average family, or what is shelter and miscellaneous items necessary to maintain it in frugal comfort, or that a basic wage should give effect to such finding. In the end economic possibilities have always been tlie determining factor. government. This was the body that sat",25,Employment Regulations

The representatives of the farmers voted against it hut, the chairman voting for the determination, it was declared carried. This award, therefore, is contrary to the definite and declared opinion of the wheat-growers who believe that the matter should be determined in the light of the ability of the farmers to pay. I have received numerous communications from representative bodies in Western Australia condemning the new award. Mr Diver has received from MrH . T. Berry, chairman of the State Wheat Harvest Employment Committee, a copy of the following letter received from the Kondinin Boad Board:"" The members of the Kondinin Road Board, mi behalf of the ratepayers, offer the strongest possible protest to the determination relating to the terms and conditions of employees engaged on manual work in connection with the harvesting of wheat sown during the year 1942. The conditions imposed are altogether too drastic for districts still only partly developed, such as Kondinin. It is further evidence of a vindictive persecution of members of an industry, which a royal commission had previously reported unable to pay its way, and it is well known that conditions have deteriorated since the Teport of that commission. Furthermore, as the Western Australian acreage for wheat production has been compulsorily restricted by one-third, the ill-effects of the determination are greater than would otherwise be the case."" There was no call for this award. When the men left the farms to join the Army or to work in munitions factories, farmers were obliged to pay almost any wages they were asked. The tribunal, which was not concerned with the welfare of the wheat industry, brought in a one-sided determination that paid no heed to the ability of farmers to pay, or to the quality of the labour offering. The rates fixed are to be paid to anything in the shape of a man, no matter how old or bow young he may be. For any sort of labour that might be offering the tribunal fixed rates which were double . those fixed by the court for any othe industry. honourable member in mind when he says that? industries was £3 2s.. and if the Minister looks at the new determination he will see that stack builders and thatchers have been allotted rates amounting to nearly £8 a week, plus keep.

I am at a loss to understand what the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) hopes to achieve by taking up the time of the House in discussing this statutory rule, which wasbrought down to meet an emergency that arose during the harvesting period just completed. through the trickery of the Minister for Labour. for Forrest, who began by accusing me of telling half truths, has himself gone on to make statements which contain even less than half the truth. This matter was first brought to the notice of the Government by the wheat-growers themselves, who were anxious lest they should not get sufficient labour to take off the harvest. They agreed to the holding of a conference with the union concerned, and this conference took place during the last session of Parliament. I did not attend the meetings, which were presided over by a representative of my department. This officer duly reported to me that the conference had unanimously agreed to the setting up of a tribunal which would fix rates of pay. What the v honourable member for Forrest objects to is, not that a tribunal was set up, but that Opposition members did not get the sort of tribunal they wanted, namely, one which would fix starvation wages.

109,Mr Ward,"The honourable memberof the wheat-growers by some of the extracts from Hansard quoted by the honourable member. It is true that, on occasions, I have criticized some of the alleged representatives of the primary producers in this Parliament, and condemned some of the attempts which they made to obtain preferential treatment for certain sections of the primary producers. Some of the primary producers have passed through very bad times in the course of the years, but there are other sections which, under all conditions have, relatively speaking, done fairly well. When he quotes from Hansard the honourable member should do so fully so that the full significance of my remarks might be apparent to wheat-growers. I challenge the honourable member for Forrest to submit to the House a comparison between the treatment of the primary producers by my party and their treatment by his own party. I remind him that when the Scullin Government introduced the first, wheat bounty legislation it provided that the bounty should be paid to all wheat growers regardless of income. There was no means test. If a wheat-grower had considerable income from other activities he still received the wheat bounty. The money available was limited, and it must be obvious that growers not in need of assistance dipped their hands into the Treasury at the expense of the more deserving. When the United Australia party was returned to power in 1931, it did not have to depend on the Country party to remain in office. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) was Minister for Commerce in the first Lyons Ministry, and he introduced legislation restricting the payment of the wheat bounty to those wheat-growers who had not earned a taxable income in the previous twelve months. I remember that the then honourable member for Warringah, Sir Archdale Parker, said that the bounty was for the needy and not for the greedy. It was recognized then by the United Australia party that only those wheat-growers in need of assistance should receive it. The Country party sponsored amendments aimed at, the defeat of the restrictive clauses of that legislation, but the move was defeated because tbe Labour party Mr Word. realized the justness of the provisions and supported the Government. At the next general elections the ranks of the United Australia party were thinned and those of the Country party increased. The Country party was then able to put the screw on the Government, and it demanded that the wheat bounty should be distributed without restriction among all wheat-growers. The honourable member for Forrest, every time wheat bounty legislation was before Parliament, supported the view that all wheat-growers, the wealthy as well as the impoverished, should participate. Our attitude was then, and still is, that monetary assistance to all primary producers should be limited to those in need of it. regard the honourable member for Forrest as an impoverished wheat-grower? regard him as a contented wheat-grower. When he was Minister for Commerce, the honourable member for Parramatta disclosed that when the distribution of the wheat bounty was unrestricted large sums of money went to overseas companies instead of to the Australian farmer. I challenge members of the Country party to show one instance of lack of sympathy on the part of the Labour party for primary producers or one instance of the Labour party ever opposing the granting of assistance to those in need of it. What we have done is to endeavour to regulate the assistance so that those most in need would receive it. That is what the honourable member for Forrest, who is reputed to be a very wealthy wheat-grower, condemns as "" hostility "" to the primary producers. When there was no lack of labour for the farms, the primary producers were able to obtain abundant labour at very low wages. Some of them argued that primary industries could not afford to pay a decent wage. The following official report shows the position then:Prior to the labour shortage in Victoria the rates for harvest hands in the Miilleo and Wininiera were from £:i to £4 per week with keep, while the rates in the districts of Ballarat, Werribee, Lavortun and Mai ton were as low as Is. per hour. Last year a survey was made in Victoria which indicated that the rates paid for last year's harvest were from 15s. to £1 per day with keep. This would be in all cases on a 10-11 hour day.",27,Harvest Awaed
110,Mr Mcleod,Does the Minister not,28,Harvest Awaed
111,Mr Ward,"Certainly not; nor do IOne shilling an hour was what they were paying! It is evident that in many cases not even that amount was paid. What did we do? We have been charged with having set up a "" packed "" tribunal. There was no protest fro m the honourable member for Forrest, or anybody else, when that tribunal was ""packed"". The protest came when it had made its decision. Any body would imagine that the t r i bunal awarded exorbitant rates of pay to the men engaged in harvesting. Where is this revolution amongst the primary producers which Country party members said would occur if we persisted in giving the harvesters a decent wage? I do not accept the honourable member's claim that he speaks for the majority of the primary producers. He speaks for a very small minority, those who are always, reaching out for assistance and who and provide decent living conditions for their employees. Throughout, the history of this country Labour governments have been compelled to force sections of primary industry to pay decent wages and observe decent standards. however, who I state what their view is I must point out that this tribunal, which is supposed to be packed, consists of two representatives of the wheat-growers, two of the employees and a representative of the Commonwealth Government-a n industrial officer and conciliation commissioner who is highly experienced in controlling the deliberations of wage-fixing tribunals. It is a false charge to say that the chairman and members of that t r i bunal are in any way biased. The following statement sets out the determination of the tribunal :The basic rate of 2s. 3d. per hour is made acted behind the back of Parliament. up as follows:Tlie index number operating as from Does the honourable member suggest that the first day of November, 1942, is 89.2 I , as Minister for Labour and National equalling 89s.

Some of the difficulties in meeting the This is to compensate for wet weather, annual leave, fares, &c. The margins run from 10 per cent, to 40 per cent, in the present award; the margin for the casual rate of 2s. 3d. per hour is approximately 14 per cent. The basic rate, at 2s. 3d. per hour, for a 48-hour week equals £5 8s. per week, which is made up as follows:£ s. d.

The honourable member for Forrest did not mention that the employees have to "" f in d "" for themselves. The wage does not take into account the time lost in moving from one place of employment to another. Under present conditions, by no stretch of i m agination could that rate be described as exorbitant. One of the matters which the refuse to pay decent wages honourable member did not mention, but which I expected h i m to mention, is that the f u l l adult wage is paid to all employees in the industry over the age of nineteen years. We recognize the fact that a lad There .are, of nineteen years of age is capable of many primary producers doing a man's job on the f a r m and is take a different view. Before therefore entitled to the f u l l rate of pay. The honourable member for Forrest cited a report by Mr Hazelton, but used only that part of the report which suited his arguments. Most of Mr Hazeiton's statements are in commendation of the Government's policy and of what has been achieved by the tribunal. Mir. SCULLY Mr Hazelton represents two-thirds of tlie wheat-farmers in New South Wales. orable member for Forrest, who does not speak for the majorit y of the wheat growers, said that the Government had Service, and this Government itself, wheat crop. If we had taken no action",28,Harvest Awaed
112,Mr Ward,"That is true. The honlabour requirements of the wheat industry are due to the fact that men who formerly worked in primary industries realize that they could earn more money in the cities. Many primary producers recognized this, and. were prepared to assist the Government and themselves by offering decent wages and conditions as an inducement to men to remain in the industry. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, I , and my colleagues in the Ministry devised a scheme whereby the wheat-growers would be assured of an adequate return for their labours, but, as one of the conditions, we required that they should pay their employees an adequate wage. The honourable member for Forrest would have honourable members believe that there was a widespread protest against the rates of pay determined by the tribunal. In contradiction of the honourable gentleman, I cite the following advertisements from the Northern Daily Leader, Tamworth:10th November, 1942 -Wanted extension head man, 30s. per day and keep.

On the 24th December last, the Sydney Morning Herald contained the following paragraph:"" Soldiers saved bountiful Riverina harvest said Mr Stalhuan, secretary of a War Agricultural Committee. ."" Upwards of 200 men in one camp worked a total of 5,500 working hours, for which they were paid 2s. Od. per hour."" That is 3d. an hour above the basic rate of 2s. 3d. an hour set by the Wheat Harvest Employment. Commission. evidence demonstrates conclusively that all the primary producers do not object to paying decent wages in order that the industry may continue. If honourable members w ill peruse Hansard, they w ill discover that on all occasions when the honourable member for Forrest has delivered a speech on the wheat industry, he has said that decent wages should be paid to workers in primary industries. TO make that qualification, and he never mentioned a price that the wheat-growers should receive for their product before they could afford to pay to their employees a reasonable wage. The Labour Government determined that the primary producer should obtain assistance to harvest his crop, and should pay a decent wage to his employees. Honourable members opposite have often declared that the Labour party represents only the workers in the cities. The Government is now demonstrating the falsity of that statement by proving that it also represents the primary producers. I believe that if it is ligh t to regulate the wages of city workers in order to ensure to them a proper standard of living, it is equally right for the Government to regulate wages in country districts in order to ensure that employees shall receive adequate payment for their labour. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr. Prowse) failed to make out a case for the repeal of the regulations. The statutory rules are promulgated for the purpose of meeting an emergency, and the regulaare contract tions apply only to this harvest. Of course, I do not say that the Government No t all. The first adwill not take similar action next year to regulate wages in country districts. The Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has suggested, and the honourable member agreed, that the matter could be referred to the Arbitration Court. that advocacy represents an advance from the stand that members of the Country party have taken hitherto, because they always objected to the application of awards to rural industries, whether the That determinations were made by a special tribunal or the Arbitration Court.

119,Mr Clark,,31,Harvest Awaed
120,Mr Mcewen ( I N D I ) [12.37],"Th eintroduced a bill to authorize the payment of a paltry bounty of 3d. a bushel. Curtin) submitted an amendment to the Government's proposal to the effect that the bounty should not be paid to a wheat grower unless he could establish that he was the victim of adverse seasonal conditions, and even in necessitous circumstances. the Opposition had grudging support from the present Minister for Labour and National Service, who at that time had left the fold of the official Labour party. The right honourable member for Fremantle justified his attitude by citing figures from the report of a royal commission which had shortly before inquired' into the cost of the production of wheat. The royal commission concluded, from its investigations, that one-half of the wheat-growers of Australia were able to produce wheat at: 3s. a bushel. I shall analyse the basis of costs which the commission adopted. The figures have a bearing on the presentcase, because they satisfied the Minister. The royal commission presumed that the wheat-grower should have an annual remuneration of £125; that no wages were to be paid to members of his family under the age of 21 years who assisted him; that no allowance was to be made for the cost of food and shelter for those children; and that members of the family over 21 years of age, who assisted, were to receive a wage of £1 a week. The Min ster was entirely satisfied with those : conditions, because he resisted the payment of a bounty to the wheat-growers. ported in Haiisard. the payment of a bounty. Doubtless 1 voted for the amendment. The then Leader of the Opposition sought to have the money paid to farmers in necessitous circumstances. Opposition had moved that the bounty should be paid only to those who produced evidence to the satisfaction of the prescribed authority that they had experienced adverse seasonal conditions and as the result w-as in necessitous circumstances. the granting of all forms of relief. looks the fact that the farmer was limited to an annual remuneration of £125, and that members of his family under the age of 21, who assisted him, were entitled to no wages. That disposes of the sympathy which the Minister pretended to have for primary producers. It demonstrates as humbug this pose that the Labour party is the only political party concerned with securing fair rates of pay for the people. If it is right to have a fair standard for workers in industry, it is equally right to have a fair standard for those who work in their own business. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. myself now to the questions of whether the appointment of the Wheat Harvest Employment Commission was necessary, and whether the appointment was made under reasonable conditions. I thought it had been sufficiently well established in this country that the determination of wages and conditions in any industry was the responsibility of the Arbitration Court. I can understand, of course, that the necessity might arise at any time to establish a special tribunal to deal with an -emergency. But the sowing and maturing of a crop of wheat does not Occur within a fortnight. Everybody knew months before the last harvest that the wheat crop would have to be gathered, and ample opportunity was available for the Government to take steps to deal with the situation and to obtain from the Arbitration Court an award covering facts are reharvesting work. The Arbitration Court could have examined all the relevant circumstances. Had the subject been referred to the court, it would have compared the position of the workers and the employers in this industry with that of the workers and the employers in other industries, and, in the light of all the circumstances, including the capacity of the employers to pay certain wages, the court would no doubt have given a fair and equitable award. But that course was not taken. A special tribunal was appointed to deal with the subject. It",31,Harvest Awaed

Lt is true that representatives of the wheat-growers brought their impending difficulties in respect of man-power to the notice of the Government, and asked that something be done to help them to secure labour to reap this essential foodstuffs crop. It was not suggested, however, that the shortage of man-power had anything to do with the rates of wages payable for harvesting work. It has been the common practice for a very long while in this industry to pay a daily wage of £1, 25s., or even more, to men engaged in driving headers and. harvesters, in stack-building.and in other harvesting work. the argument of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) that this determination would be ruinous to the wheat grower. the kind. The fact is that this award fixed a minimum rate of pay for boys of 19 years to men of more than 70 years of age. Very many of the men who worked on the harvest fields during the last harvest were more than 70 years of age. The award was made without regard to the capacity to work of the men engaged in harvesting. The request of the wheat-growers was that additional men should be drafted to harvesting work, but not one additional employee was obtained by that means. The appeal of the wheat-growers fell on stony ground, if one may call the ears of the Minister for Labour and National Service stony ground; definitely it was not unfertile ground, for a tribunal was established which made this extraordinary award. wheat-growers agreed to the award. The honourable member for Forrest has drove tractors during the barley harvest. outlined the circumstances in which As a matter of fact, the men were far the tribunal was established.

I ask the Minister for representatives, the award will be made in Labour and National Service, or the the absence of such representatives"". ItMinister for Commerce and Agriculture, was another version of the old story, "" Hands up or else "". The award was made to apply to the harvesting of barley and oats, as well as wheat, and, here again, there was a total disregard of the capacity of the growers of such crops to pay the rates fixed. . What is the position in respect of these two cereal crops? The growers of oats receive a rate of 2s. 2d. a bushel, and, in the States where the barley pool is still operating, the pool prices apply to barley. But the barley-grower gets only a first advance. In the locality in which I live, where a good deal of barley 1 . grown, nearly all the barley produced J in the last harvest was classified as feed grade, and the first advance for it was only 9d. a bushel. Three bushels of barley go to the bag, so that the barleygrowers received 2s. 3d. a bag as a first advance. But each bag costs Is. Id., so the amount received by the barleygrowers was only Is. 2d. a bag. The harvest in the area that I have in mind yielded about eight bags to the acre; therefore the grower received an advance equivalent to a little more than 9s. an acre. But what rates have to be paid to the men engaged to harvest the barley? .It is customary for men employed on this work to spend ten hours a day in the field. They, receive under this award up to 3s. 3d. an hour for eighthours, and 4s. 10-Ad. an hour for the extra two hours, making their rate of pay about £2 a day.

Therefore, that barrel has misfired.

I associate myself with the honourable members for Forrest and Swan( Mr Marwick) in demanding that the regulations shall, be withdrawn. Both of those gentlemen, and you, too, Mr Speaker, come from.

On behalf of himself and other representatives of Western Australia, he expressed himself as not at all satisfied that such powers would not be abused. If ever there'has been an example of unwarranted abuse of authority, it is to be found in the employment of the National Security Act to withdraw from returned soldiers the preference that they have enjoyed in respect of employment, and to substitute for it. preference in employment to unionists. In general terms, I associate myself with the desire of the Government that this Parliament shall enjoy additional power and authority, but pursuit of the course adopted by the Government will convince the people of Australia of the wisdom of denying that additional authority. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) has presented his case admirably He has been condemned by every member of the Opposition on tlie ground that he has no sympathy with flie primary producers. When the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr with the interests of those who farm the Scully) and I advocated that there should be; payment to the wheat-growers of 4s. a bushel in respect of the first 3,000 bushels for the payment of a guaranteed produced we had the whole-hearted support of the honourable gentleman. He said that his policy was that a fair price should be paid to every man, whether he was a worker, a primary producer, or a. business man. The principal argument of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) is that the wage awarded should not have been fixed because the industry cannot afford ro pay if. What is the reason for that inability? Is the fault to be laid at the door of this Parliament? For a period of ten years, during which honourable gentlemen opposite could have fixed a price for all primary products, they did not show any consideration for the wheat industry. Twenty years ago I , and the farmers in my district, paid a higher wage than was fixed by the He argued on behalf present award. As the Minister for Labour and National Service has as to whether additional explained, all interests were represented on the tribunal which made the award. It has been argued that the matter should have been referred to the Arbitration Court. We know what lengthy periods are involved in hearings before that tribunal. Had it had the determination of the matter, a decision would not yet have been reached. The Minister for Labour and National Service has said that the matter is more one of obtaining labour, irrespective of what is paid for it, than of what wage has been awarded by the tribunal. That is proved by the advertisements which appeared in the newspapers. The objections to this determination come from 2 per cent, of the wheat-growers; the other 9S per cent, are only too pleased to be able to pay high wages if the industry can afford it. The parliamentary committee which was appointed to inquire into rural industries in Australia found that the prices -of most primary products were not sufficient to allow the industries to pay their way on a proper basis. There is no doubt that there has been sweated labour in the dairying industry, due entirely to the neglect of the members of the Country party who have no consideration for country interests, but are more concerned farmer. The present Government brought clown regulations providing price to the producers of meat, but the regulations have been disallowed by the Senate We maintain that the primary producer should be guaranteed an adequate price so that he may be in a position to pay fair wages to his employees, but every time the Government brings forward proposals for fixing prices of primary products they are turned clown cold by tbe members of the Country party and the United Australia party in the Senate. They are opposed to a Labour government doing for the primary producers what they Themselves had refused to do when they were in power. When the Scullin Government wanted to fix a guaranteed price for wheat for a period of five years it did not get one vote from the Country party or from the United Australia",35,Harvest Awaed
162,Mr Langtry (Riverina) [2.4.3],"party. The Scullin Government guaranteed a price of 4s. a bushel and arranged to make the money available, but its proposal was turned down in the Senate. The fact is that the men on the land have been crucified by honourable members opposite. They will talk for hours about the needs of the primary producers, but when the time comes they will vote in the opposite way. Surely there could be no greater example of hypocrisy than that. Talk does not matter; the way in which a man votes is what counts. Honourable members opposite cannot blame the Labour party for the plight in which the farmers find themselves to-day, seeing that for ten years the Labour party was in opposition. The honourable member for Forrest cried over the lot of the poor wheat-growers who are unable to pay a living wage to their workers, but why are they in that position ? Because the Government which he supported for so long did nothing to ensure that they would obtain a fair price for their product. The organizations which claim to represent the wheat growers 'represent only the more wealthy of them. The alleged representatives of the wheat-growers fought tooth and nail against the proposal to pay a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, and the price would never have.been received except for the efforts of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I do iiot think that any primary producer can pay the wages prescribed out of the prices now being paid for primary products. However, if the Government is given a little time, it will see that guaranteed prices are paid for all primary products. The trouble is that, as soon as we make a move in that direction, our efforts are frustrated in the Senate. My advice to farmers is, that for their own welfare, they should return all Labour senators at the first opportunity. There are some wheat-growers and some wool-growers too, probably, and some dairy farmers, who would have men working for 2s. a week if they could, but they represent not more than 2 per cent, of the whole. The ordinary farmer realizes that a man is worthy of his hire. I am pleased that the Minister for Labour and National Service is administering these regulations in such an able manner, especially when it is remembered that he has had no experience in the industry. I hope he will remain in. office for many years to look after the interests of labour, because they have in. the past been neglected just as much as have the interests of the primary producers. port the motion of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse). This is the first time in the history of any Australian industry that an award has been made by backdoor methods of this kind, and without reference to the Arbitration Court. This Government has missed no opportunity to use the methods of a dictatorship against those with whom it does not agree The Country party has always fought the battles of the farmers, including the wheat-farmers, in this Parliament. Had it not been for the efforts of the Country party during the last ten years the lot of the farmers would be much worse than it is. The Australian country-side was almost denuded of young and fit men and then the man-power authorities went in and took the few who remained. Most of them had volunteered for service in the forces, leaving their fathers to manage as best they could until they returned. I believe in paying good wages, and have always done so. At the present time, however, there are very few workers of any kind left in the country districts, and the few who remain are only second grade. pleased when they read that statement. for the most part, they are no longer young. I am not so good a man as I was twenty years ago, and neither is the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard). The Government, instead of referring the matter to the Arbitration Court, appointed a tribunal to fix wages in an industry for the product of which a fair price had been prescribed. When a former government fixed the price of wheat at 3s. lOd. a bushel in 1940, the wheat-growers protested because the price was not payable. A price of 4s. all round would be satisfactory.

""When he returned to camp he was court-martialled for having been absent without leave. The father, who appeared at the court to give evidence on his son's behalf, had applied by letter for his son to be given leave to help him on the farm. One passage of the letter statedIf the man-power officers were given some harvesting work to do instead of playing tennis they would know what help the farmers want. mentarians, too. Ministers. The son stated in evidence that lie owned a farm, near his father's farm at Murray Bridge. Owing to his father's ill-health, there was not sufficient labour on both farms for the harvesting work. He had already had five weeks' special leave, but an application for leave without pay during the period for which he was absent without leave had been refused. deliberately flouted the instructions that be was not to have leave, but said he had no intention of deserting the Army. The father said that he could produce a medical certificate to show the extent of his illness. The certificate stated that the doctor considered that his claim on his son's assistance was a reasonable one. During the whole of the time his son was absent without leave he had worked, on the farm for between ten and eleven hours a clay. That is the sort of thing the farmers' sons bave to do. of farmhands as well as the sons of the farmers are at the front. All the younger men have been called up. have sneaked into munitions works and other protected undertakings in order to avoid going to the front, and are earning £11 and £12 a week. Instead of helping the farmer, this Government is doing all it, can to hinder him. The last Government fixed the price of wheat at 3s. lOJd. a bushel. Labour members then joined with me in saying that it was not enough. AU that this Government needed to do was to increase that price in accordance with the increased costs of production. Mr .SCULLY -The honourable member forgets that that price was an f.o.b. price. When the price was fixed the price of cornsacks was 8s. a dozen, to-day it is 14s., and next year, according to the latest information, it will be 18s., and that is an increase of costs to the farmer? of 2d. or 3d. a bushel. The cost of superphosphates has risen beyond all reason. I concede that the Government is bearing a share of the increased cost, but, owing to shortage of supplies, the farmers are not obtaining sufficient superphosphate to ensure that they shall have a decent crop next year. This Government introduced a scheme guaranteeing the return of 4s. a bushel on the first 3,000 bushels and 2s. a bushel on any wheat in excess of that quantity. Under that arrangement most farmers receive an average of 3s. or less a bushel. After paying freight many farmers under the previous Government's arrangements received 2s. 9d. a bushel, whereas under this Government's scheme they are receivHe admitted that he had ing only 2s. 4d. and 2s. 5d. a bushel. That is not assisting the farmers. Meetings of wheat-growers are being held all over the country to demand that they be paid 4s. a bushel for all their wheat. Many of them thought that they would get 4s. a bushel and at last be able to make a small profit. They find, however, that, having to pay a high wage for a working day of eight hours, plus 4s. an hour overtime, the arrangements which they thought were so good leave them in a position even worse than they were in before. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will have to give up his idea that he has done a service to wheat-farmers. Those farmers who are able to sow and harvest without the aid of superphosphates may be all right under these arrangements, but I assure the Minister that the South Australian wheat-growers are up in arms. Not only have their costs of production been enormously increased by their being compelled to pay higher wages and meet increased costs in other directions, but also this Government has penalized",38,Harvest Awaed

The farmer should not be required to pay more on mortgages than is the prevailing rate of interest on loans.

The right thing for the farmer to do is to pay fair wages, and the employee in return will give good service. This award will cause a cleavage between the farmer and the worker. I shall cite an example. A man who had worked for a fanner for seven years had on his employer's property a cottage rent-free, milk, poultry and firewood, and was paid £4 a week. When the tribunal announced this award, the farmer told the employee frankly that he could not afford to pay him £11 a week, because the property could not bear the expense. The farmer decided to harvest as much of the crop as he could without assistance, and the remainder would be left to rot. That has been a fairly common experience in South Australia. When the employee left, he had to find a home for his family, and he I support the remarks of the honourable member for Forrest, because I consider that the award was secured by a "" backascertaining whetherfirst-classlabour was available to be put into the field.

The Government has been compelled to place the primary producing industries on a sound economic basis. Accordingly, it fixed for wheat one of the highest prices for many years. The honourable member for Grey( Mr tion Court for an award possibly two Badman) implied that the Government was paying a differential rate of 4s. a bushel for the first 3,000 bushels and 2s. a bushel for the second 3,000 bushels of a crop. The fact is that the Government wfill guarantee a price of 4s. a bushel for the first 3,000 bushels, but the balance of the crop will be placed in a pool and the grower will receive the proceeds from the sale of that wheat. If present prices be maintained, it is possible that the grower will receive 4s. a bushel for the balance of his crop. The Government is making an advance of 2s. a bushel against, those sales. ""With the stabilization of the price to the grower, the Government was obliged to take action to ensure the harvesting of the crop and to safeguard the position of employees in the industry. The growers were most concerned about, the lack of man-power in the industry. They were not able to obtain the necessary labour, and the Government did not intervene until the industry requested it to do so. Early last August, the New South Wales Harvest Advisory Committee, on which the Wheat-growers Union and the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales were represented, discussed the serious manpower position, with particular reference to the wheat harvest. After an exhaustive survey, the committee conveyed its findings to the man-power authorities in unmistakeable terms. The following motion, which, was submitted by Mr December, 1942R. T. Tilson, the secretary of the Northwest Division of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales, was carried unanimously:That in order tn establish a reasonable and uniform wage for harvest employees to be applied to nil wheat-growing States of Australia this Harvest Advisory Committee urges the Director-General of Man Power to immediately convene a conference between the Australian Wheat-growers Federation representing the employers and the Australian Workers Union representing the employees for the purpose of discussing this important question. It is the desire of this committee that the matter of discussing wages and conditions for harvesting should not be referred to the Arbitration Court as it could best be decided at a round-table conference of parties. That conference was arranged, and the committee expressed the opinion that if an application were made to the Arbitrayears would elapse before effect could be given to it. In this case, immediate action was required. Up to this stage, the Government had not intervened, but the New South Wales Harvest Advisory Committee, believing that things were moving too slowly, sent the following telegram to the Minister for Labour and National Service:Wheat-growers Union, Farmers and Settlers Association and Australian Workers Union consider it imperative that immediate action be taken fixation wages Commonwealth wheat harvesting (Stop) Suggest competent authority be appointed under National Security Regulations (Stop) Competent authority could be conference of three representatives of employers and three of employees pxjsiderl over by an independent chairman appointed by the Government. The signatories were Messrs. B. K. Tilson, of the Wheat-growers Union, W. C. Cambridge, of the Farmers and Settlers Association, and W. McNeill, of the Australian Workers Union. Following that request, the Government acted promptly. The tribunal, was appointed, and determined the rates of pay. The announcement of the determination was the signal for the launching of a campaign against it, and numerous complaints were received. In a letter to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Diver protested strongly against the determination, and the matter has now been raised in this chamber by tbe honourable member for Forrest. I have a letter , from the secretary of the Wheat-growers Federation, Mr Hazelton, dated the 4th Mr Diver's claim that he speaks tor the Federation is incorrect. >io meeting of the Federation was called to consider the matter, nor were affiliated organizations consulted. Our organization, an nltiliatcd unit of the Federation, disagrees with the action taken by Mr Diver and we desire .to disassociate ourselves from such. He was not authorized to use the name of the Federation. Tn this State farmers generally have accepted the award as an equitable effort to meet difficult circumstances. Movement? t., ferment opposition to it have failed. The action taken by Mr Diver and his associates are based on sordid political motives. We strongly resent Mr Diver's attempt to involve tlie Federation and our organization in party matters of such nature, and should Mr Fadden accede to their request, facts in our possession chamber tactics"" when the tribunal -was set are furnished to permit of the exposure of the insincerity and hypocrisy underlying what is being attempted. Some amplification of these facts will he found in the columns of our nlHcial newspaper (copy of November issue is enclosed). Newspaper comment is not always accepted as reliable. Confirmation of any statement is available. The meeting at Gregra can be regarded as an offset to that at Loxton, South Australia. The Gregra meeting challenged the writer to attend and defend the attitude of his organizafor steps to be taken to meet the situation to the award. Organized opposition was present to make the defence difficult. After a. stormy meeting (all present were farmers) only one vote was recorded against a motion asking for endorsement of .the Union attitude towards the award. It was truly an instance of "" coining to scoff and remaining to pray "". The writer is confident that a similar result can be obtained wherever the facts are properly stated to farmers. One of the foremost opponents to the award (on principle), W. C. Cambridge, joined with those who made the request for its determination. His subsequent acceptance of appointment to the Tribunal to determine the award and later hypocritical denunciation of that commission, is all very illuminating. Their conception of principle ia certainly a new version. That letter definitely shows the official attitude. The wheat-growers' organization realized that the Government had done only what the representatives of the farmers had asked it to do, namely, appoint a tribunal representing all parties, with an impartial chairman. growers Eederation decide? Federation was never consulted in the matter. A further communication from the secretary of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales, Mr no doubt that the Wheat Harvest EmHazelton, states:Eleven wheat-growers' organizations participated in the election of our two members to join the tribunal and all knew the conditions under which the tribunal was to he set up. Under such circumstances every intelligent member participated and every organization implicated was in duty bound to accept and abide by decisions made. He adds that certain individuals have been attempting to make political capital out of the award of the commission, and saysTime would not permit the matter being referred to the Arbitration Court. National Security regulations had to be invoked, and this was acceptable to all organizations. Nothing was mentioned about the sin of '' by-passing the Arbitration Court"" or "" starup.

I was present at a very largely attended meeting a few weeks ago, at which it was stated by representative farmers that the return of £600 which the farmer received under the Government's scheme, on the basis of a 3,000-bushel crop, was substantial and satisfactory. It must be borne in mind that wages do not constitute the heaviest charges which the farmers have to meet. Perhaps their greatest difficulties occur in consequence of high land values and high interest rates. If the Opposition would assist the man-power for the purpose of such harvesting, Government to effect a reduction of interest rates they would do good service to the farming industry. The Government has to ensure not only that the farmers shall have a reasonable market for their products, but also that the farm workers shall receive a reasonable wage for their service. .We must do everything we can .to ensure a reasonable standard of living for people who reside in country districts. Unless fair wages be paid to people employed in primary industries, it will be impossible for them to buy wheat, meat and wool. It is a sound economic proposition that the position of both the farmers and the employees on the farms shall be stabilized. The purpose of the Government's policy is to achieve that desirable end. port the motion, and commend the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) for having moved it. That the regulations which he has criticized were most ill advised is quite apparent from the weak defence of them by Government supporters. Obviously the regulations were promulgated with little or no consideration for the primary industries. abuse of the National Security Act. member. A. grave injustice has been imposed on the farmers, also, by extending the provisions of the wheat harvest employment award to other cereal crops. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) conveniently forgot to tell us the nature of the emergency which, in the view of the Government, made it necessary to extend the conditions of this award to oat, barley and rye crops and the cutting of certain other crops. Regulation 3, issued under Statutory Rules 1942, No. 471, provides3. The object of these Regulations is to give effect to a decision reached at a conference of representatives of the Australian Wheat growers' Federation and the Australian Workers' Union held at Canberra on the sixth day of October, 1942, in regard to the determination of rates of remuneration and conditions of work for persons engaged in the harvesting of wheat sown during the year 1942, and to tlie obtaining and directing of and these Regulations shall be administered and construed accordingly. It will be observed that only the wheat growing industry is involved; but, as the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) has clearly shown, the Government has widely extended the scope of the award by the regulations issued under Statutory Rules 1942, No. 487. The growers of oats, barley and rye are not in as good a position as the growers of wheat to meet the conditions of this award, and, in fact, they have been brought within the terms of the award without rhyme or reason, without their knowledge, without representation, and without the nnanciai assistance which has been provided for the wheat industry. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) stated that the commission had been established, at the request of the farmers' organizations. Eveni f that be true in relation to the wheat growers, it is definitely untrue in relation to the growers of oats and barley. the wheat-growers. the 6th October, 1942, to which reference is made in the regulations, consisted entirely 'of persons interested in the wheat industry, and the Government was not entitled to extend the operations of the award which resulted, from a decision of that conference to farmers who were entirely unrepresented, at it. Under existing conditions it is absolutely impossible for the growers of oats and barley to meet the conditions of the award. To enable them to do so it would",42,Harvest Awaed

The method of determining wages and conditions of work by regulations rather than by the accepted, method of arbitration will land Australia in a sorry plight, in fact, assure that provision will be because it must inevitably result in a lessening of the production of essential commodities and a serious food shortage in this country. It is interesting to note that at the recent Constitution Convention held, in Canberra, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) stated that it was not the intention of the Government to fix wages by regulation. Notwithstanding that declaration, the wheat harvesting employment award has been extended to other than wheat-farmers without consultation with them. Consequently, the Prime Minister's declaration has been flouted. Under the provisions of this award stack-builders and thatchers must be paid 3s. 3d. an hour, which for a 4S-hour week equals £7 16s. In addition, board and lodging must be provided, 'or £1 6s. 6d. a week paid in lieu thereof, making a total of £9 2s. 6d. a week of 48 hours. Drivers of binders, headers and harvesters, or contractors on the same basis, must, be paid £7 ISs. 6d. a week, and. ordinary labourers £6 14s. 6d. a week. Provision is also made for the payment of overtime when the hours exceed 4S a week at one and a half times tbe ordinary rate. Certain holidays must also be paid for, though no work whatever is done on those days. The enforcement of such conditions upon the primary industries without some compensating action on the part of the Government must inevitably result in a decrease of production at a time when the Government is appealing for an increase of it Farmers cannot be expected to grow crops that will not return them at least the cost of production. The adverse effects of this award are already observable. actually being reduced. Some farmers are not growing certain commodities, and production generally is being reduced to a volume within the capacity of the farmers' own families. Many members of farming families are already in the Australian Imperial Force, and others Mr (hty. have been called up for military duty. This, in itself, has limited production to a marked degree. We cannot assume that the farmers will be able to pay the wages stipulated in this award; we must,, made to enable them to meet the increased costs involved. The preservation of our primary industries is of paramount importance to Australia. If they slump our whole economic structure must collapse, for rural production is the backbone of Australian economy. We must stabilize the finances of the primary producers. Their income must be increased to enable them to meet the ever-increasing costs of production, which are now assuming, alarming proportions. Under present conditions there is every incentive for the rural population to drift to the cities, where living conditions are much better than they are in country districts, and where the amenities of the city and of city life are strong attractions. If this state of affairs is to be allowed to continue, the production of essential foodstuffs must decline,"" with disastrous results to the whole community. I wish to make it clear, however, that I support the principle of the payment of fair wages to all rural workers, though I am definitely of the opinion that to attempt to enforce a high wage upon primary industries without making a corresponding adjustment of the prices of farm products must be disastrous alike to 'our farmers and to our national production programme. The Government has started at the wrong end. If it adjusted the prices of farm products first, and thus enabled the farmers to pay such wages as are stipulated in this award, we should not hear the complaints that are commonly heard to-day. I hope that the motion will be carried, and that the commission will pass out of Production is existence. Such an award can be sustained only after the Government has been courageous enough to ensure that the income of farmers shall be increased sufficiently to enable them to meet such increased costs. adjourned.",43,Harvest Awaed

Trusting to hear from you in the near future, Yours faithfully, JOHN NEELD. I met this gentleman last week-end. In conversation, he mentiond that he was renting a four-roomed house of which he had been in occupation for some considerable time-if my memory serves me rightly, for two years. mises ? private house. I paid a visit to it. I understand that the tenant conducts a hire-car business. He has accommodation for one car in the garage, and other cars have to be kept standing outside. The house consists of four small rooms, and is badly in need of repair. I was shown receipts for the payment of .a rent of £4 a week. Mr Neeld informed me that his wife is in employment so that she may help to pay the rent. He also said that he had approached the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings), Mr C. S. Daley and others who, in his opinion, were able to use influence, but had been ignored. He knows that he cannot get another house if he vacates this. On many occasions I have referred m this chamber to the housing accommodation in Canberra. The cost of building is far too high, and apparently the rents are disgracefully excessive. Members (CITIZEN MILITARY of the Government have at all not see any fairness in charging a working man £4 a week and telling him that unless he pays it he has to vacate the premises.

Two years ago 200 houses were to be built in Canberra. I believe that I then gave notice of my intention to move tflie adjournment of the House to discuss the cost of building and the rents charged. ' I was taken to north Ainslie by the architect and valuer. The foundations of a number of houses had been laid. I was told that if I did not make a disturbance 1 would be given a verbal guarantee that these semi-detached pairs would not cost more than £1,100 a pair and that the rent would not exceed £1 a week. Yet the cost was from £1,200 to £1,500 a pair. The house to which I am now referring is an old one; it has been built for some considerable time. I have visited other houses, for which the tenants are paying £2 and £2 5s. a week. Why has this man been singled out and charged £4 a week?

I was also informed by him that schoolmasters had been asked to furnish particulars about boys who would not be resuming their school studies during this academic year and who would thus be available for employment.

I urge the He told me that he had decided to amend the regulations in order to extend the period within which claims for additional compensation could be made by apple and pear growers, and that statement appeared in the press to-day. I urge the Minister to see that any. amendment which he makes of the regulations is drastic. The whole principle on which they are based seems to me to be entirely wrong, because they deprive citizens of their elementary and general rights to claim compensation from the Government in respect of losses suffered by them through governmental action. Instead of the department acting on the principle that all apple and pear growers who suffer loss should have the right to go to the Government and claim compensation, their rights have been restricted very definitely by the regulations now in force, and particularly by the operation of certain time limits which have been laid down in them. For instance, regulation 4 provides that the Commonwealth shall not be bound to pay compensation in respect of any apples and pears acquired under these regulations unless certain conditions be complied with. This cuts out of the operation of the compensation scheme a very large number of growers who by reason of ignorance, or because they thought they would put in. their claims at a later date, have not lodged claims. They will not be able to claim compensation at all unless the statutory rule be amended. liberal extension of the time within which they can make application. There will be no difficulty about that. placed on the right of every citizen to claim compensation, and to have his claim received and dealt with. plan should be turned round. It should be based, not on the restrictive view which the Government has so far adopted, but on the general right of citizens to claim compensation.

After reading the statutory rule, I do not know how they stand, and growers themselves Minister, when he is redrafting the regulations, to give full weight to the claim? of these classes. They have suffered in the past very severely and unduly owing to the operation of the apple and pear scheme, and very definite consideration should be given to their claims. They should be specifically taken care of, either directly or by leaving the door wide open for them to come in. I am aware of the necessity, which the Minister pointed out to me, for the Government to take every care that no undue inroads are made on government funds by extravagant or untenable claims. I realize that there will always be danger in that direction, and that there will be great administrative difficulties if a large number of claims are suddenly presented and have to be dealt with by the existing staff. At the same time, whilst those considerations are taken into full account, every care should be taken that proper weight is given to the rights of ordinary citizens, with a view to seeing that they obtain complete justice. not think that the comparison made by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) between houses in Adelaide and Canberra was altogether fair. ber seen the houses I mentioned? study of housing in Australia during the last couple of years.

I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) and the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr arrived to take the soldier away, Frost) the case of a soldier in my electorate whose treatment by the military authorities has been nothing short of outrageous. soldier's name, as he is a mental case; but at the conclusion of my remarks I shall hand to the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) a copy of a letter that I have received from the Minister for the Army, in which the soldier's name and number appear. I shall give the House a brief outline of the facts of the case, and then I shall read the letter that I have received from, the Minister for the Army, which will bear out the facts that I shall place before honourable members, and prove conclusively that the mental disorder of this soldier was known to the military authorities some time before any hospital treatment was given. Early last year this man enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He was 38 years of age, and had always been a pound, normal, intelligent individual. He was in excellent physical condition, and passed, the medical examination without any difficulty. Some months later, however, he showed signs of mental disorder. On the 17th June, 1942, he was given leave to go to his home, and was told to report to the area doctor. He returned to camp on the 20th June. Not long after that, his mental disorder was again noticed, and once more he was sent home on leave. The first point that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister is that, if this soldier was showing signs of mental derangement, he should not have been sent home, but should have been given treatment at once. However, he returned to his home again on the 28 th June, and during his stay mental state and communicated with the authorities. A doctor was sent out to examine him, and, after seeing his condition, told him that he must go to a mental hospital. The soldier refused to do that. It must be clearly understood that he was not normal, and that therefore his refusal was not extraordinary. The doctor then commanded him, as a superior military officer, to leave the home, and again the soldier refused. That night, four military policemen although, as I have said, he was on leave and had a leave pass. Strange to say, they arrived not to take him to a mental I shall not mention the home or to a hospital, but to Russellstreet, where he was to be locked up in gaol. However, seeing the condition of the soldier, and ascertaining that he had a genuine leave pass, the military policemen refused to take him away. He was admitted to the Australian General Hospital on the 9th July, suffering from fairly .acute mental derangement. On the 11th July, he was transferred to Royal Park, where he lost certain valuables, including some money. It may be that the soldier himself wa3 responsible for the loss of these valuables, and for the tearing up of certain documents which were in his possession, but the point is: Surely .a person admitted in such a state would have his belongings checked, and. would not be left in possession of important documents which would be in danger of being destroyed! The excuse given by the Minister for the Army for not making good to the soldier the money which he lost is that the man must have destroyed or lost it. The answer to to that is that the patient ought not to have been in a position to destroy oi lose valuables. One would think that one of the first precautions taken with a mentally deranged patient would be to remove and store in a safe place all his personal effects. This man was discharged from the Army on the 25th July, and the discharge took effect on the 27th July. Owing to his condition, of",47,Pairs Voluntee R Times Advocated Fair Rents I Can
209,Mr Htjtchinison (Deakin) [4.19].,"course, he could not leave hospital. He was put in hospital by the A r m y authorities and discharged from the A r m y while there. He stayed in hospital for a considerable time, and when he was fit enough to leave his relatives were billed with the cost of his treatment from the time of his discharge from the A r m y to the time he was allowed to go home. It is extraordinary that the military authorities are able to place a soldier in hospital, discharge him while he is there, and then declare that the cost of his treatment is not its responsibility. When this man returned home he was in f a i r shape. Afte r a little while he was called up by the Armyf or another medical examination for the M i l it i a and then he was called up by the man-power authorities for yet another examination. A job was supposed to be found for h i m in the country, but when he was taken there no job was available for him. and to-day he is a sad source of trouble to his sister, who is charged with his care.

A person in an acute mental condition should be restrained, both of time, more about this matter from the for his own and other's safety, and the Minister, and I hope that he w ill have patient was obviously held in protective something much more satisfactory to tell custody. I am further advised that the mental breakme than is contained in the foregoing down of this former member of the forces was letter. This man's sister is not in the due, in the considered opinion of medical financial authorities, to constitutional causes and was enable her to look after him, and I claim undoubtedly not due to, nor aggravated by, that, without subjecting h i m to all the military service. In this connection, my attention has been directed to the fact that Mr worry of further medical examinations, Mr Ilutohi/nson. had been enlisted for training only five months previously and that mental diseases of the nature concerned are not produced by such causes. How on earth can the Minister say that. This then perfectly sane, normal and intelligent man, was passed physically f it and taken into the Army. What happened subsequently we do not know, except that he was attacked by an acute mental disorder. The military authorities say, "" We wash our hands of it , we are not the cause of this trouble"". That is a principle which cannot be accepted. If a man enlists and is accepted as medically fit the Government has a definite responsibility to him. The Minister's letter continuesRegarding personal effects, which it was claimed by your correspondent were missing, special investigation was made by a legal officer, but no trace whatsoever of tlie articles could be found. Presumably, the patient must have mislaid or destroyed them. All this muddling retarded h i m , I repeat that, in view of his mental conditions, his personal effects should have been checked and placed beyond his reach. The letter continuesDischarge from the Army of this former soldier was authorized on tlie 25th July, 1942, while at Royal Park Receiving Home, and took fiff""ct on 27th July, 1942. Regarding your correspondent's statement that a sum of Theni t says to his family, "" Y o u pay the circumstances which would which would undoubtedly impede hia recovery, the Government should decide to pay him a pension until he has been restored to full health. I could cite other instances of soldiers, discharged from the Army as mentally unsound, being given a pension of £2 2s. a week without being subjected to medical examination. As the Minister states, the medical history of this man is known. In the interests of humanity and justice, he should be given a pension which may enable him to make a full recovery. honourable member for ""Wilmot( Mr Guy), who is Opposition Whip, commented this morning on the absence of certain honourable members from the division which was taken last night. I should like to give my version of what took place. The honourable member for Darwin( Sir George Bell) asked me last Friday whether I could arrange for him to be paired with an honourable member from South Australia who, he anticipated, would support the amendment of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron). That honourable member.said that he desired to have his vote recorded. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) who, as honourable members are aware, has been granted leave of absence for two months owing to ill health, has been an anti-conscriptionist all his life. He wished to be paired in support of the bill. That was also the wish of the honourable member for Darwin, if it was possible. I have been most scrupulous about honouring the pair arranged for the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) since this Government has been in office. For sixteen months he has always been granted a pair, even on the occasion when the granting of it caused equal voting in this chamber, and when you, Mr Speaker, decided to give a casting vote against the Government. Early this morning I informed the press that the only member entitled to a pair was the honourable member for Balaclava. I was not approached by the Whips on the opposite side as to how that honourable member desired to vote. Those who know him are aware that he has always been an ardent coniscriptionist. He needs no smoke-screen behind which to hide. If the Opposition does [24] not wish to have his vote recorded, for the simple reason that it could not ascertain his views, that should be the procedure adopted in future, although the Opposition will probably desire to have his vote cast against the Government when another opportunity arises to equalize the voting. rangement been made with the honourable member to grant him a pair while overseas? been taken to task because I paired him with the right honourable member for Yarra this morning. bring to the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General (iSenator Ashley) the fact that an inordinately long delay occurs in the conveyance of mail matter to members of the fighting forces in northern Queensland. I refer particularly to mail despatched from Canberra. The wives of soldiers serving in the Volunteer Defence Corps in the far north of Queensland have drawn my attention to the fact that five weeks are occupied in the transmission of letters from Canberra. The husbands of these women have excellent records of service in the last war, and they are now giving full time service in the Volunteer Defence Corps. Not only does the transmission of letters from Canberra to northern Queensland occupy about five weeks, but a similar period elapses in the despatch of letters from northern Queensland to Canberra. This causes undue hardship and anxiety on the part of the wives of these soldiers, who may be subjected to attacks from the air or may contract tropical and other diseases. I ask that this matter be investigated immediately. I do not know whether the fault lies with the Postal Department or the military authorities. There must be bad organization or negligence on somebody's part. If the letters reached their destination even two and a half weeks after being posted, the time occupied in their transmission would be too long. I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster General to treat the matter as urgent, and, if possible, furnish ah explanation to the House on the next day of meeting.",49,Pairs Voluntee R Times Advocated Fair Rents I Can

213,Mr Francis (Moreton) [4.38],"II should like to know from the Government why very little press publicity is giyen to the deeds of the American troops at Guadalcanal and of the American and Australian troops in Papua and New Guinea. On almost any day, one notices that about six columns are devoted by the daily newspapers to news from the Russian front and about four columns to news from the North African front, as compared Avith half a column dealing with the heroic struggle of the Australian and American troops in the Pacific theatre of war. Another extraordinary fact is that much of the news concerning the deeds of the Australian forces and. of our Allies in the South-westPacific Area cornes from Washington and London. I can understand why some of the communiques from Admiral Nimitz are issued from Washington, but. there seems to be no particularly sound reason why the Australian press should not be keen to publish as much information as possible in order that the Australian public may be informed regarding the achievements, in the face of extreme hardships, in the most difficult fighting area in the world, of those who are nearest and dearest to them. The Australian newspapers not only publish communiques issued by the warring nations, but they also ovenwork the cable service by obtaining information from commentators, military experts, special correspondents and others, whose information is' of doubtful value, and much of which is purely speculative. Strangely enough, the newspapers show little desire to obtain the fullest informaceed to unload the rest of the shares on to tion concerning the men whose bodies stand between us and disaster, not many hundreds of miles from Canberra. The custom in peace-time was to publish a certain volume of news from European capitals, and there has Keen a lack of appreciation on the part of newspaper editors of the changed conditions in which we find ourselves to-day. If the people knew more of the deeds of our soldiers, they would probably have a keener realization of the general war situation in the South-west Pacific Area. When I ask the Government to approach the newspaper proprietors for the purpose of securing the publication of more news of haippenings in the south-western Pacific theatre of war, I urge also that the work of Australians, wherever performed in this war, shall be duly chronicled for the information of .the Australian public. Australians are fighting on fourteen or fifteen fronts and it is desirable that the Australian people should know as much as can be told to them about the deeds of our brave young men. This morning, I asked the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) to introduce legislation governing the activities of companies, and he replied that the matter was under consideration. I should like to place on record some of my views regarding the activities of companies, because for too long a particular kind of company-the proprietary limited company-ha s been allowed to commit roguery upon the Australian public and State Parliaments have taken no action effectively to restrain them. Proprietary limited companies are those companies in which the liability of a shareholder is limited to the extent of his holding. Whilst that may seem to be desirable, there are grave disadvantages from the point of view of the public. The proprietary limited company has all the advantages of a public company, -a partnership or private ownership of a business, with none of the disabilities. tax, but a partnership is not. not a great one. Most proprietary limited companies are formed by persons who make themselves directors, issue to themselves fully paid up shares and then prothe public. If the companies fail, the creditors are left lamenting to "" carry the baby"", and the directors escape all further liability. toria laid the foundation of its commercial and industrial prosperity. in Victoria evaded taxation for a long period, and helped to maintain that conservatism which has retarded the progress ""of the State.

In New South Wales special legislation had to be passed for the purpose of restraining the activities of the McArthur gang. Similar action was taken in Victoria. companies. and their depredations were so extensive that they almost secured control of one insurance company. They owned a wireless station in New South Wales, but the licence was cancelled and re-issued by the government of the day to the Country party. I do not object to that. But it would be impossible for people of the McArthur type to act as they did if there were no proprietary limitedcompanies. It is a fact that all the advantage is on the side of the people who form the companies; there is no corresponding advantage to the community. Every proprietary limited company should be made to publish its balance-sheets. At the moment, the balance-sheets are not published. We also have a system of holding companies such as the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, the Myer Emporium Limited, and others. They consist of small family groups who form proprietary limited companies and dominate the whole of the activities of the public companies. They do not, of course, disclose their profits. If the Attorney-General introduces legislation to control companies, I . ask that the In come Tax Act shall be amended at the same time so that the Commissioner of Taxation may, in his annual report to Parliament, publish the names of persons who pay taxes exceeding £500 a year, in order that the people may know who is robbing them. I suggest that not only the amount of tax but also the net income upon which the tax is based should he published. At present, the Commissioner of Taxation publishes the names of persons on whom penalties have been imposed. I see no reason why he should not also publish the names of those who pay tax in excess of a certain amount. Other things could be said about proprietary limited companies and about company law in general, We have undoubtedly suffered in Australia through the lack of uniform company legislation. The Attorney-General told me last year that in his opinion the Commonwealth always did possess power to pass uniform company legislation. This morning, he said that he preferred to wait until all the .State Parliaments pass the Commonwealth Powers Bill so that the matter may be placed beyond, doubt. When that oocurSj company legislation may be introduced into this Parliament. Some years ago, the Parliament of Victoria passed a comprehensive measure dealing with companies, but it was rather conservatively based, because it slavishly followed British company legislation. No one will say that British company legislation is marked by progressive tendencies or possesses radical traits. At any rate, the general public must be protected from company "" sharks "" and from those who are accepted as ordinary, decent people but whose commercial morality is, like that of almost all those engaged in commerce, not of a very high order. It is almost impossible for a man to be honest in commercial life. If he tries to be, he will not get business. In order to survive he has to do the things which most of his fellows do. Often, the average employer desires to treat his employees fairly, but when he is faced with unfair competition, he has, in order to continue to be an employer, to do some of the things which he would never do otherwise, and so it is with company activities generally; War Organization of Industry) [4.57] The various matters which honourable members have raised will be brought to the notice of the Ministers concerned and answers will be supplied to honourable members as soon as possible.

I have examined the position, and am advised that the publication of this map was not a. breach of censorship. In anticipation of an announcement which it was known I intended to make on the following day, the relevant censorship instruction was relaxed. This left the Daily Telegraph free to publish the map, which was not submitted to censorship. On the 28th January, the honourable member for Melbourne referred to the publication in a Sydney morning newspaper of figures relating to allied shipping losses last year, and asked whether information of that kind was of any use except to the enemy. It is the policy of publicity censorship to limit information regarding shipping losses to what is announced by the appropriate authorities. When, however, information of this Mad has been announced and published abroad and cabled to this country, it would serve no useful purpose to prohibit republication in the Australian press. Another matter mentioned by the . honourable member in the course of the same speech related to the publication, of a report from a war correspondent describing a battle in New Guinea for possession of a Japanese food dump. I desire to say that this report had been passed by the field censor in New Guinea, and by the joint censorship at Allied Head-quarters. The military censors ' apparently did not consider that the .' report in any way contravened security. In regard to the construction placed upon the article that Australian, troops were obliged to fight for Japanese rice dumps, in order to obtain food, it will he recalled that "" the four days"" battle along the 1 Soputa trail, New Guinea, was .part of j the successful offensive which resulted northern coast of Papua.
