Sir ROBE RT BEST -That is the decision of our H i gh Court. It was so held by Justices Isaacs, Duffy, Powers, and Rich, the Chief Justice alone dissenting. I ask honourable members to reflect for a moment how great and serious this indiscretion is. Here we are launching, for the first time, a large loan on our local markets; and it is a loan for an amount that must, more or less, strain our resources, while it is accompanied with the knowledge that possibly other loans are to follow. It has been made essentially a people's loan, launched, to a considerable degree, on the same lines as the loans of the Imperial Parliament, the idea and aim being to democratize the financial operation by the fixing of the denominations. It would be naturally thought that aid would be sought from the State Savings Banks, which could be of the greatest heln and value-thos e democratic institutions which are well and favourably established in every State. There are something like 2,000,000 people-almos t half our population-associate d with the Savings Banks, and to their credit there is upwards of £82,000,000. people throughout Australia have been accustomed to do all their business through the Savings Banks; and, remembering that, we can realize how grave a mistakehas been made by the Commonwealth Banki n not securing their help. member say whether the application for egregious mistake.

Savings Banks to co-operate in this way, has, I think, misconceived his position. because it means the withdrawal of moneys from these banks and their in a mistake-it qannot possibly be a misvestment, in the war loan. MrJ . H . CATTS -Why, the Victorian Savings Bank has tried to stop the war loan by raising its interest! Sir ROBERTBEST It is the first essential that every facility and encouragement should be given to the people to naturally be anxious to operate through the banks to which they have been accustomed. I am speaking now, not on behalf of Victoria alone, but also on behalf I s that the latest deof New South Wales, because the Savings Bank of the latter State has been in cooperation with the Inspector-General The Inspector-Generali n Sydney directly appealed to Mr Miller himself, and was directly refused, much to his indignation. the Savings Banks is less than that of the Commonwealth loan. As Victoria has been referred to, let us look at the state of affairs in that State. We have a population of 1,300,000, or 1,400,000; and no fewer than 700,000 people have accounts at the Savings Bank, representing in this one State alone a credit of upwards of £25,000,000. When an appeal, as in this case, is made to the many rather than to the few, as in previous cases, the Savings Banks are, above all other institutions, those from which cooperation and help should be soughtthey should not only be invited to helpbut that help should be catered for. The Savings Banks have, expressed their anxiety to help; and this, it must be Thousands of remembered, to their own disadvantage. But their anxiety arises from purely patriotic reasons. However, their overtures in this connection are rejected ancl spurned.

If ever there was a time when the States and the Commonwealth, particularly in regard to financial matters, should act in close and cordial association and co-operation, it is the present. There should not be this feeling between the Prime Minister and the managers of these State institutions that apparently exists.

It is a question of dignity. work for nothing, tliere is a question of agency involved. The private banks have deposits amounting to £170,000,000 or £180,000,000, while the State Savings Banks have deposits amounting to over £80,000,000. They represent half the total savings of the people. They represent more particularly the savings of the workers, andthey ask for facilities for bheir clients, just, as the private banks desire, facilities, for those who do business with them. But the Government, which is supposed chiefly to represent the great working classes of Australia;-it is constantly making that claim-ha s deliberately set aside the State Savings Banks as agents of workmen, while at the same time it places all possible facilities in tlie Why hands, of those who represent the private banks.

I desire to know whether the Government have considered that matter. third reading the Minister announced that certain amendments would be made in another place, and I drew attention at the time to the fact that he had not indicated that the amendment moved by -the honourable member for Eichmond would be made. The contention of the honourable member for Richmond was that if a soldier contributed to the support of a person before death or incapacity the Commissioner should take it for granted that such person was to the extent of the help received from the soldier dependent upon that member of the Forces. It was pointed out that in several instances the Pensions Committee had' given an amount as pension less than the amount the dependant had been receiving from the soldier. Such cases are not dealt with by the amendments made by the Senate. The responsibility will still rest upon the Deputy Commissioner when determining a claim to ascertain, as a question of fact, the extent to which the person has been dependent; whereas had the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond been given effect to, the amount of the pension to be awarded would be determined by tbe amount of contribution previouslv received by the dependant from the killed or incapacitated soldier, provided it did not exceed the amount stated in the schedule. orable member for Richmond has been partly met by extendim? the definition of dependant to include persons who were dependent months prior to the soldi°r's enlistment. That is as far as the Government are prepared to go. of the amendment of the honourable member for R c.hmond was that the Commis: sioner, in assessing the amount of pent»}on, should be governed by the amount actually contributed by the soldier prior to his death or incapacitation.

The% Government could not accept the amendment in the form in which it was drafted, but we have endeavoured to achieve its purpose as f a r as practicable by including de^ pendency during the twelve months When speaking on the prior to enlistment. That is to say, if any person was dependent on a soldier during the twelve months preceding his enlistment, that fact is to be taken into consideration by the Commissioner when fixing the pension. To include all persons dependent on a soldier prior to his enlistment, and to make mandatory the payment of the amounts mentioned in the schedule, would involve a very largeexpenditure. Each claim must be settled by the Commissioner investigating it . The Government have gone asfar as they can in the direction of com 1 plying with the desire of the honourable member for Richmond. I brought under the notice of the Committee when the B ill was previously before us the case of a woman who has two sons at the front , one of whom was married. Her husband has been in hospital for seventeen years, but, although' she is in a worse position than if shewere a widow, she cannot draw the separation allowance that is allowed to a widow. WhatI desire to know from the Minister is whether the Commissioner would have discretion to make a. special exemption in such a case.

Since then, however, the Cabinet has been able to deal with the proposal, and the Minister is now in a position to give not only his own views but those of the Cabinet, and if the Cabinet do not see their way to agree to this proposal, I , for one, shall not hesitate to vote for it if a division is taken. I hope the honourable member for Maribyrnong will press his amendment, for, in my view, it should not be necessary for a widowed mother to prove absolute dependence before becoming entitled to a pension. The mere fact that she has been willing to give up her son should be sufficient. Speakingi n Melbourne recently, the Minister of Defence made flattering allusion to the fact that 15 per cent, of the adult male population had volunteered. That means that 85 per cent, of the population have not volunteered. We have, therefore, every reason to consider the 15 per cent, generously, because it cannot be said that they have any greater stake in the community than the 85 per cent., or that they are risking their lives for anything more than is left behind in charge of the 85 per cent.

Why should a widowed mother get a pension if she is not in need of it? breadwinner. is rich she is still entitled to a pension. widowed mother is a person of about sixty years of age. There are other provisions, besides this pension, made for her, and I do not think it is reasonable that the Government should be asked to amend this B ill in the way suggested when those other provisions are operative. this. [213] honourable member for Maribyrnong suggests that the person to whom he referred must have had some other form of income, for a genuine dependant is looked after under the existing law, and the further provision is made that if a person becomes a widowed mother within five years of her son's death she -may make application for a pension if she is in need of it . In carrying out the promise I made to the Committee some time ago, I brought this matter before the Government, but the Government could not see their way to make it mandatory that a widowed mother should have a f u l l claim to a pension, whether she needed it or not. peal from Philip drunk to Philip sober. to stand in the way of ample provision being made for a widowed mother, but I think ample provision is made under the law as it now stands. If a widow can show that she has no income the B ill provides that she shall obtain a pension.

If the Government had failed in that, I should have been pleased to have the point further considered.

All Money Bills are preceded by a message from the Crown making provision for certain expenditure and no more, and the provisions of the B ill must be kept within the limits of that expenditure. Apart from the statement oi the Minister thatwidowed mothers are already provided for in the B ill , and therefore there is no necessity for the amendment, as the Minister in his responsible position says that the insertion of the words proposed by the honourable member for Maribyrnong would increase the expenditure beyond the provision in the Governor General's message, I am bound to rule that the amendment is not in order. The only method honourable members could adopt to secure the end they desire would be to solicit the Government to bring down another message to cover the addition to the B ill which they propose.

The Committee has the power to do what it chooses, but not at this particular juncture. I must confine the debate to the matters embodied in the amendments made by the Senate and sent to us for acceptance or otherwise. Opportunity will be afforded to the honourable member at another time to seek what he desires to obtain. [12.27] I desire to speak to the amendment made by the Senate. It is quite evident that the desire of the majority of members of the Committee is to liberalize the provisions of this Bill to a greater extent than the Government propose, and I am surprised that the Government have not recognised the fact. Honourable members are just as responsible to the community as are the Ministers. We are constantly asked whether such and such a provision is a fair way of dealing with men who go to the front, or their dependants. Many of us have attended meetings and urged that the men of the country should volunteer for the front, and without any qualification we have asserted that the country would look after their dependants. We could not ask a man to go to the f r o n t unless we made that assertion. I suppose every honourable member has said it . The trouble, however, is that, although we pass a B ill for that purpose, much of it is rendered useless by regulations. hind the regulations. They are based upon the Act. several instances in which regulations have prevented the wishes of honourable members being carried into effect. In one case the wife of a man who had been but eleven mouthy in Australia before volunteering to go to the f r o n t is in ill-health, and has two children. She is anxious to return to England for the period of the war, because she has no friends here, and she knows that during her ill-health she can find friends in England, who will look after her and her family. She has no I recognise that your desire to leave Australia altogether. If lier husband returns from the war, it is their desire to settle in Australia; but the moment she leaves Australia she gets nothing from us, and is thrown on the world. That is done by regulation. In another case, a young man who was a shipI quite agree with wright earning £ 3 12s. a week, and kept his mother in England, submitted to the Defence Department the receipts for the money he had sent to her. He was desirous of having her put in the same position as if she lived in Australia, but now, because he has enlisted, his widowed mother loses her source of income, and gets nothing. That also is done by regulation, and I do not think it is fair.",19,Forces May Then Be Granted A Pension At Such Rate

The Minister has conceded that that I shall do all I can to prevent this House adjourning for any protracted period while the war is on, because this Chamber provides us with the only opportunity we can have of ventilating grievances.

I shall vote against the amendment until specific provision is made to deal fairly and squarely with all tliese cases. We should not leave them to be dealt with by regulation.

If he had studied the expenditure involved he would have no hesitation in giving effect to that desire.

The widowed mothers who have sent sons to the f r o n t may be inferred to be those over forty-five years of age; and there are in the Commonwealth between forty-five and sixty-five years of age 54,000 widows. Under the Act in its present form the great the sons majority of widows will be provided for because they are mostly dependent on 1 the earnings of their children, and therefore the inclusion of widowed mothers without any condition as to dependency would involve only a very small addiThe allowance to dependants is not tional expenditure.

A few days previously I read in a Sydney newspaper that recruits from such places aa Dunedoo, Gulgong, Mudgee, and other parts of New South Wales had had to travel all the way to Lithgow to meet tlie recruiting sergeant. I happened to be in a train from Dunedoo along with seven or eight volunteers. These men had a splendid send-off at the local railway station; speeches were made, and. the men left their town amid the applause of the admiring residents. They arrived at Lithgow between 1.30 and 2 o'clock the following morning. Nobody was there to meet them. Fifteen young fellows from Orange had a similar experience last Monday week. They had offered their services to the Empire, and on their departure from the town they .were given a good send-off. On their arrival at Lithgow they expected to be met by an officer of the Defence Department. In this they were disappointed. When they got out of the train they asked a policeman where the recruiting centre was. The policeman pointed out a certain house, in which they saw a light burning. They went across, knocked at the door, and the light went out. The men had to look after themselves as best they could. All the hotels were closed, and, according to a report in the Bathurst Times, when they went to the railway station for shelter they were actually expelled from the premises, and they had to spend the night under the trees in the streets. It is disgraceful that men should be treated like this. BeforeI visited OrangeI wrote to the State Commandant in New South Wales complaining, and I am glad to know that Colonel Wallack, when expressing his regret, said that in future a recruiting sergeant and medical oflicer should be sent to Orange for the purpose of examining recruits. If these officers can be sent to Orange, they can also be sent to Dunedoo, Gulgong, and other places in New South Wales. ber want the thing settled, or does he_ plaints have been made that, owing to want to go on speaking for ever?

May I bring before the notice of the Minister for the Navy the fact that considerable attention is being given by charitable people in Sydney to the housing of returned wounded and convalescent soldiers. A large proportion of the Destitute Children's Asylum at Randwick was offered to the Department free of all cost, and the offer was gratefully accepted by my honourable friend's colleague in another place. Since then, the New South Wales Government have intimated their intention of resuming the whole of this institution's premises, an action that would seriously dislocate its; work of attending to the destitute children of Sydney. I am sure the Government does not wish to see that charity in any way disorganized, and I am satisfied that the Government was in earnest when the Minister of Defence expressed gratitude for the splendid offer that the institution made. I should like to ask the Minister to state that he is grateful for what the institution has done, and his hope that the institution's good work wili not be completely dislocated by the State Government acquiring the whole of its property. Navy) [2.57] I appreciate the way the honourable member has brought this matter forward. The Government recognises the generous offer made by the Randwick Destitute Children's Home, and in acknowledging it, I am sure that we have no desire to see the institution's ordinary work dislocated in any way. It is to be hoped that our acceptance of the institution's offer will not jeopardize its future.

257,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [2.59],"wounded on the battlefield of Gallipoli, the privates who have been fighting in the trenches have had their opportunities of promotion cut off, because their officers have been unable to report upon the work they have done. More than one reference has been made to this difficulty, and I think the Minister might make some investigation in order to assure the House that proper steps are being taken to recognise the bravery of the men fighting in the trenches attached to the battalions whose officers have been killed. By way of further explanation, may I be permitted to read the following extract from a letter I recently received? My main point re anomalous promotions is day meal in the hospital. Considering not that brave deeds and good service are not what these rnjen have gone through, in my recognised, but that the men in the trenches have their chances of securing promotion from opinion the military authorities should the ranks put aside for men who have enlisted relax the rules in regard to their rations, much later, and who have had inferior training, and give these men food more in keeping in fact, no training in war. I know several who deliberately waited until the field of selecwith their condition. Will the Minister tion was narrow, and who pulled strings until have inquiries made into this matter? they were certain of a stripe or two, to say nothing of better advancement. My son was a few weeks ago one of three representing the sole survivors in the trenches of his original oompany of 250. Yet boys who had been his subordinates in the Senior Cadets and Citizen Forces come over with their stripes gained through waiting back sufficiently long, and take charge of him and the others. I shall hand this letter to the Minister for the Navy, with the hope that, later on, he will be able to assure the House that the men who are fighting in the trenches, and who have been responsible for some of the bravest deeds recorded there, will not have their opportunity of securing promotion cut off through the death of the officers immediately commanding them, and have the commands to which they, because of their brave deeds, should be entitled, taken by men who are their juniors. I wish to speak on a similar matter. The same principle seems to have been adopted in regard to the men of the Army Pay Corps, who should be entitled to promotion in accordance with the service they have rendered in Egypt and Gallioli for months past, but whose claims, ave been overlooked by the appointment of new officers from Australia. I hope that the Minister will look into the matter, and see that length of service is also taken into account in this particular branch of the Army Service. also desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for the Navy a matter worthy of consideration. There are thirty convalescent wounded soldiers at the Randwick Hospital, two of whom waited on me the other day, and pointed out that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction among the convalescents because of the fact that they are receiving the ordinary military rations. In fact, they told me that the system of distributing the food also left much to be desired. One man had been in the institution for a week and the other had been there for a fortnight, but they had not had a midthe Minister's assurance. would like to get some information concerning Defence matters. Unfortunately we can ask for information until we are tired, but we get none. We are not in a better position to-day than when we had an Assistant Minister assisting the Minister of Defence, for then we did have in the chamber some one who knew something about the business of the Defence Department, whereas now we have no one here knowing anything about it. I am anxious to know what the Department propose to do with reference to the public scandal of militia officers who are shirking their duty, and yet at the same time getting all the lucrative positions that are offering. For twenty years we have been training these men and equipping them, and fitting them out as soldiers, but now, in the hour of the country's need, they will not volunteer, but wait to fill all the good positions in the training camps; and the Defence Department are encouraging them to stay back by appointing them, at very high salaries, to these good positions. Militia officers who refrain from volunteering should not be appointed to positions of profit under tlie Defence Department. They should be compelled",26,Military Officers And Training Camps Convalescents Rations

But, instead of this being done, these men are strutting ahout in their uniforms, giving people the idea that they are making some sacrifices or effort on behalf of the country. In all parts of Victoria they ean be seen strutting about in their uniforms like peacocks. And while they are getting all these good things from the Department, they make no sacrifices on their own part. It is time that the Minister of Defence took some action in regard to them; but he is so hedged round by the military class who are continuously making these appointments, that, though we may protest again and again, practically no notice is taken of what we say. This is a matter which I urge the Minister for the Navy to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence, in order to see whether some action cannot be taken. According to a letter that I have received from Ballarat to-day, a boy seventeen and a half vears of age has been appointed, at £6 a week, to some position in the camp there. shame. Here, again, I draw attention to that splendid class of military officers, the sergeants-major, who can get no encouragement or promotion. They belong to the masses, they are not commissioned officers, .and the officials in the Defence Department will not recognise their work. To some extent, these men will be under a boy seventeen and a half years of age. matter to the Minister? ing things along. This is the place where attention should be drawn to them. However, I have only received a letter relating to .this' particular matter today. Surely we are not going to tolerate boys seventeen and a half years of age giving instruction to the men who are going to the front to fight for our freedom at the Dardanelles? That is work men should do; but we do not employ the best men, because they are sergeantsmajor. Surely in this time of peril, the Department oould overlook these distinctions, and appoint these men to commissions. I hope that some representations will be made by the Minister for the Navy to the Minister of Defence in these [214]-2 notice. [3.9] I take this opportunity of bringing under the notice of the Minister for the Navy the desirability of making some fresh arrangements with regard to our training camps. Since recruiting commenced, the policy of the Department haa been to establish large camps in the principal centres of the Commonwealth; but it has been proved that the principle of having concentrations of men in large camps has been against the best interests of the men in regard to the general camp conditions and management, and, above all, their health. I think it can be shown very easily that the system hitherto pursued has practically broken down. I therefore urge upon the Minister the desirability of establishing camps in other places than the vicinity of the capital cities. It came under 'my notice yesterday that men who had recruited in considerI t is a able numbers at Bellingen, and in the adjoining Dorrigo district, and were ready to leave their occupations and go to Sydney, have been told not to go there for a fortnight. Tho trouble is that there is no accommodation at Liverpool, and these men will havo to wait until there is accommodation. In another case men from Grafton passed the local medical officer's test, and proceeded to Sydney, where they were again, medically examined. Some failed to pass the second test, and they were left to find their way to their homes again the best am sick of sendway they could, while the others were turned adrift in Sydney, and told to return to the depot in a fortnight's time. This system iB one that must be altered. Camps should be established in the larger towns, such as Grafton, where there is any amount of accommodation. The local committee are prepared to offer to the Defence Department the ample accommodation at the show-ground, with its water supply and cooking conveniences. The same remarks apply to the Jockey Club, who have on their race-course appointments second to nothing outside Sydney. When people are prepared to meet' the Department in every way, the Department should show some earnestness in accepting their offers.
