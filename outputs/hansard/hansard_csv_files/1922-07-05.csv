64,Mr Stewabt,"And also on the Treasurer.printed for distribution so that honourable members may follow me closely. A l though thefiguresare only on an approximate basis, they are so near to the exact position, that they will not need any material alteration. Tho total approximate expenditure out of revenue for the year 1921-22 was £65,118,265 compared with an actual expenditure of £G4,624,0S7 for the year 1920-22, and an estimated expenditure of £64,104,45S for the year 1921-22. Thus the approximate expenditure for the last financial year exceeded the actual expenditure in 1920-21 by £494,178, and the estimated expenditure for 1921-22 by £1,013,807. The four main headings of expenditure are "" Ordinary Votes of Departments,"" "" Special Appropriations, Other than War,"" ""Additions, New Works and Buildings"" and "" War Services."" The estimated expenditure for the yoar under "" Ordinary Votes of Departments' ' was £15,745,769. The approximate expenditure, being £16,200,164, exceeded this by £454,895. The estimated expenditure under "" Special Appropriations, other than W a r "" was £14.637,025. Th© approximate expenditure, being £14,972,586, exeeeded this by £335,561. The estimated expenditure on "" Additions, New Works and Buildings"" was £2,518,41.1. The approximate expenditure was £2,5S4,359, an iucrease of £65,948. on "" W a r Services"" was £31,203,253. The £31,361,156, an increase of £157,903.' Under these four headings the total increase of £1.013,807. which I have shown, is made up. I desire now> very briefly, to deal with the four different headings, the first of which is "" Ordinary Votes of Departments."" It will be seen from the statement in the hands of honourable members that the 'estimate totalled £15,745,769, but that the expenditure has been £16,200,164-a n increase of £454,395. I propose to indicate now the sources from which that increase has been derived. It will bo noted that the second Department appearing in the list of Departments is that of the Prime Minister. The estimate of expenditure was. £416,798; thc actual expenditure was £539,658-a n increase of £122,S60. The items which have contributed to briuging about the increase comprise thc following:-First, there has been a paymeut of £32,500 in settlement of the claim by the South African Government in respect of flour shipped from the Commonwealth. vernment will get that back again. that the Wheat Board will realize their obligation and refund the amount to thc Commonwealth Treasury. discussion of the matter at this moment: I am merely placing the facts and the figures before honourable members. The next item is a contribution to the League of Nations totalling £14,500. The amount set down on the Estimates was less than that which we have been called upon to pay, because the Government were hopeful that the new basis of payments contemplated at the Assembly last year would have come into operation and that, thus, we would have been relieved. The matterhas not yet reached finality, by medium of the ratification of the different States concerned, and, therefore, the Commonwealth Government will be required to find the amount which I have just mentioned in order to make Australia's appropriate payment to thc League. The next Tho estimated expenditure item is in respect of the Royal Commission on Taxation. Here, there is au approximate expenditure was excess amount of £5,000 over the estimate. This has been brought about by thc long continuation of the services of the Commission. The present occasion is not appropriate for mo to enter into a discussion of the work done and being done by the Commission; but I do not think that any Commission upon income taxation, in any part of the world, has approached its work with a more serious determination to fully investigate the subject and to give of its be3t in coming to a decision. The next item in order has to do with the Australian delegation to Washington, in respect of which a sum of £8,500 is involved. That outlay, of course, could not have been in contemplation when the Estimates were framed. Towards the relief of distress occasioned by the maritime strike, the item of £4,450 is merely a belated payment to the New",20,Consolidated Revenue Fund

The last item under the heading of which I am now speaking totals £49,000 ; it is in respect of relief of distotal £6,000. tress in Europe. Honourable members are sufficiently familiar with the circumstances to appreciate the action of the Commonwealth Government. mainly with the provision of meat for Russia? in providing meat. The total of these items to which I have just alluded is £113,950 out of the full amount of the increase, namely, £122,SC0; and it. will be for honourable members to consider how far the expenditure had beeu unavoidable. The next Department in the list under the head of "" Ordinary Votes of Departments "". is the Treasury. The estimate amounted to £1,207,2S0, and the approximate expenditure has been £1.330,S34an increase of £123,554. I shall now indicate thc chief causes of the increase. The first has to do with taxation, in regard to which, for temporary assistance, we have had to find no less than £50,000 additional. which I can draw the attention of honourable members is the amount of income tax iwhich has been collected during the past year. The estimate was £15,000,000, and .the best-equipped critics stated that that was a hopelessly exaggerated expectation. There has been collected, however, £16,790,645. which I would call attention has to do with the maintenance of persons in charitable institutions. The outlay in this regard was under-;ostimated by £12,000, and the difference has had to be provided. I am not attempting to excuse tlie position, but would merely remind honoraible members that this is a very difficult matter for any one to estimate exactly. Respecting coinage, an increase of £26,000 is shown. The output and return from coinage depend exactly _ on the amount spent on its production. Honourable members will note, under the heading of ""Receipts,"" that revenue amounting to £130,000 was estimated Tlie Comfrom this source, whereas the approximate sum derived was £178,352-a n increase of more than £48,000. In order to secure that increase, however, we have had to incur additional expenditure amounting, as I just stated, to £26,000. Remission of fines under Taxation Acts There are certain cases where grave injustice appears to have been done under our .Statutes, which are necessarily rigid. There is no power hy whicli unjust imposts can be remitted by to do the Commissioner of Taxation, and the only method is to pay ithe sums involved from the Treasury funds, and to place f the amounts upon the Supplementary Estimates for the information and consideration of the House. With respect to the Government and Stamp Printers, an expenditure of £9,000 had to 'be incurred owing toi greater output from the activities concerned. Inscribed stock frauds are responsible for £7,000. I cannot at this stage enter into a discussion concerning whether the frauds should or should not have occurred. They did occur, and the money had to bo found to cover the losses. The approximate total of these items whioh I have just been relating is £110,000; and the total increase of expenditure upon the Treasury Department is, I repeat, £123,554. The only factor here, to The next Department to which I shall refer is that of Home and Territories. The estimated expenditure was.£771,78S; the approximate outlay has been £860,255-a n increase of.£8S,467. That is more than covered by payments made in respect of one item alone. I refer to oil investigation in New Guinea. The Another item . to sum is made up in two parts An actual total of £96,000 has had to be paid,, and £25,000 of it is in respect of the purchase of the British Government's interests in oil investigations in New Guinea, while the remainder consists of the actual cost, including arrears, amounting to £71,000. I think honourable members have very distinct views with regard to the whole question of oil investigation and exploration in New Guinea; but it is not for me at this stage to discuss the question. I am giving the House thesefiguresonly to show how the increase has been brought ahout. At the appropriate time, no doubt, honourable members will raise every possible point in regard to the question. The",21,Consolidated Revenue Fund

71,Mr Brtjce,"It was mainly employedone point I am now putting is that in this item we have £96,000 which has been added to the expenditure of the Department. The total increase on the estimated expenditure of the Department is £88,467, so that, excluding this item, there has really been a reduction in its expenditure. The estimated expenditure in respect of A i r Services was £100,000, whereas ihe approximate expenditure for the year has been £152,058, an increase of £52,058. -civil or defence aviation, or does it represent the expenditure on the combined services? combined services. The amount provided on the Estimates proved to be insufficient to meet the expenditure required for, not an additional establishment, but for the establishment existing at the beginning of the year, and eventually these additional amounts were found for the Department. They were provided, however, only upon the promise that a saving of a like amount should be made in the vote for New Works, so that when, in connection with the Budget, we are considering the position as a wihole, honourable members will find that tbere has been a saving on New Works equal to the additional amount that has been made available ,to the Department in connection with the General Estimates. The estimated expenditure of the Postmaster-General's £7,455,533, and the approximate expenditure has been £7,758,399, an increase of £302,866. It is clear that in this vote, there had been some under-estimate for the maintenance of existing services. I am speaking now, not of increased services, but merely of maintenance and other moneys which had to be found unless services were actually going to be disexplaining the cause of this increase, and continued. The other side relates 'to repair and maintenance of lines in existence. If that work had been discontinued, the position would have been that when we came to put into operation the larger and continuous scheme that we now have in mind, we should merely have created further arrears that would have to be picked up. I have had a considerable amount to do with the increase in this direction, and am quite prepared to defend it. It appeared to me to be useless to cut down services and 'to allow maintenance and repair charges to accumulate, and property to depreciate just when we proposed to extend the whole of our operations, and to start on an entirely new basis. It is for the House to determine the wisdom or otherwise of our action in making available these additional moneys. I come now to the Department of Health, the estimated expenditure for which was £108,568, whereas the approximate expenditure amounted to £144,106, showing an increase of £35,538. There is one cause only for this increase, and that is the preventive measures that had to be taken in connection with the threatened outbreak of bubonic plague. I. cannot tell the House whether every penny of the money so expended was properly spent, or whether it was necessary to expend it . I would, however, take honourable members into my confidence to the extent of telling them that we were threatened with an outbreak of bubonio plague, and that while I hope that I have a certain measure of courage as Treasurer, I had not the courage to act contrary to the views of the whole of our medical advisers, and to take the risk of an outbreak of bubonic plague in this country. sponsible for such preventive measures? plague is within, our gates, but they are not responsible for the cost of fumigating vessels and other work of the kind. cost over £35,000 when it extended over only a few months? was so expended. able colleague the Minister for Health( Mr Greene) at the appropriate moment to defend that expenditure. I am only stating why I , as Treasurer, had to find this additional amount of £35,000. That completes the figures relating to the ordinary departmental votes. Coming to "" Special Appropriations, other than war,"" the estimated expenditure was £14,637,025, and the approximate expenditure has been £14,972,586, an increase of £335,561.

On the other hand, payments in respect of interest and sinking fund decreased approximately by £100,000, so rhat these two groups of items balance each other. The increase is due to the fact that, as will be seen by reference to the items under "" Special Appropriations,"" provision has been made for the Defence compensation which will be payable, if the necessary action is taken by Parliament, to the -personnel retiring under the reorganization scheme. come out of the funds for 1921-22. but it will be open to honourable members to discuss the point. We take the view that if it had not been decided to refer this question to Parliament for its deterduring the year, but, naturally, we had mination, the whole scheme would have been finalized and cleaned up during the last financial year. As it is, it has not been possible to do that. In due season a measure will be introduced for the authorization of these payments, and it will then be open to honourable members to express their views upon the action which has been talc en. authority for a special appropriation. in lespect of the compensation scheme until the necessary Bill has been passed. been, and cannot be, paid, until the scheme is passed by Parliament. consider, however, that it would have been spent during the last financial year if the matter had been treated as being within the discretion of the Government, and we have accordingly provided for it in connection with the last financial year. In respect of the item "" Other Special Appropriations,"" which were estimated at £291,000, the approximate expenditure for 1921-22 was £328,524. The bulk of that increase was accounted for by the advance of £25,000 which was made to the Soldiers Co-operative Woollen Mills at Geelong. The Act declares that this advance shall be made out of revenue, and this loan will be repaid to us. For additions, new works, and buildings, the estimate for 1921-22 was £2,518,411, and the approximate expenditure was £2,584,359. The approximate expenditure over the estimate shows an increase of £65,948, and that increase is entirely due to tlie fact that during last year we had to make provision for paying to the British Government an amount of £163,000 for munition-making plant ordered some years ago. This was quite unexpected; we had no knowledge of the pending payment, but the plant had been ordered, and had come to hand, and provision had to be made to pay. But for that payment the amount under this item would have been substantially less than the anticipated amount. tleman says that nothing was known about this, he knows that the records of the order were in both Departments. able gentleman misunderstands me; it was not known that this payment would be due full information as to the ordering of the plant. The War Services estimate' wa? £31,203,253, and the approximate expenditure was £31,361,156, or an increase over the estimate of £157,903. Under the heading of repatriation of soldiers, there is a decrease of approximately £160,000, and in the case of other war is, so far, no services of £61,000. The increase all falls under War Pensions, which show au amount of £378,000 over the estimate. That* increase in war pensions is due to the fact that Parliament, at the end of last session, passed a.n amending Act which considerably liberalized the provisions, and as a result it has been We necessary to find a very much greater sum in the past six months than we had any knowledge of when the Estimates were framed. I think I have covered in sufficient detail the expenditure side, and put honourable members in a position to fully digest, understand, and consider the figures. On the revenue side the estimate was £6.1,787,350, and the approximate revenue is £64,913,085, an increase. of £3,125,735. The principal item ia Customs and Excise, the revenue from which was estimated at £26,131,000, and the approximate revenue received £27,630,392, an increase of £1,499,392, or approximately £1,500,000. The reason for the increase is, of cotirse, that thetrading conditions have proved to be better than was estimated at the time that the estimate was framed. It will bo remembered that the Customs Estimate for the year just closed showed a substantial",23,Consolidated Revenue Fund

A t the beginning of the present year the trading indications appeared to be that a substantial reduction would be effected. There has been a substantial reduction, but not so great a reduction as was anticipated. The income tax was estimated to return £15,000,000, £16,790,645 has been received, an increase of £1,790,645. The main reason for this is that ait the beginning of tbe year there was carried over no less than £4,494,285 of moneys to be collected in respect of the year 1920-21. on? in. the arrears has been actually got in ? over from 1920-21, all have practically been got in.

Then, under ordinary circumstances, very little money comes in, but in this instance quite substantial sums were received in respect of the arrears of the previous year. arrears now? number, but we do not start the year we are now in with anything like the amount to be paid in respect of income tax as was the case twelve months ago; the arrears have, to a great extent, been reduced. arrears there will be? quite sufficient estimating as it is. One item which has assisted the revenue is the payment on account of the army of occupation £835,000; but of this we have heard a good deal, and I need not elaborate the' point. The principal decrease has come about in connection with the war-time profits tax, the estimate for which was £2,000,000, and the approximate revenue received £1,306,708, a decrease of £693,292. As honourable members know, this is a very difficult tax to administer, and it causes an infinity of trouble to finalize. The Act ceased to operate in 1919, but, of course, payments were deferred for a certain time under the measure. I hope now that we aregetting to a period when we shall be able to close up the whole of the old transactions, and to start without any war-time profits tax to confuse our figures, and cause trouble and difficulty. The next item is that of the Government Line of Steamers, the estimate in but, in the result, regard to which was £300,000; but it has not been deemed prudent or safe to. put in any approximate result at this time. The reason for this ia. that we cannot get the accounts in from Great Britain for a considerable time, and it would not do to put down a balance as a cash basis, as operations are conducted in the Treasury. That means a reduction in the ostimatc of £300,000. In the case of the Australian note issue the estimate was £1,400,000, and the approximate receipts are £1,261,482, a decrease of £138,518. A satisfactory feature about the decrease is that it indicates that the assistance which was necessary 'by way of advance during the period of war finance is gradually beginning to disappear, and it is not necessary for the banks to lean so heavily on the note fund; that is at least one healthy Are there many sign tending in the direction of deflation. their interest? merable other items, but I do not wish to weary the House. statement about sugar, directly, and I do not wish to anticipate it . The estimate of transactions for the' whole year, 1921-22, made at the 'beginning of the year, show receipts £61,787,350, and expenditure £64,104,458, a deficit of £2,317,108. The approximate transactions for the year areReceipts £64,913,085, and expenditure£65,118,265; a deficit of £205,180. Therefore, the estimated deficit of £2,317,108 has been turned into a deficit of £205,180, an improvement in the position of £2,111,928. On tbe approximate figures, as now estimated, an amount , of £6,413,147 will be carried forward by way of surplus for the present year as against an estimated' amount of£4,301,219.

To my mind, there is no justification for the expenditure of large sums of money ou the encouragement of immigration until some proper scheme of laud settlement has been devised. ^Notwithstanding the words put into the mouth of the Guveuior-Geuerd, no suoh scheme is yet iu existence. wore made between the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments for the encouragement of settlement, but the other States have not agreed to any definite scheme. Last year .large sums were spent here and in Great Britain on'the upkeep of offices for tlie facilitation of immigration. But this expenditure will not be justified until a matured policy of land settlement has been devised. Australia needs more population; but tbe first duty of its legislators is to provide for the employment and settlement of its, own people; and tc-day in the various States there are thousands of persons who for years have been trying in vain to obtain, land on which to settle. While our own rural populations are unable ito obtain tbe land that tbey need for their operations, we should not spend money to bring persons here from abroad to settle on the land. The duty of 'tbe Oommonwealth and State Governments is to see that land is made available, first, for the peopio already in Australia, and, afterwards, for immigrants. We should be able, were the right methods devised, to settle thousands of persons on the land within a very few years. Large areas suitable for close occupation are to be found in proximity to most of our cities, P] and efforts should be made to have .them thrown open .to small settlers. As it is, tbe would be settler is told to go out to the remote parts of the Oommonwealth aud take up Crown lands. If he does so, bo finds that there areuo convenient railways for the transport of his produce to market At the same time we allow the big landholders to lock up their land or to keep it comparatively unused. This state of things is detrimental to the advancement of Australia. The small man who tries to settle far from railways has'' no hope of succeeding, and when immigrants' settle under such conditions tbey in tbe Old Country, and thus prejudice Australia's reputation. If necessary, legislative action should be taken to throw opon the large estates which arc now not being put to their best use. Those whohold land without using it should be required in a young country .like this to make it available to others who will use it, and with land thus available a proper Recently arrangements scheme of settlement eould be devised which would suit the needs of our own people and enable us to absorb settlers from abroad. At the present time our railways run for many miles through land -suitable for small settlement which is not being fully used, and no attempt has been made to throw it open for useful occupation. We should say to those who lock' up their land, "" If you are not prepared to use it yourselves, you will be compelled' by legislation to allow others to do so."" immigrants on Crown lands? who havo gone into the subject know that there is very little suitable Crown land available. acres of Crown lands are available. is unsuitable, because it is far from markets, and without proper means of access. The greater part of it is at loag distances from tbe railways. Small settlers cannot succeed on such land. If settlement is to prosper, the Crown lands of Australia must be opened up by the construction of railways giving easy access to markets. Even men with a good deal of capital must fail if tbey settle .in places remote from markets.",26,Amendment

I u Queensland a Labour Government is in power. All I know is that tbe Prime Minister refused to assist the Queensland Government to raise money for tbe purpose of settling tbe Burnett lands. Mr Gullett said that that was one of the matters ia regard to which he found fault with tbe Commonwealth Government while he was in charge of immigration. The opportunity was there; but Mr Gullett says that because a Labour Government was in power in Queensland nothing could be done by tbe Commonwealth Government to help in the settlement ofthose lands. reason. the bead of tbe Immigration Department, and in receipt of a good salary; be should .know something about tbe matter, and he resigned because of the unsatisfactory manner in which tbe Prime Minister was dealing witb. immigration. view. lett was receiving from tbe Government £1,500. per annum, and I doubt whether he is getting so much now. before he resigned from the Government, service. ting half of tbe salary be was receiving from the Government, than continue in the anomalous position in which be was placed, and feeling that be .could not do justice to tbe important subject of immigration, resigned from the Government service. I urge tbe .Government first to find employment for our own people, to open up the country so that tbe Department can say to the newcomer, ** Here are 200 or 300 areas of land available for selection "" ; then select tbe most suitable type of people. Every sort of man cannot' be put' on tiie land, and' if the Government are not careful they will be importing people from Great Britain and other places who are unsuitable. Indiscriminate settlement of that kind will condemn the scheme. Unless tbe Governmenb have proper organization to deal witb the immigrants on their arrival, the whole policy is doomed to failure. Honourable members on this side of tbe House are opposed to immigration at this time of stress when thousands of our own people are unemployed. Let the Government first find employment for those, people, and if then they can find openings for others we shall assist them to* get immigrants. We agree that it is necessary to increase the population of Australia, but the immigration scheme should be placed on a sound business footing, and only if that is. done will it be possible to make a success of it. I come now to the agreement in regard to wireless telegraphy. Bub for the action taken by tbe Opposition, Parliament would probably have accepted the agreement submitted by the Prime Minister to enter into an arrangement witb tbe Amalgamated Wireless Company, regardless of whether or not tbe proposal was satisfactory to tbe Commonwealth. Honourable members on this side pointed out that the agreement was loosely drawn, and that its acceptance was not likely to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. After a good deal of debate, tbe Prime Minister agreed to refer the matter to a. Committee representative of all parties in the House. I am pleased to soy that that Committee justified everything said from this side of tbe House. It found that tbe agreement bad been loosely drawn, and bad not received that careful attention, which should bave been given to a project involving the CommonI bet be is not getwealth in an expenditure of £500,000. Whilst the Commonwealth had to find the same amount of money as tbe other party to tbe agreement, it was to receive only three-sevenths of the representation on the directorate. Everybody knows that tbe Commonwealth should bave control in a matter of this kind. It should not provide £500,000 for people who are speculating in this company, and allow them the preponderance of power. The Committee altered tbe agreement, but I believe that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) still dissents from tbe arrangement even in its amended form.

He questions whether Parliament should accept tbe proposal, but says that if the scheme is to be carried into effect tbe Commonwealth should control it. There is a good deal to be said for that point of view. But what justification is there for the Government proceeding with this agreement without first submitting it to Parliament for ratification? There has been too much of that sort of thing ever since the outbreak of tbe war. During the war period responsible government was in abeyance. decided that the Government should proceed witb tbe agreement after investigation by the Committee. I am finding fault with the House. Parliament should rise to its responsibility and insist that projects of this kind should be submitted for its approval. We could not forosco what might develop in connection with the inquiry by the Committee; yet this House' agreed that after the inquiry tbe Government, should be allowed to enter into this transaction. Whether thc proposal be good or bad, tbe proper procedure is to submit it to the House for approval. Whenever the expenditure of a large amount of public money is involved, Parliament should have the right of saying yea or nay. If that is not done, what becomes of our parliamentary system? Are we carrying out our dnties to the public if we allow the Government to expend money in this way without parliamentary sanction? We aro not. The public expect Parliament to control tbe purse; and it is not in the interests of the Commonwealth, or any other country, that Parliament should permit the Government to commit the people to the expenditure bf ^huge sums of money without direct parliamentary approval. I notice with satisfaction that at last the. government intend to do something in the provision of better telephonic and telegraphic facilities for the people in tbe f^ K' % T a n d 1 c l a i m the Opposition blazed tbe track"" in connection witb that proposal. Wbon the Estimates were before the House, I moved for the reduction of tbe Defence vote by tbe amount of tbe anticipated deficit, and I said clearly that the Labour party believed that the money thus saved could be better expended in giving increased facilities to settlers in country districts. We made it clear that suoh expenditure would provide employment, whilst also assisting primary production. At that time the League of Nations was appealing, through Lord Cecil, to Governments throughout the world to reduce their naval and military expenditures, or, at any rate, not to increase them beyond the amount expended in the previous year; but in spite of.that appeal the Commonwealth Government were actually proposing to increase tbe Defence expenditure by more than £900,000. Washington Conference. on behalf of the Opposition, that tbe Defence Estimates should be reduced and the money thus made available applied to the provision of telephonic and telegraphic .facilities in the country. The settlers out-back were compelled to wait throughout tbe war period for better facilities, and the Postmaster-General stated some time ago that 13,000 applications for tele% phone lines were awaiting attention.. In every honorable member's electorate a large number of applications for telephones are held in abeyance until the. Government can get money to proceed witb the work. If tbe Government had given bead to tbe advice of tha Opposition twelve months ago, a lot of this accumulated work could bave been done and more employment could have been provided. Ever since that time the Government bave been dismissing from the Defence Department employees who oould bave been given work in connection with the erection of telephonic and telegraphic lines in the country, and tbe total expenditure of tbe Commonwealth would not bave been in creased ; whereas the Government now propose to 'borrow £8,000,000 for this purpose. I am not finding fault with that project. Tbese works should be carried out, and money for them must be found. It is idle to talk about assisting the primary producer unless we take the necessary steps to bring them within reasonable distance of their neighbours and markets.",28,Amendment

We were told. from time to time that the Government could not secure tbe necessary material until the war was over. During tbe last two or three years, however, the material has .been available, but construction works have not been put in band. It is only because duringtihelast session tbe Labour party brought this. matter prominently before the'House, and. moved the reduction of the Defence Estimates, and also because there is a general election looming ahead, that tbe Government now seek to take credit for their intention to do something in bhis regard. Honourable members on this side of the House will do everything possible to assist tbe.

Tbe sooner tbe Government put these works in band tbe better for all concerned.

We are told that the Government are watching the matter vory closely, and that if they do not find the provisions of the Act satisfactory, they will take steps to amend them. I trust that tbey will watch the operations of this measure more' closely than they have been doing. I.believe that a considerable quantity of cheap stuff has been entering Australia, to the detriment of our own people engaged in industry. Several newspapers have commented on the attitude I have taken up in regard to this . matter; and one in Sydney last week made the statement that I advocate higher duties, that I do not really know where I stand, that I am afraid of trading with Germany, and that I am against German goods coming to Australia.

In one breath he is in favour of trading w i th every country, and on the other hand be is in favour of a Tariff that would prohibit it . Mr' CHARLTON quite simple. Before the war, we traded w it h every country and imposed a T a r i ff which we endeavoured to make adequate to protect Australian interests. We ought to protect our own industries, but at the same time we are entitled to trade with other countries in respect to commodities not supplied by Australian industry. I take this opportunity of replying to the statement made by the Prime Miuister( Mr Hughes) in. thc course of the debate on Friday last, when he claimed that Australia could not compete with the B r it is h . manufacturers because of the. cost of coal. The righ t honourable gentleman is reported to have said:How could they expect to compete end hold the markets when .they werepaying 50 per cent, and 100 per cent... more to produce au article than their competitors. Mr Charlton had endeavoured to make out that coal was cheaper here than in Great Britain. There was nothing so dangerous as a half truth. It was perfectly true that we produced best coal cheaper than Great Britain, but we did not produce^ more cheaply than Great Britain the coal which was necessary to make the coke for tbe manufacture of steel. We produced it at a higher coat, and that was the milk of the cocoanut.. The price of coal for steel purposes was 37s. 4d. in Australia, compared with 22s. Cd. in Great Britain and I3a. l i d . in America. That there is no foundation for tbe right honourable gentleman's assertion is shown by the figures furnished by two manufacturers from Greab Britain who have received cabled information on this point within the last month. Evidently some one has been "" ringing in "" a tale on the Prime Minister, and the righ t honourable gentleman has taken it for granted t h a t it is correct. He knows nothing about coal; I do. The price of Australian coal is lower than that which is being paid for British coal. of coke in New South Wales 75 per cent, The honourable member of small coal is used, and 25 per cent, of roundcoal. The information I shallquote will prove t h a t tbe small coal which tbe British manufacturers are getting at I have just made 9s. a ton is practioally dust; it is refuse coal that has been accumulated at the collieries for years past, and is of very little value; it is sold in job lots for some particular purposes, and cannot be regarded as first-class coal. Nothing but 'first-class coal oan be used for making coke. A t Newcastle the price.of round, The position is cool is 21s. 3d. per ton, and that of small coal 17s. 9d. per ton. According to the statements of the management of tbe steel works at Newcastle, the average price paid for coal is 19s. I d . per ton for making coke. Tbey are unable to get 75 per' cent, of small coal, and consequently the average cost is higher than it would otherwise be. What is the price of coal in Great Britain'? The following appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on 16th June last: During the past month Mr George Cradock, of George Cradock and Company, Australasia, wire rope importers, Pitt-street, has been in Sydney on business connected with his firm. Yesterday he passed on to Brisbane, but willsoon return. Whilst he wag here, being interested in the coal prices question, he cabled . a fortnight ago to thc Company's works at Wakefield, Yorkshire, and received the following reply:-""To-day' s prices at -works are: Shire Oakes coal, 25s.; re-heating, 32s. 6d.; boiler, 26s., .varying weekly.?' Mr Cradock explained that these quotations are for coal delivered at Me work*. The Shire Oakes colliery is 30 miles away. The re-heating coal is got from' a mine 10 miles off, and the boiler eoal IB supplied from a colliery about. 3 miles from the works. He said he expected New South .Wiales coal would have been much higher than he finds it, namely, 21s. 9d. f.o.b. Newcastle. This rate,.as it will be seen, is well below English. prices. In every cose mentioned the price is 2s. or 3s. above that of the best Newcastle. W r it in g to the Sydney Morning Herald on 17th June last., Mr C. F . Mallett says:I have been advised from London that the present prices of screened coal delivered to the principal British steel works and to the Belgian steel works are as follows:-Welsh, 22s.; Midlands, 25s.; Tyne, 17s.

I have made inquiries from the proper quarter, and have been furnished with the estimate which I have just given. The only other question with which I intend to deal ie that of invalid and old age pensions. J am more than surprised that in His Excellency the Governor-. -General's Speech there was no intimation that the Government had determined to liberalize the invalid and old-age pen.sions system. "" I do not know bow the ..aged and infirm have-contrived -to carry -on during .the last six or seven years, in view of the high cost of living. Although prices have been soaring, no attempt has been made by the Government to give them an increased allowance to meet the additional charges thus imposed upon them. Some years ago the invalid and -old-age pensions were increased from 10s. to 15s. per week; but nothing has been -done to help pensioners since prices first began to rise. The Labour party on numerous occasions have advocated an increasedpayment. We have endeavoured again and againto induce the I noticed in an article pubGovernment to take action, but bave. always been met with the reply that the financial position of the Commonwealth would not permit of an increased payment. iSix Joseph Cook, when Treasurer, told us on several occasions that he could If that is deducted from the not accede to our request because of the strained condition of the finances. While on the one hand the Government refuse, any increase, we find them on the other hand reviewing the .old-age pension payments. I am aware that, under the Act, it is the duty of the Department to review from time to time the pensions paid; I emphasize that I am not but it is very strange that it is only at this juncture that-steps have been taken to comply witb that requirement of the law. I have not a word to say against tbe omcers administering the Act. It would be impossible for ras to have a better set of officers. They are mostI would humane and considerate. Who, then, has been responsible for the action of the Department in reviewing the .pensions received by the aged and infirm? Has this action been taken by the officers on their own initiative, or has the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) instructed them that expenditure must be cut down wherever possible? I do not know who iB responsible, but I do know that the effect of t h e reviewing of the pension payments is -that in very many, cases the pensions have been reduced. It may be that in some cases the amounts have been increased As to that, I kpow nothing; but I know that reductions have been made, and I find it difficult to understand why this action should have been taken just when we are passing through a boom period. Every one knows that tihe values of properties, as compared with .pre-war prices, have increased from 60 per cent to 80 per cent class of property to which the honourable member is referring. the class of property owned by invalid and old-age pensioners. In New South Wales, since the appointment of a State valuer-general, the valuation of properties has been increased to the extent of f rom 60 per cent, to 80 per cent.",34,Amendment

162,Mr Ohaklton,"I have in mindseriously affected the position of invalid arid old-age pensioners. ' ""When we increased the pension from 10s.. to 15B. per week we did not increase the property limitation. We allowed it to remain at £50. There are many pensioners' who, either becauso. they were incapable of looking after themselves,, when tbey had a little home of their own, or for other reasons went to live with friends. Others, again, are residing in rented cottages, while many live in their own homes, and have a cottage which they rent. Their position is affected by the valuations made. If the cottage which a pensioner was renting was valued, before the war, at £300, that involved a reduction of £12 per annum in the amount of his pension. cases cottages in New South Wales which before the war had placed upon them a valuation of £300 are now valued at £500 by the Valuer-General, and this increased valuation of £200 means.a further reduction of £10' per annum in the pensions payable to,persons so situated. The position, therefore, is that while the. Government refuse to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, they are at the-same time causing to be carried out a review of the whole system which tends to further disadvantage pensioners. This review has been undertaken while the property market is booming, so that instead of getting an increasedallowance, pensioners, because of tbe greatly enhanced valuations, are suffering .a decrease. The review of the system should have been allowed to stand over' until tbe property market became normal; ber contend that things are so good that the value of property all over Australia is increasing? every one else, knows that property values increased to a very large extent during the war period. The prices 'of property and everything else "" boomed "" during the war, and much of the trouble with which we are now faced is due to that fact. gone back. been referring particularly to. the valua-' tions made by the Valuer-General of New South Wales, whose valuations are adopted by the Invalid and Old-age Pensions DeThis has partment. Tbe Department has no regard to valuations, carried out by local auctioneers or other valuers, and the re 1 stilt is' that valuations have been increased throughout New South Wales. WheneverI return to my home at Newcastle, I am met by aged and infirm people, who complain of the inroads thus made on their pensions. They say that just at a time when they were expecting the Government to increase their pensions they are having -them out down. Only last month. I received tbe following letter on tbe question:Municipality of New Lambton, Council Chambers, New Lambton, 10th June, 1923. M. Charlton, Esq., M.H.R., Melbourne. In most Dear Sir,I am directed to bring under your notice the fact that reductions have been made' in the amounts paid to a number of old-age pensioners by the Registrar of Pensions. Becently, forms were sent out by the Department requesting information as to the value of their properties, &e., which in most cases showed an increased value over previous years, accounted for by the. fact that this area is valued by the Valuer-General. Some pensions have been reduced by as much as 7s. and 8s: per week. You will readily, understand what this means to the old people in this district, and I must ask, therefore, that you approach the proper authorities with'a view to having this matter adjusted to their benefit. Yours faithfully, L. H. SHORT, Town Clerk. There is also good reason, to complain .of tbe failure ' of the Government to increase tbe amount which a pensioner may earn without suffering a reduction of his pension. When the invalid tand' old-age pensionswere increased no addition was made to tbe amount which a pensioner may earn, so that if a man earns more than £26 a year he suffers a corresponding reduction in his pension. There is .no reason why the invalid and old-age pensions should not be increased by 5s. a week. When I urged, on a former occasion, that sucb an increase should be made, I was told that the finances would not permit of it. I remind the House that our finances to-day are in a much better position than they were last year. The surplus of £6,618,327 on the operations of the year 1920-21 was paid into a trust account to provide for invalid and old-agepensions, and authority was given the Government to'.pay war pensions out of'the same fund. .When weurged at that time'",35,Amendment

168,Mr Charlton,"That is so. I havethat the invalid and old-age pensions should be increased we were told that the moneys to the credit of the fund would be exhausted in a very short time. We find, as a matter of fact, however, that there is a deficit of only £206,000 on tbe operations of tbe year just closed, so that practically tbe same amount of this purpose. alterations to be made in our defence system, largely as an outcome of the Washington Conference tbe Government will have at their disposal this year £1,750,000 more than they bad during last financial year. Tbe Government are going to borrow tbe money necessary to provide increased telephonic and telegraphic facilities to country residents; and if they out down the Defence expenditure, as proposed, by £1,750,000, they will be to that extent better off than they were last year. Tbat being so, what is there to prevent us from increasing the invalid and old-age pensions by 5s a week? Tbe reduction to be made in the Defence expenditure will practically provide for such an increase. On the 1st inst. there were 105,172 old-age pensioners and 38,941 invalid pensioners, making a total of 144,113. An increase of 5s. per week would involve an additional expenditure of £1,873,476, or only a little more than tbe amount which tlie Government will save by cutting down the Defence scheme as proposed."" In view of the high cost of living, Parliament is not justified in refusing to increase tbese pensions. I have at band tbe latest figures in regard to the cost of living. Statistician shows that last month it increased instead of decreased, and it is still increasing. increasing. cost of living last month was higher than it was in May. Despite this fact, many invalid and old-age pensioners are having their pensions reduced. Instead of cutting them down, the Government should increase them. In order to become, eotitled to a pension, a man must bave lived in this country for at least twenty years, so that tbese old people bave borne tbe heat and burden of the day in the development bf Australia. Surely it is our duty -to see that tbey are liberally treated 1 Tbe cost of living to-day is 45 per cent, more than it was in 1913. Tbat calculation takes into consideration only rentals and tbe cost pf food supplies. It has no regard to the cost of clothing, and everyone knows that wearing apparel has increased to an even greater extent than tbe cost of food. In view of the position, I money is still available for urge that the Government sliould at once As the result of the liberalize our invalid and old-age pensions system. I am as anxious as is any man that the finances of tbe Commonwealth shall be properly safeguarded, but I contend that when in order to conserve the finances of tbe country the Administration is placing the poor and suffering of tbe community in a position of want, it is showing an utter disregard of one of tbe true functions of government. It is the essence of good government to cater for tbe wants of tbe people, and especially to look after those who bave grown old and infirm while toiling in tbe interests of their country. Suoh people should at least be given sufficient to keep the wolf from tbe door. Tbey are not so provided for to-day, and I therefore move That the following words he added to the proposed Address :"" hut we regret that your Advisers have made no provision to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions."" for Defence and Health) [5.15] -In view of the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), I move That the debate be now adjourned.
