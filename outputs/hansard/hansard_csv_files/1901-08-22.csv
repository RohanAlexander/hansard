Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to an article in to-day's Age, entitled "" New Guinea Affairs,"" according to which the Premier of Queensland seems to indicate, that ordinary courtesy has not been extended to the Queensland Government by the Federal Government. This seems to me to be a matter of some importance, and I would like to hear what the Prime Minister has to say regarding it . this morning, and it struck me that I should be asked a question this afternoon, from whatever quarter the question might come. I was very much struck by this statementIf in response to repeated requests the Federal Government did not give attention to New Guinea affairs, Mr Philp said he would have no other course than to communicate with the Imperial Government on the subject. The whole of the paragraph conveys such a misleading impression that I do not think it expresses correctly the views put forward by the Premier of the State of Queensland, and until I have his assurance that it is correct I shall not believe it. The paragraph goes on to sayNew Guinea was the most important possession the Federal Government had to do with, and Federal responsibility should not be left in the hands of State Governments. The Federal Government did not assume that attitude with regard to other matters which the States might well manage themselves. This refers really to tlie proposed repairs to the steamer called the Merrie England, which has been used by the Administrator of New Guinea, in carrying out his duties. Perhaps honourable members will pardon me for giving a full answer to this question, because they are, like myself, concerned in not leaving the Commonwealth Government or Parliament under any imputation such as that conveyed. On 31st July the Honourable Mr Philp, Premier of Queensland, telegraphed to me as follows :"" It is usual custom for British New Guinea Government steamer Merrie England to receive annual overhaul and she is now in Brisbane for that purpose. This year extra special repairs costing about £1,000 are required and amount appears in Estimates of current financial year submitted to Governor General by Government of Queensland.""

In view of difficultiesfor the next five years, and perhaps, ten years, by to obtain tbe necessary authority buted by Imperial Government under lapsed ago, and I have not yet received an answer, I hold myself justified in making this long statement, because honourable members will luive noticed that there is a constant current of complaint that the Federal Parliament does not promptly answer communications. W it h reference to our undertaking responsibilities, I would point out that it is very easy to shoulder responsibility on to the Federal Government-to allow this Government to undertake those matters which are expensive, whilst the States retain those that are profitable-bu t that is a course that cannot be adopted under such circumstances as ours, when the federal expenditure is so strictly limited by the clauses of the Constitution. An HONOP.ABI.JS MEMBER -Why should we ask the Imperial Government to contribute £7,000 ? that was that the Imperial Government used to find the amount, but had ceased to do so. Honourable members will readily recognise that if the Federal Government is to observe due economy it will be necessary for it to strive against any excess over that amount, which, under the original agreement, was to be found by the three contributing States, namely, £15,000 a year. I think the other£7,000ayear is only afair contribution, and involves none of the dangers of such contributions in other cases, because the request that will ""be made, if the House agrees with me, is that the administration of New Guinea shall carry with it a control which ought not to be in the hands of the Imperial Government but in the hands of the Commonwealth. Mr F. E. M CLEAN I wish to ask the Prime Minister-because I have not had time to look into the matter myselfwhether there is not power given in the Constitution to regard the matter of the administration of New Guinea as a transferred service, and to debit the cost of ad-' ministering it to the various contributing States, without entailing new expenditure upon the Commonwealth ? I presume that the right honourable gentlemati has considered this matter and will be able to inform the House whether the cost could not be so debited ? able to go into the matter up to the present stage-and the honourable member will see that of course there might be a more settled opinion hereafterI do not see that the r 4053 administration of New Guinea could in any sense be regarded as a transferred department within the meaning of the Constitution. In that case the cost of administration would be new expenditure within the meaning of sections 89 and 93 of the Constitution, and would therefore have to be. charged, per capita, to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. In view of that responsibility-havin g communications, from a gentleman who, although a verystrong supporter of the Federal Government and a very able administrator, represents. 450,000, whilst I have to see what is the best I can do for 4,000,000I have had to hesitate.

(2) The order shall specify .such name or address and shall upon publication be of full force .and effect until cancelled by the Postmaster-General. Sir PHILIPFYSH (Tasmania) -It -will be within the recollection of honourable members that when I addressed myself to this Bill, on the occasion of the second reading, I limited my observations to its principles, presuming, of course, that upon any moot points there would be ample opportunity for debate in committee. I think we have now arrived at a stage when one -of these points of the Bill, which has been specially marked out not only by honourable members in their previous observations, -but by the petitions which we have -received from all over the Commonwealth, arises. The attention bestowed upon this matter evidences the importance which is .attached to the particular clause which now comes up for consideration. I hope that I shall be able to limit my remarks upon clauses 55 and 56-for they really ought to be read together-to a very reasonable length. Still, I trust that honourable members will give me credit for a desire to fathom the depths of these clauses-if there be any fathoming necessary-'and will .acknowledge that, if I am brief, it is not because I have anything to conceal. I wish that there shall be the utmost fairness in the debate in connection with these clauses. I have most especial reasons for wishing this. I am associated with these clauses in two forms, and, before I have closed my -observations, I may desire to refer to these forms. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN l a d better amalgamate them. honourable member pleases. I desire that these clauses shall be looked upon not only from the Commonwealth point of view, but from the point of view of the State of Tasmania, and possibly from a stand-point which may be personal to myself. They contain special provision for dealing with four different kinds of offences, some of which are new so far as our law is concerned. These portions are to be found in paragraphs a, b, e, and d of clause 55, with respect, to which the Postmaster-General seeks to have conferred upon him a special power-som e will say an extraordinary power. So far as the power is concerned, I admit that where it was exercised on a notable occasion in the old country it gave rise to considerable discussion, and very nearly ended in the defeat of a Minister of the Crown. Although there was no statutory power, this power was exercised by Sir James Graham, but it was exercised for a different purpose. It has also been exercised elsewhere. It is a power which is proposed to be given to the PostmasterGenerali n cases where there may be any suspicion that correspondence passing through the medium of the Post office relates to the promotion or carrying out of a scheme connected with any assurance, agreement, or security, or lottery or scheme of chance not sanctioned by law, or connected with the foretelling of future events, or with a fraudulent, obscene, indecent, or immoral business or undertaking to publish in the Gazette that such postal articles shall not be registered, transmitted, or delivered to the person to whom they are addressed. Clause 56 provides how these postal articles are to be dealt with, and adds a further proviso that no money orders shall be issued in favour of, or paid to, any person with respect to whom any such order is made. In support of these clauses, it is my duty to call the attention of the committee to what are the Acts under which the Postmasters-General, not only of Australia, but of other places, are acting. I shall commence by saying that in the United States, as a result of the State Legislatures finding that they had not power to stop such letters, federal legislation was passed empowering the Postmaster-General to stop them. So far as Australia is concerned, I find in Western Australia, Victoria, and Queensland, legislation of almost a similar The Minister character to that which is proposed in these",17,Paper
21,Sir Philip Fysh,"I will, if the-clauses, authorizing the Postmaster-General to refuse to deliver within his own boundaries, or to transmit beyond his own boundaries, letters addressed to any individual if he has reason tc believe that that individual is acting in contravention of the purposes of such legislation. As to New South Wales, the same purpose is secured. Postmaster-General not to deliver letters are not followed up by a similar provision in regard to their transmission, but the effect is the same. He is empowered to withhold the sending of letters posted to addresses outside that State. We have, therefore, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, four -out of the six States which have so legislated, and we have in Tasmania another State which, only in a partial direction, has -so legislated. I shall state the whole case for Tasmania, I hope, before I close. Just now I am only dealing with that legislation throughout the Commonwealth which effects this particular purpose. To a partial extent we have the same power in Tasmania. We have power to stop the delivery of letters if the Postmaster-General believes they are posted in contravention of the State legislation for tbe better suppression of gaming -and betting. It has been my duty as Postmaster-General in Sir Edward Braddon's Government to stop letters of that character, -and to return them to the senders, .with the' -official information that they were in breach who had been sending their pounds to this -of the Gaming Act. Therefore, in a. degree in Tasmania, and to an extensive degree in the remaining States-that degree being to the absolute suppression of such lettersthere has been uniformity in the past. It hus been a uniformity of purpose, however, which has not been carried out. I am not sure to what extent the setting inoperationof these Acts of Parliament induced the individual concerned to go to Tasmaniai n order to carry out his particular purpose. The fact remains, however, that we have had passed in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland measures for the absolute prohibition of lotteries and sweeps and anything like totalizators. I believe I am properly informed in saying that no action has ever been taken under any one of these Acts of Parliament. So far as "" Tattersall"" is concerned, they have practically remained simply as a signboard to certain individuals, warning them that they must not set up operations here. There has been no action taken under any of them so far as the great object against which they were aimed is concerned; but they have been used in another direction, and, I think, no one will gainsay their utility. Their utility has been proved in Tasmania as well as in the other States, in that they have given the Postmaster-General a power which The words empowering the under special circumstances he has found it desirable to exercise for the protection of confiding, weak, and silly people. When a noted tipster, to whom I have already alluded, advertised himself as a medium for conveying information to the people of Victoria' and elsewhere with respect to some coming horse-racing event, tliat man being known to the police, the fact was reported to the Postmaster-General, and this law was brought into operation to enable the Postmaster-General to advertise the fact that letters addressed to that individual would not be delivered, but would be returned to the sender. That is not the only case in which the provision has been exercised. It was reported, to me, as Postmaster-General of Tasmania, by the secretary of the department, that letters were being addressed to a certain individual, although they had every reason to believe tliat no distribution of stakes had ever taken place, and that it was time to interfere. The law was put into operation, and the unwary, credulous, and silly people man were warned by having their money returned, with an intimation that he was carrying on an unlawful' lottery. And so with respect to fortune-telling, soothsaying, and astrology; the Postmasters General of the different States have f u l l power, and have exercised it . The power has never yet been exercised, however, so far as the purpose, possibly, of these clauses is concerned-namely , the suppression of what is known as "" Tattersall."" The clauses are not specially aimed at "" Tattersall."" which the honourable gentleman refers were aimed at him. member says they were ; but they have not been utilized in that direction.

I want it to be distinctly understood. 1 am not going to say positively that it will be so, but we are empowering the Postmaster-General to exercise arbitrarily, at his own sweet will, the intention that he has and whether the present Postmaster-General has, or has not, such an intention, a later Postmaster General may have-to put in motion the machinery which will absolutely suppress "" Tattersall's."" It will stand in the way of the tens of thousands of people who have been in the habit of sending their pounds or their shillings to this particular individual. member think that will be a good thing 1 Sir PHILIPFYSH that point presently. I have some little suspicion when an honourable member on the other side, notwithstanding that he is an estimable friend, puts a question of that kind to me, that he does it for the purpose of damaging my case or my party, but it will not in any way affect the reply which I shall give. I hope honourable members of this Parliament will, if they do not know me now, know me, as time rolls on, as a man whohas nothing to conceal; as a man who tries to discharge to the best of his ability the duty before him, even though that duty may be an unpleasant one. We have had these various provisions, not in operation, but in suspense. because they were separate States, have viewed with leniency the passage of these letters, which otherwise would have been stopped from one State to the other. Four separate States have had full power to refuse delivery within their own boundaries, that power when it came to stopping letters of this kind posted to an address within a neighbouring and friendly State. They may have been influenced by the international conventions at Budapesth or Berne, or wherever the conventions may have been held; they may have been influenced by theseinternationalarrangements, and especially by the articles of the last Berne postal convention, which practically enacted that letters posted in one kingdom should pass to another. Now we have come to a different state of things. We are no longer six separate States dealing in six separate methods with postal matters. We are a Commonwealth, and, therefore, letters posted within the Commonwealth for delivery within the Commonwealth are certainly within the ken of ourown Acts of Parliament, I am not sure whether we are not going outside our powers in saying under the clause that we will not transmit. That w ill be a matter for the lawyers to decide. I am disposed to think, however, that letters posted within the Commonwealth to an address outside the Commonwealth must, under the International Convention Postal Laws be transmitted to those'places. vernment manufacturing in their legislation work for the Supreme Courtl able member may think so, but. I shall come to I do not. It may be considered advisable to make provision that while we retain the power to withhold the delivery of letters addressed to places within the Commonwealth, and their transmission from State to State, we shall not take the power to withhold the transmission of letters to addresses outside the Conimon r wealth. That will be a' matter for the committee to decide. The power of course may be taken, and I sincerely hope that at the next postal convention, which I think will be held in Rome next year, special attention will be given to tlie purpose of these clauses. It will be the duty of whoever represents the ComThe various States, monwealth there to call attention to our purpose to stop such correspondence. I hope that when the Postal Union meets in Rome next year the Commonwealth will be ably represented, and that especial attention will be given to the question whether Postmasters-General should not be peryet they failed to exercise mitted to exercise the power of refusing to transmit beyond the borders of their own country letters such as tbose which are dealt with in the clause.

It is certain, however, that the -countries which enter the Postal Union are bound by the regulations and articles -agreed upon in conference, and therefore it seems to ine that we shall be compelled to try to secure at an early date such an -alteration of the conditions as will enable us to interfere in regard to the transmission of .letters addressed to places beyond our own borders. The honourable member for Kooyong has called attention to the large number of petitions which have been presented to both Houses of the Legislature, both for -and ing clause. I believe that over 120,000 people iu New South Wales signed a petition against these clauses, and I think that over 110,000 people in Victoria'did the same. Similar petitions came from -other places within the .Commonwealth. But, on the other hand, a great number of petitions have been presented in favour of the clauses, and, though the signatures to those petitions may be fewer than the signatures to the petitions against the -clauses, the petitions have come from persons whose influence is felt throughout the -community. Much as we may respect those who from conscientious grounds object to the .retention of the clauses, we must also respect the opinions of those who desire to protect the purity of our young people from the temptations to gambling with which they are assailed. The Government, however, have decided to go .beyond the evidence of public opinion afforded by these petitions, and to accept the views which -are embodied in the legislation which has been passed by the people's representatives in a majority of the States. We find that in four of the States there is an absolute prohibition, and in one of the States a limited prohibition, of the practice which' the clauses are intended to prevent, and Ministers have therefore felt it incumbent upon them to bring the legislation of the Commonwealth into line with that of the majority of the States, and to try to prevent the transmission through the Post office of moneys devoted to the furtherance of sweeps. ' If we did not do that, we should have to say that the States have not acted wisely, but have acted hysterically, and without recognising the signs of the times. Sir Minister favour the adoption of these other clauses ? Sir PHILIPFYSH I am coming to that. Sir PHILIPFYSH The Prime Minister has already said that they are vital to the Bill. MrV . L . SOLOMON -He said that he would drop the Billi f he could not carry them. provisions in the Bill which are of vital importance, that I do not think we can drop the Bill, because, if it were not passed, against this and the followwe. should have to fall back for a period upon the varying legislation, of the States. But, if I interpret aright the expression of the Prime Minister with regard to these clauses, he considers that they are vital to the Bill. and. Telegraph Bill, unless there is a majority of the committee in favour of the retention of these clauses. Sir PHILIPFYSH I take the announcement of the Prime Minister, in regard to the vitality of these clauses, to mean that the Government will throw all the weight of its influence into the endeavour to have them carried. I do not go so far as to say that we shall throw up the Billi f they are not carried ; but I am not the Minister who is responsible for the position of the Government in such a matter. pared to accept defeat upon a vital principle? Tho Prime Minister must believe that he will carry the clauses or he would not have made the statement. Sir PHILIPFYSH I do not think he had any hesitation on the subject. I would now refer honourable members to section 99 of the Constitution Act. I refer to that provision with bated breath, because I am far from able to interpret its meaning, but I think that we can read in it the intention that our legislation should not make any distinction between Tasmania and the remaining States of the Commonwealth, even in a matter of this kind. The provision to which I refer says that Parliament must give no preference in matters relating to trade, commerce, or revenue to any one State or part thereof. It seems to me that if we passed legislation which would enable letters containing money States to be transmitted to Tasmania, and thus gave that State, a",20,Paper

In the year 1896, in association with the right honourable member for Tasmania, Tasmanian regulate and suppress public We had found in Tasmania just the same evils as are in existence all through Australia now, but we have not now in Tasmania the exposed evils which are to be seen in eveiy street in the cities in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. Actof 1896 suppressed gambling in our little tote' shops, it caused to be dragged down every public advertisement which would give offence to the most susceptible conscience. It prevented the newspapers from advertising lotteries all through the country districts, and it stopped public gambling to such an extent that if I were to take honourable members to El wick race-course tomorrow they would think they were on the lawn in some gentleman's park, and could enjoy themselves without the noise and turmoil that has to be submitted to at Randwick or Caulfield or Flemington. tend that a great deal of good has been done by the operation of the BillI have mentioned, and I join those who have spoken on the subject before, in expressing the wish that it might be possible to find Sir Philip Fysh. throughout Australia the refined conditions, and culture in association with racing that, I have lived in Tasmania for are exhibited in Tasmania. sible to suppress betting by legislation 1 Sir PHILIPFYSH I think that im Tasmania a great deal has been done bylegislation, but I am not speaking now in. the hope that the bright example of Tasdefeat.

34,Sir Philip Fysh,"The fault of naturethat has been stored in Tasmania for ages; but the metalliferous exports of that State now amount to £1,700,000 a year. Partly owing to this and partly through the excessive taxation by means of customs duties they have been realizing a surplus during the last eight years, ranging from £100,000 to £130,000 per annum. I find, however, that the Treasurer, in anticipation of the falling-off which may occur under a uniform Tariff, thinks that for the year 1902 he will not only lose his surplus of £130,000 but that there may be a deficiency of that sum in the Customs and Excise revenue. That, however, is one of the responsibilities which Tasmania has taken, upon herself in joining the Commonwealth, and our responsibility now consists in taking away from Tasmania another portion of her revenue. Since the year 1892 the Postal and Telegraph department in that State has been paying its way and the revenue has been showing a gradually increasing surplus of from £2,000 up to £15,000, partly of course as the result of the "" Tattersall"" sweep business. Under the clauses in this Bill there is very little doubt that Tasmania will be a large loser of revenue,and I think it my duty to call the attention of honourable members to the effect of their action in this.matter-to the very great financial responsibility which they incur in voting for this measure. BeforeI close my remarks, which have extended to greater length than I had intended, I would like to explain my own personal position. I suppose we all like to be regarded as consistent, but if we are true to ourselves we are satisfied, and it does not matter what any one says. I am not going to attach any very great amount of importance to what any one may think of me so long as I am satisfied with myself, but I have heard observations which I have regretted-observation s which have not been couched in the language of courtesy, but which have been, in fact, offensive. T. desire to say in personal justification that when I join a Government, I join it not for the purpose of finding out wherein we can differ, but wherein we can agree. When I -join a Government, I do it with regard to some great principle upon which I believe I may be at one with my colleagues, and not for the purpose of finding out some minor matters with regard to which I may create discord. Therefore, although I might personally like to speak for Tasmania and -to vote for Tasmania, I am true to my colours and loyal to my colleagues. A nd I hope that I shall be so in> the future, as I claim ever to have been in the past, even though I may have to make; some sacrifices. I am therefore supporting; the Bill in its entirety. -The honourable the Minister has not. answered the question I put to him w it h regard to the provisions of the Tasmanian^ Postal Act, under which he stopped andi opened letters.

The: arrangement was that all the moneys in the) shape of contributions should go to the conductors of the sweeps and lotteries by letters sent through the post. Then regulations were gazetted in March, 1897, which, empowered the Postniaster-General to stopletters which were addressed to persons, who were not duly licensed under the Act, and under this authority I stopped the letters of a man who was not licensed, and returned them to the writers with an endorsement, ""Illegal orunlicensed lottery."" These were regulations framed by the Cabinet of which the right, honourable gentleman was the Premier and I was Postmaster-General. perfectly satisfactory and accurate reply, but what I took exception to was that the Minister, in comparing the postal Acts of the different States, conveyed the impression that the Tasmanian Act contained a. provision similar to that which it is now proposed to incorporate in this Bill. Sir PHILIPFYSH I explained the difference. gather that from the Minister's explanation. When referring to this matter before, I said I would be constrained to speak, as it were, in my own defence, not because of my having anything to reply to of which I am in the slightest degree ashamed-no t that any act of mine requires to be explained, away, not that I have permitted any I act which I would not re-enact to-morrow",22,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To

38,Sir Edward Braddon,"I did nobif the occasion arose but I have to defend myself, and to defend the State of Tasmania and its legislation against misrepresentations, many of them very gross and far fetched, and against very much misapprehension as to what ""Tattersall's"" is, and as to what the action of the Tasmanian Government has been in regard to it. I may say at once that I am in no way responsible for "" Tattersall's "" being found in Tasmania, and if honourable members will bear with me I will give the history of the manner in which "" Tattersall"" came to be installed there under an Act of Parliament licensing his operations. It was while I was in England, as Agent-General, that tersall "" was brought into Tasmania to conduct a lottery called the V.D.L. An Act of Parliament was' introduced by the Government, of which Sir Philip Fysh was Premier, to permit of that lottery. '-' Tattersall"" was installed, and there I found him when I returned from England, and there were no means of dealing with him by law except by a very roundabout and barren process conducted under an Act of the time of George II. I took the whole question as to the proceedings of ""Tattersall"" and gambling generally into consideration, and faced it as a man of the world and as a man of common sense should face them; that is to say, I tried as far as possible to abolish any of those forms of gambling which are dangerous to a community, which are seductive and lead men and boys-boys more often than men to disaster and ruin. a moderate form of gambling as is conducted through ""Tattersall."" sible to say that in this form there. is any great attraction in gambling, or that there is any great excitement lead men and boys to speculate beyond their means. ciated dangers which arise from other forms. It has been said that it is possible or probable that money will be filched from the till or elsewhere to invest in tickets in ""Tattersall's"" sweeps, but inasmuch as these tickets have to be purchased with ready money it is impossible to conceive that there would be any such complete motive for theft arising from this inducement to gamble as would make a man who would not steal for anything purpose of mvectirg It is different in the case of gambling Sir Edward Braddon. through the tote shops or with the bookmakers, where it is carried on upon credit. the tote shops here. never done any business in tote shops, but I am aware that in some instances at any rate-as is the case with bookmakers-gamblin g is done upon credit.

In order that gambling Lottery. might be as far as possible extirpated from Tasmania, this Bill for its suppression was introduced. It is not a Bill that was introduced for the special object of licensing "" Tattersall's "" or any other sweep. It was submitted with a general object, and with an honest intention to do away with the more pernicious, attractive, and dangerous forms of gambling which were known to exist in the community. We knew that its operation would result in a certain increase of postal business, but does that affect the morality or otherwise of "" Tattersall's "" ? Does that alter the position in the slightest degree, unless it be in favour of the view which I takethat "" Tattersall,"" besides doing good to its own promoters, does good to the whole Government-to the Postal services throughout the States of the Commonwealth-by conButI can see no harm in such tributing largely to their revenue ?

That is one of the which might many absurd misrepresentations which have been broadcasted throughout the comThere cannot be assomunity. But there is no monopoly. If with this form of gambling honourable members will consult the Tasmanian Act, which legalizes the operation of certain sweeps under stringent conditions, they will find that there is no mention of any particular person, and that anybody, by fulfilling all the conditions requiredwhich include the lodging of a deposit of £10,000, which is liable to forfeiture for a breach of the regulations-ca n obtain from the Government, of the day a licence to carry on his sweep just as well as can or everything steal for the George Adams. in these tickets. could find £10,0001",23,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To

It is used exclusively for the sale of tickets upon sweeps.

54,Sir Edavard Braddon,"It wouldupon these clauses from various bodies, all of whom are entitled to credit for their motives. signed petitions for the retention of these clauses are actuated by the best possible motives. WhatI contend is that their motives are based upon a misunderstanding of the' subjectupon which they speak. I would point out one thing, to which I hope some respect will be paid, namely, that upon a petition presented from Tasmania there will be found tbe signature of Sir James Agnew, an ex-Premier, who I may say without exaggeration is tlie most highly-respected member of the Tasmanian com ui unity. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Ho w old is he ? some years older than the honourable member. But has age anything to do with it? This is not a weight-for-age race, or anything of that sort. This gentleman is old enough at any rate to know his own mind, and old enough also to have had such experience of the world's affairs as to lead him to take a. proper view of any question affecting the public morals or the public welfare. He constitutes practically the fourth of Tasmania's Premiers who are opposing this clause. charge of this Bill, Sir Philip Fysh is one, I am another. Sir James Agnew is a third, and the present Premier of Tasmania constitutes the fourth These are men who at any rate in their day have had the conduct of public affairs iu the State of Tasmania, and who presumably have attained to that position as the result of some merit which has justified their elevation. As regards three of them, at all events, it cannot be said that their present attitude is actuated by Cabinet considerations. Of course, the present Premier sees the wrong that would be done to Tasmania by an interference with its rights, and tlie wrong that will be done to it financially by depriving it of sorely needed revenue. We have heard that these sweeps constitute a breach of the Constitution on the part of Tasmania, Surely never in this world was there such an absurd topsyturvydom of ideas as is to be found in that statement. are invaded ? Certainly the rights of Tasmania. We have in the Constitution sections 108 and 1 IS. The former provides thatEvery law in force in a colony which has be of permitting packets to be searched when come or becomes a State, and relates to any matter within the powers of tlie Parliament of the Commonwealth, shall, subject to this ConstiI admit that those who have tution, continue in force in that State. Section 118 sets outFull faith and credit shall be given throughout the Commonwealth to the laws, the public Acts and records, and fhe judicial proceedings of every State. If it be argued tliat this is contradictory to section 108, or inconsistent with it, then the later section-118-in accordance with the uniform practice, should be deemed as having practically repealed or superseded by implication the earlier one-. It will be within the memory of honourable members that I have pointed out that one of the chief safeguards of these lotteries being carried out in Tasmania is the provision that they shall be carried on only through the medium of the post. That, as a salutary condition, has been introduced advisedly iu the Tasmanian statute. Here we are seeking, through the Commonwealth Parliament, to obtain an enactment which shall declare that which tlie Tasmanian law absolutely requires, to be of no effect whatever. The Tasmanian law says that tickets shall be sold on applicationthrough the post and only so, but the Commonwealth Government The Ministeri n would have it provided that no applications of the kind shall go through the post. If that is not an invasion, of Tasmania's statutory rights, I am at a loss to know what could, by any possibility, be so construed. Apparently, Ministers have counted heads and have found that they are in a majority, but I hope even now that their calculations as to tliat majority may be disappointed. I hope that this branch of the Federal Legislature will not pile upon the wrongs already imposed on the little State of Tasmania yet one other, against which its Government and its people have strongly protested. I hope we shall see in this matter no straining of the just powers of the Postmaster General, no straining of the power of the Government of the Commonwealth, no violence done to the ordinary law as to the carriage of letters as it prevails in England. I hope we shall have none of these things, even though they purport Whose rights to have thousands and thousands in favour of them, when only hundreds and hundreds, perhaps, are petitioning against them. We have no warrant whatever for any interference of this sort in the English law. The English law gives no power beyond that",25,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To
55,Sir Edward Braddon,"He isi t is reasonably suspected that they contain contraband articles. The Ministeri n charge of the Bil l has pointed out the ruin which occurred to one Minister of State-for it meant ruin to his political career-by his contravention of the unwritten law that postal communications intrusted to the State shall be held inviolate, and their secrecy not interfered with. W ill it be reto consider that relevant section-109-of membered that, after all, tbe Post and Telegraph department is nothing but a common carrier-the servant of the public-for the carriage of letters and telegrams ? Do not let us give to it authority that would be unwise in any case, that would be wrong iii any case. Do hot let us follow these most dangerous models, and inflict upon a State, that might receive generous consideration at the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament, a wrong which it should not be called upon to bear. Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) I think honourable members will admit that the case for Tasmania has been placed before them ' in a very able and complete manner, partly by the Minister in charge of the Bill-wh o performed the duties assigned to him in a very fair and impartial way and still more so by the right honourable member for Tasmania who has just resumed his seat. I desire to take this opportunity of congratuhiting that right honourable member on the very clear and exhaustive manner in which he stated the case for Tasmania. am sure the people of that State will have no reason to regret the action of the two honourable members who have to-day placed that case before the committee. I think that the representatives and the people of Tasmania may not only expect generous consideration at the hands of this House, but that they will receive that generous consideration. In a case of this momentous character, if there are any reasonable doubts about the propriety of proposed legislation . which would affect the small State of Tasmania, with its limited representation, this Federal Parliament w ill give tliat State the benefit of the doubt, and will pause before launching upon any legislation which might prejudicially affect her, and as to the constitutionality of which there are any substantial doubts. The honourable member, Sir Edward Braddon, has, to the very best of his ability, and as ably as any representative could possibly discharge the task, placed before the committee what he considers the constitutional right of 12 I 2 Tasmania. He has also placed before us what he believes to be the moral and political aspects of the case. Dealing first with the constitutional aspect, which 1 venture to submit is one of very grave importance, I would point out to the right honourable member that, whilst drawing attention to certain sections, he has omitted the Constitution Act, which provides that where the law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail. I presume the right honourable member will admit that the Federal Parliament has been assigned f u l l and complete control over Postal and Telegraph departments. These departments, and the powers involved in them, have been transferred freely and voluntarily by the States to the Federal Union. There is no qualification whatever in that transfer. There could be hardly any doubt, even assuming that we had no constitutional precedent or authority to guide us in a question of this kind, that the transfer of the power over Postal and Telegraph departments necessarily conveys within that transfer the power to decide what shall be carried as mail matter as well as what shall not be carried as such. If it was intended to confer upon the Federal Parliament a limited or a restricted power, then such limitation or restriction would have appeared on the face of the federal I instrument. But there is no such limitation and there is no such restriction. Nothing of the kind was even contemplated. The grant of power over postal matters conferred upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth is as clear and as unqualified as a similar grant of power under the Constitution of the United States of America. cause of the non-inclusion in the Constitution of Australia of certain sections which to some extent tend, although in a minor degree, to limit the power of Congress over some subjects. This question has been fought out and has been practically decided . under the federal constitution in the United States. I should like to remind the right honora""ble member for Tasmania who has just spoken: that many years ago the Federal Congress of the United States, in the Reserve Statute No. 3894, passed a law to this effectNo letter or circular concerning lotteries shall be carried in the mail oi the United States, and",26,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To

This was embodied in the Federal Act of 1876, and confirmed by the Federal Act of 1877. A short time after the passing of that Act a man named Jackson was prosecuted in the courts on the charge of having deposited in the federal mail postal matter contrary to the Federal Act. He was convicted and sentenced to a penalty. He applied to the Federal Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus to be brought up, in order that the constitutionality of that federal law should be decided. reported in 95 United States Reports, page 132. Honourable members who care to follow this subject further will see the arguments exhaustively described there, and the judgmenta most elaborate judgmentgiven by Mr Justice Field, which wound up with this passageThe court has no doubt whatever as to the constitutionality of this law. That precedent may be fairly accepted as a guide to us in considering the question whether we can legally proceed to carry a law of this kind. That, however, was not the only law relating to lotteries passed by the Federal Congress. Later on, we find tliat several Bills of an amending character were brought in in order to deal with what was known as a growing evil, in the shape of the Louisiana State lottery. That lottery had been legalized partly by the State of Louisiana; partly it was legalized by an Act of State legislature, and, afterwards, it was legalized in a still more remarkable manner by being embodied in the State Constitution itself. It became such a great curse and a nuisance that public opinion throughout the whole of the United States was roused to a tremendous extent, and it led in a measure to the passage of anti-lottery laws throughout America. It led to a further agitation for an extension and amendment of the federal law in order to cope with this terriblecurse. Accordingly, the federal law was enlarged for the purpose of giving the federal postmaster power to direct the local postmasters throughout the United 'States to stop the delivery and the transmission of mail matter' relating to lotteries and gambling schemes of the kind referred to. Mr G. passed in contravention vention 1 Sir John Quid: to that point directly. I am dealing now with the constitutional aspect of the subject. Congress on the 10th September, 1890, passed an amending law to meet an evasion of the previous federal law which had been broughtabout in this manner : The previous federal law had provided for the stoppage of mail matter addressed to the manager of the lottery. The manager of tlie lottery got over that law in a rather remarkable and astute manner. I am drawing attention to this point because there is an imperfection The case is in this clause which will have to be remedied if it is to be rendered workable-. The manager advertised that all lottery matter, letters, and circulars, should be addressed, not to himself personally, at New Orleans, but to the manager of the National Bank at New Orleans. That was done. Letters began to pour in on the manager of the bank in hundreds and thousands, and the law was practically evaded. The federal authorities proceeded then to stop letters, circulars, and newspapers so addressed. What happened then 1 The manager of the National Bank applied to the Supreme Court for an injunction to restrain the federal postmaster from proceeding to stop his letters, on the ground that the federal law did not authorize it to be done. The injunction was granted, and' so the federal law, by reason of that imperfection, was rendered practically abortive. Congress then proceeded once more to tackle the question. As I have said, in September lS90.it passed an amending Bill, providing that letters and circulars relating to lottery matters, whether directed to the managers, or the principals, or the agents, or the representatives of such lottery schemes, should be stopped, and should be dealt with hy the federal postal authorities. That law is now in force in the United States. It has never been challenged. The result was that the State lottery of Louisiana, which had been a terrible scourge to the community for a quarter of a century, was finally and successfully suppressed. Out of the 44 States of America in 1890, no less than 42 had passed local laws for the suppression of lotteries and schemes of that character. I think I have shown the constitutionality of this proposed law. I would now like to draw attention to the second B. EDWARDS -Was tliat law branch of this matter which should be conof the Berne Considered, namely, whether this Parliament",27,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To
58,Sir John Quick,"That was not conought to interfere in the manner proposed, and whether it is desirable and right and proper to interfere. I certainly do not think that this Parliament ought to interfere in a matter of great importance involving the interests of a State unless tliere are very strong reasons indeed to justify sucli intervention, but I submit that there are very strong reasons indeed why the proposed law should be passed. We may look first not only at the state of public opinion throughout Australia, but also at the public feeling in those great kindred -communities across the sea, the United States of America, where the people are so profoundly impressed with the terrible evils associated with lotteries and schemes of that character that they have been constrained to pass restrictive legislation. We ought to regard that as a very strong argument in favour of our acting similarly. First, .speaking of the state of public opinion in Australia, 1 would direct attention to the circumstance tliat, although in the Bill before us the marginal note suggests that this clause is taken from the law of Queensland in 1891, it was passed almost word for word by the Parliament of Victoria in 1883, when I had the honour of being a member of the Legislative Assembly. The provision was brought in by Mr Kerferd, the Attorney-General of the Sendee Administration, on account of the terrible growth of sweeps and consultations in the City of Melbourne. The evil had attained such terrific magnitude that the newspapers unanimously joined in the demand for its suppression, and great credit was justly due to the leading newspapers of Victoria for the stand they took, because it involved them in a loss of revenue to a very large extent. The Victorian Parliament almost unanimously passed the clause which is now introduced in this Bill. gambling in consequence 1 Sir JOHN QUICK of fact, that these sweeps and consultations which were rampant in the city were driven out of Melbourne to a large extent, and then found a resting place in other States where there was no law against them. The law that was passed in 1883 in Victoria was re-enacted in 1890, and so satisfactory was tlie operation of this legislation found that at the conferenceof Deputy Postmasters General held in 1891, at which the whole of the Australian States were represented, it was agreed that it was desirable that legislation for the suppression of lotteries should be made uniform throughout the whole of the States. I present that as a very striking testimony in support of the proposed legislation. A few monr.hs after this conference, Queensland engrafted on to her statutes the Victorian clause for the suppression of sweeps and consultations, but unfortunately only granted a permissive power to the Postmaster-General, which was not exercised for some time. In 1893 New South Wales passed a similar law, and in the same year Western Australia passed an A ct of like effect. So that then we had four out of the six colonies brought into line with an almost uniform law-unifor m with the exception of the words ""prohibit transmission,"" which it was found necessary afterwards to insert in ,the Victorian law in order to enable the Postmaster-General to prevent the transmission as well as the delivery of lottery matter. The New South WalesA ct is similar except that there is no power to prevent transmission, but substantially the four States were brought into line. Although no similar clause was enacted in South Australia, there is nevertheless a very strong anti-lottery and anti-gambling law in that State, which has been enforced since 1875. Mi-. V . L . SOLOMON -And a legalized totalizator to counterbalance it . Sir JOHN QUICK I do not wish to discuss the reasons why South Australia did not pass a clause similar to that in force in other States. Probably the spirit of gambling was not so strongly developed there as in the other States. When the lottery promoters were driven out of Victoria they found refuge in New South Wales, where they carried on their business successfully for a considerable time, until the New South Wales Government brought the law into operation against them. Then they were driven out of New South Wales and I think, as a matter took refuge in Queensland, until the law was brought into operation rigidly to the extent of driving them out of that State. I believe they afterwards tried to find a resting place in Western Australia without success, but in 1896 negotiations were opened up with the Government of Tasmania in order to enable them to obtain a footing in that State. We have had a very interesting historical explanation as to the circumstances under which the law was passed in Tasmania which has enabled these",28,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To
59,Mr Higgixs,"Has there been any lesssweeps and lotteries to carry on a flourishing business. Reference has been made to the financial aspect of this matter, and to the loss which it is believed Tasmania will suffer if this law is passed. But I would like to point out to the honourable members for Tasmania that the revenue they are deriving from "" Tattersall's"" sweeps is not obtained from a normal source, and that neither is it a natural nor a legitimate source. ""Tattersall"" has been driven out of four'of the States, and has found a comfortable home in Tasmania, where he is able to defy the law of the other States, and to furnish Tasmania with an illegitimate and unnatural source of revenue, which is really a cancer in the midst of the community, and which makes Tasmania occupy the'unfortunate position of being practically the Monte Carlo of the Commonwealth. should think the people of Tasmania would be sufficiently high-minded to deal with this matter from a loftier stand-point than tliat of the revenue tliat will be lost as the result of bringing this law into operation. For the sake of s£15,000 a year are they content to stand pilloried in tlie eyes of the world as giving a refuge to this .pernicious institution which has been kicked out of all the other States1 able member kick the bookmakers out of Victoria1 be said about bookmakers, I consider, in dealing with the moral aspect of this case, that more evil will flow to the homes of the people and to the youth of Australia through these lottery systems than will result from direct betting or gambling. No doubt direct betting has its evils-and its calamities, but this Parliament has no control over that kind of gambling. Our present concern is' whether the Federal Parliament, having authority over the Post-office, should allow it to be made an agency for facilitating forms of gambling which, in the opinion of the greatest judicial authorities in the world, and in the opinion of some of the greatest statesmen in the world, ought-not to be sanctioned by the State, but ought, if possible, to be put down. There are special reasons why this form of gambling should be prohibited, and there are certainly strong reasons why the Commonwealth should not allow the Poskoffice to be made use of for the purpose of circulating correspondence and information relating to this most pernicious evil. In the interests of the community generally, and of the young people of Australia in particular, and in deference to the growing feeling throughout the world that gambling ought to be put down as far as possible, we ought to give the power sought in these clauses. In connection with this matter, I desire to quote the opinion of three eminent Judges of the United States with regard to this matter. Mr Justice McGloin, of the Louisiana Court of Appeal, in January, 1S92, uttered these remarkable wordsThe honour of Louisiana is, to an extent, the honour of the entire union ; the welfare and purity of one State is a matter of vital interest to all the States. A vigorous enforcement of existing postal laws bearing against all lotteries, supplemented by other legislation closing to them the express service, will go far towards protecting the other I States against a corporation, which is a confessed pirate, a wilful violater of every law. Now let me apply to my honourable friends from Tasmania the words of this Judge and say that the honour of Tasmania is to an extent the honour of the entire unionI would appeal to them to join with us in endeavouring to suppress an institution which is calculated to bring dishonour and discredit upon the Commonwealth. are clean themselves they will have a better right to ask Tasmania to stop the sweeps. Sir JOHN QUICK I also desire to quote the words of Mr Justice Grid, who 1 in the case of Phcden v. Virginia 8. Howard, 163, saysExperience has shown that the common forms of gambling are comparatively inocuous when placed in contrast with the wide-spread ""pestilence of lotteries. The former are confined to a few persons and places, but the latter infest the whole community ; it enters every dwelling ; it reaches every class; it preys upon the hard earnings of the poor ; aud it plunders the ignorant and the simple. These are not words from the platform, but a judicial utterance from the bench. In another case, Stone v. Mississippi, United States Reports 101, 818, Chief Justice Waite said :Lotteries are a species of gambling, and wrong in their influences; they disturb the checks and balances of a well ordered community. Society built on such a foundation would almost of necessity bring forth a population of speculators and gamblers, living on the expectation of what, by the casting of lots or by lot, chance or otherwise, might be awarded to them from the accumulation of others. Certainly the right to suppress them is governmental, to be exercised at all times by those in power', at their discretion.",29,Langdon Bonython Doe S The Orders Which Could Not Be Transmitted To

62,Mr Cameron,"When the other StatesWhen one of the amending Bills was before the Federal Congress Mr Moore of New Hampshire said:Many of bhe States, by statutory provision, produring tlie discussion in the Parliament of hibit lottery advertisements and prohibit lottery agencies or the sale of lottery tickets, and subject the offender to fines from $50 to $2,000. Many, very many, of the best newspapers in the land refuse to become parties to this scheme of obtaining money by false pretences, aud refuse bo advertise lotteries, and advocate bhe j ustness of tlie people's cause in excluding from the mails papers that do advertise lotteries or lottery drawings. I regret to Say that the district of Columbia, the scat of the Government of this nation, has failed to provide necessary legislation to prohibit the carrying on and advertising this worse of all classes of gambling, and in consequence this city contributes, as I am advised, about $1,500,000 annually. Tlie immense wealth accumulated by this Louisiana State lottery has enabled it to control almost everything in Louisiana. Finance, politics, morals, seem to be controlled by this power, and to oppose it, particularly in New Orleans, secins to be fatal. If we should be disposed to believe editorials appearing in the leading New Orleans papers lately, we would be convinced tliat lottery money was used very largely to elecb governors and legislatures with a view to control legislation. I am advised too bhab nob long since, almost wibhin bhe shadow of bhe dome of bhe capital of this nation, a well-known gentleman of this city gave a dinner to a number of distinguished gentlemen, and when the wine flowed freely one of the speakers of the occasion took the opportunity to put all parties upon notice that if there was any legislation permitted at this session of Congress antagonistic to the interests of the Louisiana State Lottery the company would see during the next campaign that any member favouring such legislabion should be relegated to bhe shades of private life. If this be true it is quite apparent that bhe Louisiana Sbabe Lobtery is nob only in bhe business oi making statesmen, but when necessary is disposed to engage iu unmaking them. The good people of bhe State of Louisiana are making an honest, honourable, heroic effort to purge the State of this plague bhab has for bhe pasb twenty years been a blot upon the good name and fame of her people. Let us stand up and be counted as friends of the United Sbabes; wocannob afford bo longer remain a sileub partner. Tn similar words, I ask this Parliament to assist Tasmania as a partner in the Federation to abolish this growing lottery evil, and to remain no longer a silent partner. I feel assured that'as a similar evil grew in Louisiana to such an extent that it was like a huge octopus having a grip of the entire State, until suppressed by federal law, so in course of time this lottery, which has been established in Tasmania will, if not suppressed, become a similar huge incubus controlling largely the political and municipal Government of that land. It is most undesirable that any State of this union should become subject to the domination of any particular institution of this kind. I need not refer to what took place Queensland in 1895, when a desperate effort was made by those representing the Tasmanian Lottery Institution to secure u reversal of the repeal of the law of Queensland. We do not wish any such influence to grow up in connection with our Legislature. We want the atmosphere of our political and State life to be free from the, blighting influence of an institution such as that aimed at by clause 55 of the Bill. almost every honourable member agrees with, what has fallen from the lips of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo with regard to lotteries. We recognise that it is a great misfortune, indeed, that gambling should exist in any State. I am quite sure-, that the great bulk of honourable members do not wish to encourage that evil in any way whatever. The only point of difference which there may be between us, as far as I can judge from the general tone of the debate, is as to whether such a proposal as is now under consideration ought to be introduced into a Bill of this kind. Even if we think it ought, there is a question as to whether our power to legislate upon it does not conflict with the law at least of one of the States. If we study the Consti"" tution Act, we shall find that however right, it niay be that the various States shall give us power to regulate the moral affairs of the community, no. such power has really been given to us. That being so, the question arises"" Ought we in this Bill to seize upon an opportunity to regulate as far as we can the character of the matter transmitted through the post""? If we can accomplish that object without interfering with the privacy of the Post-office, I am sure that all of us will be only too glad to do so. We should be glad indeed to exterminate all baneful influences to the community. It is with great diflidence that I speak upon this question, because I cannot help recognising the difficulty -with which we are confronted. Personally I have never attended horse racing, nor have I invested in "" Tattersall's "" sweep. I have no sympathy with either. But the point is that the various States have not given us power to legislate for the suppression of gambling.

70,Mr Henry Avillis,"It is the opinionlaw. All that was said by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo goes for nothing. We should like to suppress gambling, but this Bill will not do it . That is the point at issue between those who believe in these clauses, ""and those who believe that such legislation will be inoperative, and will result only in the evil being shifted from one State to another. The totalizator exists in South Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, and elsewhere. The people indulge ""in this innocent form of investing money by which it is possible that they may gain a large reward. We find also that some of the people who sign petitions in favour of these very clauses themselves promote art unions, raffles, and other games of chance. Notwithstanding these petitions, we find also that the people are in favour of what we should not leave to the States they call innocent forms of gambling -the raffle, the art union, the totalizator, and the lottery. They are not opposed to a game of chance. it in every department of life, and i i i every institution it is resorted to. By every post we receive intimations that an art union is to be held to raise funds for a hospital or something of the kind. From one end of Australia to the other the people are in favour of lotteries. What they are opposed to are the evils which follow the laying of large sums of money with the bookmaker or with the welsher. honourable and learned member for Bendigo quoted an American authority, who described gambling as a great evil. To tell us that is only to repeat a platitude. We all know that it is a"" great evil. I myself am as strongly opposed to gambling as any honourable member of this House. I have never once taken a ticket in ""Tattersall's"" sweeps ; never once have I registered a bet with a bookmaker ; seldom have I been to the race-course, and I have been in Melbourne on Cup day, and have yet stopped away from the race-course. I merely mention these matters in order to show that I am not here to advocate the claims of the bookmaker or the promotion of gambling. My desire is to prevent gambling if possible. This measure is not, however, a sincere one. It is proposed for the purpose of enabling the Postmaster-General to pry into the private correspondence of individuals. The privacy of a man's household and his correspondence will be invaded under this Bill, if he chances to be labelled as the promoter of a sweep. Even a letter from his child will not be sacred ; it may be torn open by the Deputy Postmaster General and returned to the sender, although the honourable and learned member for Bendigo seemed to dispute the power of the Postmaster-General under this clause to open such a letter. I am of opinion that a man's correspondence should be delivered to him whether he calls himself "" Tattersall "" or any other name. It does not concern us whether Tasmania will lose £14,000 a year by the adoption of this provision, or whether other States will benefit to thatextentbytheexcisionoftheclause. What we have to consider is whether the clause has any right in the B ill ; whether it is the duty of this Parliament to administer the laws of the several States, or whether the administration of their own social laws. If they allow any of those laws to become a dead letter, it is no part They practice of the dut}' of the Commonwealth to enact a provision such as this, which will have the effect of enabling the Commonwealth to administer the laws which the States themselves are unable to, or do not administer. What we are called upon to do, according to the title of the Bill, is to enact a law relating to the Postal and Telegraph service of the country. To that extent I am prepared to vote for it, but not The for the purpose of establishing a code of morals, and enforcing them upon the people in the way indicated by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and the Minister in charge of the Bill. Eveni f we shut out ""Tattersall"" from Tasmania there will be the same amount of labour to perform in the administration of the Post-office as we have to-day. The only difference will be that we shall lose an amount of postage, estimated at £14,000 a year, which will go either to the French at Noumea or the Germans at Samoa. What good can come from the enactment of this clause? We have the authority of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo for saying that such a provision has not lessened gambling in Victoria. We have the statement of the Minister that it has not lessened gambling in any other State. The passing of this clause will not tend to lessen gambling, and we have no right to introduce it in a law of this character. The constitutional aspect of the question has been referred to. It seems to me that that matter might be left to Tasmania. That State will very soon see whether we have the power to pass this law or not. If we allow the delivery of all these letters, as we are asked to do by the people and by the States themselves, we shall discharge our duties faithfully and well. ""We shall be exceeding our powers in passing this clause for the purpose of suppressing what is said to be a form of gambling, when the Minister himself has failed to show that it would have that effect. We are asked to enact a vexatious, inquisitorial, and meddlesome law, which will not raise the moral condition of the people; and while the honourable and learned member for Bendigo urged the committee to vote in favour of the retention of this clause, I just as strongly beg the committee not to pass it. If we do, we shall be violating the privileges of the people. We have no right to interfere with the private relations of individuals. When we take a man's correspondence, and waste-paper basket, we exceed our duty. 1 represent a very large part of this Commonwealtli, and the people of my great constituency have to a large extent expressed their opinions against the insertion of this clause. No reason has been advanced for its inclusion in tlie Bill, and I shall therefore be her Sbabe rights in. this matter. vote for its excision. that no honourable member"" of this committee would advocate gambling. We are all desirous of abolishing it, but we want to see its abolition accomplished in a reasonable way. far as I could gather from his speech, is in a rather peculiar position. We know that as a member of a Tasmanian Government he introduced the Tasmanian law known as tbe Suppression of Betting Act. In that Act provision is made for putting down betting in public places and within buildings, and among other things it is enacted that, under certain conditions and circumstances, lotteries inay be conducted. A regulation was framed under that Act which legalized what is generally known as "" Tattersall's "" in Tasmania. The Minister who has given effect to alaw of that character in his own State must indeed be in a rather awkward position when he finds himself called upon here to support a Bill for bhe wiping out of that very Act. I oppose this clause on two grounds. The first ground is that I consider that to pass it would be to override the Stabe rights of Tasmania. It has been argued otherwise, very ably I know, but I do not intend to involve myself in a question of tliat kind, because I know there are legal authorities in the committee who could twist me round their fingers, so to speak, upon that particular point. But even if we have the right to legislate in tlie way proposed, we should consider whether it is expedient bo exercise that light. When I was stumping the country in support of the Commonwealth Constitution Bill, it was pointed out to me again and again that certain clauses in it gave extraordinary powers to the Federal Parliament. Following the cue given by the leaders of the movement, I invariably replied that it was safe to presume that its administration would be placed in tlie hands of reasonable men. Instead of that being the case, it seems to me that we are going to verify the doleful predictions of the anti-Billites; that we are going, at the very toss it into the oubset of our federal career, to raise a hornet's nest about our ears. Tasmania is a small State. It was induced to enter the Federation in the belief thab it would be better for it to be inside the union bhan oubside; bub we propose at the very outset to set at defiance what Tasmania conceives to baken up by bhe Premier of Tasmania and obhers who ought to know something of the views of the people of that Sbate. I regret that this step has been taken, because those The Minister in charge of the Bill, so who advocated the acceptance of the Commonwecalbh Constitution Bill, in New South Wales were continually told that they were doing a wrong thing. It seems to me that, instead of going along without any friction, we are endeavouring to create strife, and to keep olive the enmity of those who opposed the Constitution Bill. It seems to me that section US of the Constitution has a very strong bearing upon this question. It provides, in effect, that the Commonwealth shall give f u l l faith and credit to the laws and public acts of the different States. We now propose to do indirectly thab which we have no direcb power bo carry oub. We intend to exercise our powers in the direction of prohibiting portion of a Tasmanian State law. This is an attitude which I cannot understand, and to which I am not going to subscribe. It has been clearly indicated by the Premier of Tasmania that he intends, if we pass this clause, to test the validity of our act in the",32,Honourable Member The N By Enact Legislation Of The Character Proposed

Are we going to wait for the settlement of this question by the High Court, or are there any other means of determining it ? but Tasmania will. in which to place a State? Surely we should be chary in passing a provision of this sort, which creates causes of appeal, before we have established the High Court. If we are serious in our opposition to gambling, surely tliere must be some other way of preventing it than that of turning the Post-oince into an engine for its suppression, and interfering with the rights of private individuals. In 1893 a PostalA c t was passed in New South Wales, which gave the Postmaster-General power to open letters addressed to any individual who was suspected of promoting or carrying on a sweep or a lottery, and I hold in my hand three packets of letters which I have been told on reliable authority were illegally opened under tliat Act by various Postmasters-General of that State. I have compared the addresses on many of the envelopes with the addresses published in the Gazette in accordance with the Act, and I find that in some cases they do not agree at all. More than that, there have been instances in which letters addressed to guests staying at Adams' hotel, and '-in one instance a letter addressed to Mrs. Adams, were opened. On one envelope the sender took the precaution to write, "" Not referring to consultations,"" and signed his name, which was that of a well-known Sydney man; but the postal officials, nevertheless, tore open tbe envelope to examine the contents. In every case the envelopes had printed on the face of them the names of the firms from which the letters came. business letters, in some cases containing invoices or accounts, in other cases communications of a strictly confidential nature, and the opening of them meant that the contents became known to persons to whom it was highly improper that they should be known. any one has shown a knowledge of their contents? system in vogue in the department, for the officials to learn more than the addresses and the signatures of the letters that are opened. fact beyond the bare word of a gentleman in whom I have every reliance. I have been told, too, that there is reason to believe that, in some cases, money was abstracted from tlie letters; at any rate some of the senders asserted I s that a fair position that they had contained money. The bundles which I have here do not contain all the letters which were opened, which number nearly 2,000. Some of the letters were sent to the dead-lettpr office, a thing which was never contemplated by the Act, and kept there for the usual time before being opened. Thirty-five letters sent by the Dairy Produce Company were opened, though the name of tlie firm was printed on the envelope. Twenty letters from Holdsworth, Macpherson, and Co. were opened. addresserl ? Tattersall's Hotel,"" which was not the address prohibited in the Gazette.

Fifty-six letters from Rowlands, crated water and sodawater, manufacturers j 30 letters from Marshall's Brewery; 23 letters from MeLelland and Stewart, printers; and 24 letters from the Bank of New South Wales were opened. There is one letter in the package which was sent by a firm of solicitors, and refers to a banking transaction of a most confidential nature, but it was opened in the Post-office. Sixteen letters from John Dtght, produce merchant, and 60 letters from the Fresh Food and Ice Company, were opened. Naturally a man who was keeping an hotel would have a number of letters from firms of the sort: They were purely but that consideration did not prevent the postal officials'from ruthlessly opening them. Now we are asked to allow the Deputy Postmasters-General of the States to pry into the private correspondence of individuals.

I am not prepared to say whether these petitions were got up voluntarily, in the way that the supporters of the clause claim in connection with their petitions, but I can assure honourable members that there is a very strong feeling in New South Walesi n favour of ""Tattersall's"" sweeps. I could quote at considerable length from the press, and I have here a passage from an article in the Melbourne Argus of 2nd July last, which, I think, is worth reading. I may say that the newspapers which are advocating the continuance of "" Tattersall's "" sweeps are not trying to prove tliat gambling is a moral thing. The Argus saysThe true policy just now is to avoid frictionto get the Constitution into force with as little irritation of individual States as may be consistent with a broad conception of national obligation. There will be plenty of time to deal with all touchy and contentious questions of this kind. There will be all the time to come. Continuance for a while of the present relation of the Postal Service to sweep business in Tasmania will not be a dire calamity, nor will it prejudice action at a more favorable opportunity. A little humouring of particular States at the outset may be a wise concession to the union we all desire to see peaceably and thoroughly developed. Tlie Melbourne Age says Mr G. B.

110,Mr Clarke,"No, I would leave theefieot of reversing the present postal laws in the majority of the States. States to deal with the question of gambling as they think best. I know the States have no power to deal with the postal laws, but if they are opposed to betting or gambling in any form they have the power to legislate within their own parliamentary dominion. I think the amendment which I have outlined would leave each State the power to legislate as it likes, but, of course, it could not deal with the Post-office, which is under the control of the Commonwealth. The amended Postal Act, dealing with the suppression of gambling, was passed in New South Wales in 1S93, when Sir George Dibbs was Premier, and Mr John Kidd was Postmaster-General. Sir George Dibbs has signed the petition which I presented the other day against these two clauses, .and Mr John Kidd, who is now Minister for Mines, ;ind who was the Ministeri n charge of the PostalA c t which prevented Tattersall"" from longer carrying <! on in New South Wales, also signed the petition. I do not know what reason actuated these gentlemen, but I know it has been stated over and over again tliat the passage of that Act was one of the greatest mistakes the New South Wales Legislature ever made,because it was impracticable by such a clumsy and iniquitous method to put down gambling. "" Tattersall"" was driven to Tasmania. honourable and learned member for Bendigo ventured to say that gambling decreased after the year 1883, when the anti-gambling legislation was passed in Victoria. It may have been lessened, and I will admit that since the Amended PostalA ct was passed in New South AValesi t put down a lot of unscrupulous people who were endeavouring to promote sweeps, and who ought not to be trusted to hold £5,000 or . £6,000 of public money. In Tasmania, however, the public .are safeguarded by the State, because the sweep promoter has to deposit a certain amount of money as a guarantee, and everything is run as fairly as possible. Even before that legislation was introduced it was known that the sweeps conducted by Mr George Adams could always be relied on, and that they were conducted in a fair way. I believe Mr Adams is a man who could not be dishonest if he tried, but, of course it does not follow that other sweep proI would leave the moters would be the same. There are many other evils besides gambling which we might desire to put down. I do not think that the controlling of those evils is facilitated by these clauses. lottery? least object. It has been suggested that the State control of these matters would form a source of revenue for the payment of old-age pensions. It is a most extraordinary thing that many clergymen-gentle men for whom I have the very highest respect-hav e signed a petitionin favour of this clause, whilst in their own churches they tolerate bazaars for raising funds. I have gone to bazaars very frequently. I attend them with the knowledge that I am going to be fleeced for a certain amount. I spend as much as I intend, and come away quite happy. I do not object to that. It is an easy way of raising money for charitable purposes. AlthoughI have a very great respect for the opinions of gentlemen of the cloth, I was rather surprised to get a printed article with the name of the Rev. H . AVorrall attached, in which he is alleged to have said that ""Tattersall"" had amonopolyin Tasmania. Honourable members know perfectly well that the Tasmanian Act is not confined to ""Tattersall."" Any one who chooses to conform to the conditions prescribed may do so. It may be a monopoly, because the I do not think so. The public have faith in Adams. Buti t is not a monopoly in the legal sense, or in the sense that any one else is prohibited from conductting a sweep there if he so wishes. The Rev. H . Worrall is credited with sayingWould you view with favour a huge jam monopoly, sending through the streets of every village in Tasmania its hirelings with petitions to the Federal Parliament to continue such a system V You know you would not. Then one marvels that this State is wicked enough or insane enough to support by a numerously signed petition a ""Tattersall's"" monopoly when ib shrinks from any obher monopoly.

I see that that is so. I am very glad that I have been put right on that point, as I did not wish to assume an attitude which was incorrect. I do not wish to 'delay the committee at greater length. I quite understand the desire of the Government to secure uniformity in a matter of this sort. A t the same time. I cannot help thinking it is most unfortunate that in their endeavour to bring about that uniformity they will certainly arouse the hostility of many people in Tasmania. I am sure that no one is more sincere than is the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr name have not been so foolish as to tell the Piesse, in hisdesiretodo away with gambling, but behind all this we have the most serious question of State rights to consider. AlthoughI believe we may have the power, technically, to pass this particular clause I consider it will breed discontent and dissatisfaction in Tasmania, and that it is contrary to the wishes of a large number of people in other parts of the Commonwealth. feel that I cannot support this clause as it stands, because it would override State rights. I feel strongly that we are proposing to give to the Postmaster-General power to find a man guilty of committing an illegal act when we have no actual light to pass such a law. In New South Wales, where the postal authorities have had full power to stop letters addressed to ""Tattersall,"" there is a feeling of dissatisfacadmitted that Adams' sweeps are the fairest tion in regard to this proposal. I feel very stronglyon the subject myself. Why should we thus interfere with the rights of an individual, when there is a belief on the part of the people that lotteries should be permitted 1 Money is raised for charitable purposes by the very system which we are now proposing to prohibit. I cannot but think that the Minister in charge of tlie Bill intends to give us a very free hand, inasmuch as he has said that while he is faithful to the Government in supporting this clause, honourable members must feel the responsibility of their vote. I should certainly feel it a great responsibility to vote for what I consider is an interference with the liberty of the subject. Although there has been this prohibition of lotteries in various States, we find that they are still conducted at bazaars and charitable gatherings. They are very prevalent in New South Wales. I recollect a bazaar promoted by a very large church in Sydney, at which they not only conducted lotteries, but had the "" three thimbles and pea,"" and various games of that kind going on. Another religious body, more particular in their actions, decided to wait on the Attorney General, Mr AVant, and to ask his permission to conduct a lottery at a bazaar which they proposed to hold. The deputation pointed out that a lottery was being conducted at a bazaar then being carried on' in the city. Mr Want's reply was""The probability is that those who are conducting the lottery at the bazaar you Attorney-General that they are committing an offence against the law. If you had not told me that you jn'oposed to do the same I dare say tlie police would not have interfered, but in view of what you. have said, I will instruct the police to arrest you if you violate the law at your bazaar."" These lotteries are being countenanced by church authorities, and those whom we are led to believe entirely oppose gambling. We allow .bookmakers to lay the odds ; we allow the Victorian club in Melbourne and Tattersall's club in Sydney to have public betting rooms, where men can sit up until all hours of the morning and gamble; where the odds are called, where cash betting goes on, where the wildest system of gambling is privileged, and yet we propose to put down a system of gambling that is admittedly fair and above board. It is carried on. The prizes are distributed all over the country. We hear of a sailor somewhere out at sea or a man in the back blocks, who could have had no possible connection with Adams, receiving a prize of £400 or £500. I know of a cabman who received £1,000 from ""Tattersall "" as a return for an investment"" of 10s. The people can put a small sum of money into "" Tattersall's "" sweeps and be sure that the prizes are fairly distributed. I cannot see why we should try to crush out this form of gambling when we permit the other systems to which I have referred to remain. It has been said that some of the petitions in favour of ""TattersaH"" are bogus ones. AVe",39,Honourable Member The N By Enact Legislation Of The Character Proposed

I am in favour of those sweeps. They provide a very honest system of gambling, and it should be the last to be suppressed. I deplored the driving of Adams' sweeps out of New South Wales, and I am going to vote against this clause, which will probably drive "" Tattersall"" into New Caledonia or some other island. I nave seen his sweeps working in Tasmania, and I know of no Statei n the Commonwealth where racing is carried on upon purer lines. I know of no race-courses where you get fairer and more liberal odds than those of Tasmania, where the totalizator is allowed. I should not like to say that the whole tone of racing there is above the level of the sport in New South Wales or Victoria, where Ave liave race . clubs equal to any in the ""world, but at the same time there is a strong * feeling in Tasmania that by means of the totalizator the people obtain the most liberal odds.

I cannot understand some of the votes given by this committee. I was really very sorry last night, Avhen, as the result of the action taken by the Opposition, a majority of the committee refused to prevent the passing through the post of papers containing seditious and blasphemous matter. I think it Avould be very much to the advantage of the community if they Avere not alloAved to be distributed. Although honourable members are prepared to pass legislation Avhich will have the effect of wiping out the best and most honorably conducted lotteries, they are Avilling to permit bookmakers to continue to folloAv their avocations, and to alloAv still more dangerous systems of gambling to exist.

It seems to me that, when the B ill was being framed, those responsible for it had in their minds a picture of Adams preparing for his next Melbourne Cup Consultation. I know that advertisements come from Germany and other places to induce people to subscribe to lotteries there, and if the people are foolish enough to subscribe to such institutions outside their own country, I do not'think we should interefere with them. to make a speech on this subject, as I believe that every honourable member has decided how he will vote.

The great danger is that by means of the post, and by means of regulations, we may practically create a "" boss "" for Tasmania. AVe may be creating here in Australia what has been found so dangerous in America, in the shape of men who can practically sway the Parliament and the destinies of a particular State. I have no hesitation in supporting the power proposed to be given to the Postal authorities to interfere with the transmitting and delivery of letters to any sweep promoters. I might say that I have looked at the Act and the regulations which have been passed in Tasmania, and they seem to me to be remarkably lielpful to one man. In the Act of 1896, bookmakers are actually forbidden to ply their trade on the race-courses, the Commonwealth the result will be that and the small sweepstakes promoters are also just as effectually crushed out of existence. allow only a man with a lot of money to carry on sweepstakes, because it is provided that a deposit of £10,000 must be put down, and tliere are, of course, very few men who can possibly comply with that condition. I do not understand how two Houses of Parliament in a free State could ever have consented to pass such a Statute, and to approve of such regulations. I do not suppose that the Premier of the State at the time, who has spoken with such fairness and honesty here to-day, had any intention to help any particular man, but those who have been working 12 K 2 the oracle have been much too cunning culated to throw the whole of the gambling in Tasmania, and the greater part of the gambling in the other States, into the hands of one man. I have a statement here, and I would like to know whether it is true, that there was a large public meeting held at Hobart, at which resolutions were carried against ""Tattersall's"" sweeps, and tliat no regard to that meeting.. want to know who owns the newspapers in Tasmania. I do not desire to make any statement upon rumour, but it seems to me to be a most remarkable thing that a meeting of citizens in a free town like Hobart should pass important resolutions, and that there should be no reference to it in any of the newspapers. The newspapers are free to do what they like, but I should like to have the matter explained. It is not because I simply dislike betting that I am going to vote in favour of these clauses. I do not claim any virtue for it , but I hardly ever go to a race meeting, and I never invest in sweeps, nor do I ever bet. It is not, however, because of that, that I am voting in favour of giving the postal authorities the power that is now being sought, but because I think that we ought not to allow the Postal department to be made the means of giving one man, or even several men, so much power. I do not see that Tasmania is going to be much injured by what is now proposed, because, assuming that Tasmania is strongly in favour of retaining lattersall's"" sweeps, which I regard as very doubtful, our legislation must be uniform, if we have it at all. If we have uniform legislation throughout we must permit the transmission and delivery of these letters throughout all the The Act and the regulations States, and I am quite sure that if Mr. Adams had the choice of all the States he would not remain long in Tasmania. If the effect of our uniform legislation should be that the law now in force in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales is to no longer have effect, Mr Adams would no' doubt very quickly move to one of the big centres. He might feel grateful to Tasmania, and he might remain there for a a few months, but he would not allow his gratitude to interefere too much with his interests. I think there has been too much made of State rights in connection with this question. There is not the slightest doubt that, looking at section 51 of our Constitution, and comparing it with the corresponding States trol of the laws for the peace, order, and good government of Australia with regard to postal communication, may say what matter post. The honourable member for Cowper whose speech we all appreciated for its candour and honesty did not see how he would infringe upon tbe rights of other States in connection with his proposed but I think that he must now understand what the effect of it would be. At the present time under the State laws, in Victoria, we have power not merely to prevent the delivery of letters, but also the transmission of letters from Victoria. the honourable member's amendment is carried, Victoria will lose her right to prohibit the transmission of letters to Tasmania, otherwise Tasmania cannot have the power which her representatives say she requires. Now, I ask why, if the other States do not wish to transmit letters, Tasmania should compel them to do so. The question is not one of interfering with the freedom of Tasmania, but one of Tasmania wishing to interfere with the freedom of the five other States. I feel that I shall not be regarded as supporting these clauses for any bigoted reasons. I am convinced that cash betting is much better than credit betting, and that when a man sends his money to ""Tattersall"" he parts with his cash and has done with it. There is, I admit, much more danger to a man in the midst of the excitement of a race-course, because he is often induced to bet on what he conceives to be a "" dead bird "" and then has to find the money to pay for his bet. I have known men, under excitement, when they thought they had a chance of making something, they could not reasonably afford, and there is no doubt there is an immense temptation sort of gambling. member has put it, it often means trying to pay a debt of honour by incurring a debt of dishonour. On the other hand, eveiy one does not bet with bookmakers, whereas there are many women and children who use Tattersall's sweeps who would not think of approaching a bookmaker. I do not know whether Australia has a national vice, but if she has, it is that of gambling. Mr Higgins. know of anything that is eating so much into the vitals of our people as the vice of section of the United gambling. People say that our gambling Constitution, we, having conpropensities are a sign of the excellence and the energy of the breed. I like speculation and enterprise and energy, but I like to see it exerted in the proper channels. At shall be carried through the present the energy of the race is being frittered away in a direction that leads to no profit, but involves a great deal of unhappiness and often ruin. The man who goes in for betting makes nothing and produces amendment, nothing, but it is simply a matter of passing money from one pocket to another. I doubt very much whether clause 55 will be effective to prevent "" Tattersall's "" sweeps from being carried on. We are all anxious to make our legislation effective, but If this clause is copied to a large extent from the Queensland Act, which has never been tested, and I think we ought to put the matter more shortly and clearly, in the same way as we have done in regard to various matters in the Customs Bill. The first paragraph is only and deliver these aimed at direct betting, and the second is aimed only against promoters or entrepreneurs of lotteries, and paragraphs (c) and (d) do not touch the matter at all. I should like to see the clause framed in this way : Thati f the Postmaster-General has reasonable grounds to suppose any person to be engaged in receiving money as contributions or subscriptions towards any lottery or scheme of chance, he may prohibit the transmission of letters addressed to such a person. It may be said that we must make exceptions, as some lotteries are already allowed by law. I am sorry that art unions ai-e allowed in connection with our churches, for instance. But I do not see that we are unduly interfering with the rights of Tasmania by adopting the proposals contained in this Bill. On the to bet to an extent which contrary, if looked at from the proper standpoint, it seems to me that Tasmania is attempting to impose upon the other five in connection with this States the duty of delivering and transAs one honourable mitting matter of which those States do not approve. If there is any need for a further examination of what has been done in America under very similar circumstances, I may point to a passage from a recent book on the Constitution by Randolph Tucker, who, on page 567, saysCongress has passed an act, amended in 1890, I do not prohibiting the conveyance of obscene matter through the mails. In the case supra, the Supreme Court decided that Congress can regulate the that convention any obligation on the entire postal system of the country, and may part of the Commonwealth to transmit designate what shall be carried in the mail and what shall lie excluded, and punish the deposit letters. in the office of any such matter as is prohibited sides it will be seen that we are not enacting by the Statutes mentioned. And further decided a stupid and nugatory provision. If we that the object of Congress was not to interfere make this clause efficient, we shall be able to with tlie freedom of the press or any other rights say not only that we will not transmit letters of the people, but to refuse the facilities of the mails for the distribution of matter deemed inwithin the Commonwealth, but we shall be jurious by Congress to the public morals, but that able to bring pressure to bear upon the transmission of such matter so excluded in any Ministry not to sanction an obligation to other way would not be forbidden. AlthoughI am not in any way a Letting will thus be seen that the argument tliat by man, I should be the last person to be a the adoption of these clauses we shall merely party to enacting a law which prevented a compel ""Tattersall"" to move to an adjacent person from making a wager.

163,The United Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"debate, as far as it was important, would take place upon this particular clause. I want to say again, as I said last night, that I do not see any analogy between the position of a newspaper, aud that of a letter. One is carried under certain conditions of cheapness. It is open at both ends, it is not a sealed document. Any one who desires that it shall be sealed can have it so by paying the proper postage. \Te have to analyze this clause before we can really discuss it. In the first place, it opens up the question of State service and the limitations of State service as compared with Other powers of government. place, we have to deal with the powers of -the Federal Government as contrasted with a government under a system of unification. Then we have to deal with the position of a State whose rights may be overridden by federal legislation, and overridden in a matter in which the Federal Legislature has no power. We also have to consider, as far as I can see, the question of whether-even if we have a right to do this-it expedient thing to do at this time in our constitutional position. to see whether this clause is effective at all, because honourable members will notice that in sub-clause (2) the words are introduced "" not sanctioned by law or an unlawful game,"" whereas those words do not occur in sub-clause (1). I understand that it is the second sub-clause which practically deals with Tattersall's. -apart that this clause will have to be re-drafted unless we are to be guilty of legislation which will practically create litigation for the High Court. honourable member is desirous that any Bill should emanate from this Parliament which, so far as the wit of man can make it, is not so clear as at any rate not to invite litigation in the future. regard to the question of the Post-ofhce as a State service, it is in exactly the same position as any other service in which, for general purposes, we are to carry out a commercial undertaking. in essence, no difference between the postal service of the Commonwealth and the municipal service of watering the streets. stead of each man watering before his own door, the municipality takes up the work for the general public, and each man pays bis fee. I am absolutely and unalterably against the use of any service of this kind Sir Will iam in order to promulgate morals in a community ; I am absolutely against anything that will trench upon the inviolability of a sealed letter in the Post-office unless in the case of crime. It is all very well to talk about the dangers of betting, and the evil done to the community. As the honourable member who preceded me said, this matter of betting is eating into, the vitals of the community. No man feels more strongly than I do that this is in some respects a particularly objectionable kind of betting, inasmuch as it is not like a vice In the next which affects a man in mature life. This is a vice which gets hold of the women and of boys in offices, and no doubt leads to an enormous amount of fraud. The whole of Sydney is one vast tote shop at the present time. I do feel that it is the greatest evil-and I say that in order to make my position perfectly clear-with regard to the social life of the Australian community at the present time. But I do is an not believe in absolutely violating the very groundwork of the Post-office itself, in order Finally, we have to prevent that evil to some extent. Suppose the Post-office was in the hands of private individuals, would any man allow a private carrier to interfere with his private correspondence 1 It is not so much a matter of dealing with this particular man ""Tattersall,"" or with his particular system, but it is the evil of the system Therefore it seems to me which is created by the machinery of this from all the other argumentsBill. At the present time there is a very great feeling in various parts of Australia in regard to the power of the Postmaster General to interfere with the sacredness of I am sure that no letters. Strong as my feeling is in regard to this question, I say it is a still greater evil to abnegate the real principle which lies, at the bottom of our postal service. The department is no different from the railway With service. If we send a parcel by rail from one part of Australia to another, has any one the right to inquire what is in that parcel, except perhaps for the purposes of the Customs% There is practically, the community 1 going to say it is dangerous to the community t were a passenger by the train he would like some power to exist to stop the carriage of McMillan. dangerous parcels.",45,Honourable Member The N By Enact Legislation Of The Character Proposed

We have to deal with a very peculiar position. The individual States had a right to use their postal service ""in order to carry out effectively the law of the States upon this subject, and the very fact that in most of the States these letters were allowed to go to ""Tattersall"" in Tasmania is -clear proof that there was a moral feeling that while they stopped the delivery of letters of that kind to addresses within their own boundary, they had no right to do so in regard to letters to be transmitted to any other State. When we decided to become a united Australia there was an original compactI do not say in this instance a legal, but an implied compact-that the rights and privileges which the States retained should still be retained by them without any interference, -until they themselves relegated those rights to the Commonwealth. uniformity of legislation 1 going to do a wrong in order to obtain uniformity of law t I will allow for the sake of the argument that five-sixths of all Australia are in favour of suppressing ""Tattersall's"" through the Postal department, but are we going to ride rough-shod over one State, because we have a majority in the other Statest Would not that be an absolute contravent i on of the principle of federation ? What is the very principle of federation ? Isi t not that in regard to matters of legislation which each State retains to itself, it shall not be interfered with, and that it shall do what it likes in regard to them ? handed over absolutely to the Commonwealth. handed over as a service of the State; but the difference between the Post-office as a service, and the power which we possess under this Bill, in regard to currency, for T h a t is example, is very clear. Of course we must have a power to enact legislation to carry out postal arrangements, but that power must be exercised within the provisions of the Constitution. It seems to me an idle argument to quote the general powers we possess under the Constitution. The Constitution Act provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of tlie Commonwealth. "" Subject to this Constitution."" Then the contention comes to this; that under a mere machinery Bill we can enact indirectly a law which we have no power to make under the Constitution. If we do it in this case to what extent can we not increase our powers ? I know that I am speaking to-night under a heavy disadvantage. 1 am speaking probably against the uniform consciences of a great many of the best people of these communities. I know that I am speaking to-night against the opinion probably of the ablest lawyers in Australia. I will allow that if the United States of America have the power to pass such a law as this the Commonwealth Government have the power to do the same. I should like to draw the attention of honourable members, however-and I speak with great diffidence in a matter of this kind-to the fact that from the time of Chief Justice Marshall to the present day there has been A r e we a system of gradually enlarging the powers of the central Government in the United States. While I admit that the ablest lawyers of America have declared emphatically and without reserve that this clause can be put into a Postal Bill, still I do not think that, from a legal point of view, we have a right to take all United States judgments as guiding us. Above all things, in the starting of a Constitution like this, in a matter in which State rights are affected, I say most emphatically that we should look, not merely to.the legal view of the question, but to the moral position of the whole affair, and as to the way in which we ought to » deal with a question like this, connected as it is with the different States. We are told that this sweep system ""can be suppressed T t is even if it is legal in the States.

The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr tions'. W ill any one tell me that there is Piesse, shakes his head. I feel certain, however, that it must give rise to a great deal of debate and a great deal of suspicion as to the real meaning 'of the whole clause if, in the very sub-clause which is supposed to deal with this matter, there are words introduced which evidently make the provision nugatory. Have the Ministry simply drafted a clause which apparently justifies what they call the public conscience, and which perhaps satisfies a majority of their followers, but which they see, with an inner meaning, will be absolutely nugatory when they try to deal with the particular evil which is supposed to be aimed at ? I think we ought to have had a clearer exposition from tlie Ministeri n charge of the Bill with regard to this particular matter. I quite feel that there is a very strong argument in relation to this clause as to the provision in the Constitution which says that all laws must be equal. But is it not a curious argument in the mouths of those who are willing to argue, first, that the thing has no own purposes, elected to deal with them riglit to be done, and, secondly, that the Commonwealth Government have got absolute power in the matter? It seems to me a most immoral thing to attempt to argue that, because we want to create uniformity of law, we must do a rank injustice to one of the States of the Commonwealth. We will have to abandon the question of uniformity rather than do one tittle of injustice to any State of Australia. Are we going to open this Commonwealth life of ours by litigation on the part of Tasmania with the Commonwealth Government? Are the people of that State going to say that one of their clearly ascertained rights of legislating on matters which they have retained to themselves, and which honourable members, who are in favour of this clause, admit are not Government, has been violated ? The honourable member for Ballarat will allow, as a constitutional lawyer, that we have no riglit to pass any law at the present time dealing with lotteries. If we have no power to deal with this subject, how are we going to take The n I that power for granted ? We are told by honourable members that the Postal department having been handed over to the Commonwealth, the Government have the supreme! and only right to say "" we will carry letters, papers, and everything upon the conditions that we set down."" But they must be common-sense business condiany difference between a State service like that of the railways, which may some day be handed over to the Commonwealth, and the State service of the Postal and Telegraph department, always allowing that we make restrictions in regard to crime ? There is no difference whatever. Furthermore, when these six States handed over this particular service to the Commonwealth, they did not hand over the machineiy for the creation of morals, or machinery which, in an underhand way, would enable legislation on subjects which were confined to the States. They handed over simply the service of a common carrier, to be carried on upon commercial principles. be found in the Constitution ? mon decencv. not because there were State laws regulating lotteries, or because the State, for itsthrough its Post-office that a system of espionage over certain letters came about ? When the various States said to their Postal departments"" We will give you the power of a common carrier, but we retain to ourselves the right to legislate in regard to lotteries and games of chance,"" surely there was a divorce between the two conditions. If "" Tattersall's "" was allowed in three of tlie large States of Australia, would the Government have introduced these clauses into the Bill? If they would not have been put in under such circumstances, what right have we, under the Constitution, to pass them when one State allows "" Tattersall"" to carry on his business within its borders and five do not ?

Sir control of the Tariff is a matter absolutely taken over by the Commonwealth. But, by passing these clauses, we are trying to override, in an indirect way, the constitutionally expressed desire of the people of Tasmania. Much as I deplore tlie evil of gambling, even if I admitted that the power to pass legislation such as we are now passing, had been handed over to us under the Constitution, I would say tliat, as a matter of common-sense expediency and fairness, we had no right to perpetrate an injustice to any State of the Commonwealth. Although honourable members may confront me with the judgments which have been given in America, and may be perfectly satisfied that, as a matter of dry law, I a.m wrong, that is my opinion. we do to Tasmania? We treat that State in the same way as the other States are treated. trying to exercise a power which belongs to the States alone, because it is not comprised within the 39 articles of tlie Constitution. Furthermore, I am absolutely against the violation of the secrecy of sealed packets, except for the detection of crime, and I believe that honourable members may yet see that there must be fresh legislation to prevent that which may grow into an intolerable injustice. have no patience with honourable members who would not concede to others the right to hold a different opinion upon this question from that which they hold, and I hope that I shall say nothing which will indicate that I consider that I alone am right in this matter, and every one else wrong. It is a question upon which we may fairly differ, and we should each be ready to give others the fullest credit for their sincerity. The hist speaker and other honourable members seem to imagine that by passing these clauses we shall violate the State rights of Tasmania; but when the Constitution was accepted Tasmania handed over her State rights in the Post-office to the Commonwealth, and now, with regard to that institution, the only rights are federal rights. JOHN' FORREST -Tasmani a has a federal matters one State must give way to the majority of the other States. nation. Parliament is under obligation in such matters only to a majority of the people of the Commonwealth. If Tasmania has rights in this matter, so have tlie other and larger States. Before federation they had the right to frame postal laws affecting lotteries, and they did so. They said, through their legislation, that they would not allow lotteries to be carried on by means of the Post-office. The other States have as clear a right to prohibit the carriage of correspondence relating to lotteries as Tasmania has to have it carried. That being so, surely the majority must rule, and four or five of the States have already determined that they will not allow the Post-office to be used to facilitate gambling transactions. If the State rights of Tasmania are to be admitted, a wrong must be done to every other State. I We are am not prepared to concede tliat Tasmania has any State right to which the rights of the other States must give way. The laws of the Commonwealth must be uniform. The provision which we are now considering was never intended for the suppression of gambling. All we are asked to say is that the Post-office shall take no hand in the distribution of correspondence relating to gambling transactions. The whole question is whether we have a right to say what matter shall pass through the Post office of the Commonwealth. If we have tliat right, we can determine what shall or shall not go into Tasmania, just as we can determine what shall or shall not go into the other States of tlie union. Under the Bill, Tasmania would have just the same rights as the other States, and she cannot claim more. If she is given the same rights as the other States, I cannot see that any injustice is done toiler.

I desire to say a Avord or two as to the way in Avhich petitions against the clauses Avere signed. We Avere told by some honourable members, Avith quite a flourish, that some ministers of religion had signed these petitions. Unfortunately, that is too true, but it is not true that these ministers, for the most part, signed them knowing Avhat they meant. They did so under the belief that we Avere going to take power to open anybody's and eA*erybody's letters for any purpose whatever. Here is a clergyman, the Rev. William Wall, of Redfern, Sydney, AVIIO saysAfter carefully reading the heading of a petition to prevent such legislation being enacted as would empower the postal authorities to interfere with the privacy of the post, there being nothing to lead me to suspect that the petition aimed at obtaining the free run of the postal seiwice for f ambling purposes, I signed it. I Avas thus eceived and assisted what I do not approve. The Rev. Ebenezer Price, of Granville, Sydney, secretary of the Evangelical A l liance of New South Wales, saysI was led to sign a certain petition against clauses 54 and 55 'of the Postal Bill now before the Federal Parliament on the ground, as told meby the person soliciting signatures, that the proposal was to give the Postmiister-General and his deputies the right to open private letters.

I never heard of security of this kind being required from any one in a matter of this sort before, and if sweeps .cannot be carried out except under such conditions, the State should certainly have nothing to do with them, because the effect is to set up a monopoly which, in my judgment, is injurious in the highest degree to the State in which it is carried on. Going back to the constitutional aspect of the matter, I submit that Tasmania is simply being asked to fall into line with the majority of the other States. she is being forced. tlie honourable member can put it that way, but the alternative would be to force the other States to adopt the same view of the matter as Tasmania.

We cannot have perfect legislation, but we can only achieve a rough approximation in these matters. If the legislation that has been passed in a majority of the States has done ""Tattersall"" no harm, why should he be kicking up all this bother to-day and getting up the present agitation? This is not the first time that an agitation has been got up by ""Tattersall."" We have realized that ""Tattersall"" is a great power in the country, no matter where he happens to be, and I frequently used to hear from him in an indirect way. One of the things that surprised me most in connection with this matter was the statement that Mr John Kidd, who brought in the B ill that was intended to prevent the transmission of sweep promoters' letters in New South Wales, should have signed a petition in favour of the elimination of these clauses. I have my gravest doubts as to whether that gentleman deliberately signed the petition knowing what he was signing. it with very great pleasure. all the more dubious as to whether he have twitted him with having signed the petition, and he did not deny it . hear it .

I believe in the rule of the majority, and as Tasmania entered into this bargain knowing that she must absolutely surrender tlie control of the Post-office to the Commonwealth, she has no right to turn round now and complain that we are filching away from her any of her State rights. She can do as she likes so far as her gambling laws are concerned, and she can carry on ""Tattersall's"" still.

215,Mr Isaacs (Indi),"To my mind byfor a, ftabeaa cmpiis in regard to three gentlemen who were endeavouring to promote lotteries in Alabama and Louisiana, and who -objected to have their matter stopped by the Postmaster-General of the United States, the Supreme Court was moved to declare that it was unconstitutional legislation of a similar character to this. What were the .arguments used? Every argument which has been advanced by the honourable member for Wentworth was put forward there as -clearly as possible by the learned counsel for thepetitioners. They urged that directpower was not given to the Congress, that it was invading the reserved powers of the States, and that if Congress were allowed to legislate in regard to matters in such a way as to affect the powers reserved to the States, it would be unconstitutional. But all these arguments were answered in the way in which honourable members have answered similar arguments here. State, namely, that of Louisiana. that one State to dominate the rest 1 Was the power of the Congress to be curtailed because some reserved powers were retained by the States? The answer given by the -courts, 1 think, has set the matter at rest as -far as the United States are concerned for ever. Chief Justice Puller saidWhen the power t'o establish post-offices and post-roads was surrendered to the Congress it was as a complete power, and the grant carried with it the right to exercise all the powers which -made that power effective. It is not necessary that Congress should have the power to deal with crime or immorality within the States in order to maintain that it possesses the power to forbid the -use of the mails in aid of the perpetration of -crime or immorality. Later on, speaking about the circulation of newspapers, he saidThe circulation of newspapers is not prohibited, but the J&overnment .declines itself to become an agent in the circulation of printed matter which it regards as injurious to the people. In these few words lies the whole kernel of the matter. The Commonwealth of Australia is now established. The question of the postal facilities has been removed entirely from the purview and control of any individual State, and it was a mistaken argument to use in a Federal Parliament-and it would be futile if persevered in-that we are to regard States as States when we are considering the exercise of our federal powers. When we are legislating, I trust that we shall hear nothing of State rights, and nothing save in respect of the welfare of the people of Australia as a whole. I do not go so far as the honourable member for Parramatta, who says that we are to consider what is best for the majority absolutely, and to disregard the welfare and rights of the Tasmanian people because they are in a minority. understood the honourable member. But I say that, in federal jurisdiction, States are not to be considered at all but the individuals who comprise the Australian nation. The honourable member for Wentworth said that, from the time of Chief Justice Marshall up to the present, the Supreme Court had gone on enlarging the sphere of the American Constitution That is not quite accurate. The Supreme Court of the United States had several stages in its construction of the Constitution. A t one time it took the national construction, at others it Here was one took the narrow or State construction. If Was it had adhered to the broad construction right through I believe that the tremendous calamity of the Civil war would have been averted. It was the narrow State construction, combined with the fatal principle of State rights dominating the Federal Legisature, which brought about that terrible conflict which cost* the nation millions of lives and of treasure a startling example In that case the Chief Justice said from the bench that no black man had any rights which a white man was bound to respect. But in some of the States the change of feeling within a 1 few years was so great that black men were actually making the laws which white men were bound to obey. I do hope that we shall not start by fettering our federal powers, and that we shall insist that we have those powers if we think it expedient and just to tlie Australian people to exercise them. The next question is"" Isi t expedient and right "" 1 So far as I can see, I think it is in the highest degree expedient that we should support the principle embodied in this clause. I know of no influence more subtle or insidious or more destructive to industrial habits and industrial thought, and to the conservation of national energy, than the spread of the gambling spirit. I think that we ought to be at one in endeavouring, if not directly to suppress it, at all events in refusing to aid the dissemination of materials by which it is propagated and",52,William Mcmillan I T Is Not To Consider Is Whether As A Matter Of Public

But I hope that the honourable member will find himself in a minority, which will satisfy the people that upon the whole the Federal Parliament is united upon this matter. But I can assure the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr themselves to pass through the sameCameron, that we are not in any way weakening the rights of Tasmania. This Parliament, while assenting to tlie position that a State has a right within its own limits to restrain, repress, or regulate vice or immorality, or what it deems to be such, always has the power within those limits which our Constitution has confided to it , and, in regard to those subjects intrusted to its care, to say that it does act for the peace, welfare, and well-being of Australia. In doing that it will not infringe directly or even indirectly upon State rights. Before the Federal Constitution was framed the Statesi n their various Acts of legislation undoubtedly touched in one instance or another upon various points of policy. It was impossible for the State 'to pass any one Act without affecting the people within its limits in various directions, either in social or inquestion. dustrial life. possible for us to pass legislation without -affecting, in many directions, what may be called State rights. That is not a reason, however, for abstention. should simply have to postpone all legislation because it affected some existing legislation within the States. through exactly the opposite reason. existence is that we are to legislate not with a view to preserving existing legislation in any State, but to make it uniform throughout Australia. While we have a few irregularities here and difficulties there, we must consider what is, on the whole, the best for us all. Not only'do I heartily support the clause as it is framed-and in that I do not speak of its drafting, but of the principle which it contains, because I think its form is susceptible of some improvement but I would willingly support the Government or any honourable member who chooses to move, in going even further in the same direction. United States and it seems only a logical, conclusion-no t only do they forbid letters, postal cards, and circulars concerning lotteries from being transmitted through the post, but they go to the root of the matter and say that advertisements inviting attention to these tilings shall beprohibited from passing through the post. That is only right. Why go only to thelength of prohibiting all response to such invitations, and yet allow the invitations, channel 1 The evil is greater when you allow requests to pass unchallenged through the post, and then proceed to stop thetransmission of replies. To make the matter complete,. we ought to prohibit to the same extent as letters, the transmission through the post of newspapers which contain advertisements asking the people of Australia to do what this Parliament thinks, inadvisable in the interests of the nation. Mr G. B. EDWARDS'(South Sydney).. -We have had to-day one of the most interesting debates which have yet taken place in this Chamber. The tone of the debate has been very high indeed, and theopinions on both sides have been admirably expressed. I think it is safe to assume that there is a very general recognition of the right of honourable member's to differ on this, Honourable members who haveI n like manner it is imspoken on one side have conceded an equal, right to those on the other to put forward, the opposite view. The view in opposition to the adoption of this clause has been putI f it were we very ably. Indeed, when we look at thespeeches of the honourable member for Wentworth and of the two honourable gentlemen who spoke at the outset of this debate, we must confess that it would not be possiblefor a case to be put in a more able manner.. In the two last-named honourable members, we had a peculiar combination. We had. in them two representatives of Tasmania, who as members of the State Ministry were responsible for ""Tattersall's"" beingbrought into existence there. We have had certainly a most extraordinary exhi. bition of what is now known through out Australia as the "" Yes-no "" policy from the honourable gentleman in charge of the. Bill. It was almost impossible to tell what attitude he would take up in respect of these clauses, but it gave me a certain amount of satisfaction to find that in the end, and for very good reasons, he decided In the to stick to them.

223,Mr Isaacs,"The very reason of ourhad the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddona case of arcades ambo-bot h having been responsible for the initiation of "" Tattersall's "" sweeps in Tasmania. The right honourable gentleman, who first opposed this clause, put the case for Tasmaniai n the best way possible from that point of view. I am proud of being a Tasmanian, and as a Tasmanian, continuing to have an interest in Tasmania which I hope to hold until I die, I can see there is a view for that State to take up in regard to this clause other than that put forward by the right honourable member, Sir Edward Braddon. He seemed to take up tlie position that there was a strong desire on the part of the people of that State to retain their powers and privileges in this respect, and that it was an invasion of their rights for the Commonwealth to destroy the permission given to ""Tattersall."" to carry on business there. As a Tasmanian, I think it would do more honour to that State, and redound more to her moral and material welfare, if she joined with the other four States of the Commonwealth which have already passed legislation on this subject, and expressed a wish to have done with this things once and for all, now that we have an opportunity of getting rid of it . The right honourable member says that he was acting as Agent-Generali n England at a time when there was some failure of the Bank of Van Dieman's Land, and that ""Tattersall"" was called over to Hobart to distribute by lottery some of the assets of the bank. He was called over by reason of tlie implicit confidence which the public had in him. Having got him over there, and he having successfully conducted the lottery, they began to think whether they could not regulate the gambling laws of the community, and they passed an Act for the regulation of gambling. That Act, as pointed out by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne, has in every line of it an implied effort to improve the conditions for ""Tattersall,"" and to make the position one that he would take up for the benefit of Tasmania, which was then in financial straits. It is a singular thing that he should have arrived there at a time when it was necessary for the Government to obtain some additional revenue. A d vantage was taken of the financial position of Tasmania to pass a law for the "" suppression of gambling,"" but which, as I say, was | really for the encouragement of gambling, if not in Tasmania, then in the rest of Australia. Theposition which the right honourable, gentleman takes up is that by regulating, gambling in Tasmania they got it under control, and that there was less of it . Themistake that has been made in considering how far "" Tattersalls "" affects the gambling proclivities of the whole of Australia is that although the institution exists in-Tasmania, and the people of that State do not largely avail themselves of it, the people of the rest of the Commonwealth do. A point which is constantly forgotten is. that although this institution may not doso much harm to Tasmaniai t is doing a. great deal of harm to other parts of the: Commonwealth. Erom the narrow point of view of the profit which Tasmania derives, from this institution, that State need not struggle very hard to keep it going. If these clauses are not enacted,, "" Tattersall "" will be free to come back toSydney or Melbourne, where, owing to theiicentral position, his transactions. could becarried on under much easier circumstances. Tasmania would thus lose the £15,000 per-annum that she now obtains from this source, and would also incur the loss which we now suffer by the people's money beingtaken out of the national wealth and passed into this sink, where it creates nothing.. The profits derived by Tasmania from theexistence of "" Tattersall"" there are not con-<fined to the increased postal revenue. Money is circulated by "" Tattersall "" himself and by the labour expended on his institution in the island. A .good deal of money is spentin printing and in supplying clerical work.. The people have tasted of this, and a great, many of them are unwilling to give it up. I cannot help thinking, however, that if the Commonwealth is able to put an end to""Tattersall"" the great majority of the people of that State will be very glad, to get rid of his sweeps. It has been argued from the first that this attempt on. tbe part of the Commonwealth is an in vasion of the State rights of Tasmania. I denied that at the time, and pointed out. briefly that the effect of striking out this, clause would be to invade the rights of the other States. . The right honourable member for Tasmania referred to that as a piece of topsy-turvy logic, but I am happy to noticethat some of the legal minds of this committee have admitted that that position is justifiable. Those States which have passed laws to prevent people from investing money in these sweeps would have their rights invaded if this clause were struck out. Tasmania would invade' their rights by means of its law which permits "" Tattersall "" to continue his operations. I hold with the honourable and learned member for In d i that we ought to look at. this question, not from the point of view of any State, but from the view of what is best for the moral and material welfare of the whole of Australia. A large amount of money is invested day after day and year after year in this unreproduetive work of gambling. It is so great that if we were to turn it into more reproductive channels it would lead to a vast increase of the national wealth. One point has been referred to in regard to ""Tattersall"" with which I wish to deal. An assertion which I made the other evening that it was a monopoly, and that it was therefore undemocratic to recognise it at all, has been disputed. It is now said that it is no monopoly, and the Act under which it exists has been brought forward to show that any person who chooses to deposit £10,000 with the Government of Tasmania can enjoy the same rights and privileges as .those given to ""Tattersall."" I undertake to say that that provision is not generally and widely known. If it were, I am certain that there are people interested in this sweep movement who would readily find the money and go into the business. It would be a most lucrative investment of £10,000. I am sure, however, that if rivals to "" Tattersall"" appeared before the Tasmanian Government with £10,000 in hand and said, "" Please register us as a competitor against ' Tattersall,' "" some reason would be found for not putting them in that position. The right honourable member for Tasmania said tliat this £10,000 was a security for the public. being put into my mouth that I did not use. WhatI said was, that this was security deposited in order to make it cerreference to newspapers, and not sealed tain that the institution 'was carried on in documents. accordance with the regulations and the law. Mr G. B. EDWARDS right honourable gentleman's explanation. plications for tickets. In passing the clause Other honourable members have certainly dealing with obscene or indecent printing we said tliat it is a security to the public. But admitted that in these machinery Bills, in what kind of a security can it be either to cluding the Customs Bill, we can safeguard the people who invest in these sweeps, or to the morals of the community. It has been the Government, when the sums involved said that this form of gambling is different amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds annually? It was one of the conditions under which this monopoly-for it is a monopoly-wa s given to "" Tattersall"" by the Government at a time when it was in need of money that the sum of £10,000 should be deposited. It is a pity that this thing should ever have originated in the island State, and it will be a still greater pity if some measure is not taken to terminate its existence as soon as possible. What might it not become 1 Already we know that the power of "" Tattersall "" is great and constan tly growing. We have only to look at the opposition which has been got up against this clause in order to see the power which can be wielded by this institution. We know the power which ""Tattersall"" wields in New South. Wales, where that institution no longer exists. If the institution goes on, insteadof having a federation of six States in this Commonwealth, we shall have a confederation of five States and ""Tattersall's"" Island. "" Tattersall "" is getting mortgages over property in ail parts of Tasmania, and wielding an influence over public men, while this revenue of £15,000 per annum is being obtained by pandering to the gambling proclivities of the people. I feel very warmly that the Commonwealth should, in passing a Postal Bill, take the right of deriding what matter it shall carry through the post. Private letters will not be opened and interfered with, as has been suggested. The intention is clearly set forth in the clause that only letters proscribed as being addressed to people who are reasonably supposed to be carrying on these sweeps shall be opened for the purpose of seeing whether the law is being evaded. The power we are taking is not one that should be in a Postal Bill. We have already taken power to deal with obscene or indecent literature, and I do not know that I object to words any objection was made to that. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN T h a t was in Mr G. B .

Those who elevate "" Tattersall's"" into a kind of special providence, with whom the people may gamble on safe terms, seem to forget that side by side with the application for tickets, "" Tattersall"" is issuing circulars and advertisements, tempting people to invest, just in the same way as an ordinary betting man. I admit that betting men and tote shops are evils just as great as sweeps, and if we had power to do away with them, we ought to do it . The Federal Parliament has no power to deal with tote shops and betting men, but we have power to regulate the Post-office, and that is a power we are fully justified in using in the interests of good order and the moral and material welfare of the people. with mingled feelings to the speech of the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill, especially when the fact that for many years he had been a Member of Parliament mania, and for a considerable period a Minister of the Crown. He told us that whenever he appealed for the confidence of the people, the people had responded in his favour; but he forgot to mention that, on the last occasion when he asked for that confidence, the cry arose in Tasmania that he was a ""wobbler."" regret extremely not been able to get rid of the bad habit which he acquired in his last campaign, and that he is "" wobbling"" more over this matter. 1 It would have been much better had he refused to have anything to do with the Bill more than contenting himself with voting for or against it. I do not like to see a Member for Tasmania doing anything which would, in my opinion, injure that State. reading I explained myself very fully on the matter of "" Tattersall's,"" and I do not propose to allude to it further than to state that clauses 55 and 56 areadmittedly directed against "" Tattersall."" come law, I presume "" Tattersall"" will have his letters suppressed. Does the Ministry intend to apply the same law all round, to persons who are carrying on what is practically the same kind of gambling in tlie other States? In Victoria and New South. Wales bookmaking is openly advertised and12 h carried on, bookmakers undertaking to invest money committed to tlieir charge. Are these men's letters going to be opened ? If not, the Government are making fish of one and flesh of another. Another and more important question has not been touched on, but it should receive serious consideration before these clauses become law. Some of the ablest men in the House have said that the Federal Parliament have the right to pass and enforce these clauses, while equally able men in the Senate have said that the Government have no such right. Suppose, for tlie sake of argument, that tlie Government have not the right, have the Ministry considered what the result will be? Tasmania has duly legalized "" Tattersall,"" and has passed over the control of her Post-office to the Federal Government, who thus assume the same responsibility that the Tasmanian Government held. If it be declared by a listened properly constituted court tliat the Federal Government have acted ultra vires in interfering with "" Tattersall's,"" has it been he alluded to considered what the result will be when "" Tattersall"" brings an action for damages ? in TasThe moment "" Tattersall's"" letters are stopped, that moment the Government interfere with and destroy a business which he has been properly and legally authorized to carry on in Tasmaniaa business that may involve not only hundreds of thousands of pounds, but probably £1,000,000. It may be a year or more I before the Federal High Court is established, to find that he has and in the meantime ""Tattersall""cannot appeal. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo told us that once the five sister States had "" whitewashed"" themselves, and that Tasmania must now fall into line. The majority must rule ; and if the majority decides that Tasmania must go with the other States, the Government have the power of brute force; but I do not think the exercise of On the second that force is likely to promote that love which ought to prevail amongst six sister States. Tasmania are, no doubt, put in a difficult If these clauses beposition in this matter.

But we have to consider this question on somewhat higher grounds.

I should have liked' the right honourable member, Sir Edward Braddon, who spoke so strongly, to have told us clearly what was the governing motive in passing this legislation-whethe r it was to restrain gaining, as the Act expresses it, or whether it. was to secure, through breaking faith in an understanding with the rest of Australia, the establishment in Tasmania, as a means of adding to the revenue, a scheme of lottery which the other States had decided should not remain with them ? Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN is still in force in Tasmania. what has been said as to the right honourable member, Sir Edward Braddon, -and I recognise his great services to TasmaniaI say that this question has never been put to the people. The people have not seen all the evilswhich arise from what-was done when the Gaming Bill was passed, and when a home was given.to this outcast institution. That was only the beginning of what may grow into one of the greatest evils which can affect the Commonwealth. The American State Legislatures enact laws against this evil, and the Congress itself takes similar steps ; and why do they do this ? Is of the results which may flow if the gambling evil be allowed to continue ? The right honourable member forgot all those teachings of history and all he must have learned from experience, aud recklessly brought on Tasmania the scandal of being the refuge of this outcast institution. I need not refer to the arguments as to this being a State right invasion. The eloquent address of the honourable member for Wentworth on this point has already been replied to, but I wish to assure that honourable member and the committee, that those who have spoken up to the present have not really spoken what would be shown to be in the heart and true mind of the people of Tasmaniai f this question were put fairly to them. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -The speech of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse, makes me think that Tasmania is not altogether lost. The other honourable member for Tasmania to me is an absolute enigma. The Commonwealth has arisen as the result of the surrender by the States of powers which they formerly possessed. We have gained no new territories, and we have taken in no new nations, and the powers of our Commonwealth Government are made up of those which were once possessed by the various States. The power to carry mails and to regulate postal and telegraphiccommunication, was among those which were surrendered by each of the States in order to form the Commonwealth, and to-day I am going to vote for the State rights which have been vested in the Commonwealth. All the Commonwealth claims is to exercise for the six States the power which each StateT h a t Statute exercised previous to the formation of the Commonwealth. I claim that I can speak for Tasmania, because I was the second man on the poll in the election for the representation of that State in this House. MrO ' MALLEY I beat the honourable member by 2,000 votes, and he got in ' only on my surplus votes. tion. MrO ' MALLEY It is absolutely true. The honourable member polled 1,992 No. 1 votes, and.I polled over 4,000 No. 1 votes; and, therefore, I have twice the right to speak on this question that he has.

When we speak of the greatness of a country we do not speak of her armies or of her navies, but of tbe moral men and women she produces, and that is what we want to cultivate in Tasmania. When the time comes that Tasmania cannot live without "" Tattersall,"" may she eternally sink in the depths of the ocean. She is the richest State of the union, and not the pauper State that some honourable members seem to think. the Commonwealth ought to agree to put £15,000 on the Estimates to make up what Tasmania is going to lose. Mr .JOSEPH COOK -Would pauperising Tasmania1 MrO ' MALLEY be a fair thing. No doubt we have been exploiting all the other States, but the more one has the more he wants, and the less one has the less he will get. The Commonwealth, which has the supreme power, rose out of the States as the Himalayas rise above the plain. The Commonwealth has the power, if it chooses, to destroy ""Tattersall,"" but whether it will use that power I cannot say. In connection with every community there is something that ought to be preserved, and something that ought to be destroyed, and every patriot and every true man desires to destroy that which is bad and preserve that which is good. Tlie very exterior of nature may be withered and wasted ; the very earth itself may be blasted and blighted by unproductiveness, and towns and villages may be swept by flames, and whole armies of human beings may be swallowed in their hellish embrace; but all nificance beside a national act of wrong, and it would be a national wrong to allow one little State to exist as a parasite. speeches we have heard from the representatives of Tasmaniai t is clear that the people of that State do not speak with a united voice on this very vexed question. We have been asked to consider this matter as if some special State privilege belongs to Tasmania, and, whilst there has been no argument put forward in defence of sweeps on moral grounds, it has been contended that the postal authorities should conduct their business on purely commercial lines, that the secrecy of all matters entrusted to them should be maintained inviolate, and that it is no part of the functions of the Postal department or of the Commonwealth to consider the moral side of the question. I disagree .with these arguments altogether, because I consider that the morals of the community are distinctly a matter of concern to the Commonwealth Government, and that the Postal department should not lend itself to any transactions that may operate detrimentally to the best morals of the community. Inasmuch as ""Tattersall's"" sweeps have not been A t the same time, I think defended by tlieir strongest champions from the moral stand-point, I take it'that I am correct in offering opposition on moral grounds to the continuance of any that not be facilities for carrying onthese sweeps. It has been urged that ""Tattersall's"" No ; I think it would sweeps are not so bad in their effects upon the morals of the people as other forms of gambling, but I think that sweeps belong to the most insidious form of gambling, and that they are most dangerous to the moral well-being of the community. The influence exerted by these sweeps enters secretly into every home, and offers inducements to gamble to people who would never think of such a thing, but for the facilities which are given in this way. To such an extent have the ill effects of these sweeps been observed in each of the States, that, with the exception of Tasmania, they have thought it necessary to legislate against them in order to protect the community. "" Tattersall"" was started in New South Wales, and until action was token its influence was perceptible in every little community. From the back-block stations thousands of pounds were annually sent to "" Tattersall's"" by individuals who never such calamities sink into insigfrequented race-courses, or indulged in gambling otherwise, and to such an extent did the evil grow, that it was thought necessaryto put a stop to communications being sent to "" Tattersall"" through the post. Similar action was taken by other States, and for the same reason. For some years Tasmania has been the home of "" Tattersall's "" sweeps. It has been fast degenerating, if we can believe the evidence that we have from that better Tasmania which is represented here so ably by the honourable members, Mr Piesse and Mr O'Malley. According to that better Tasmania, the influence of "" Tattersall's "" sweep in that State has been anything but in tlie direction of the moral welfare of the community. It has been a kind of cancerous growth which",58,William Mcmillan I T Is Not To Consider Is Whether As A Matter Of Public
234,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"From thehas reduced the island to the position of the Monte Carlo of Australasia. ""We are now asked to permit this state of affairs to continue. Not only are we asked to permit it with respect of Tasmania, hut also with respect of the Commonwealth, because there are only two alternatives before us-eithe r to apply the legislation that was found desirable in the other States to Tasmania, or vice vers(L. Under our uniform postal regulations, we cannot legislate in the direction of prohibiting "" Tattersall"" in the other States, and permit his operations to continue in Tasmania. We must either prohibit them throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, or we must permit the operations which are at present carried on in Tasmania to be also conducted in the other States, which have cast "" Tattersall"" out as an unclean tiling from amongst them. I prefer to be guided by the wisdom and experience of the other States, rather than by the attempts which are put forth here on behalf of a section of Tasmania. The contention advanced as to the rights of Tasmania to continue this lottery business as one of the State rights which have been reserved to her, was veiy ably answered by the honourable and learned members for Northern Melbourne and Indi. The real position has been made perfectly clear by the recent action of America, whose example in this matter of State rights we have largely followed in our own Constitution. The decisions given there amply bear out the contention of the Government that this is not a matter which comes within the scope of State rights. When Tasmania handed over the Post-office to the Commonwealth, she handed completely as she did her Customs, her military, and other transferred services. If the contention which has been advanced is to be held good, it seems to me that Queensland has a right to urge that the Commonwealth must not legislate in connection with black labour, because that is a matter affecting State rights. good ground for saying so as has Tasmania sall "" :in regard to this matter. Victoria also could come forward and say that we must not legislate to tlie detriment of her manufacmaster-General, upon evidence satisfactory to turers, who enjoy a high protective Tariff. him, that ""Tattersall, care of George Adams, If such objections were to be held Hobart, Tasmania,"" is engaged in conducting a tenable, then our federation must disappear, chance because it would be clothed with no powers of Congress entitled An Act to amend certain of Government. These points, however, have been very amply answered, and we need have no apprehension that this is a matter which trenches upon State rights. I wish to preserve the rights of the States. I do not desire to see this Parliament trench upon rights which legitimately belong to the functions of State government. Regarding the petitions which have been presented so industriously to this House, I have no doubt that it has cost an immense sum of money to secure the large number of signatures which have been attached to them. We have heard it stated on very good authority that a large number of these signatures were obtained either under a misapprehension of what are the provisions of the clauses in question, or because of misrepresentation in respect of them. I believe that both causes have operated. I remember the occasion upon which I first saw one of these petitions in a country town in New South Wales. I was asked to sign it , upon the ground that the Bill proposed to confer upon the Postmaster General unlimited power to open my correspondence. If that had been the scope of the Bill, I would readily have opposed it . I had sufficient Scotch canniness, however, to abstain from signing it until I had seen the Bill. When1 saw the provisions to which exception was taken, I was thoroughly satisfied to stand by the Government in obtaining what I thought to be very necessary legislation. I believe that many of the signatories to the petitions were caught napping. Not only in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, has action been taken against ""Tatit over as tersall's"" on the ground of injury to public morals, but in the great republic of America similar action has been taken, showing at once the great scope and influence exercised by this system of lottery, and the position from which the American Government view it. In the last issue of the Review of Reviews, page 6, I find that the Postmaster-General is reported to have issued the following notification to the It has been said already. postal authorities of America in respect It having been made to appear to the Postlottery for the distribution of prizes by lot or through the mail, in violation of the Act 11",59,William Mcmillan I T Is Not To Consider Is Whether As A Matter Of Public

While my sympathy has &c, approved on 10th September, 1890,"" he directs all postmasters to return all letters and advices, whether registered or not, addressed to ""Tattersall."" I believe that we shall not be going far wrong in this particular in taking a leaf out of the book of the Postmaster-General of America. I should like to point out that this clause does not deal with "" Tattersall's "" specially, but it gives to the Postmaster-General power to deal with other objectionable matter. No one will deny -that our Postal departments in all the States have been made use of largely for the purpose of advertising quack doctors and other matters that were not in the best interests of the community. Unless the Postmaster-General is given the power proposed in this clause, great and irreparable injury may be done to the community. I consider these, with proper safeguards, are only necessary powers to be placed in his hands. Before any letters can be stopped, the person to whom they are addressed must be gazetted as one who is not permitted to use the postal facilities for the promotion of sweeps, and no wzwng can be done, because the Postmaster-General is amenable to Parliament. I believe that the provisions of the clause are so necessaiy and desirable that, while I have voted against the Government in certain other instances, I am prepared to support them in securing this necessary legislation. all the States with the exception of Tasmania, and it is legislation which, in my opinion, is in the interests of the good morals of the community. I believe that whilst we are laying the foundation of the nation we should legislate for the -true and well laying of that foundation, both in regard to the morals of the community and other matters which engage our attention, If we cannot make men moral by Act of Parliament, let us not by Act of Parliament give facilities to the community to adopt a wrong course of action. I believe that national welfare is a matter of national righteousness, as well as of those other matters which go to build up progress and prosperity. Mr P, E. M c LEAN (Lang) I listened very attentively to the speech made by the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, and also to several other speeches that have been delivered in opposition to the clauses proposed by the been with the clauses as they stand, I have still been anxious to hear what can be said against them, and to hear the case fairly and clearly stated from what I am compelled to call the Tasmanian stand-point. Unfortunately this matter seems to have resolved itself very largely into a question between the Commonwealth and Tasmania. While I am very anxious that State rights should be respected as far as possible, 1 am bound to say that the only conclusion I can arrive at, after hearing the arguments on both sides, is that in conceding the demand of Tasmaniai n this respect we should be absolutely subverting the principle of majority rule. We should be bowing down to the will of the minority instead of recognising that in Commonwealth affairs the great majority of the Commonwealth must rule. The explanation given by those who oppose this clause in regard to the existing state of things in Tasmania, shows clearly that that State owes the establishment of "" Tattersall"" there simply to the fact that the larger States have declined to allow the institution to remain with them. Seeing that the great States on the Australian continent, represented by millions of subjects, have declared that they will not have this institution cariying on operations in their midst, is it reasonable to suppose, now that the Commonwealth has assumed the management of the Post-office, that they will go It is in harmony with that of back on what they have already declared to be their will and judgment, and allow the minority in Tasmania to dictate the policy of the Commonwealth? protest.

There has been practically no public agitation against these powers, and although we know that a very large number of people in these States have indulged in ""Tattersall's"" through the medium of the post, we still know that there has been no definite public movement to repeal these provisions, or alter the policy of the Postal departments of the States. position : Our Tasmanian some we stand in the Bill, we shall be seriously invading their State rights. Let us suppose that for the sake of Tasmania we withdraw these clauses from the Bill. Supposing we allow "" Tattersall's "" business to be carried on in spite of the laws previously adopted in each of tlie larger States of the Commonwealth, then, I would ask, what about the rights of the larger States? Are they to be ignored ? Are we to absolutely ignore the will of the people, as expressed by their legislation and their Government, in the larger States of the Commonwealth ? If that is the view of State rights which is going to be put before tlie committee, I do not think it will find favour with honourable members. inevitably break up the We have a perfect right, in framing the postal policy of the Commonwealth, to consider the wishes of the great mass of the people within its borders. If incidentally we do violence to tlie feelings of some residents of the Commonwealth ; if incidentally we prevent the carrying on of an institution which has existed in Tasmania for some time past, we cannot help it. We must lay down some sound definite principle of public policy on which the Commonwealth shall be conducted, and if we do that, we cannot help any incidental hardship which may occur to the residents cular State. vinced people of Tasmania would wish us to throw out these clauses. Of course, I am bound to assume that, as the law by which "" Tattersall"" is permitted to cany on business in Tasmania has been in force for some time, it has the endorsement of the people. Just as I assume that the absence of any consistent agitation in opposition to the law Mr F. E. McLean have taken against sweeps in other States is evidence that there is no great feeling against that law; so I am willing to concede that the existence of the law in Tasmania, as it stands, is some evidence that it is the will of the people of Tasmania to have these sweeps. Still, they knew perfectly well sweeps that, on the establishment of the Commonwealth, the Post-office would become a matter of federal concern. We should be landed in no end of difficulty if we were to urge State rights in regard to other matters outside We have arrived at this the administration of the Post-office. I friends, or have only to mention the Tariff as one of them, tell us that if question in regard to which the people carry these clauses, as they of Victoria might legitimately demand that we should respect vested interests, and respect their financial requirements. Arguing on tlie lines adopted by the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, they would regard it as a serious wrong if we interfered with the policy established in their country. On the other hand, have not the people of New South Wales a very strong interest in the policy of free-trade which has been built up there? We should have an agitation immediately aroused against any alteration of policy which would seriously invade State rights and impose burdens, upon their people. So we would go on bringing endless confusion into our discussions here if If it were adopted it would we were to adopt the principle laid down by Commonwealth. those who oppose the clauses. I have not heard anything to convince me that any very serious wrong can result to the people of Tasmania by the adoption of these clauses, which appear, in my humble judgment, to have the endorsement of the great majority of the people of this country. is not my intention to occupy the attention of the committee at any great length.

The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Indi havepointedoutthat byadopting this amendment we should be giving power in the Bill which would have the effect of overriding the existing law of the State of Queensland. It is a fact that the Queensland Legislature If church lotteries or passed a PostalA ct in 1891 which gave power to the Postmaster-General to intercept letters addressed to sweep promoters either in Queensland or elsewhere, but I am informed on very reliable authority that the power was never used-that is to say, that letters addressed to ""Tattersall's"" in Tasmania have been sent and are still being sent through the Post-office of Queensland. SoI think the Government that the contention that we are overriding or interfering with the State rights of Queensland does not apply. Then again, so far a 8 We will consider that the Postal Act of Victoria is concerned the provision applies only to letters addressed to persons within the State. mission of postal matter to Tasmania if a bookmaker; I think it does. we like. power is not there, but I* am sure that it is not exercised, and that letters have been sent to "" Tattersall's "" in Tasmania ever since it has* been established there.

256,Mr Clarke,"I will not argue that thetechnically interfering with State rights, we are not doing so in practice, because such rights have never been exercised. That is an answer also to the honourable member for Lang, who drew attention to the fact that the State laws had never been altered. The reason is that the Postmasters-General have not dared to put the law into practice. General) I hope the committee will realize that the effect of the amendment moved by the honourable member, in a very temperate and fair speech, would be to precisely negative the whole intention of this clause. We are allowing a clause to stand on the face of the measure, claiming the undoubted right of the Federal Parliament to have the absolute and exclusive control of its post-offices, which it is expressly endowed with. Having declared by the clause the undoubted power of the Commonwealth, we are now asked to provide that the Postmaster-General, as the agent of the Commonwealtli, should not be permitted to exercise it except by prohibiting correspondence in relation to fortune-telling, or fraudulent,Undecent, obscene, or immoral businesses. In regard to all other kinds of gambling through the Post-office, whether by bookmakers or lottery conductors, or by those carrying on schemes or games of chance, or any other variety of gambling, the Federal Parliament would be crippling itself, and placing its powers absolutely at the disposal or under the control of any of the States of the Union. The honourable member's amendment aims at compelling any States, no matter what their desires may be, as to tlie control of the postal matter passing through tlieir territory, to send to any State to which it may be addressed any postal matter relating to any lottery or gambling business, provided that in the State to which it is addressed the carrying and receipt of such correspondence may have been legalized. This would, therefore, effectually protect Tasmaniai n regard to ""Tattersall's,"" and it would leave the other States free to start rivals to "" Tattersall's,"" and require correspondence addressed to them to go as freely through Tasmania as Tasmanian correspondence would be passed through the other States. It would absolutely require every State to send to Tasmania any correspondence relating to its sweeps. The committee will, therefore, realize that this amendment would add to 12 M a clause, which is a declaration of federal rights, an absolute subjection of federal rights and powers in its Post-office to the ' will of any Statei n the Union. Sir EDWARDBRADD ON (Tasmania). I do not follow the Attorney-General entirely, nor do I think he has taken sufficient cognisance of the fact that each State should have complete jurisdiction over its own social legislation. To my mind it is no more in keeping with the Constitution that the Federal Parliament should indirectly, through this Postal Bill, take the power to proscribe any harmless form of gambling, or any form of gambling whatever, than that it should assume the power to lay down the law in any State with regard to compulsory vaccination or free education or any. other matter. To my mind there is something very repellant in the idea that the Commonwealth Parliament should arrogate to itself the right of saying that in this or tliat State such and such social laws shall be enforced because we choose to enforce them indirectly by means of a Post and Telegraph Bill. I hope that the amendment will'be carried,, and that the wrong which will otherwisebe imposed on all the States will be. avoided. to be regretted that the honourable member has been able to move this amendment, because I think it brings out in the clearest. possible way one of the very two seriousquestions involved in the proposals of the Government, namely, that as to rights of States. I hope that we shall always be very jealous of the rights of the States, especially of the rights of those States which may, perhaps, be called the weaker from the point of view of population, voting power, and representation. I trust that we shall always act towards them in a. fair and generous spirit not in even a technical spirit. If I thought.. that in any technical sense the rights of"" any States were invaded by tlie clauses in the Bill, in spite of the very strong view which I entertain as to the wisdom andi necessity of the provision, I should act iiv defence of the rights of the States. But I have never been able to see that any States ""could have avoided knowing that in handing over, the post and telegraph offices to the Commonwealth, the power of dealing with such questions was also handed over.

258,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"It is scarcelya power not to be exercised lightly, because I hope we shall, always be jealous of any interference with the free transmission ofcorrespondence through. the Post-office. B ut in this. case, upon very broad and high national ground, I am in favour of. the clause. I feel no difficulty at all in regard to the amendment, which I shall certainly vote against. point out that it is not only the State of Tasmania which is concerned, In my desire to save time, I omitted to mention that the Postal Acts of the different States contain a proviso preserving, anything which has been legalized by them. Unless some such, proviso is inserted here, art unions, which have been considered legal in New South Wales, and also the disposal of works of art by lottery, will be prohibited. long since, a Bill was passed giving the Eight Hours Demonstration Committee power to dispose of certain works on. the art union principle That Act, I take it, will be overridden by the clause, so that I have more than one object in view in pressing this amendment! Mv. REID -The whole clause is permissive. is there -,\ ought to be ruled out of order. We have already declared that the clause shall apply to clearly inconsistent with sub-clause (6), inaslotteries or games of chance where they are much as sub-clause (a) contains other things sanctioned by la w.

Surely ifthat amendment was in order my proposal is. equally so 1 MrR E, MGLEAN' --In sub-clause (b) we have eliminated the words "" not sanctioned by law."" The point to be decided therefore iswhether the: words now. proposed to be added to the clause negative what the committeehas already done. I think that substantially they have that effect, and I submit the amendment is out oft order. MrV . L . SoLOMON. -r-3-here is nothing; in this proviso that is a, distinct negative of the words oi< sub-clause (b) of clause 55. The words which we struck out were ""not sanctioned by law.."" Do these words mean : "" unlawful"" under the laws ofi the Commonwealth, because-1 take it that: we cannot declare, anything to be unlawful which is permitted under the gaming laws of the various In New South Wales, not States.? What did those words "" not sanctioned by law "" refer to ? Did: they mean not sanctioned by the Jaw of tlie States, or not sanctioned by the law of tlie Commonwealth? The Commonwealth certainly has e not-the right to make any law under ourConstitution connected with, or in any way dealing with gambling, or, with the gaming laws. Those laws are left to the States. I submit that there is such a large element of doubt as to what law is referred to in clause 55 that it would, be inadvisable to member's amendment out of order.
