Of While I am on this subject, there are a lot the 66 countries which had companies proof urban myths floating around on this issue viding products through the oil for food prowhich I want to take this opportunity to degram, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs bunk. The public comment on the UN oil for indicated today, only Australia-and the food program in the aftermath of the Volcker Australian government-is having a full, report and the Cole inquiry has often been open and public inquiry into the actions of inaccurate and misleading. There has been a the Australian companies that were involved concerted effort to attack the government on in the oil for food program. the basis of so-called facts-and they are not I will now go to some of the issues that facts. There is a range of false and oftenhave consistently been raised by the member repeated assertions about the government’s for Griffith in this MPI, in his public comrole in and knowledge about problems in the ments and in his questions during question oil for food program which have assumed the time. Firstly, the allegations of 2000 were status of articles of faith. They are basically without any substantiation-no evidence was urban myths. The first urban myth is that the provided in that regard-and the responses terms of reference are too narrow to investigiven were to the satisfaction of the UN. We gate the government’s role in the oil for food continue to go back to the point-not acprogram. The government took the proper cepted by the Labor Party-that these conand appropriate step of establishing the Cole tractual arrangements were overseen and commission of inquiry to examine the actividispensed with by the UN under the provities of three Australian companies about which concerns were expressed in the report were implicit in sanctions rorting.

The terms of reference for the inquiry’s examination of advice provided the inquiry were entirely appropriate given to the AWB on methods to repay damages the nature of the UN inquiry report’s findarising from wheat contamination in 2002. ings.

WA staff reviewed these contracts to verify whether the pool FOB data provided to WA was consistent with those contracts. The details of the contracts were consistent with data provided by AWB(I) to WA. When questioned specifically by WA staff over the provision of “kickbacks” in Iraq AWB(I) denied any wrong. AWB(I) staff pointed to the unique circumstances of Iraq sales (eg: that sales were to include delivery of wheat over land and payment is not made until the wheat is delivered) to explain why it was necessary to pay a Jordanian trucking company and why prices may appear above global benchmarks. Part of the WA’s 2004 performance monitoring activity included examination of the Corporate Governance procedures within AWB(I) including a review of the AWB(I) Corporate Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct Policy that had been approved by its Board. This policy dealt with agency facilitation payments. WA’s review found that there were no payments recorded for Iraq wheat sales. WA’s performance monitoring activities are undertaken from the perspective that WA is not a regulator of AWB(I)’s performance. Responsibility for the manner in which AWB(I) conducts its business resides with the Board which is governed by a constitution and established corporate governance framework. The WA’s role is to report retrospectively on the outcomes of AWB(I)’s management of the national pool and the resulting benefits to growers. This is generally a high level assessment undertaken by WA on an annual basis. I regret that my answer was not complete. Yours sincerely MA (Tim) Besley Chairman Wednesday, 8 February 2006 ----Mr Terry Raper Terry Raper on 19 January this year. Terry was the second oldest of the nine Raper boys. He is survived by his wife, Jean, and his sons, Andrew, David and Grant, their wives and his five grandchildren. He cherished his large extended family, including his brothers and sisters-inlaw. One of his brothers commented that the family had lost a brother, a friend, a lovable bloke and a lovable father. The booklet produced for the requiem mass for Terry has a photo on the front, also used by the local paper. That photo encapsulates Terry: warm, outgoing, gregarious and giving. Terry was a much loved and respected member of the community. Much more than that, he was a genuine and committed man, who continued until the last months of his life to serve that community. He often visited my electorate office and had a joke to share with us, more often than not a little blue. He did have a wicked sense of humour, which only he could get away with. Terry worked hard all his life. He worked at the Bankstown Torch and then successfully ran his own safety training company business. His commitment to work was only outmatched by his commitment to his family. He was a tireless voluntary worker and a dyed-in-the-wool member of the Labor Party. The Revesby branch relied on him to organise all the polling booths in the area as well as working one of the booths during the day. Revesby will not be the same without him when the next election is called. When Terry was diagnosed with melanoma he was not given a long time to survive. Terry exceeded that time by many months. Terry redefined the word ‘fighter’. He was passionately committed to the game of rugby league and, according to his brother, Johnny, loved the St George jumper. On the front of the requiem mass booklet the family had the following words included: Some people come into our lives and quietly go. Some leave a footprint on our hearts and we are never the same. Terry Raper has left a footprint on many hearts in his community, and we will never be the same. He has left a wonderful legacy in his children and his grandchildren. We will all remember and celebrate the life of Terry Raper. More than 1,000 people attended the church service and over 400 people attended the wake at Revesby Workers Club. Those sorts of numbers were testimony to the life that Terry lived. He was very well regarded in his local community, to which he contributed a lot. I have been to a lot of funerals over the years, but very few funerals have matched that amount of people, both at church service and at wake. A lot more would have come had time allowed. My condolences to his wife and to his family.

203,Mr Melham (Banks) (9.30 Am),"I rise today to acknowledge the passing of my friendAustralian Transplant Cricket Team to England in July to compete in a three-week cricket tour. The tour comprises two test matches and three one-day cricket internationals for the David Hookes memorial shield. The squad includes liver, heart, bone marrow, lung and no fewer than 11 kidney transplant recipients from all over Australia. Who else could boast a team full of legitimate steroid users? At least half of the team have used the high-performance drug known as EPO-legally, of course-for treatment of chronic kidney disease. The team’s aim is to raise public awareness of the benefits of and need for organ and tissue donation. With that in mind, arrangements are currently being made for our team to attend certain public functions, including a formal introduction to members of the UK parliament, who will then escort the team members on a tour of the houses of parliament. Following the death of David Hookes, there was a spike in organ donor registrations when it emerged that David and his family had agreed to donate his organs. Nevertheless, Australia has one of the lowest organ donation rates per capita of any country in the Western world. Mr Deputy Speaker, I repeat: the tour is to raise awareness of organ donation. With Australian Organ Donor Awareness Week running from 17 to 25 February, I urge Australians to sign onto the register and to let their families know of their wishes. I will be watching the David Hookes memorial shield closely, as we on the Gold Coast are immensely proud to be having one of our own playing in the series. Chris Wills, from the Gold Coast’s beautiful hinterland, received his heart and lungs last year. Chris, an all-rounder, is right up there in his grade for batting and bowling. After Australia losing the Ashes in both men’s and women’s to the pesky English, he is keen to get things back on track. I have no doubt that we will retain the David Hookes memorial shield, and Chris is emphatic that he will not be returning to Australia without it. I wish the team all the very best on their upcoming tour. Adelaide Electorate: General Practitioners Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (9.35 am)-Yesterday, during question time, the Minister for Health and Ageing was asked a question relating to the current doctor shortage that Australia faces. This brought me to once again reflect on the situation in my own electorate. Last November, I addressed this parliament on the current medical crisis caused by the shortage of GPs. I spoke about how this shortage was having a detrimental impact on the health of communities within Adelaide. I particularly spoke about the Nailsworth surgery, which, in 2003, lost two practising GPs and has been unable to attract replacement practitioners due to the shortage. After years of unsuccessfully searching for replacement doctors, the Nailsworth surgery finally sourced a doctor who was willing and enthusiastic to join the surgery. I outlined how the surgery, desperate and overworked, was denied the opportunity of employing this doctor under the government’s Health Insurance Act, as the doctor in question, Dr Tedders, was trained overseas and had completed only six years of rural service and was therefore unable to attract the necessary provider number. In recognising the surgery’s plight, I supported their application for an exemption under section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act to allow the doctor to join the surgery. I personally MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Statements By Members
204,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (9.33 Am),"The Australian transplant cricket team is heading offwrote to the minister for health, appealing for an exemption to be granted, and in parliament I called on Minister Abbott to grant an exemption to a surgery that is facing possible closure. Unfortunately, just like the pleas and petitions this government received from the communities in and around Nailsworth, my pleas have also fallen on deaf ears. It is just not good enough. The people of Adelaide want to know when the government will be willing to work on serious, long-term solutions designed to address the shortage of GPs and ease the pressure. Currently, we have a government whose medical policies and guidelines simply do not match what is happening in our communities. Whilst Nailsworth is repeatedly told that it is not ‘an area of shortage’, it has currently reached full capacity and can no longer accept new patients. The two remaining doctors face immense pressure, as they are left to service approximately 7,000 to 8,000 patients and can rarely take holidays due to the problems of locating replacement GPs. Early cuts to medical training places have led to a situation where we are not self-sufficient in supplying the demand for health professionals. We are relying on overseas trained doctors who are only able to access provider numbers in restricted areas and at restricted times. Perplexingly, Dr Tedders has been granted a provider number to work after hours and in two local nursing homes, but this alone does not meet the needs of the communities surrounding Nailsworth. There is a serious shortage of GPs, and our inner and outer metropolitan communities are also feeling it. Nailsworth is just one of many surgeries experiencing the problems caused by a short-sighted government. The government should have our country’s health high on its list of priorities. Instead, it is happy to deny Australians access to adequate GP services. I again call on the government and the minister for health to act for the Nailsworth surgery and for the people in the communities in my electorate of Adelaide. Gilmore Electorate: Charity Fundraising local business that has jumped in to assist two local charities for cancer patients. The generosity of their gesture needs to be acknowledged, and what better way than by recording the fact in Hansard? But, first, I have some background. The two Shoalhaven charities are the committee raising funds to have a linear accelerator installed in the Shoalhaven Hospital to assist South Coast cancer patients and the Milton cancer outpatients appeal committee, raising funds for an outpatients wing at the Milton Hospital. Both these committees have had their fundraising boosted through the generosity of Corban, Nowra, who donated a new car to be used especially to assist the effort. The car will be raffled and the proceeds distributed between the two charities. The car will be drawn at a ball at the end of March or at the beginning of April. The principals of Corban, Nowra, Cameron Blake and Alan Pace, were approached by a number of people seeking a significant donation. But, as Alan Pace explains it, Corban was not prepared to come to the party unless the community benefited. Both Cameron and he came from Sydney, and as he said to me, ‘City people don’t appreciate how well off they are, because country people do it tough.’ So they resolved to assist in this way, and I want to reinforce their generosity by saying that these are the types of businesses I want to support.

205,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.38 Am),"TodayI rise to pay tribute to a worthy benefactor andThey were approached by Mrs Betty Berg OAM, who has done a lot of fundraising locally and who is a well-known local identity. She negotiated with Corban, and they agreed to help. They supported the community by donating a Suzuki vehicle, and all they ask is that the community in turn support them to some degree. You cannot ask for more than that. Their generosity stands as a reminder that local businesses are as much part of the community as are other organisations. They rely on the community for their living, and it is only right that they participate equally as responsible corporate citizens. Corban, Nowra, is to be congratulated on its generosity of spirit and its involvement in the social issues of the Shoalhaven. I would like to lay down a challenge to the other car dealers in town to match what Corban has done: rise to the challenge and help the community that puts money in your pockets. Whilst many of our businesses are very active in fundraising, particularly in local events, there is always more that can be done by both businesses and, in return, the community. I would also like to also mention that Jim and Niki Kladis of Kladis Winery at Wandandian, just up the road, have donated a 22 carat gold ruby necklace and matching earrings as second prize. I would love to go on and thank everyone who has contributed so far, but that is for another day when both facilities are realised. For now, may I extend on behalf of the Shoalhaven area our utmost gratitude for Corban’s compassionate and generous gesture. These are the types of businesses that are welcome in the Shoalhaven. Ballarat Electorate: Prisoner of War Memorial Ms KING (Ballarat) (9.40 am)-On Sunday it was my honour to attend a service that marked the second anniversary of the Australian ex-prisoner of war memorial, where 269 additional names were added to the granite wall. The memorial pays tribute to over 35,000 Australian ex-POWs, 8,000 of whom died overseas whilst in captivity-the remainder came home bearing the scars of their experiences. One of the names on the memorial wall is the man that the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Foreign Affairs paid their respects to yesterday: the Hon. Sir Reginald Swartz, a former member of this place and a former POW. Peter Blizzard OAM, who has recently received his OAM, largely for his work on the memorial, designed the wonderful granite wall that contains over 35,000 names. It is important to note that the Australian ex-POW memorial, whilst it is located in Ballarat, is of national significance. It contains all 35,000 names. A large amount of research was undertaken to get all the names. The current Changi Chapel, which exists within the parliamentary precinct, is unfortunately the only place that is recognised as a national memorial for exPOWs. WhilstI do not want to detract from the significance of the Changi Chapel, it really is not the national ex-POW memorial. The government has failed to recognise that, despite the fact that the memorial in Ballarat has not been funded solely by the Commonwealth government-it has been funded by state, private enterprise and the efforts of many ex-POWs-it speaks to many POWs and their families far more than the Changi Chapel. I have called previously, and will be calling again, on the new Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to recognise the national significance of the Australian ex-POW memorial in Ballarat, because it contains 35,000 names. On any weekend you can see the masses of poppies along the wall. Families are visiting from all across Australia to see their family member’s name on the wall. It is a memorial of national significance. It does not require any legislative change in order to be recognised as MAIN COMMITTEE such; it requires the will of the government to recognise that this memorial has emerged from the Australian ex-POW community. It speaks far more as a national memorial than any of the memorials the government has so far endorsed. I again call on the government to recognise that the Australian ex-prisoner of war memorial in Ballarat is one of national significance. Fisher Electorate: Australia Day Awards munity Australia Day awards. On 26 January this year some 35 local citizens who dedicated time and effort for the benefit of the local community were recognised at a ceremony attended by approximately 300 people. The individual award recipients are: Mrs Jane Bright for her contribution to the protection of abandoned dogs and cats; Mr Gary Phillips for services to the Sunshine Coast war veterans and the Sunshine Coast Concert Band, particularly for the work he did with respect to Victory in the Pacific Day; Mrs Laurel Asimus for ongoing volunteering efforts in the community, particularly in relation to seniors and Lifeline; Mr Frank Beattie OAM for dedicated community service to the hinterland, particularly the Maleny RSL; Mrs Patricia Blake for more than 20 years of voluntary charity work, including work for the St Vincent de Paul Society; Mr Bill Close for assistance to struggling rural and outback families and Christian support through his Care Outreach organisation; Allan Lawley and Hendrik ‘Hank’ Drent for dedicated fundraising activities in support of the hinterland’s elderly residents; Mr John Edwards for services to education, particularly school based sport; Mrs Gwen Greenwood for services to the community through the Lionesses clubs of both Buderim and Mooloolaba; Mrs Lorrie Housman for more than 20 years of local charity work, including work with the St Vincent de Paul Society; Mr Edward ‘Ted’ Hyde for dedicated fundraising on the Sunshine Coast for cancer research; Mrs Sheree Lyons for her hard work and dedication to the Sippy Downs community-in particular, she is now president of the community association; Mrs Adele MacDonald for dedicated service to the sport of lawn bowls on the Sunshine Coast; Mr Casey McGuire for services to the community through sport; Mr James ‘Jim’ McBrien for his long-term dedication as a Lifeline volunteer; Mrs Gloria McEwan for services to the community-she has been involved in Inner Wheel, QCWA, Legacy and Friendship Force; Mr Cec Munns AM for services to education; Mrs Janet Scott for services to the community; Mrs Rita Rynne for dedicated services to various Sunshine Coast community support organisations, including work for leukaemia and also the Association of Independent Retirees; Mr Hans Van Roy for services to the Buderim community-he has been president of the chamber of commerce; Ms Lucy Cradduck for services to the community, in particular the Buderim War Memorial Community Association; Mr Peter Shadforth for services to sporting clubs and community organisations; Mr Bill and Mrs Margot Lind-Hansen for services to the Kawana Ambulance Committee; and Mrs Nancy Moule for her contribution to the arts. There was also a highly commended award given to the Suncoast Social Dancers. The community service award went to Telstra Country Wide. Also, there were awards to Mr Des Dwyer, former Caloundra mayor; Councillor Andrew Champion; and Mr Steve and Mrs Terri Irwin.

206,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (9.43 Am),"Every year since 2000 I have hosted the Fisher comOccupational Health and Safety year-old, Joel Exner, who lived in my electorate was killed on a building site last year. Sadly, not in my electorate but in the city of Blacktown, Paul Hughes, 41, a father of a young family of three, died falling from a building site. I congratulate Andrew Ferguson, the secretary of the relevant union; the board of management; and all the members of that union for the way they supported the family in such a tragedy and brought down Paul’s mum and dad from Queensland so that they could visit the site of his death and be at his funeral. You would expect nothing less, I guess, of the union, but again I record my appreciation for it. I thought I should quote to the House some of the thoughts of Paul’s father. He said: Every man’s birth right is to come home from his job. and, I might add, to his familyPaul did not deserve to die like this, and there is nothing worse for us than knowing we outlived our son because our government has not made workplace safety enough of a priority. I agree with that very much. I say to all honourable members that it is an issue that we need to take up. People should have the right to go to work and earn a fair day’s pay but, most importantly, come home to their families of an evening. The issue of criminal negligence in relation to workplace sites has been frustrating in the sense that there has been so little progress, in my mind, about protecting workers from unfortunate death during work. I disagree with Louise Markus when she says that occupational health and safety is a state matter. In fact it is very hard, with the new industrial legislation that has passed through the House, to work out just what role the Commonwealth now plays-it did not play a very big part previously, I must admit-in occupational health and safety matters. But we must have a system, and we must allow trade unions to inspect sitesas they have so rigorously done previously-to oversee those sites and to ensure proper safety measures are taken with no short cuts and no money saved at the cost of the lives of workers. Tragically, under the new industrial legislation this is not possible. (Time expired) Cowper Electorate: Pacific Highway concern in my electorate-that is, the Bonville Deviation, a stretch of the Pacific Highway running through the area of Pine Creek. It has been the scene of no fewer than 13 deaths since 2001. The Pacific Highway, of course, is a New South Wales state government road, designed, built, owned and maintained by the New South Wales government. It does receive substantial funding under AusLink, and I was delighted to be able to announce, with the then Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, that some $960 million is to be spent on the Pacific Highway for the years 2006-09. But we have been waiting many years for work to begin in Pine Creek. As long ago as 1998, the state government announced that it would fully fund the improvement of the Bonville Deviation through Pine Creek, with a completion date of 2003. We are still waiting for work to commence. The state government also withdrew its commitment to fully fund the scheme. As recently as 13 July 2004, Bob Carr was on the radio decrying the fact that the reason the Bonville Deviation had not commenced was a lack of federal government funding. Later that day, on ABC radio, I pointed out to the listeners that the RTA’s own website noted the fact that the Pine Creek deviation was to be fully funded by the New South MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Statements By Members

It disappeared from view and reappeared later in the afternoon with a revised wording that removed the fact that the New South Wales state government was responsible for the Bonville Deviation. The new wording basically indicated that the state government was only responsible for planning. We have finally advanced beyond that. We have seen tenders called for the project. Tenderers were given 13 weeks to place their tenders. But regrettably the delays still continue. Mr Joe Tripodi, the state Minister for Roads, the minister for excuses, is still allowing his department some six months to assess tenders, when the tenderers were only given 13 weeks to put in their tenders. We have named Mr Tripodi ‘Slow Joe’, and the message coming from my electorate is: ‘Slow Joe must go.’ It is time for Morris Iemma to show some leadership and get rid of Slow Joe, the minister who would rather whinge than work, the minister who carries with him a grab bag of excuses. It is time for Slow Joe to pick up his swag and move on. We want to see a minister committed to the Pacific Highway. We want to see a minister committed to making things happen-not just whingeing. Slow Joe must go. It is time for Iemma to act, not react-he doesn’t act too often; he reacts quite a bit. It is time for Iemma to act. It is time for the Bonville Deviation to start now. (Time expired) Lunar New Year Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.53 am)-The Australian Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean communities are celebrating lunar new year at the moment, between 23 January and 12 February. Lunar new year, for one quarter of the world’s population, is the most important holiday of the year. This year it marks the end of the Year of the Rooster and the beginning of the Year of the Dog. In this last week, I have celebrated with Australian Chinese Buddhists at the Nan Tien Temple in Parramatta, with the wider Chinese community in Parramatta Chinatown and with the Australian Vietnamese community at the Tet Festival at Warwick Farm, an event that attracts around 60,000 people each year and is organised by an organisation representing the Vietnamese community in Australia at large. I have great affection for these communities and, more than that, I am amazed by them. They are so strongly Australian-and proudly so-and such extraordinary contributors to the Australia that is common to us all, yet they have also retained such a strong cultural base and maintained that base through generations of Australians. How privileged we are in this place to be invited, as representatives of the people, into these little slices of Australia and to be given a front row seat to see the lion and dragon dances, to hear the music and the language, to eat the food and to catch a glimpse of other philosophies, other religions and other belief systems that flourish so well within the Australian context. It was also a privilege for me to hear the wisdom of the Abbess of the Fo Guang Shan Nan Tien Temple, the Venerable Man Chien, a woman of extraordinary wisdom and grace. She was kind enough give the politicians at the Buddhist ceremony last week crystal lotus flowers to remind us, in the Buddhist way, that even though lotus flowers grow in the mud they retain their beauty and purity-a fitting metaphor, she thought, for politicians. Several of us are carrying them around with us in our handbags as a reminder. It is quite a beautiful concept. MAIN COMMITTEE As we celebrate with these three successful communities we should remind ourselves that we did not always open our arms to these new arrivals. At times we were quite tough, particularly on our Chinese and Vietnamese Australians, but how lucky we are as a nation that we do not just have the world at our door to experience it from afar but have it within us, in our own population. The traditional lunar new year wish is for health, wealth and prosperity, and these three communities have given those things to us. It is fitting at this most important time of the year for them that we wish them the same-health, wealth and prosperity and a happy lunar new year and Year of the Dog. Queensland Health Queensland Health. I rise to be an advocate for those constituents in my community who have been so adversely affected by the intransigence, the lack of action and the bumbling of the Beattie state Labor government in Queensland. I rise because those MPs who are charged with the responsibility of representing the people of the Gold Coast in Queensland’s state parliament, the parliament that is accountable for the lack of action when it comes to Queensland Health, have remained eerily silent. My concern is that Gold Coasters are forced to accept suboptimal outcomes when it comes to their health because the Queensland state Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, and the Queensland state Labor government seem unable or unwilling to do anything to fix the health crisis in Queensland. Over the course of the past week we have seen on the Gold Coast a complete blow-out in waiting lists for operations at our public hospitals. This blow-out is all the more concerning when you consider that for a patient to be eligible to have an operation in Queensland there is a secret waiting list to get onto the waiting list. So there is a blow-out in the official waiting lists, and I can only shudder to think what the lead time just to get on the waiting list is for those constituents who are on the secret waiting list. That the Labor premier says this is all a consequence of federal government policy just highlights the fact that the Queensland state Labor government has become so arrogant and out of touch that the people of Queensland are ready to take the baton to it. We saw that in two by-elections. I stand in this parliament to say that the Howard government will continue to channel record amounts of money into the Queensland state Labor government’s coffers in an attempt to play a meaningful role when it comes to addressing the issues of Queensland Health. Over $11 billion per annum is flowing to the Queensland state Labor government through GST and financial assistance grants. As part of this as well, the Howard government contributed $8 billion to Queensland Health over five years. That funds 50 per cent of the hospital system. Despite this, Peter Beattie and his state Labor members are contributing a miserly $440 per head of population to public hospitals. This is less than any other state government contributes to its public hospital system. It is an indictment of the Labor government in Queensland, and the fact that the Labor MPs from that state have been silent on this is completely unacceptable. I will continue to highlight the inaction of the state Labor government, I will continue to highlight the way in which the Commonwealth government is pouring record amounts of money into Queensland and I will continue to ask, ‘Why?’ (Time expired) 193 the time for members’ statements has concluded.

210,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"Order! In accordance with sessional orderCognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 December 2005, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time. Authority Bill 2005 and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. The Australian Labor Party are proud to have introduced the original antidoping legislation in 1990, which resulted in the Australian Sports Drug Agency. We are equally proud that even from opposition Labor have been able to bring to account the Howard government and ensure Australia continues to build on a drug-free sporting legacy. Labor’s goal in establishing ASDA was to ensure that Australian athletes were able to perform and compete in an environment untainted by banned substances. This goal was met, with ongoing revision and adaptation of our antidoping legislation. To move forward in antidoping in Australia, it is essential that there be a platform for national and international collaboration, regulation and development. Australia’s antidoping systems are robust and thorough and are managed by an authority that can adapt to ever-changing doping technologies and that has fair and transparent measures in place to investigate allegations of antidoping violations. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005 establishes the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. Australia is internationally renowned as one of the leaders in antidoping. Drug testing programs commenced in Australia in the early 1980s. In 1989, the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention was signed, in recognition of sports organisations developing an internationally coordinated approach to drugs in sport. It took effect in Australia in 1994. The World Anti-Doping Agency was established in 1999, with the aim of continuing to coordinate and harmonise antidoping efforts across sport at an international level. In March 2003, WADA released the World Anti-Doping Code. The WADA code provides a framework for international and national sporting organisations and public authorities to establish antidoping policies, rules and regulations. This code has been accepted by all Olympic committees and Commonwealth Games associations, 68 national antidoping organisations, 159 of the 161 national paralympic committees, 10 major games associations, all Australian national sporting organisations-through government funding obligations, and other international sporting organisations. Australia’s commitment to the international antidoping effort was ratified most recently in October 2005, when UNESCO adopted the International Convention Against Doping in Sport, a binding agreement to implement the WADA code. Australia is a signatory to this convention, which will take effect once 30 member nations sign on to the treaty. While Australia has a strong reputation for its antidoping efforts, gaps in the current ASDA powers were exposed during the handling of an alleged doping violation in December 2003. A MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Statements By Members
211,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (9.59 Am),"I rise to speak on the Australian Sports Anti-Dopingplastic bucket of syringes, vitamin B and C vials, Equigen vials, other injecting material and an empty box of Testicomp were found in the room of cyclist Mark French at the Australian Institute of Sport facility in Del Monte in South Australia. A preliminary investigation took place. Allegations were made that there was a clandestine drug culture among elite cyclists and that the AIS was turning a blind eye to the drugs culture at the AIS facility at Del Monte. Following this preliminary investigation, the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia instigated an independent investigation of the incident. Allegations were again made that there was drug use by unknown members of the AIS cycling team and that there was a culture of permissiveness in respect of doping at the Del Monte facility. In May 2004, in evidence to the court, Mr French named five other cyclists who had allegedly participated in group injecting sessions at the Del Monte facility. The court found Mr French guilty of antidoping offences. Mr French was banned from competition for two years and fined $1,000. There was no further investigation into the allegations surrounding the five named cyclists. On 18 June 2004, it was the Labor opposition that raised this issue in parliament. Senator John Faulkner criticised the government for the mismanagement of investigations into allegations of antidoping violations. Senator Faulkner called for the establishment of an investigation and determination process independent of the Australian Sports Commission. Senator Faulkner also highlighted concerns that there had been no further investigation of the other named alleged offenders involved in the case. This case was of utmost sensitivity given that some of the alleged offenders were considered potential gold medallists at the upcoming Athens Olympics. After Labor raised these concerns, the Hon. Robert Anderson QC was appointed by the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia to investigate the alleged claims of doping within the AIS track sprint cycling program and to assess the effectiveness of actions taken by the ASC and Cycling Australia following the discovery of injecting material. From this inquiry Justice Anderson made a number of observations. In short: the preliminary investigation tried to do too much, given its objective was only to determine whether Mr French’s scholarship should be suspended; the follow-up investigation was conducted with due expedience; the case should have been taken to the ASC as urgent, given that Mr French may have had a case to answer and that the further allegations may have impacted on Olympic selections, which were only a few months away; and Cycling Australia and the ASC should have instructed their solicitors to proceed with the case more urgently. The key recommendation that Anderson made from the inquiry was that there should be a body-a body which is quite independent of the AIS, the Australian Sports Commission and the sporting bodies themselves-with the power and duty to investigate suspected infractions, such as substance abuse, and to carry the prosecution of persons against whom evidence is obtained. Throughout the French track cycling case, ASDA did not have the power to investigate, present the case or intervene in any way. The ASDA Act was amended in 2004 in order to comply with the WADA code. However, while the responsibilities are mapped out for the sporting body and athletes in the WADA code, ASDA currently does not have the power to examine all antidoping rule violations in the code. This legislation provides two additional powers: the power to investigate doping allegations and the power to present antidoping violation cases of hearings of CAS or other sports tribunals. Sporting bodies who made submissions to the Senate inquiry into the legislation MAIN COMMITTEE concurred that this type of body was required. These additional powers will enable ASADA to examine all eight antidoping violations contained in the WADA code-namely, the presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete’s body or specimen; use or attempted use of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method; refusing or failing, without compelling justification, to submit to sample collection after notification, as authorised in the applicable antidoping rules, or otherwise evading sample collection; violation of applicable requirements regarding athlete availability for out-of-competition testing, including failure to provide required whereabouts information and having missed tests, which are declared based on reasonable rules; tampering or attempting to tamper with any part of doping control; possession of prohibited substance and methods; trafficking in any prohibited substance or prohibited method; administration or attempted administration of a prohibited substance or prohibited method to any athlete; and assisting, encouraging, aiding, abetting, covering up or any other type of complicity involving an antidoping rule violation or any attempted violation. ASDA and will also carry out additional functions in relation to the investigation of potential additional sports doping violations; the presentation at hearings conducted by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport and other sports tribunals of cases against an athlete or support person alleged to have committed an antidoping rule violation; determining mandatory antidoping rules to be included in ASC funding agreements with sports; and advising the ASC of the performance of sports in observing these requirements. Scheme, or NAD Scheme, which is also established by the ASADA Bill. Detailed protocols and procedures for the exercise of ASADA’s functions will be contained in the NAD Scheme, which will be a legislative instrument, developed alongside the ASADA Bill, to be tabled in parliament. The National Anti-Doping Scheme will be consistent with the mandatory provisions of the World Anti-Doping Code and will implement the UNESCO convention, once ratified. The bill acts as the broad legislative umbrella for ASADA, and the NAD Scheme will contain much of the detail that will directly affect the athletes and sporting bodies. The Senate committee inquiry into this bill has been told that the NAD Scheme will contain antidoping rules applicable to athletes and support personnel, including details of antidoping rule violations and the consequences of infractions; protocols for ASADA drug-testing procedures; protocols and procedures governing ASADA investigations; protocols for of its findings; and protocols for ASADA’s presentation of doping cases at sports tribunal hearings. Under the scheme, it is the responsibility of Australia’s sporting organisations to promote athlete compliance with the scheme, refer violations of the scheme to ASADA, assist a violation has occurred. The scheme also authorises ASADA to monitor the compliance of sports and sports administration bodies, including the ASC, with these obligations; notify the Australian Sports Commission in regard to such compliance; and publish reports about the extent of compliance. The NAD Scheme has not yet been produced. This is a key concern of Labor along with sporting bodies and players’ groups. National sporting bodies, athletes and players, not to mention the parliamentarians, have to trust this government that the regulations attached to MAIN COMMITTEE this bill are consistent with the WADA code and UNESCO convention. They have to trust this government that the NAD Scheme regulations do not contain provisions that will affect them in a negative way. There are also valid concerns, both from Labor’s point of view and that of the sporting bodies, with regard to delays that would be caused by the need to disallow the regulations. While amendments to the NAD Scheme are required to go through a public consultation process, this is not the case for the initial regulations. This is certainly not ideal. In the Senate committee hearings on this bill the government gave a guarantee that all interested sporting and players associations would be contacted and consulted regarding the detail of the NAD Scheme. Australian sport has a lot riding on the proper establishment of effective antidoping regulations. This consultation is vital. The Australian Olympic Committee characterised some additional concerns in relation to these bills. They argued that the administration, investigation and prosecution; does not outline the reasons for or status of the register of findings; does not provide ASADA with the necessary and appropriate powers of investigation; and has adopted definitions at variance with those in the World Anti-Doping Code and the UNESCO antidoping convention. These are all valid concerns. The management of ASDA believes that the powers will be separated through good management practices. This remains to be seen. Without seeing the actual NAD Scheme it is difficult to look any further into their concerns. Labor, as they have done throughout their term in opposition, will hold the government to account on their commitment to the national sporting bodies and their commitment to athletes to ensure that this legislation will offer positive benefits to sport and not incur any additional cost or risk associated with the NAD Scheme. I should also note before I close that the rush we are in to get this legislation through parliament is not really acceptable. While not wanting to hold this legislation up any longer-it has been on the government’s agenda since mid last year-the government should have had this legislation on the table long before now. We should have seen the regulations before now. This would have allowed the parliament to assess the real impact and would have allowed for an efficient and effective antidoping body with additional powers to be well and truly in place by the Commonwealth Games. Labor has always been committed to, and the leaders in, Australia’s push to eradicate drugs in sport. Labor created ASDA in 1990 and it was Labor who pushed for the Anderson inquiry, which recommended this legislation. Labor supports the passage of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005. Whilst we have several concerns with this legislation, they are not significant enough to amend the bill. As such, the government should accept this as an act of good faith on behalf of the Labor Party and the opposition will closely monitor its implementation. I commend the bill to the House. Doping Authority Bill 2005 and to commend the minister, Senator Rod Kemp, who is doing an outstanding job as Minister for the Arts and Sport, and his officers and members of the Sports Commission. I think all of us are very proud of Australia’s sporting achievements, including at the Olympic level. When we think of the outstanding performance of the Australian team at the last Olympics, in Athens, which I had the good fortune to attend, it is something of which we are very proud. We had a record haul of medals. We are very proud of the way in MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Australian Sports Anti Doping Authority Consequential And Transitional Provisions Bill 2005
212,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.12 Am),"I am very pleased to support the Australian Sports Antiwhich women have come to the fore, particularly in swimming, achieving incredible results, breaking world records. I think we can look forward to the Commonwealth Games as a time at which we will again see an incredible result for Australian athletes. I do not think any of us will be surprised if we end up with the largest share of medals at the forthcoming games in Melbourne. This promises to be a wonderful games, and Melbourne has done an outstanding job in this area. There is no doubt that, essential to ensuring Australia’s image as a great sporting nation is that we not only take great results from the likes of the Ian Thorpes of the world but also prove to the world that our athletes are drug free, that we run a clean environment in the training of our athletes and that we do not have any high-profile scandals. I remember the great tragedy for the Greeks when two of their top athletes were caught with drugs. They were devastated by it. I personally believe one of the reasons why the attendance numbers in the first week of the Athens Olympic Games were down was that they were so shocked by those results. So it is important to national pride that we do address the questions of drugs, and this is what this bill is all about. The ASADA Bill creates the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. We have taken a balanced Tough on Drugs in Sport approach which is appropriate and which is achieving results. It is about having a fair treatment system ensuring that athletes’ rights are protected, because that is also essential. Last year, Minister Rod Kemp announced that the government would establish a new Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority to take on the advocacy functions of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The ASADA Bill will allow the organisation to investigate all antidoping outlined in the World Anti-Doping Code. Specifically the bill provides for ASADA to undertake antidoping testing, determine mandatory antidoping provisions and advise the Australian Sports Commission of progress on the work being carried out. It provides for education for Australian athletes and support personnel. I am sure that is going to be an absolute key. I am sure young people are often tempted to take supplements to lift their performance just a notch higher. It encourages antidoping initiatives by the states and territories, provides antidoping and other services under contract and makes resources available to the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee for the performance of its functions. In the event of serious allegations of doping infractions, Australia will have in place an integrated system-from collecting, preserving and analysis of evidence to making educated recommendations on its findings and carrying a case to a tribunal if required. This is going to enhance our compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code and will also implement the The ASADA Bill sets out the broad requirements under which ASADA will operate. The National Anti-Doping Scheme will reflect the provisions of the two major international instruments that I have mentioned. The scheme will contain antidoping rules, protocols for tocols for presentation of doping cases at sporting tribunals. The scheme will set out obligations for Australian sporting organisations such as promoting athlete compliance, referring violations to ASADA, assisting ASADA in the course of its investigations, taking action in response to ASADA finding that a violation has occurred and assisting in hearings. The MAIN COMMITTEE scheme will authorise ASADA to monitor the compliance of sports and sports administration bodies, notify the Australian Sports Commission in regard to such compliance and publish reports about the extent of compliance. There is obviously a whole laundry list of things that they are responsible for, but it is a practical way for an antidoping authority to be involved in all the machinations-from first apprehensions, through all the procedures when somebody is caught to assisting with cases et cetera. They will be involved in the transfer of information to the Australian Federal Police. The bill will also contain the rights of the athlete, which I think is important. The ASADA Bill attaches strict conditions to receipt and disclosure of sensitive information from Customs, the Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement bodies. For example, disclosure must not contravene the terms of Customs initial disclosure to ASADA, and sports in receipt of such information must give an undertaking that any use of the information on its part must be for antidoping purposes and will not occur in a way prejudicial to the subject of the information. Athletes will have access to established external review mechanisms in relation to ASADA investigation, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. All that is important because we have had quite a lot of controversy-for example, in the use of coffee, coffee supplements and NoDoz tablets, which I was familiar with as a student but have not used in the sporting field. It is unlikely: I had no great sporting field in which to test it. When some of our young athletes have been accused of a case-you can just imagine-it has been referred to the Australian Federal Police and then gone out to the media. We saw that occur in the cycling area, where information was suddenly broadcast to the media. The devastation in and impact on young athletes of such a provision is unconscionable. By all means, if they are found to be guilty of infractions and have been taking illegal supplements, additives or drugs of any form, they should be held accountable not only by the legal process but also in the court of opinion. If they are using unfair means to gain advantage to win medals, it is against the whole Australian ideal of the athlete and the Australian ideal of a fair go. We want a fair go: if they have achieved the best result they should not have someone else take the medal away from them because that person has been into drugs or supplements. We all want to support that. I am very pleased to see that the rights of the individual are going to be preserved. The establishment of ASADA represents a significant enhancement to the Tough on Drugs strategy, which is already a world leader. We within government are very proud of that. sport. Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, I know that you personally will be very interested, coming from the city that is very proud to be hosting the Commonwealth Games, which will put us at the forefront of international sport. We can expect to see many world records broken at this event. We want to ensure that we have not only the finest athletes who do their best and perform to their ultimate but also drug testing done on a fair and appropriate basis, that any cheats are weeded out, appropriate testing is carried out, appropriate procedures are followed and that the athletes’ rights are protected. I commend the minister, his staff and the Sports Commission. Bringing this bill forward is an important step forward. I believe it is going to add to Australia’s reputation in producing MAIN COMMITTEE not only fine sportsmen but also a drug-free sport environment. I commend the bill to the House. Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005 in the parliament of Australia. I am particularly pleased-indeed honoured-to speak after my good friend and senior colleague in the parliament the member for Cook, who I know has a very strong interest and reputation in the world of sport. He played a very significant role in the very successful Sydney Olympic Games of 2000. This bill is important for our sporting community and for the overall reputation of the Australian nation. We all know what illicit and unprescribed drugs can do to people’s health and well-being. When an Australian athlete in particular takes drugs that are illegal or illicit and unprescribed by medical professionals, the cost is very significant. It costs athletes their health, with the side effects of performance-enhancing drugs very well documented. It costs the Australian sporting fraternity its international reputation as an honest and fair competitor. It costs the faith of the Australian public, who have continually ranked sport as something special and unique to the Australian character-something which defines Australianness. In fact, 62 per cent of the adult population of this country do participate in some kind of physical activity for recreation each year, and over half of those do so through organised community sporting associations, clubs and the like. There is also an economic cost to Australian businesses. Successful sporting events attract businesspeople from around the world and create a wealth of opportunities for Australian businesses and industries. One such example is Austrade’s Business Club of Australia. This has come to be an important mechanism for Australian businesses to piggy-back off major competition in Australia and to network with significant corporate and business figures from around the world who come to Australia, not only to enjoy high-level sporting competition but also to do business. Bolstered by $800,000 in funding from the Howard government in 2004-05, the Business Club of Australia is set to hold more than 25 business networking events across the 12 days of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. Previous networking events held by the club during the Sydney Olympics and during the Rugby World Cup in 2003 are widely seen as having been very successful, netting this country’s businesses hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business transactions. Over 190 Australian businesses have achieved an international sale as a direct result of the club’s activities during these major sporting events. Why is this important? Because of the place that sport has in the fabric of Australian society, we can leverage off sport to further our country’s economic success. Therefore, the use of drugs by Australian elite athletes does have an economic impact. It directly impacts on businesses and mars their opportunity to leverage off major sporting events, and it tarnishes the profile of Australia as a clean and fair sporting country. Despite all these costs, some athletes nevertheless continue to bow to the pressures placed on them by their coaches and by the public for them to do well and, in particular, to the pressure they place on themselves and turn to performance-enhancing and recreational drugs. Australia has a reputation for placing enormous pressure on its elite athletes to perform at their very best. We idolise our sporting heroes-the Bradmans, and the Pat Rafters and Ian Thorpes of today’s world. Successful sportsmen are beacons to the 1.6 million young AustraMAIN COMMITTEE",190,Asada Bill Does Not Separate The Asada Functions And Powers Relating To Policy Making
213,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (10.23 Am),"I am pleased to speak on the important Australianlians aged between five and 14 who participate in organised sports every year. At the same time, the Bradmans, the Rafters and the Thorpes stand as shining examples of sportsmanship and of Australians who have performed at an elite level and have become the best in the world without taking drugs or performance-enhancing substances. So it can be done. It is important to portray the message to young Australians who might see themselves as having great potential in the sporting arena that they can be the very best in the world, that they can be champions, without taking performance-enhancing drugs. On behalf of the people of Ryan, whom I have the great privilege of representing in this parliament, and as a member of the government who supports this bill very strongly let me make it clear that the use of drugs in sports by a small minority of sportspeople sullies our image. Unfortunately, the fact that drugs are used by only a minority of sportspeople does not take away the fact that the impact of their use is substantial indeed. I want to comment on the matter of obesity. An estimated 1.5 million people under the age of 18 are overweight or obese. One in 10 children under 16 is obese. One in five children under 15 is categorised as being fat or overweight. These figures are too high for us to accept as a nation. One way to try to make an impact on these figures and reduce the level of obesity is through sport. Successful sporting figures figure strongly in this country as role models. There is a role here for our sports men and women. Young Australians look up to our elite athletes as role models. If they see the reputations of their role models being tarnished in the community and in the media, if they see their role models being criticised by public figures for taking performance-enhancing drugs, that is not going to do them any good whatsoever. Kids who are overweight should be encouraged to take up sport as a way of reducing their weight. I want to say very strongly in the parliament today that what this bill is trying to do is very important. It tries to address the issue of the use of drugs and illegal substances in sport at the elite level. As we all know, the Howard government is very committed to ensuring a level playing field for all athletes and to upholding the good name of the Australian sporting fraternity by eliminating drugs from sport. In order to achieve this, the government has introduced the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005. In formulating this bill, the government has taken into account its obligations under international treaties and conventions, as well as the recommendations of the 2004 Anderson inquiry. The government has delivered a scheme which is tough on drug cheats but respectful of the rights of athletes. In 1999, in an effort to coordinate and harmonise antidoping efforts across the globe, the World Anti-Doping Agency, known as WADA, was established. Subsequently, in 2003, WADA released the World Anti-Doping Code. The code is a benchmark for international antidoping authorities and sets out eight doping violations. WADA is also responsible for the creation and revision of a list of prohibited substances, the use of any of which qualifies as a doping offence. In the 2004 election campaign, subsequent to the release of the code, the government committed to ensuring that sport in Australia was as drug free as humanly possible. As part of this commitment, the government now requires all of Australia’s sporting codes to enact antidoping regulations in line with the WADA code. As of July 2005, all major Australian sporting organisations are code compliant. The government also amended the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act in 2004 in order that it comply with the code. However, the structure of ASDA meant that amendments alone could MAIN COMMITTEE not bring it fully in line with the code. The government acknowledges that ASDA was created by the Labor Party when it was in office in 1989, under former Prime Minister Hawke-a good example of the Labor Party doing something right, which is more the exception than the rule. However, this meant that antidoping investigations lacked both independence and neutrality-a situation that was highlighted in the 2004 investigation into Australian Olympic cyclist Mark French and in the subsequent 2004 Anderson report. In that case there was a concern that issues raised by Mr French, including claims that there was a systemic culture of doping among his fellow cyclists within the Australian Institute of Sport, were not appropriately investigated. An inquiry, chaired by Mr Robert Anderson QC and commissioned by the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia, investigated the effectiveness of their investigations into Mr French’s claims. In his recommendations, Mr Anderson QC called for an independent body with the power to investigate and carry out prosecutions of persons suspected of infractions of the antidoping code. In October 2005, Australia adopted the International Convention Against Doping in Sport, which was put forward by UNESCO. As a signatory to this agreement, Australia entered into a binding agreement to implement the WADA code. Following Australia’s formal and binding agreement to implement the WADA code, and in recognition of the findings of Mr Anderson QC, this bill will create a new authority, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, ASADA, and a new scheme, the National Anti-Doping Scheme. In the time. I have remaining, I will make some brief comments on ASADA. ASADA will assume the functions of ASDA, including retaining the role of the Australian Sports Medical Advisory Committee, created by ASDA, to provide expert medical advice. Along with its inability to investigate doping allegations, ASDA also suffered under definitions which were imposed by the Labor government, forcing it to have even more unnecessary constraints on its functions. Specifically, the ASDA Act defined ‘competitor’ as ‘any international and national athletes, or younger athletes who may become international or national level athletes’. The participant in sporting activity’. This gives ASADA jurisdiction over all levels of sport in Australia, to aid it in the goal of ensuring Australian sport is completely drug free. In other words, this provides more of a blanket coverage. This piece of legislation provides a wider net and brings into it Australian sports men and women across the country, which is a very important distinction. While the ASDA Act recognised the role of persons other than competitors in the use of drugs in sport, the ASADA Bill specifically gives the power to enforce antidoping provisions against a new category of people, in addition to athletes. This new category is classified as ‘support people’. Support people are defined as being the coaches, the trainers, the managers, the agents, the team staff members, the officials and the medical or paramedical practitioners-a group of people who might place undue pressure on a young athlete. This extension of powers is designed to address the kind of systemic doping culture identified in the case of Mark French, which I touched on earlier. advising the Australian Sports Commission on sports drugs and on safety matters to be included in funding agreements with sporting organisations. It will include promoting the eduMAIN COMMITTEE cation of sports men and women and support personnel about sports drugs and safety matters. It also has an important role to play in the area of general support and encouragement, of course, as well as in conducting research. ASADA will also carry out the functions conferred on it and authorised by the NAD Scheme. The ASADA Bill ensures that it has the correct balance of powers to ensure that it can perform its duties without becoming a coercive body against the primary interest of athletes and support personnel-which is, of course, that athletes perform at their peak in the sporting arena. The only limitations on the powers of ASADA are as follows: it cannot acquire or hold real property and it cannot enter into contracts or transactions or lease land and/or buildings and other like infrastructure. ASADA is also prevented from coercing any athlete or any support person into giving testimony. Although the government has been criticised by some for not giving ASADA the power to compel testimony, the government believes that this is an important limitation to ensure that athletes see ASADA not as a witch-hunting body intent on dragging the good name of athletes through unwarranted investigations but as an organisation that is there to help them-to benefit their interests by ensuring that drugs do not become rife within their sport. We in the parliament know that when our name is put in print or in the media in a very negative way it does leave a connotation which is quite unhelpful, even though it might be completely unjustified. This also applies to athletes. When their names are on television sets in living rooms across the country, there is a connotation and an inference that they might have done something wrong, when in fact they may have done nothing wrong at all. That is a very important constraint that this bill imports into this organisation. There is of course much more that I could say when talking about a piece of legislation introduced by the Howard government-all very positive stuff and, in this case, all in the interests of the Australian sporting fraternity-but I will conclude with some general remarks about Australia’s reputation in the sporting world. We are known around the world as a great sporting nation. We compete with the very best. Indeed, we punch well above our weight as a small nation of some 20 million people. We win world titles and Olympic gold medals in the spirit of fair competition and high sportsmanship. Equally, we lead the world in antidoping administration technology and in our very strong moral commitment to taking drugs and illegal substances out of sports and competition. Our efforts are second to none. For the first time at an Olympic Games athletes competing in Sydney in 2000 were not just tested after their events; they were also subject to preOlympic and out-of-competition testing. This, combined with a new test for the previously undetectable performance-enhancing drug Erythropoietin, made the Sydney Olympics one of the most drug free Olympics ever-and a triumph for Australia in promoting our commitment to drug-free sporting events. In the weeks ahead Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, will host the Commonwealth Games. This will no doubt showcase Melbourne to the world, and it will also showcase Australia. It will showcase the very best of Australian sporting success. As well, it will showcase how very strong this country’s commitment is to fair competition and strong sportsmanship. As the member for Ryan, and as someone who played a little bit of sport in my younger days, I hope very much that I can continue my good work in the local Ryan community, to interact with young people, with the sporting kids at the various schools in my wonderful MAIN COMMITTEE electorate, and to convey to them the very strong and important message that there is absolutely no place in sport-or, indeed, in their lives-for drugs. Drugs damage lives and damage circles of friendships. They are no good whatsoever to sporting kids. I will take this opportunity to say that I want to continue to encourage the educators, the parents and those who hold public positions in the Ryan community-and the wider circle of friends and relatives of young people-to continue to speak very strongly about health issues with kids and grandkids and to speak very strongly about living a very healthy lifestyle, being active and saying absolutely no, no, no to drugs. Drugs are not something that we want to see infecting or contaminating the young lives of Australians in this wonderful country. the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005 and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. These bills signal a new era in Australia’s already strong commitment to eliminating performance-enhancing drugs in all forms and at all levels of sport. Australia has long been recognised as a world leader and as a nation with firm principles on drugs in sport. The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games brought with them some of the toughest antidoping measures ever adopted. The previous speaker, the member for Ryan, said the conduct of the Sydney Olympics was a triumph for Australia not just in competition on the field but because of our tough antidoping measures. I endorse all of what he had to say. I have a keen interest in these antidoping bills, having been involved in competitive sport of one form or another for most of my life-including swimming, running, triathlons and rugby. Indeed, for me over many years rugby union was a way of life. Rugby union, as they say, is the sport played in heaven. It starts this Friday night, in Western Australia, when the Western Force take on the Brumbies in the new Super 14 format. Rugby, like many other sports, is a sport built on the principles of honour, fairness, sacrifice, discipline and sportsmanship. These same principles have been the backbone of Australian sport of all kinds for generations. The use of performance-enhancing drugs-indeed, any drugs-flies in the face of these principles, undermining everything which makes sport such an important part of the social fabric of this country. On any weekend across the country we see hundreds of thousands of young Australian kids, youths and adults playing sport of one kind or another. We need to encourage and increase this level of participation in all our communities and promote our ideals of sportsmanship. It is this interaction, this social fabric in our communities, that is important and, coupled with the admiration we have for our sporting stars, it makes it so vital that the issue of drugs in sport be treated seriously. I noted with interest the comments in yesterday’s Australian newspaper regarding this very issue. It seems that the National Rugby League is unhappy that the Howard government is taking a strong stance against the use of so-called recreational drugs by our sports men and women. Their argument, which is flimsy at best, is that the proposed ASADA should focus only on performance-enhancing drugs and that the use of other drugs should be dealt with by the various sporting bodies such as the NRL. This is, frankly, a nonsensical position for anyone to take. While Mr Gallop, the head of the NRL, says that the rationale for the introduction of ASADA is to stop cheating, I believe, and I think most Australians would agree, that MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Asada Will Ensure That Australia Remains The Leader In The International Fight Against Drugs In
214,Mr Henry (Hasluck) (10.42 Am),"I am proud and pleased today to speak in support of the use by athletes of illegal drugs, whether or not we call them recreational, is just as damaging to them, their sport and our country’s reputation as the use of performance-enhancing drugs. All sports men and women and their sporting organisations must take a strong leadership role in this. In Australia, our young people hold their sporting heroes in awe. The example set by athletes has a profound effect on the youth of our nation. I for one am pleased that ASADA will be taking an active role in ensuring that athletes using illegal drugs will be shown to be a poor example for our children. I am surprised that the NRL has not welcomed the Howard government’s move to eliminate the use of all illegal drugs in sport. I am also surprised and disappointed that the NRL, amongst others, believes that the proposed ASADA has too much power to investigate and prosecute drug use in sport. Mr Gallop’s suggestion that the NRL tribunal should continue to investigate and prosecute drug cheats seems to ignore the principles of arms-length investigation and fails to recognise the need for stringent, consistent, nationwide standards with regard to drug use in sport. The Howard government recognises the importance of sport in Australia and the need for Australian sports men and women to compete fairly in domestic and international sporting competitions. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill provides for the creation of a body-the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority-which will replace the current Australian Sports Drug Agency. The new ASADA will perform all the functions of the old ASDA in relation to drug testing, education and advocacy. But it will also carry out important additional functions, such as investigating potential sports doping violations; presenting cases against an athlete or support person alleged to have committed an antidoping rule violation, at hearings conducted by the international Court of Arbitration for Sport and other sports tribunals; determining mandatory antidoping rules to be included in Australian Sports Commission funding agreements with sports; and advising the Australian Sports Commission of the performance of sports in observing these requirements. mittee. ASADA will be governed by a board consisting of a chair, a deputy chair and from one to five members. A quorum will consist of the chair and two other members. The chair is the head of the agency and will exercise some of the corporate governance functions independently of the board. The board will have a decision making role in relation to ASADA’s regulatory function-it will decide on matters regarding ASADA’s testing investigations and hearings functions. ASADA will be responsible for overseeing the National Anti-Doping Scheme, which will initially be outlined in regulations developed alongside the ASADA Bill. The National Anti-Doping Scheme will thereafter be further developed and refined by The National Anti-Doping Scheme will set out the specific processes and protocols to be employed in implementing the World Anti-Doping Code and the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport. ASADA will be responsible for monitoring the compliance of sports bodies and sports administration bodies with their obligations under the NAD scheme. ASADA will notify the Australian Sports Commission of the extent of compliance by sports bodies and will publish reports on the same. Failure to comply is not dealt with in the ments. MAIN COMMITTEE This is similar to previous amendments to the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989. a prescribed set of circumstances. The ASADA Bill specifies permitted antidoping purposes for which disclosures may occur. The disclosures must be in the course of investigating possible doping breaches; determining whether to take action over such breaches, and the consequences of such breaches; or taking action, or participating in proceedings, in response to such breaches. The ASADA Bill specifies trusted persons, generally ASADA members and staff and designated associates, who may receive information. It also specifies penalties of up to two years imprisonment for the improper disclosure of protected information. The ASADA Bill also allows ASADA to disclose information to the Australian Federal Police under appropriate circumstances. The Australian Federal Police disclosure to ASADA is facilitated through its own act, the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The ASADA Bill contains specific and detailed provisions protecting athlete’s rights and carries over existing safeguards under the ASDA Act. It provides for appeals by athletes to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and for complaints by athletes to be brought to the attention of the Ombudsman. Importantly, there is strong support among sporting organisations for the creation of the issue of drugs in sport must be treated seriously, given the public recognition, admiration and community profile many of our sporting stars receive. Indeed, many of our top-flight sporting stars are hero-worshipped by the young and the youth of our great country. They must comply with society’s expectation of our sporting elite. Within the electorate of Hasluck, I think it is very important that we set the benchmarks and appreciate the need to encourage and support young people in sport in our schools and through our different sporting associations, whatever that sport may be-whether it be rugby union, Australian rules football, hockey, tennis, athletics, swimming, netball or basketball. We must not be seen to be supporting the use of drugs. Illegal drugs in any form are just not acceptable, and performance-enhancing drugs are not fair in competition. We must ensure we continue to recognise those issues in our sporting endeavours. Sport is built on the principles of honour, fairness, sacrifice, discipline and sportsmanship, as I said earlier. Those principles must be fundamental to the way we encourage our young people into sporting activities and commitment to those sports. In a competitive environment the challenge is for people who are highly motivated and wish to win. We must make sure that that is balanced with the need for them to be fit and committed to the healthy pursuit of their sport in an appropriate way and not encourage-and make sure we are not seen to be encouraging-people to take performance-enhancing drugs or any other drugs to improve performance. The use of performance-enhancing drugs, indeed any drugs, flies in the face of these principles and is totally unacceptable. These bills, and the Howard government’s policy on doping in sport, have been developed with the full involvement of sporting organisations and athletes in Australia. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority bills reflect the Howard government’s commitment, domestiMAIN COMMITTEE cally and internationally, to eliminating doping and drug use in sport. I commend the bills to the House. Ms LEY (Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.54 am)-On behalf of the Minister for Arts and SportI thank those who have contributed to the debate on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005 and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005-the members for Bruce, for Cook, for Ryan and, most recently, for Hasluck. These bills establish the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority as the single organisational focal point for Australia’s antidoping activities. Testing, investigation, research and education functions will reinforce each other in presenting a unified, integrated response to doping in sport. The creation of ASADA balances a tough on drugs approach, ensuring that all athletes are treated fairly and that athletes’ rights are protected. The bills before the House enhance an Australian antidoping framework that is already world leading. They add more robust arrangements for the investigation and hearing of antidoping violations to the government’s existing drug testing, education and advocacy activities. The creation of ASADA represents a comprehensive response to Australia’s obligations under the WADA code and the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport. tegically implement the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport, to be ratified by Australia, once it enters into force. There is strong support among sporting organisations for the creation of ASADA, which was emphasised in submissions to the government’s 2004 discussion paper on the proposed creation of a sports doping investigations board. The establishment of ASADA will mean that sports, athletes and the public can have complete confidence that doping allegations will be investigated and pursued in an independent, robust and transparent way. It represents a tough response to doping in sport and a response that treats all athletes fairly. The ASADA bill sets out the broad requirements under which ASADA will exercise its functions. Detailed protocols and procedures for the exercise of ASADA’s functions will be contained in the National Anti-Doping Scheme, which will be a legislative instrument to be tabled in parliament. The scheme will contain the core functions of ASADA to enable the new authority to operate efficiently and effectively from commencement. It will also carry over and consolidate into a single document the existing regulations and orders relating to As a condition of any funding from the government, sports will be required to adopt the scheme as part of their antidoping policies, which will include submitting to the antidoping jurisdiction of ASADA. As a condition of the scheme, sports will be required to ensure that their athletes and support personnel cooperate with ASADA officials in carrying out its testing, investigations and presentations at hearings functions. Sports will also be required to accept any findings by ASADA that an individual has committed a doping offence, and issue appropriate infraction notices to athletes. The bill also contains specific and detailed provisions protecting athletes’ rights and carries over existing safeguards under the ASDA Act. The bill includes provisions facilitating the exchange of sensitive information between ASADA, the Australian Customs Service and the MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Federal Police in regard to the use and importation of prohibited substances. These provisions, along with the obligations imposed on sports through the contractual arrangements with the government, will put in place a system that will provide ASADA with the powers and ability to carry out its functions effectively and systematically. The World Anti-Doping Agency, the body responsible for coordinating the international effort against doping in sport, has welcomed the entry of ASADA as the new linchpin in Australia’s antidoping framework. Australia, as host of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next month, now has an opportunity, through the creation of ASADA, to underscore to the international sporting community its absolute commitment to fighting against drugs in any sport.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 December 2005, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Transport and Regional Services Committee Reports: Government Responses Debate resumed from 7 December 2005, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the documents. ticular reports: National road safety-Eyes on the road ahead and Train illumination: inquiry into some measures proposed to improve train visibility and reduce level crossing accidents. Firstly, I want to deal with Train illumination. This report was presented to the House in June 2004. The government’s response was tabled in the House in December the following year. I will not go into all the detail, but I want to briefly say that the committee reported with only five recommendations but they were good ones. The government supported one recommendation in full, one recommendation in part and one recommendation in principle and did not support two of the recommendations. The report focuses on a very narrow aspect-as you would expect with only five recommendations-of community safety at level crossings. It is very specific and something that I am sure is a concern to all members. I am pleased the government supported at least some recommendations, particularly the adoption of a scoring system which is similar to that which is in place in Queensland. This will provide uniformity across the country. I am also pleased MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Asada Has A Wider Role That Is To Set Standards With Respect To All Drug Use In Sport Surely
215,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.01 Am),"I want to make a few brief comments on these two parthat the government will undertake further studies to ensure maximum safety for the public at level crossings to make sure that is achieved. I want to highlight, for the benefit of the House, members and the public, that fatalities at level crossings are a serious matter. While they have decreased over recent years, which indicates that there has been an improvement in safety standards and illumination and a whole range of other issues about visibility, there are still too many people who die at our rail crossings each year and there is always more that we can do. I do not think any of us lives in a perfect world, a perfect system, where we expect there to be no fatalities, but I strongly believe that governments should continue to work harder together-particularly in areas where the federal and state governments can work together to bring about uniform signage and uniform policies and procedures across what are national issues. I just wanted to make those comments in relation to the Train illumination report. I want to also make some brief comments on the national road safety report called Eyes on the road ahead. This report was also presented to the House in June 2004, and the government’s response was tabled in the House in December the following year. The committee reported with 38 recommendations. The government supported only three of those in full. It supported 13 recommendations in principle and noted one, but it did not support 21 of those recommendations. Obviously there is an extensive number of recommendations because of the scope of the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services and the importance of national road safety. Just as important as safety at rail crossings is national road safety. This is a national issue and one where the federal government could do more work on better partnering with the states, not saying, as is the case in the government’s response that was tabled in December 2005, that many of these issues were out of the scope of the federal government. In fact, the principal reason the government did not support the recommendations of the committee is that the federal government believed that many of the recommendations were overreaching the federal government’s responsibilities. That may be the case, but where that is the case there is scope for the government and the minister to pay particular attention to working with the state authorities and using good recommendations, not just rejecting them out of hand. Such safety recommendations may be out of the scope of the federal government, but it should work with the states in trying to put them in place. It seems obvious to me, as I am sure it would to ordinary people out on the street, that if you have a good recommendation, a good policy-something that could be done to save lives-you will do everything you can to enact it, if you have the power to do so. To simply say, ‘Well, it’s not my responsibility; I’ll just let somebody else worry about it,’ I do not think is a good enough response. I also want to mention that I think, while some were very good, some of the committee’s recommendations were not so very good. Committees, in themselves, are not infallible. They do make recommendations that I do not always agree with. I want to note one in particular. The committee recommended some absurd special licensing category for four-wheel drive owners. While this debate rears its ugly head from time to time, I think it is just as silly as anything could possibly be. The government rejected it-and I am glad that it did. I am sure that this debate will pop up again and I will not go into the detail of why I believe this is a silly approach to licensing or safety. If we really want to look at road safety, before moving on MAIN COMMITTEE to any sort of licensing there are many things that the federal and state governments could do simply about the condition of our roads, to start with. Very rarely with somebody’s death is it a case of just a licence issue. It is usually a combination of two, three or four things, not the least being poor road conditions. Often it is people speeding or being under the influence of some drug. Just with those few comments, I note both of those reports. am)-I rise to take this opportunity to comment on what I believe is a very important report, National road safety-Eyes on the road ahead, and the government’s response to it. First, I thank the chairman, Paul Neville, and all the members of the committee for the work they put into this important report. The government does take it seriously; it certainly has supported a number of the recommendations. As the previous speaker said, many of the 21 recommendations that were not supported do not come under the jurisdiction of the Australian government, and we must continue to work very closely with the state and territory governments on this very complex issue. Road safety is important to all of us in Australia. Every single Australian would love to see the death toll and accident trauma on our roads reduced, and we are making significant progress in that area. In 1995, there were 2,017 deaths on Australian roads and the population fatality rate stood at 11.2 deaths per 100,000 people. In the following 10 years, we saw a substantial improvement in national road safety. Statistically, the annual fatality numbers have decreased by 19 per cent and the rate per population has dropped by 28 per cent. The Australian government has contributed to this achievement through its ongoing work on improved vehicle safety standards and our strategic investment in the nation’s roads, particularly with the new $12.7 billion AusLink program and our continuing commitment to the highly successful national black spot program. Under that program, each year from 2005 to 2008, a total of $45 million will be spent on the AusLink black spot program, which will fund work on addressing some 370 dangerous black spots throughout Australia. In the late 1990s, we led the development of the current 10-year National Road Safety Strategy, which has a very ambitious target of a 40 per cent reduction in the population road fatality rate by the year 2010. That strategy was formally endorsed by all ministers of the Australian Transport Council in November 2000. Up until the end of 2004, Australia was well on track to achieving that 2010 fatality reduction target. However, sadly, 2005 was a disappointing year for road safety, with 1,635 people being killed on our nation’s roads. That is an increase of 52 on the previous year’s figure for fatalities, and it was the first time the annual road toll had increased since the year 2000. Road safety is a collective responsibility involving all governments at all levels, industry groups, community organisations and each and every one of us as individuals. The Australian government will continue to work closely with these groups to find new solutions that can drastically cut the trauma on our roads. But, ultimately, no matter how much you spend on roads, no matter how much you upgrade the roads and no matter how much you improve the technology of the vehicles, road safety depends on the actions of individuals-each and every one of us who uses the roads, and that is virtually everyone in Australia, whether as a driver, a rider or a pedestrian. I was extremely disappointed at the significant increase in the Christmas-New Year holiday toll recently. I was reflecting the other day on the fact that I had put forward a road safety MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Committees
216,Mr Lloyd (Robertson,"Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (11.06message prior to the Christmas-New Year holiday period. That was broadcast widely around Australia, and I wondered how many of the 78 people who died on our roads over the Christmas-New Year period actually heard my message about being safe on our roads over Christmas and, like all of us, thought, ‘Yeah, that’s right; we’ll be safe, and it won’t happen to us,’ when in fact it did happen to those 78 people. While significant progress has been made in reducing our road toll, that rate of reduction has slowed. Many experts have tried to single out one specific cause for the increase. I guess that is one of the difficulties with road safety-we are all experts, because we are all users, we are all consumers, of road safety in one form or another, so we all have an opinion and we all think we know what the answer is. The preliminary analysis of these deaths that occurred over Christmas showed that most of these tragedies occurred on country roads, and involved motorists losing control, hitting trees, overturning or crossing into the path of oncoming traffic. Reducing the deaths and injuries on our roads certainly remains my highest priority as minister for roads and, I know, the Australian government’s highest priority, because every single death on our roads is a tragedy for the families, for the communities and for the friends, and it is a national tragedy. The potential that we lose on our roads every year is something that we should all be very concerned about. I am positive that with better roads, safer cars and better drivers we can all work together to keep this road toll as low as possible. One of the important initiatives that the Australian government has implemented is the novice driver education program. Whilst driving training and licensing in Australia is primarily a state and territory responsibility, the Australian government is particularly concerned about the vulnerability of young, newly licensed and inexperienced drivers. We are currently working with the states and territories to introduce a national, compulsory education scheme for all provisional licence holders. But in the first instance it is important that we have a trial of an innovative driver education program in New South Wales and Victoria, which I hope will commence later this year. This will be delivered to novice drivers, aged 17 to 21 in New South Wales and 18 to 22 in Victoria, when they first obtain their provisional licence. The program is based on learning methods that will help young drivers gain true insight into their own limitations and the risks they face on the roads, leading to safer and better driver behaviour. This Young Driver Safety Forum was announced in December 2004. It was sponsored by the Australian government and chaired by former minister and Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson, who I would like to pay tribute to because he was very much a driving force in establishing the Young Driver Safety Forum. The initial cost of this novice driver education scheme was estimated at around $5 million, but this has substantially increased in the light of detailed development of the curriculum and expert advice on the methodology aspects of the trial, particularly relating to the potential course dropout rates. The budget has now been estimated and actually capped at $10 million. I am pleased to say that we have confirmed funding contributions currently that amount to $8.6 million. The Australian government has increased its offer from $1 million to $3 million. We have $1 million from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries; $2.5 million from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority, basically the New South Wales government; half a million dollars from IAG, the Insurance Australia Group; $1.4 million from the Victorian government; $1 million from VicRoads; $0.4 million from the Transport Accident MAIN COMMITTEE Commission; and $0.2 million from the RACV. We are still waiting for an increased offer from the Victorian government, and they have agreed to provide an additional $1.4 million, subject to certain conditions. We are still discussing those conditions with the Victorian government. I certainly urge Minister Batchelor to look very favourably on our request for an increased contribution from the Victorian government, so that this trial can get under way as quickly as possible. It is important that we have this trial, because we want to ensure that any novice driver training scheme is not something that encourages young drivers to think-even more than they do now-that they are bulletproof, that they have been trained as expert drivers. In fact, it may increase the potential for speeding or accidents for young drivers, so it is very important that we get this trial right and ensure that it is an effective prototype before we start discussing the roll-out of a compulsory driver training scheme with the states and territories. SoI look forward to that happening later this year. I will continue to push forward, working with my senior minister, Warren Truss, on this novice driver training trial. The Australian government is not just working on increased driver education. As I said, we are building better and safer roads around Australia. I am very pleased to be able to work with my senior minister in implementing the AusLink program over the next five years. It is an innovative and significant step forward in road funding in Australia-some $12.7 billion, the vast majority of that going on road construction. It includes $1.2 billion in Roads to Recovery money, which goes directly to councils. Many of our accidents happen in country areas, on roads that are controlled by local councils. Local councils struggle to maintain their roads and the safety aspect of many of their roads. This is new money. It is additional money, and I know that it is extremely welcomed by local councils throughout Australia. In addition to that, we provide $1.6 billion every single year to councils right around Australia, directly from the Australian government. That is money that they can also use on their roads to upgrade the condition and improve the safety of those roads. We have $250 million in the Roads to Recovery strategic fund. That is an important addition to the Roads to Recovery program. I am very pleased that I was recently able to secure an additional $100 million for that fund from cabinet. That again will increase the safety of many of our local roads. Overall there is $178 million in black spot funding. As I mentioned earlier, that is a very important program which specifically targets areas with high rates of accident or injury or high death tolls. It has been a magnificent program, which the Australian government reintroduced when it came to government 10 years ago in 1996. All the states and territories around Australia are receiving significant increases, despite some of the claims by some of the state and territory roads ministers that their funding has actually been cut. Nothing could be further from the truth. Under AusLink, New South Wales is receiving $3,778.6 million. That is a 77.7 per cent increase in construction funding. Victoria is receiving $2,374.2 million, a 105 per cent increase over the previous five years construction funding; Queensland is receiving $2,734.4 million, an increase of 87.1 per cent; Western Australia is receiving $1,306.2 million, an increase of 110 per cent on the previous five years construction funding; South Australia is receiving $793.6 million, a massive increase of 111.8 per cent; Tasmania is receiving $372.2 million, an increase of 52.9 per cent; the Northern Territory is receiving $264.5 million, an increase of 47.4 per cent; and the ACT is receiving $113.4 million. MAIN COMMITTEE You can see that every state and territory in Australia is receiving a significant increase in their construction funding for roads. We have expanded the network. The AusLink network now takes in many more roads than the national highway network did, and we are working in partnership with the states and territories. I think that is an important point to make. The Australian government do not actually build roads. We do not have the legislative authority to move the services, to resume the land or to provide the EIS studies that are necessary for major road construction. We fund the New South Wales and other state governments, we fund the territories and we fund the councils, but we need to rely on them to work in partnership. I would encourage the states to continue to work with the Australian government in partnership so that we can roll out a better and safer road network around Australia. One project we are working on at the moment is the Pacific Highway. That is probably one of the most high-profile roads in Australia. Far too many people have died on the Pacific Highway. But over the past 10 years the Australian government have contributed some $656 million to that road. We will have duplicated some 44 per cent once we finish the projects that are under construction at the moment. We are making significant progress. We are providing another $160 million per year over the next three years, working in conjunction with the New South Wales government. We have the F3 Freeway widening. In Victoria we have made a commitment to duplicate the Hume Highway by 2012. We have added additional resources to the Deer Park section and the Goulburn Valley Highway and $107 million to the Calder Highway. In Queensland we have committed $120 million to the Tugun bypass and $556 million to the Ipswich Motorway. So you can see that all around Australia we are committed to better and safer roads. We are committed to reducing the road toll. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to put forward what the Australian government is doing to reduce death and injury on our roads. Again, I thank the committee for their work on the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Georgiou) adjourned.

If ordered to pay a fine, he would need to borrow additional money to pay it”, (e) did the ADF’s Director of Litigation, Mr Miller, recommend that the Commonwealth pay any damages or costs arising from the Medical Board hearing; if so, did Mr Miller make that recommendation before the Medical Board’s penalty hearing on 19 August 2004. (7) Did the total legal assistance provided by Defence to the Lieutenant-Commander amount to one hour of legal advice from a Reserve legal Officer on 20 October 2000; if so, (a) do Reserve Legal Officers receive a given daily rate dependent on rank and (b) was the Reserve Legal Officer a lieutenant at the time. (8) At the Senate Estimates on 31 May 2005 did Mr Cunliffe say in response to a question on billable hours or costs of services given to the Lieutenant-Commander say: “I would be surprised if at this point it was possible to reduce it to a figure. I do not believe it would have been expressed in those terms at the time it was provided”. (9) Were other Naval Officers who gave evidence at the Medical Board hearing provided legal assistance by the ADF; if so by whom was this assistance provided and at what cost.

Medical Board hearings did Phillips Fox take over representation of Dr McKenzie, (c) did the ADF’s Director of Litigation approve legal assistance at Commonwealth expense to Dr McKenzie when his legal defence was already covered by this professional indemnity insurance, and (d) what factors caused the transfer or representation to take place. (12) Was the Lieutenant-Commander forced to use Freedom of Information to obtain documents from her own personal file in order to progress her complaint; if so, (a) has she received all of the documents requested and if she has not, why not, and (b) was the Lieutenant-Commander forced to use Freedom of Information to obtain documents from other ADF files in order to progress her complaint; if so, has she received all of the documents requested and if she has not, why not.

(15) Was the female officer given access to the personal files or either (a) Dr McKenzie and (b) the Commanding Officer of HMAS Stirling. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Lieutenant-Commander’s parents referred to the incident in their letter of that date, which covered a range of issues including reference to the alleged rape. (2) On 11 December 2000, Rear Admiral Hancock held the rank of Captain, and the position of Senior Staff Officer to the Chief of Navy. In that role, and at about that date, he met the parents of the Lieutenant-Commander. The subject of the meeting is not recalled. (3) Defence did refer the rape allegation to the AFP. Defence has not located any formal report and is not aware of any formal report concerning the alleged incident ever being made by the LieutenantCommander. It was on this basis that the Minister was advised that the alleged incident was not reported to Defence. Correspondence from her parents to the then Chief of Navy in late 2000 identified that the alleged incident, as well as a number of other matters “…occurred during the 1st semester of 1986”. Subsequent correspondence between Navy and the Lieutenant-Commander and her parents was unable to elicit a report by the Lieutenant-Commander on this incident, but did cause Defence to decide that the AFP should be advised of the matter and this step was taken by letter dated 5 April 2001. The Minister regrets if there was any confusion arising out of his answer. (4) Defence paid an amount of $384,320.86 for legal and related costs associated with Dr McKenzie. (5) The HREOC conciliation proceedings were confidential; it is not appropriate to refer to what was or was not proposed by anyone present. (6) Yes. (a) The costs of Phillips Fox attendance at the meeting were $1,380. (b) Yes. (c) That is not a matter known to Defence. (d) Defence was not a party at the hearings and is not aware of what submissions were put on Dr McKenzie’s behalf, or the effect on the Board of any submissions. (e) Defence’s Director of Litigation determined that a portion of the Board’s legal costs should be met, in accordance with the Legal Service Directions. (7) A civilian lawyer, who is a Navy Reserve Legal Officer, provided legal assistance to the Lieutenant-Commander. The duration of the assistance was in excess of an hour. Defence has made no payment to that lawyer for that service. (a) Navy Reserve Legal Officers are paid according to the form of their particular engagement and their rank, as stipulated in the Defence Determinations made pursuant to Defence Act 1903, section 58B. (b) Yes. (8) Yes. (9) No. (10) Yes; but it was not applicable in the circumstances. (11) Yes. (a) The basis of the firm’s engagement is not known to Defence. (b) Phillips Fox acted for Dr McKenzie after he received the Board’s initial notice dated June 2002 and before the matter was called on before the Board. (c) No. (d) There was no decision to transfer. (12) The Lieutenant-Commander made an FOI application on 8 December 2003 for her personal file. A full disclosure was made on 7 April 2004. (13) No. Access to a member’s personal record and his/her medical record is not unfettered but is subject to the person seeking access having appropriate authority and a relevant need for access. Dr McKenzie did not have right of access to the Lieutenant-Commander’s personal file. (14) It is not clear from the question what “complaint” is referred to, or with whom it was lodged. Access to a member’s personal record and his/her medical record is not unfettered but is subject to the person seeking access having appropriate authority and a relevant need for access. The Commanding Officer of HMAS Stirling was entitled to have access to the personal file of the LieutenantCommander in his role as her commanding officer. (15) Access to a member’s personal record and his/her medical record is not unfettered but is subject to the person seeking access having appropriate authority and a relevant need for access. The Lieutenant-Commander as Executive Officer did not have authority to have access to the personal file of the Commanding Officer of HMAS Stirling. The personal file of Dr McKenzie who was a Reserve member, was not held at HMAS Stirling. Religious Organisations: Funding (Question No. 1898) Dr Lawrence asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Is the Minister’s department providing any funds to organisations which require their employees to meet certain religious requirements (eg membership of a particular church or religious group) as a condition of their employment; if so, will the Minister identify the organisations. (2) Does the Minister’s department provide funds to any organisations for programs which include religious instructions, or faith-based counselling; if so, will the Minister identify the organisations. (3) Does the Minister’s department place any requirements on church and charitable organisations which receive funds from the department that the funds not be used for religious or evangelical purposes; if so, what are the guidelines or requirements. (4) How does the Minister’s department ensure that services and programs funded by the Government and delivered by church and charitable organisations are not used for religious or evangelical purposes. (1) My Department provides funding to a wide variety of organisations and some of these organisations are faith-based. As part of the conditions of funding set out in funding agreements, all funded organisations are required to comply with all relevant legislation, which would include employment legislation and regulation. (2) No. (3) Programs funded through my Department have specific guidelines and/or performance requirements. The funding agreements between organisations and the Department require organisations to only expend funds for the purposes for which they have been given. Organisations are funded to undertake specific projects, meet specific outcomes, milestones and/or deliver specific services, also set out in the funding agreement. The purpose of the funding is also set out in the program guidelines for individual programs. (4) Organisations funded are required to acquit funding and report on outcomes or milestones achieved or the specific services delivered as part of their funding agreement with the Department. They are also required to provide evidence, by way of independently audited financial statements, that the funding has been spent for the purposes set down in the funding agreement. Any funds expended for purposes other than those covered by the funding agreement must be refunded by the organisation. Borneo (Question No. 1922) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) How were the 11 nominees for the trip to Borneo in June this year chosen. (2) How were those who served in Borneo notified of the trip if they were not associated with any of the RSLs. (3) Can she explain how those who did not know about the trip or who were not given the chance to nominate, or be nominated, were not discriminated against. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Repatriation Commissioner wrote on my behalf in February 2005 to 240 ex-service organisations seeking nominations. The number of places on each mission party is limited and I seek to ensure, as far as practicable, representation from each State and Territory and each Service. My inten-",212,Questions In Writing
220,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:tion is to include as wide a representation of the units and formations involved in the campaigns as possible, and to reflect the rank structure and different experiences of individuals. Each nomination is carefully considered by the Department, taking account of service records, health and fitness to travel and the broad selection criteria and recommendations made to me for final decision. (2) The Repatriation Commissioner wrote to some 240 relevant ex-service organisations of which nine were RSLs. (3) The Department does not have a record of surviving veterans of the Borneo campaigns so it is not possible to ensure that every veteran is aware of the commemorative mission. It writes to relevant ex-service organisations that disseminate the information. Where veterans are aware of missions and nominate themselves, the nomination is considered together with ex-service organisation nominations. Adelaide Airport (Question No. 1928) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Can he confirm whether Air Traffic Control for Adelaide Approach has been or is going to be moved to operate from another Australian city? (2) Was there an agreement in 2002 that Air Traffic Control would remain Adelaide-based for at least five years? (3) What are the financial savings from relocating Air Traffic Control from Adelaide? (4) How do other Air Traffic Control services compare to that provided at Adelaide in terms of safety and efficiency for light aircraft owners? (1) The Board of Airservices Australia considered the issue of consolidation of the Adelaide approach Terminal Control Unit (TCU) with the Melbourne air traffic control centre in August 2003. The Board further considered the matter at its November and December 2005 meetings and resolved to delay making a final decision on the TCU integration proposal for up to 12 months. The Board has indicated it needs more time to adequately examine detailed information about the rationale for the proposed integration and options in lieu of the integration proposal, as well as the potential impact on the feasibility and benefits of the integration proposal in the light of recent developments in the relationship between Airservices and the Department of Defence. (2) The Board’s 2003 decision stated that if there is to be any relocation, it would not occur before 1 September 2008. (3) Airservices Australia has assessed the potential financial savings from relocating Air Traffic Control from Adelaide to Melbourne at $3.0 million Net Present Value over 13 years. (4) In locations where remote TCU services have previously been relocated to a major centre, there has been no impact on safety. For example, Canberra relocated to Melbourne in 1995 and Coolangatta relocated to Brisbane in 1999. Airservices Australia advises that integration of both the Canberra and Coolangatta operations within the major centres has improved the capability to optimise the use of systems, staff resources and provided for better supervision of operations which delivers benefits to all sectors of the industry. However, Airservices recognises that technology advancements and the dynamism of the aviation environment may present options in lieu of TCU integration and will keep the matter under active consideration pending a final decision by the Board.",216,Questions In Writing
221,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:F3 Freeway-New England Highway Link (Question No. 2034) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 11 August 2005: (1) Did the Government identify $253 million in the AusLink plan for the highway link between the F3 Freeway and the New England Highway; if so, what sum was allocated for this purpose in (a) 2005-2006, (b) 2006-2007, (c) 2007-2008, and (d) 2008-2009; if no money was allocated in the forward estimates, can he explain why not. (2) Can he confirm that the cost of the project is being reviewed and substantial cost increases are expected; if so, who is undertaking the review and when will it be completed. (3) Is the Australian Government prepared to consider a larger commitment than $253 million; if not, can he say where the additional funding will come from. (4) Can he advise on the progress of negotiations between the Commonwealth and NSW on the AusLink plan. (1) Yes. In the AusLink Investment Programme provided to the New South Wales Government on 10 May 2005, funding allocations were: $14 million in 2005-06, $25 million in 2006-07, $40 million in 2007-08 and $162.7 million in 2008-09. (2) The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) undertook a review of the cost of the project, and produced a revised cost estimate of $765 million. (3) The AusLink White Paper released on 7 June 2004, stated that “Further funding for the F3 to Branxton project will be sought in future budgets subject to an agreement being reached with the New South Wales Government on funding shares as part of the state funding agreement.” However, speculation about the final Australian Government contribution to the project would be premature. The RTA is currently reviewing the project in conjunction with the Department of Transport and Regional Services. This will be the subject of further advice to the New South Wales and Australian Governments. (4) The NSW Government signed the AusLink bilateral agreement on 29 September 2005. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs (Question Nos 2169 and 2189) Mr Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 18 August 2005: (1) Has the Minister received any training, coaching or assistance in public speaking or voice projection at public expense since the Minister took office; if so, what was the cost of this training.

(2) Which programs identified in part (1) require the recipient to offer Australian Workplace Agreements as a condition of funding. (1) This information is available in a range of publicly available documents, including budget documents and annual reports. (2) Funding programs which include the condition that employees be given the option of the offer of an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA) are: higher education providers under the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements (HEWRRs). Institutions are required to offer AWAs to all new employees employed after 29 April 2005 and to all other employees by 31 August 2006. Until 30 June 2006, institutions are exempt from offering AWAs to casual employees engaged for a period of less than one month. The HEWRRs are provided for in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Act 2005 and the relevant guidelines; Australian Technical Colleges under the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Act 2005; and TAFE institutions -the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Act 2005 provides for financial assistance to the States and to other persons for vocational education and training. In order to be eligible for funding, States must implement workplace reforms in the vocational education and training sector, including ensuring that TAFE institutions introduce more flexible employment arrangements by offering AWAs to staff, except where making such agreements under the Workplace. Relations Act 1996 is not possible because of the corporate status of the TAFE institution, in which case other individual agreements should be offered. I am not aware of any other funding agreements which require applicants to offer AWAs.",218,Questions In Writing

Veterans’ Affairs: Benefits (Question No. 2409) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 10 October 2005: (1) Is she aware that a person’s marital status affects a number of entitlements under the Veterans Affairs Act. (2) Do the affected entitlements include maximum basic pension and allowance rates, and rates for other payments, eg, rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance, remote area allowance and telephone allowance. (3) Can she provide details on all the circumstances in which a married person or member of a couple receives a smaller benefit than a single person and the nature of that reduced benefit. (4) Is she aware of concerns that the reduced benefits operate as a disincentive to marriage. (5) Has her department costed removing the disincentives by paying a member of a married couple the same rate of benefit as a single person; if so, can she say what sum this would cost; if not, will she undertake to cost the abolition of reduced payments to members of a couple. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes, with the exception of telephone allowance, which is paid on the basis of one telephone subscriber per household, pharmaceutical allowance, which is paid on a family basis and utilities allowance, which is paid on a household basis. (3) The individual partnered pension rate is 83 per cent of the single rate. Additional allowances are paid on a household basis. Rent assistance has been structured so that a single person or a family pays on average the same percentage of the household income in rent. (4) The pension structure does not provide a disincentive to marriage because a couple who live in a marriage-like relationship are treated in the same way as a married couple. (5) No, as it is appropriate that the individual partnered rate is less than the single rate. Members of a couple enjoy economies in their domestic circumstances. Pensions and Allowances (Question No. 2410) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 10 October 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware that a person’s marital status affects a number of entitlements under the Social Security Act. (2) Do the affected entitlements include maximum basic pension and allowance rates, and rates for other payments, eg, rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance, remote area allowance and telephone allowance. (3) Can the Minister provide details on all the circumstances in which a married person or member of a couple receives a smaller benefit than a single person and the nature of that reduced benefit. (4) Is the Minister aware of concerns that the reduced benefits operate as a disincentive to marriage. (5) Has the Minister’s department costed removing the disincentives by paying a member of a married couple the same rate of benefit as a single person; if so, can the Minister say what sum this would cost; if not, will the Minister undertake to cost the abolition of reduced payments to members of a couple. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. The Social Security Act 1991(the Act) requires the Secretary (or Delegate) to determine whether a person is single or a member of a couple in order to calculate the rate of pension or allowance that is payable. A person who is in a marriage-like relationship is treated the same as a person who is legally married. (2) and (3) The social security system recognises that single people need more income to have a similar standard of living to couples. The rates of pension, allowance, rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance, remote area allowance and telephone allowance are all affected by a person’s status as a single person or as a member of a couple. (4) Under the Social Security Act 1991, the existence of a marriage-like relationship (whether a couple is legally married or not) is considered in determining whether a person is a member of a couple. There is no disincentive to marriage. (5) See (4). There is no disincentive to marriage. Refugees (Question No. 2420) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 10 October 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware that the Rural Australians for Refugees, who have been corresponding with individuals on Nauru, are concerned for the welfare of the remaining refugees. (2) Would the Minister advise what will happen to those refugees who remain on Nauru. (3) Can the Minister explain why some refugees have been granted TPVs and others have not.

The long term situation of the two persons remaining on Nauru will be resolved from Nauru. (3) All persons processed at the Nauru OPC, who were brought to Australia, received temporary visas. Those who were determined to be refugees received secondary movement (temporary) visas and those who were found not to be refugees received temporary (humanitarian concern) visas. Asylum Seekers (Question No. 2422) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 5 October 2005: (1) Is the minister aware of the recent statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) urging countries not to send Iraqi asylum seekers home, saying Iraq was too dangerous except in parts of the North. (2) How many Iraqi asylum seekers in Australia face possible repatriation to Iraq. (3) What steps are being taken in view of the UNHCR’s advice. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) I am aware of the September 2005 statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regarding the return of persons to Iraq. The Commissioner has requested that States continue to postpone schemes to promote or induce returns for persons originating from Southern or Central Iraq but has said that the voluntary return of Iraqis originating from the three Northern Governorates could be considered, provided they have family and community links that can ensure their access to protection, housing and other basic services. (2) and (3) Because of the ongoing situation in Iraq, and the advice of UNHCR, the Government is not enforcing returns to Iraq. This includes not promoting voluntary reintegration assistance packages to Iraqis, although these are available on request by individuals who wish to voluntarily return. If a person requests Australia’s assistance to return to Iraq they are given a copy of the latest UNHCR advice so that they can make an informed decision. Defence Medal (Question No. 2423) Mr Edwards asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 10 October 2005: (1) Does she recall the Government’s commitment in June 2004 to provide a new Defence Medal and to have application forms for the medal ready by the end of last year and the medal available by the middle of this year. (2) Can she provide details on the progress of the establishment of the medal. (3) Can she explain why the Government has not honoured its commitment to thousands of members of the Australian Defence Forces who have served since WWII and who are still waiting for the medal. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes, though the commitment was made on 11 July 2004; not in June 2004. (2) Creating a new medal is a lengthy process. From the time a medal is announced, it goes through an extensive process before it is issued. This includes Royal approval, consultation on eligibility and design, formal approval, tendering for manufacture, testing and manufacturing the medal before it is issued. The Request for Tender for the manufacture of the Australian Defence Medal was released on 20 October 2005. (3) The Government continues to honour all members of the Australian Defence Force, both past and present. The Government will begin issuing the medal when the medal has been manufactured and applicants for the medal have been assessed as eligible. The medal is expected to be available in the first half of 2006, subject to manufacturing lead times. Minister for Health and Ageing: Travel Advice (Question No. 2424) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 10 October 2005: (1) When did the Minister for Health and Ageing inform him of his intention to take leave for a family holiday in Bali, Indonesia, in September/October 2005. (2) Did he or his office suggest that the Minister for Health and Ageing should holiday at a location other than Bali in keeping with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) travel advice that Australians should defer non-essential travel to Indonesia; if not, why not; if so, what was the Minister’s response.

235,Mr Hockey,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followHoxton Park Airport (Question No. 2459) Mr Hayes asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 11 October 2005: Is Hoxton Park Airport classified for protection by Regional Rapid Deployment Teams; if not, why not. The Regional Rapid Deployment Teams deploy to security controlled regional airports in Australia. Regional Rapid Deployment Teams would not deploy to Hoxton Park airport because it is not a security controlled airport. In the event of an incident at the airport, the New South Wales police would respond, which is consistent with the National Counter-Terrorism Plan. Profiteering (Question No. 2462) Ms Hoare asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 11 October 2005: (1) Is he aware of reports that some airlines operating out of Bali had attempted to increase the price of flights returning from Bali following the recent devastating terrorist attacks. (2) What measures are in place to prevent organisations and individuals profiteering from incidents such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. (3) Will the Government introduce measures to restrict such profiteering; if not, why not. (1) I am not aware of any such reports. (2) The Trade Practices Act 1974 (the Act) is the Commonwealth legislation that generally regulates business transactions and provides protection for Australian consumers in a range of areas. Although there are no provisions under the Act that deal specifically with profiteering from incidents such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, the Act does prohibit the misuse of market power and therefore provides a mechanism for dealing with anti-competitive conduct. (3) Airfare prices are set by airlines and are commercial decisions for the individual companies. Although it is not the role of the Australian Government to control or limit the commercial decisions of the business community, the Government does expect that Australian companies will act ethically and not take advantage of people in traumatic circumstances caused by terrorist attacks or natural disasters.

237,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Is the Minister aware that for many parents the fees associated with child care nullify any financial benefit from working, particularly in part time employment. (5) Will the Government introduce a tax deduction for the costs associated with child care for working parents; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Government is investing a further $266.4 million in child care through a suite of child care measures that will support the Government’s Welfare to Work changes, including nearly 88,000 new places for Outside School Hours Care (OSHC), Family Day Care (FDC) and In-Home care. The additional places are expected to meet demand. (2) The Government provided an additional 84,300 Outside School Hours Care places, 2,500 Family Day Care places and 1,000 In-Home Care places over a four year period in the 2005-06 Budget. There is no limit on the number of long day care centre places that may be approved. The initial allocation of the over 17,000 Outside School Hours Care places occurred in November 2005. All confirmed demand was met. (3) The Minister is not aware of any studies that show increases in child care fees a contributing factor to parents not participating in the workforce. (4) The Australian Government provides support to families to assist with the cost of child care. All families who use approved child care are eligible to receive assistance in the form of Child Care Benefit (CCB). CCB is means tested and low income families receive the highest rate of CCB. CCB covers two thirds of the cost of care for low income families. CCB has a part time loading, in recognition that part time fees are sometimes more expensive than full time fees. In addition the Child Care Tax Rebate will provide working families with up to $4000 per child per year additional assistance for out of pocket costs per child. Furthermore, parents benefit socially and economically over the longer term from participating in the workforce. (5) The Howard Government introduced the Child Care Tax Rebate (CCTR), which benefits working families using care from 1 July 2004. Further questions on tax issues should be directed to the Treasurer.

Writing Services (Question No. 2536) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 31 October 2005: (1) Did the Australian Taxation Office enter into a contract with Evans-Smith and Dando Pty Ltd to provide writing services at a cost of $12,000; if so, what did Evans-Smith and Dando write under the terms of this contract. (2) Why was it considered necessary to engage an outside company to write this material. (1) Yes. Evans-Smith and Dando Pty Ltd were engaged by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to write the 2005-06 edition of Making it Easier to Comply, an annual corporate publication that reports to the community on the ATO’s progress and plans under its easier, cheaper and more personalised program. The total cost for the services was $11,616 (GST inclusive). (2) It was considered necessary to engage an outside company to write this material because the ATO did not have sufficient available resources with the necessary specialised skills to undertake the work in the required timeframe. Eleven Group Consulting (Question No. 2538) Mr Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 31 October 2005: Did the Minister’s department engage Eleven Group Consulting at a cost of $10,479.89; if so, what services were provided under the terms of this contract.",257,Questions In Writing
241,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has no record of engaging Eleven Group Consulting. Granther Group (Question No. 2539) Mr Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 31 October 2005: Did the Minister’s department pay the Granther Group $12,940 for symposium tickets; if so, (a) what was the title and purpose of the symposium, (b) how many departmental officers attended, (c) where was the symposium held; and (d) what other costs were associated with the symposium. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: No. Alcohol (Question No. 2540) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 31 October 2005: Why does the Government not require labels to be placed on alcohol containers in Australia warning women who are pregnant of the dangers associated with the consumption of alcohol using the same wording as the warning labels placed on alcohol containers by the Government of the United States. The development of food regulation policy, including labelling of food and drink, is a shared responsibility between the Ministers of the Australian Government, the states, territories and New Zealand. The Australian Government therefore can not unilaterally change food labelling and other food regulations. The mechanism for developing food policy guidelines that guide food standards development is undertaken by the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) undertakes the development of food standards. on alcohol beverages. The reasons for FSANZ rejecting the applications include that: studies on the effectiveness of warning statements on alcohol beverages have shown that while they may increase awareness, the increased awareness does not necessarily lead to a change in behaviour. The evidence even indicated that warning statements may result in an increase in the undesirable behaviour of ‘at risk’ groups; existing labelling requirements and public health programs and campaigns already provide information to enable consumers to make informed decisions about alcohol intake and prevent deception about the nature of the product; there has been a reduction in consumption and alcohol-related harm in Australia (between 1990 and 1997); and labels would be difficult to devise given the complexity of issues surrounding the use and misuse of alcohol, and the known benefits of moderate alcohol consumption.

242,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd (Question No. 2541) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, in writing, on 31 October 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware of the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in the case CEO of Customsv Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd and Anor [2005] NSWSC 948 and, in particular, paragraph 109 of the judgement referring to that part of the agreement between the Chief Executive Officer for Customs (CEO) and Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd which allows, if the CEO considers that on reasonable facts at any time that the information as to impecuniosity contained in the affidavit of Ms Khan (the director of Ozzy Tyre and Tube) is materially incorrect at the date of its making, the CEO to be at liberty to terminate the agreement and take such proceedings to recover the balance of any judgement sum. (2) Can the Minister confirm that (a) the Supreme Court found that Ozzy Tyre and Tube had evaded duty of $255,805.34 which it ordered to be paid and, in addition, imposed fines totalling $3,237,000, and (b) the agreement between the CEO and Ozzy Tyre and Tube provides for the $255,805.34 to be accepted as full settlement and the fines totalling $3,237,000 not to be paid on grounds of impecuniosity. (3) Is the Minister aware of the Australian tyre industry periodical Australian Tyre Dealer, Volume 14, Number 4, August/September 2005, which, on page 13, carries a one page advertisement titled ‘Ozzy Tyre Wants You!’ stating that (a) Ozzy Tyres is one of Australia’s leading tyre and wheel companies and is currently looking for dealers to join the company as franchisees, (b) Ozzy Tyres was established in Sydney in 1988 and its head office and flagship store is located in Liverpool, New South Wales, holding one of the best displays of wheels and tyres in Australia, and (c) Ozzy tyres has researched and developed a franchise system with its first franchise opening in Brisbane. (4) Will the Minister direct the CEO for Customs to review whether Ozzy Tyre and Tube is impecunious in light of its current franchise expansion plans as expressed in its advertisements in August/September this year; if so, when, if not, why not. (5) What action will the Minister take to ameliorate the damage Ozzy Tyre and Tube has inflicted on its competitors because it had been trading unfairly by not paying the proper customs duty on 18 shipments of tyres, wheels and other car parts. (6) Can the Minister say what damage Ozzy Tyre and Tube has inflicted on its competitors as a result of its illegal conduct; if not, what steps will the Minister take to find out. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, I am aware of the case referred to and of the terms of the settlement agreed to by the CEO of Customs and Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd and Lorene Khamis. (2) (a) The decision handed down by Justice Rothman imposed: penalties totalling $1,725,000 on the first defendant (Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd); and Penalties totalling $1,512,000 on the second defendant (Lorene Khamis). (b) The settlement sum agreed to by the CEO of Customs was $255,805.34 in full and final satisfaction of the judgement sum. The settlement terms also required the defendants to pay the legal costs incurred by Customs in this matter. In reaching this settlement, Customs accepted legal advice that a settlement involving guilty pleas and recovery of duty was the best available outcome given the complexity of the case and the lack of capacity for the defendants to pay the judgement sum. This settlement resulted in convictions against the Customs offences and",260,Questions In Writing

(3) Yes, I have viewed a copy of the advertisement referred to and have noted the claims made in this advertisement. (4) I have been advised that Customs are assessing whether there is cause to review the accuracy of the claims of impecuniosity made in the defendants affidavit. (5) The Customs offences involved in this case have been before the courts and the outcome is outlined in the answer provided at 2 a) and b) above. (6) The illegal conduct referred to has been dealt with by the courts, as outlined in the answer to Question 2. Employment and Unemployment (Question No. 2542) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 31 October 2005: (1) According to the most recent Australian Labour Force Survey, what proportion of employed persons reported that they worked (a) less than 5 hours, (b) 5-10 hours, (c) 11-20 hours, (d) 21-30 hours, (e) 31-40 hours, and (f) 41 or more hours in the survey period. (2) Can he say what proportion of employed persons reported that they worked (a) less than 5 hours, (b) 5-10 hours, (c) 11-20 hours, (d) 21-30 hours, (e) 31-40 hours, and (f) 41 or more hours in each other member country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). (3) How does Australia define ‘employed’ for the purposes of reporting employment statistics and when was this definition first applied. (4) Can he say which other OECD countries use the same definition of ‘employed’ as Australia for reporting employment statistics. (5) What is the (a) definition of ‘employed’ used for employment statistics and (b) latest published unemployment rate for (i) New Zealand, (ii) the USA, (iii) Canada, (iv) the United Kingdom, (v) Germany, (vi) France, (vii) Sweden, (viii) Norway, (ix) Denmark, (x) Netherlands, (xi) Italy, (xii) Japan, and (xiii) Korea. (1) According to the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) data, for September 2005, the proportion of employed persons who worked: (a) Less than five hours per week was 8.6 per cent; (b) Between five and ten hours per week was 5.7 per cent; (c) Between 11 and 20 hours per week was 9.9 per cent; (d) Between 21 and 30 hours per week was 10.8 per cent; (e) Between 31 and 40 hours per week was 34.8 per cent; and (f) 41 hours and over per week was 30.2 per cent. (2) My Department does not have hours data worked for each member country of the OECD. Accordingly, this matter should be referred to the ABS for further consideration. (3) The official measure of employment is compiled by the ABS from their monthly Labour Force Survey. In general terms, to be defined as employed, a survey respondent must have: Worked for one hour or more in the reference week for pay or profit, or for one hour or more without pay in a family business or on a farm; or",261,Questions In Writing
244,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Had a job, but were not at work in the week they were surveyed for one of a number of specific reasons (such as being on leave, on strike or locked out, stood down or away from work because of shift arrangements). This definition closely follows International Labour Organisation (ILO) guidelines, and has been essentially unchanged since the national Labour Force Survey was first undertaken in 1964. (4) The majority of OECD countries also have definitions of employment that closely follow ILO guidelines and, accordingly, are comparable with the definition used by the ABS (ie, that persons who work for one hour or more, or who have a job but are away from work for one of a number of specific reasons, are classified as employed). The countries that have a definition of employment comparable with Australia’s on which my Department has information are: Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The United States of America and Korea also have very similar definitions, but only classify unpaid family workers as employed if they work for 15 hours or more or 18 hours or more, respectively. It should be noted that unpaid family workers only comprise 0.001 per cent of total employment in the United States of America. Accordingly, this difference in definition will not have any significant impact on any international comparison. (5) (a) As noted above, most of the countries listed below have a definition of employment that is comparable with (or in the case of the United States and Korea, very similar to) that used in Australia (ie, that persons who work for one hour or more, or who have a job but are away from work for one of a number of specific reasons, are considered employed). My Department does not, however, have information on the definition of employment used in France. (b) The latest available data on unemployment rates for the following OECD countries (for 2004) has been extracted from the 2005 OECD Employment Outlook: (i) New Zealand– 4.0 per cent; (ii) the USA – 5.6 per cent; (iii) Canada– 7.2 per cent; (iv) the United Kingdom– 4.7 per cent; (v) Germany– 9.9 per cent; (vi) France– 9.6 per cent; (vii) Sweden– 6.6 per cent; (viii) Norway– 4.5 per cent; (ix) Denmark– 5.3 per cent; (x) Netherlands – 4.7 per cent; (xi) Italy– 8.1 per cent; (xii) Japan– 4.9 per cent; and (xiii) Korea– 3.6 per cent. Livingstone Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (Question No. 2546) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 31 October 2005: Did the Australian Taxation Office engage Livingstone Services (Aust) Pty Ltd for the sum of $12,000 to undertake an administrative investigation; if so, (a) what was the purpose of the investigation, (b) why was it necessary, and (c) will the findings be made public. Yes. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) engaged the services of Livingstones Australia Brisbane on a consultancy basis to undertake an administrative investigation. (a) The purpose of the investigation was to look into allegations and counter-allegations of harassment between two ATO employees. (b) The engagement of their services was necessary because the allegations have a history of several years and efforts to resolve the issue informally by senior management and human resource operatives have not been successful. The issues are complex and legal representatives are involved in the process. Because of this, and to provide impartiality, an external investigator was considered necessary. (c) The results of the investigation will not be made public, but will be considered by a senior ATO delegate. The report will form the basis for any further appropriate administrative action considered necessary. SX Trailers Pty (Question No. 2550) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 31 October 2005: Did his department engage SX Trailers Pty at a cost of $86,100 for a semi-trailer; if so, why was it necessary. Questacon – The National Science and Technology Centre, part of the Department of Education, Science and Training, did engage SX Trailers Pty at a cost of $86 100, the price of a new semi-trailer. This was necessary to replace a trailer used by the travelling Shell Questacon Science Circus that had become unserviceable and unsafe due to age, corrosion and mechanical failure. The original trailer was designed and manufactured in 1987. A custom-built trailer is essential for the transport, storage and promotion of a national touring programme known as the Shell Questacon Science Circus. The new trailer was purchased after investigating alternatives such as repairing the old trailer or leasing a general purpose transporter. A range of quotations was sought and assessed before choosing SX Trailers Pty as the supplier. The new vehicle enables Questacon, on behalf of the Australian Government, to provide a science education outreach programme to Australian rural, regional and remote communities. News Clipping Service (Question No. 2552) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 1 November 2005: Did his department pay Australian Associated Press a fee of $14,824 for more than 2500 press clippings in September 2005; if so, was this in addition to the research fee of $15,284 in August 2005. Yes. The department paid Australian Associated Press $14,824 (GST inclusive) for 2500 press clippings in September 2005. Yes.

247,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Child Care (Question No. 2558) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 1 November 2005: (1) Has the Minister read the article titled ‘Child care crying out for a proper accounting’ in The Sydney Morning Herald on 31 October 2005 which reported that the price of childcare had jumped 9.1 per cent in the year to September, more than three times the headline inflation rate, and that this gives credence to the claims that childcare is in crisis. (2) Can the Minister say what the factors are that have contributed to the inflation of childcare prices. (3) Can the Minister confirm that the childcare sector is in danger of collapse because of chronic labour shortages; if so, what is the Government doing to alleviate the shortage of childcare workers. (4) Can the Minister confirm that despite spiralling childcare costs, childcare workers can find better paid work in supermarkets or call centres; if so, what is the Government doing to ensure childcare workers are better paid. (5) Will the Minister rule out forcing sole parents to become family day carers; if not, why not. (6) Where are childcare supply problems most acute and how many new long day care places are required to address the supply shortage in (a) Australia and (b) the inner-West of Sydney. (7) What is the Government doing to increase the supply of childcare places in (a) Australia and (b) the inner-West of Sydney. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. The Minister notes that the child care CPI does not reflect the significant benefits of the Child Care Tax Rebate (CCTR), which will deliver additional assistance of around $1 billion over the four years to 2008-09. The CCTR is not taken into account because taxation assistance is outside the scope of the CPI. (2) Child care fees are not regulated by the Australian Government and are business decisions made by child care services. The Australian Government provides assistance to families through Child Care Benefit which is indexed to the CPI and the CCTR – a 30 per cent tax rebate of up to $4,000 per child, per year on out of pocket child care costs. (3) No. (4) No. (5) Yes. Parents entering the workforce will be supported with a range of employment options which they may consider. (6) Since 2004, the Government has met in full the confirmed demand for places from family day care and outside school hours care services. The Government has no limits on the number of long day care centres or long day care centre places that may be approved for the purposes of Child Care Benefit. (7) (a) and (b) Under the Howard Government, child care places have doubled to 600,000 compared to 306,000 in 1996. In successive Budgets in 2004 and 2005 the Government has made provision for a total additional 124,300 Outside School Hours Care places and 6,500 Family Day Care places to 2008-09. The government allocated over 17,000 Outside School Hours Care Places to services in November, meeting all confirmed demand. There are no limits on the availability of long day care centre places.",264,Questions In Writing

Ipswich Motorway (Question No. 2559) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, in writing, on 2 November 2005: (1) When will he announce funding for the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway which is a crucial link in the National Highway network and a Commonwealth Government funding responsibility. (2) How much longer will the people of Queensland wait to have what is widely regarded as the worse road in Queensland upgraded. (3) Is he aware that the Member for Ryan said on Gold Coast radio on 14 September 2005 that the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway must become a top priority and that funding should be made available for the full upgrade immediately; if so, why does he continue to ignore these pleas. (4) Can he confirm that the independent report released by the engineering firm Maunsell on the feasibility study of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and the half Northern bypass found that the Ipswich Motorway must be upgraded and that the full distance of 19km from Dinmore to Rocklea would cost approximately $1.1 billion, including $160 million to upgrade the Logan Interchange; if so, will he implement the independent report and commit funding to the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. (5) Can he confirm that (a) the funding required to complete the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is approximately $57 million per km, (b) the planning has been finalised, and (c) if construction were started immediately, the full upgrade could be completed by the end of 2010 and the Goodna to Gailes section could be completed by 2008; if so, can he say whether the Commonwealth has assessed the investment to be good public policy for the people of Queensland. (6) Can he confirm that the independent report released by the engineering firm Maunsell on the feasibility study of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and the half northern bypass found that (a) the half Northern bypass, which is only eight km in length, would cost approximately $1.061 billion excluding $160 million to upgrade the Logan Interchange, (b) this equates to about $142 million per km, (c) there is the need for a minimum of three years of additional planning required before design and construction can begin and, (d) if planning were to begin immediately, the project would not be completed until 2012. (7) Can he explain the huge disparity in cost and construction timeframes between the full 19km upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway and the 8km half Northern bypass. (8) Can he explain why the Commonwealth Government will not proceed with the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway immediately to provide immediate relief to the traffic problems which plague the area and consider options in relation to the need for a half Northern bypass later. (1) to (3) On 12 November 2005 the Prime Minister, the Honourable John Howard MP, announced that the Australian Government will allocate $320 million of the AusLink Brisbane Urban funding to upgrading the existing Wacol to Darra section of Ipswich Motorway. The total Australian Government funding now allocated to improving the Ipswich Motorway corridor is $556 million.",265,Questions In Writing
249,Mr Lloyd,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) The independent feasibility study of the Ipswich Motorway Northern Option identified three potentially feasible alignments and estimated construction costs of between $820 million and $1,137 million. These options require further investigation and planning. The study concluded that the existing Wacol to Darra section of Ipswich Motorway must be upgraded irrespective of the approach adopted for the Dinmore to Goodna section. The 12 November 2005 announcement by the Prime Minister recognises these findings. (5) The Queensland Government’s estimate of the cost of upgrading the existing Ipswich Motorway could be up to $1,098 million in 2005 dollars. I understand that this estimate has been confirmed by engineering consultants, Maunsell Australia. The Queensland Government has completed planning only and estimates that construction would take three years minimum using Design and Construction (D&C) procurement methods. (6) Further geotechnical and environmental investigation and planning is required. The Prime Minister announced on 12 November 2005 an additional $10 million of AusLink funding for investigation and planning of the Ipswich Motorway Northern Option between Dinmore and Gailes. It is likely that this will take a minimum of two and one half years. I understand that it is possible that construction could be completed in a further three and one half years using contractor alliances and concurrent planning. (7) Until such time as the further investigations referred to in (6) are concluded, it would not be appropriate to compare claimed costs for what may prove to be non-compatible (due to route choice, engineering solutions etc) potential projects. (8) Funding has now been provided so that the Wacol to Darra section of Ipswich Motorway can be upgraded without delay and further investigation and planning of the Ipswich Motorway Northern Option can proceed. Media Ownership (Question No. 2560) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 2 November 2005: Further to the answer to question No. 2371 (Hansard, 31 October 2005, page 129), can the Minister explain why she stated that she has nothing further to add to the information provided previously when this was the first occasion that I had raised this matter with her. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The honourable member’s question No. 2371 related to a former Bill to reform Australia’s media ownership laws. The Minister has repeatedly responded to questions on the issue of media ownership reform from the honourable member, indicating that the Government is considering how best to implement its commitment to reform Australia’s outdated media ownership restrictions. As part of this process, the Minister announced in November 2005 that a position paper on a number of media reform issues will be issued for public consultation early in 2006. Respite Care (Question No. 2561) Ms Annette Ellis asked the Minister for Ageing, in writing, on 1 November 2005: (1) Is she aware that the competitive tendering process used to allocate funding for Respite Care Services in the ACT resulted in the Saturday Dementia Program at the Burrangiri Crisis Respite Day Centre losing its Commonwealth funding and that it has since closed due to lack of funding.",266,Questions In Writing

(2) NRCP funding is not allocated through competitive tendering processes. The NRCP is a grant program and the usual method for allocating funds is through competitive application processes. (3) The RFA process for the NRCP was advertised nationally on 5 March 2005. Applications closed on 1 April 2005. There is no minimum time requirement for grant processes, but the four weeks allowed was more than the 25 day requirement for competitive tender processes. Organisations had been advised in January 2005 of the government’s intention to conduct a competitive application process. (4) to (7) A separate estimate of the availability of respite on any particular day is not available because a significant proportion of respite availability is for flexible care that is used on different days of the week depending on the requirements of individual carers. In addition, the Carers ACT Commonwealth Carer Respite Centre (CCRC) brokered respite for carers in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) according to assessed relative need.",267,Questions In Writing
251,Mr Abbott,"The Minister for Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourableNotes to parts (4) to (7): Answers reflect that assessments for funding under the RFA were made on the basis of assessed priorities within Home and Community Care (HACC) regions. The ACT is one HACC region. In the ACT, services commonly have a territory-wide catchment area and it is not possible to quantify carer uptake of services within specific electoral boundaries, nor postcode areas. Services are not approved on the basis of “places”, rather carer numbers and hours of respite provided are used. (8) (a) In the ACT, all 6 carers who were receiving respite from services unsuccessful in the RFA that ceased operating from 30 September 2005, are continuing to receive respite. (b) Organisations that were unsuccessful in receiving continuing NRCP funding received transitional funding until 30 September 2005. They were provided with information about alternative services for carers. It was up to individual carers whether or not they chose to accept alternative respite. Analysis Consulting (Question No. 2562) Mr Bowen asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 3 November 2005: Did the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission engage Analysis Consulting at a cost of $24,000; if so, what services were provided under the terms of this contract. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission did engage Analysys Consulting to undertake an assessment of the cost modelling submitted by SingTel Optus in support of its ordinary access undertaking for supply of the mobile terminating access service (MTAS). The $24,000 amount was a progress payment with the total contract value being $60,000. Consultancy Services (Question No. 2564) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 3 November 2005: Did the Australian Taxation Office engage the services of Grosvenor Management Consulting at a cost $11,550.01; if so, what services were provided under the terms of this contract. Yes. The Australian Taxation Office engaged the services of Grosvenor Management Consulting at a cost of $11,550.01 to review adherence by United KPFW (Now United Group Services Pty Ltd) to the terms and conditions of its contract to provide property services to the office. Small Business: Workplace Agreements (Question No. 2580) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 7 November 2005: (1) Is it the case that many small business owners currently rely on the award system as a benchmark for employee wages; if so, on what information should small business owners rely to determine the price of labour after the enactment of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. (2) Can he confirm the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 will allow workplace agreements that undercut awards; if so, can he explain why.",268,Questions In Writing
252,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,269,Questions In Writing
253,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The proportion of businesses with less than 20 employees that had their pay set by awards was 27.5 per cent at May 20041.. For businesses with 20 to 99 employees the proportion that had their pay set by awards was slightly higher at 31.2 per cent2. Therefore, the majority of small businesses with less than 100 employees have their pay set by agreements rather than awards. Under the Workplace Relations Amendment (WorkChoices) Bill 2005 (the Bill), minimum and award classification wages will be set and adjusted by the Australian Fair Pay Commission (the Fair Pay Commission). These wages will form the basis of the wage guarantee in the new Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (the Standard). Under the Standard, no employee who signs an agreement can be paid less than their relevant classification wage. Employees who remain award-reliant will continue to be paid their classification wage. The wage and classification details published by the Fair Pay Commission will have sufficient information for small business employers and employees to be able to determine the appropriate classification wage for their employees. (2) The Bill is designed to provide people with the choice of remaining under the award system or entering into a workplace agreement which tailors working arrangements to their particular needs and circumstances. In respect of workplace agreements, protection is provided through both the Standard and a number of protected award conditions. The Australian Government will enshrine in federal legislation, a number of key employment conditions: annual leave, personal/carer’s leave (including sick leave), parental leave (including maternity leave) and maximum ordinary hours of work. These conditions, together with basic rates of pay and casual loadings set by the Fair Pay Commission, will comprise the Standard. All new agreements will need to meet the Standard throughout the life of the agreement. In addition, the Bill will protect certain award conditions when new workplace agreements are negotiated. These award conditions are: public holidays, rest breaks (including meal breaks), incentive-based payments and bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates, shift loadings and overtime loadings. Employers and employees will continue to be able to vary these protected entitlement’s arrangements by agreement, as they can under the current system. However these specific award conditions can only be modified or removed by specific provisions in a new agreement. It is the Australian Government’s intention to provide certainty and clarity for employees and employers wishing to negotiate an agreement. In particular, any changes made to these protected conditions in agreements must be clearly identified so that the employees affected are aware of the modifications to their entitlements. ----------------1 ABS, Employee, Earnings and Hours (Cat.

Crisis Payments (Question No. 2584) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 8 November 2005: (1) In respect of the Crisis Payment review, (a) what was its purpose, (b) what were its findings, (c) was the cessation of the crisis payment discussed and is it being considered, and (d) will the Minister table the review? (2) Can the Minister explain why there is a disproportionate number of men compared to women who receive Crisis Payment grants? (3) Will the Minister list all of the circumstances under which people can successfully claim the Crisis Payment?",270,Questions In Writing
255,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) How many Crisis Payment grants (a) have been made in each of the last five financial years and (b) are expected to be made this financial year. (5) In respect of each grant of Crisis Payment for the last five financial years, what was (a) the age, (b) the sex, and (c) the state or territory of residence of the applicant, and (d) the reason for the application. (6) How is the availability of the Crisis Payment advertised? (7) How many (a) alleged and (b) proven perpetrators of domestic violence have received the Crisis Payment since the payment was established. (8) After perpetrators of domestic violence are removed from the family home and have received Crisis Payment grants, are their estranged partners who have remained in the family home also able to access crisis payments; if not, why not, and are they able to access any other payments. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The purpose of the review was to assess the effectiveness of the service delivery of Crisis Payment. (b) The report found that Crisis Payment was considered to be a valuable payment by both the community and the Centrelink network but that there was scope to streamline administration and better meet individual needs and community expectations. (c) There was no discussion of the cessation of Crisis Payment. (d) The review was an internal Centrelink review and there are no plans for the Minister of Family and Community Services to table this review. (2) There are more men than women granted Crisis Payment primarily because there are more male prisoners in Australia. The majority of Crisis Payments are granted to people on release from prison. In 2004-05 there were 45,804 Crisis Payments granted, of which 25,476 were granted to newly released male prisoners in comparison to 3,098 granted to newly released female prisoners. (3) Crisis Payment can be claimed where a person is in severe financial hardship and an extreme circumstance has forced their departure from their home, or on release from gaol or psychiatric confinement. (4) (a) Centrelink is unable to extract Crisis Payment data for the 2000/2001 financial years at this time. The data was recorded and stored in a different manner to subsequent years. Total Crisis Payments made in the remaining four financial years are as follows: 2001/2002 = 43,971 2002/2003 = 45,282 2003/2004 = 44,847 2004/2005 = 45,804 (b) Crisis Payment is not separately appropriated and therefore a forecast of the number of Crisis Payments to be paid in this financial year is not available. (5) The requested data for four financial years is listed in Attachment A. (6) Crisis Payment is marketed through a number of channels including: On the Centrelink website; In refuges, that is, equipping refuge workers with the necessary information to refer customers to claim a Crisis Payment; Welfare and Education areas in prison or psychiatric confinements;",271,Questions In Writing
256,Mr Hockey,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followDepartment of Family and Community Services Website; Welfare Right websites; Centrelink brochures and booklets (i.e. Are you in Crisis or Needing Special Help life event booklet); and Australian Services for Regional Australia website. (7) 74 crisis payments were made available to alleged and actual perpetrators of domestic violence. (8) Currently only victims of domestic violence who leave their family home and establish a new home are eligible for Crisis Payment. Section 1061JH(1) subsection (c) of the SSAct states that a person is qualified for a Crisis Payment if the person has established or intends to establish a new home. They are not able to access other social security payments in addition to their pension or allowance. Paying Crisis Payment to a perpetrator is also of benefit to the victim as it assists with the relocation of the perpetrator away from the family home. Communitites and Children Program (Question No. 2585) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 8 November 2005: (1) In respect of the Communities and Children program, (a) when did the program commence, (b) what sum was allocated for the program for each financial year since it commenced, and (c) how many applications for funding were (i) received and (ii) approved each financial year since it commenced.

(4) Will the Minister explain the process for applying under the program. (5) Does the Minister’s department exempt applicants from making a formal application for funding in any circumstances; if so, (a) in what circumstances, (b) how many programs or grant recipients have been funded without submitting a formal application. (6) Which departmental officers are responsible for making final funding selections and who approves the grants. (7) Will the Minister provide the most recent University of New South Wales (UNSW) and Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) evaluation of the program.

Media Ownership (Question No. 2596) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 8 November 2005: Further to the answers to question Nos 2322, 2323, 2325, 2368, 2369 and 2370 (Hansard, 31 October 2005, pages 126, 128 and 129), why does the Minister have nothing further to add to the information provided in relation to the Government’s agenda in respect of Australia’s media ownership laws, particularly as they relate to the public interest and future of our democracy. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Questions 2322, 2323, 2325, 2368, 2369 and 2370 have not varied in their substantive content. The honourable member has therefore been referred to previous answers to questions on the same topic. The Minister has repeatedly indicated in response to the honourable member’s questions on media ownership laws that the Government is considering how best to implement its commitment to reform Australia’s outdated media ownership restrictions. As part of this process, the Minister announced in November 2005 that a position paper on a number of media reform issues will be issued for public consultation early in 2006. Abortion (Question No. 2597) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 8 November 2005: Further to the answer to question No. 2148 (Hansard, 31 October 2005, page 107), is it the case the Government does not have a role in alerting Australian women; if not, why not. Although there have been some studies researching the link between abortion and premature birth risk, there is insufficient evidence of a clear causal link at this time to warrant government action in this area. Consistent with my previous answer to question No. 2148, it is the responsibility of the medical practitioner concerned to discuss the possible associated risks in the light of an individual woman’s circumstances as part of gaining informed consent to conduct any medical procedure. Consumer Medicine Information Scheme (Question No. 2599) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 9 November 2005: (1) What investigations has the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) undertaken in relation to the delivery of information to the public through the Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) process.

262,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) What evidence is available on (a) the level of public awareness of the scheme and (b) whether the scheme is meeting its objectives. (5) Has the scheme been advertised; if so, what sum was spent on it. (6) Is he aware that according to the Pharmacy Guild’s evaluation of the CMI program, only 33% of pharmacists reported that they always provided CMI the first time a consumer was prescribed a medicine and that only 16% of consumers in one year, and 21% of consumers in another year reported they had received CMI. (7) Can he confirm that the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia guidelines state that CMI should be provided 100% of the time to first time consumers and does the TGA formally monitor this process or have any checks and balances in place in relation to the CMI scheme. (8) What forms of monitoring of the CMI is undertaken by the TGA. (1) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) engaged the services of mpconsulting in November 2004 to provide advice to the TGA on the most appropriate means for improving consumer and professional access to web based copies of up-to-date Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) and Product Information (PI) documents. Following an initial exploration of some of the issues, mpconsulting prepared an Initial Discussion Paper in April 2005 to provide a basis for scoping further discussions with stakeholders. The Initial Discussion Paper Improving access to prescription medicines information is available on the TGA website available at: http://www.tga.gov.au/consult/index.htm and was subject to a period of consultation. The responses from that consultation are being considered and further work is to be undertaken on this issue. (2) The CMI scheme provides a payment to pharmacists to assist them to meet additional costs associated with printing and explaining CMIs. Pharmacists are required to certify every two months that they have provided CMIs in accordance with the provisions of the CMI scheme. (3) All prescription medicines must be supplied with a CMI document and the TGA reviews CMI documents as part of its evaluation process. The Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 set out the requirements CMI documents must meet and if assessors believe that CMI documents do not meet these they are ‘sent back’. CMI documents must also be consistent with the PI document for health professionals and therefore are regularly reviewed when changes to the PI document are made. (4) (a) An evaluation of the CMI scheme was undertaken by Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) under contract to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The TNS evaluation showed that in April 2004, 47% of consumers who had a prescription filled in the previous six months were aware of CMIs, compared with 41 per cent who were aware of the program in July 2003. (b) The main objectives of the CMI scheme are to promote the quality use of medicines and assist consumers to make informed decisions. The TNS evaluation showed that the majority of participating pharmacists are better equipped and more focused on providing their customers with CMIs. The evaluation report also showed that since the commencement of the CMI scheme, around 90% of consumers who were surveyed reported greater knowledge of the possible side effects and interactions of their medications. (5) The Pharmacy Guild promoted the CMI scheme in pharmacies in September and November 2002. Promotion to consumers included the provision of posters and cards displayed on pharmacy counters. Promotion to pharmacists included distribution of registration forms and program guidelines. A total of $42,618 (excluding GST) was spent on this promotion, for approximately 5,000 pharmacies.",280,Questions In Writing
263,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In June 2005, the Australian Government funded the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to organise the “Ask Your Pharmacist Week” information program. One of the aims of the program was to raise awareness of CMI. Key activities included raising public awareness and demand for CMI, and the development of new pharmacy and consumer CMI promotion materials. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia spent a total of $668,490 (excluding GST) on the “Ask Your Pharmacist Week” information program. The Australian Government funded National Prescribing Service promotes awareness of CMI through its Community Quality Use of Medicines Program. It is not possible to provide a specific expenditure figure for the CMI awareness activities undertaken as part of this program. (6) Yes. (7) The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) Pharmacy Practice Handbook 2000 states, in part, that “CMI may be offered to the patient each time a product is dispensed. Whether this is appropriate is a matter for professional judgement. Specific circumstances where CMI should be provided include when a medicine is first provided to the patient.” The TGA does not formally monitor this process. (8) See part (3).",281,Questions In Writing
