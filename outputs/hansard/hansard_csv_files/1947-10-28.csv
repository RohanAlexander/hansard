On the contrary, the Government has prohibited the export of tyres to that dominion. newspapers, a statement was published that the United States of America had lodged a large order for British motor cars. The item stated that motor cars would he exported from Great Britain to the United States of America at the rate of 500 a week. Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether these exports will affect the export of British motor cars to Australia? of any particular orders lodged by the United States of America for British motor cars, but I do not believe that they will interfere with Australian orders for British motor car chassis. Western Australian press there recently appeared a letter from Florence Hodd in which she stated that she had received a letter from Canberra relating to the launching of the Fourth Security Loan, and that the number of her Commonwealth Savings Bank pass-book was pencilled on the flap of the envelope, and that it is the function of the State authorities when she had complained to the manager of the bank he had replied that that was purely routine work. I now ask the Treasurer whether he has any knowledge of this practice on the part of Treasury officials, persons associated with the loan organization, or others. Will he say whether it is the practice to disclose the banking business of any person to those associated with the raising of war loans; whether such officials are bound by any oath of secrecy; and whether in view of the fact that the writer of the letter to' which I have referred regards the action as n threat, immediate inquiries will be instituted and a statement made to the Parliament? the particular matter to which the honourable member has referred. No instructions have been issued by the Treasury to the effect mentioned. If the honourable member will give me the address of the person to whom he has referred I shall have her complaint investigated, and will let the honourable member have a full answer in due course. I shall not, however, make any statement in the House on. the subject. New South Wales such as Broken Hill,, which are close to the border of another State are experiencing difficulty in obtaining building materials from adjoining States-thei r customary sources of supply-wil l the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction investigate the distribution of such materials in order to ensure that towns so situated shall be able to obtain supplies from the adjoining State, or alternatively, that they shall receive their quota from their own State? culties which towns such as the honourable member has mentioned are experiencing. In normal times BrokenH ill obtains its supplies of building materials from South Australia, whilst other towns in New South Wales, such as Wentworth, normally obtain supplies from Victoria. The responsibility of the Commonwealth in this matter is confined to the allocation of building materials as between States, and to allocatethose quotas as between individuals within their own boundaries. I do not know whether provision has been made for Victoria to supply such places as Wentworth or whether South Australia has arranged to supply Broken Hill, but I shall take the matter up with the State governments concerned. Should those governments not be prepared to make allocations of building materials to places in other States close to the border, I agree that some provision should be made whereby the New South Wales allocation will enable them to obtain supplies. representing the Minister for Supply and",12,Motor Vehicles Tyres Britis H Exports

12,Mr Mcdonald,"Will the MinisterShipping state unreservedly that there is, and will be, no discrimination in the allocation of petrol to candidates in the Victorian elections? the Minister for Supply and Shipping, and therefore I cannot give any definite assurance; but I should say that it would be very remarkable if the Minister would not be prepared to give an assurance of the kind asked for by the honourable member. a Liberal candidate in the Victorian elections was incorrectly reported in the morning press in Melbourne as being a Labour candidate. Consequent upon this mistaken report, this candidate received through the post a copy of the Labour party's "" Speakers' Notes"" for the campaign. This was addressed to him in an official "" O.HMS."" envelope bearing the inscription of the Premier's Department, and the postage stamp affixed to it had tie official ""O.S."" perforation. I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster General whether the Victorian Government has made any arrangement with the Postmaster-General's the use of official postal stationery and concessional postal rates for election purposes? Do these arrangements apply to all political parties and all candidates? Does the Minister think that Mr ColesI f no such arrangements have been made, what action has been taken to discontinue this misuse of public funds and official stationery? master-General to inquire into the matters which the honourable member has raised. My own supposition is that the practice which is being followed in Victoria to-day is the usual practice which -has obtained in all State elections, where the Premier of the day sends out from the Premier's office information which is calculated to return his government to power. Every Premier that I ever knew in Victoria did, and I assume that every Premier in every State since the institution of responsible government has done so. for Commerce and Agriculture informs me that a few years ago he received from the Leader of the Australian Country party some information which had been sent to him in an official envelope with an "" O.S."" stamp. I do not know the rights or wrongs of that particular incident; but if the honourable member for Fawkner wants an inquiry into that matter, we shall undertake it. I agree with the honourable gentleman in one respect, namely, that any Liberal party candidate who is described as a Labour party candidate has certainly been incoiTectly described. A. A. CALWELL, M.P. for Information and Immigration seen the following press report containing a statement alleged to have been made by Mr G. J. Coles upon his return from a business trip overseas:"" Britain's people are listless and apathetic, always filling in forms and generally living under a mass of red tape,"" he said. He said that moving from England to the United States was ""like coming from a cage to open country "". "" Everything in the United States is so free,"" he said, "" and business is Department for brisk and unrestricted."" '-' Although prices are high the average American working man buys more with hie money than any other working man in the world "". was correctly reported and has he any comment to make on the matter? that reported statement by Mr Coles, and I think it was a most unfortunate statement for him to make. The people of Britain are waging a strenuous struggle to survive, and any sneering statement of the kind mentioned is, to say the least of it, in very bad taste. Mr Coles happens to be a director of the National Bank, and that, perhaps, accounts for it. I travelled on the same ship from England to America as did Mr Coles. I did not believe, when I left England, that I was leaving a cage, and I did not feel, when I reached the United States of America, that I had got into open The Minister country.

The report also states that Mr Sandy Inglis, one of the British press correspondents present, walked out in protest against these remarks. Does the Minister think that he was rendering a service to Australia, Britain and the British Commonwealth of Nations by making a statement in another Dominion that the people of Great Britain are without spirit, hope or confidence ? the sort in the United States of America, Canada, or elsewhere. The honourable gentleman may wave that newspaper clipping as much as he likes; but of the hundreds of newspaper reporters to whom I spoke anywhere, that is the only reporter who attributed anything of that sort to me. I have never heard that stated before. At the press conference which I held in Parliament House, Ottawa, there were about 60 correspondents present, and that is the only newspaper which attributed anything of that sort to me. I praised the people of Britain, and said that all the peoples of Europe, including the British .people, were sufferpaid to the coal industry for the purpose ing grievously, that they were fatigued and very often when going home from work went to sleep because they were not properly nourished. I said that we were doing all we could to help them, and that if the gates of Europe were opened and sufficient ships were available, millions of people, including British people, would want to come to Australia. That is what I said, and that is what I stand byMrs. BLACKBURN -Some months Air aware that Trans-Australia Airlines ago I asked a number of questions with has fixed a later hour for the departure respect to Australian-manufactured tobacco smokers' pipes.

I have also been informed that during the months of July and August this year, imports of smokers' pipes have greatly increased. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs from what country .are these .pipes being imported, and under what wage conditions are they being manufactured? To what degree does the Minister believe these importations will affect workers at present employed in Australia in the manufacture of smokers' pipes?

43,Mr Dedman,"I noticed in theissued a denial. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has seen that denial; but I say emphatically that there has never been any question of the abolition of preference on canned fruits. That matter has never been discussed with' the Governments of the United Kingdom, United States of America or any other country. seen a press announcement by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Chandler, that the City of Brisbane and the Sydney Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board would have been successful in negotiating loans in the United States of America bad the Australian Government allowed them to go on the New York market? Alderman Chandler is reported to have stated further that, since the Australian Loan Council insisted on no competition, it must realize that the exercise of its authority implied acceptance of responsibility. If those statements are correct, does the Australian Government intend to take over outstanding loans in the United States of America of all local authorities, and grant them some relief by compensating them for the lower rates of interest they could have obtained in New York? If the Government does not intend to do that, will the Treasurer indicate the Government's policy towards the flotation of local authority loans in the United States of America? give the honourable member a detailed reply. The matter referred to by the honourable gentleman has been raised in the House before. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Chandler, went abroad with the desire of floating a loan for the Brisbane City Council in advance of a conversion loan that was to have heen floated in the United States of America on behalf of the Australian Loan Council. It is perfectly true that, as Chairman of the Loan Coimcil, I indicated to Alderman Chandler that the loan for the Brisbane City Council should not be proceeded with. There was also some difficulty about a loan for the Sydney Metropolitan Water and Sewerage* Board. In each case, action was taken to ensure the best possible terms in the United States of America for not only governmental conversion loans, but also loans on behalf of local authorities. I will give the honourable gentleman the story in detail; it is a fairly long one. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether he is able to provide any sacks for the potato harvest in northern New South Wales where the crop of potatoes intervenes between crops in other parts of Australia. It bridges the gap between them and usually takes about a month to be consumed, so that the sacks required for it would be in use for only four or five weeks. I have received telegrams on this matter from all parts, of the northern rivers area of New South Wales, where this special crop of potatoes is grown. Unless sacks are obtained, the crop will be wasted and people in the cities will have to go without potatoes. Can -the Minister help? will be made to meet the requirements of the potato-growers of northern New South Wales. I have discussed that matter with tlie Australian Potato Committee and have asked it to do its best for the growers. the Minister for Labour and National Service arising from the wheat-growers' concern about the shortage of labour for rural industries. I have received a letter from a prominent official of the Farmers and Settlers Association at Grenfell containing this passage I would foe pleased to know on what conditions these city men will accept harvest work at 50 hours a week, and what w ill be the position of the fanner if labour supplied is 'not satisfactory. Would they accept work at the rural harvest award and hours? The writer also made comments in the letter which the Minister might like to read.

This subject has also been raised on several occasions recently by the honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Wimmera. At present, the Department of Labour .and National Service has organizers engaged in canvassing employers in districts where wheat, dried fruits, sugar, peanuts and many other primary products are grown. The department hopes to be able to organize labour with the co-operation of employers' groups in those districts. If , as the honourable member suggests, the regular forces will not be sufficient to harvest the crops, the department will try to organize any other kind of labour available. That is one of its responsibilities. labourers work will be governed by the awards covering the respective industries. There is a harvest award. will be sent to the districts where the employers co-operate by supplying the information which is being sought by the department's organizers. We expect employers to pay award rates and to do their best to secure accommodation for tbe workers. the Prime Minister been directed to figures which the Commonwealth Statistician released recently, disclosing, that among other things, there was a substantial decline during August of the production of meat, gold, tobacco, cigarettes, bricks, cement plating sheets and black coal? If so, will the right honourable gentleman tell the House the reasons for this decline ? If he is not able to give the with the details of the matter mentioned information at the moment, will he have inquiries instituted with a view to remedying the position, and stepping up the production of these essential items? Will he also make a statement to the House on this matter at an early date ? Commerce and Agriculture will answer the question. off in the export of meat is due to the most bountiful season, which shows promise of a plentitude of green feed late into the year. The result is that graziers and farmers, quite naturally, are holding their lambs, sheep and cattle for a longer period than they would in normal seasons, which end much earlier. The season is such that the grass seed menace, which forces producers to market their lambs early if they do not propose to shear, is now absent. The present fallingoff has distinct advantages because many of the lambs will yield additional quantities of wool, and when carried forward for a longer period, will put on more weight. Thus increased supplies of meat will be available for the people of the United Kingdom. The net result is that Conditions under which such during this year the people of the United Kingdom will receive more meat from Australia than they would in a normal season because the export of meat terminates much earlier in normal seasons. inform me whether American ex-servicemen undergoing rehabilitation training courses at Australian universities and technical colleges in Australia are to be taxed upon the subsistence allowance paid to them by the United States Treasury?

The committee which I mentioned is examining only the finances of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and I understand that its report w ill be available in approximately one month. issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, under the heading "" Sacks for Harvest: Wheat Board Moves"", states that 7,000,000 additional cornsacks are to be imported from India in an effort to cope with the State's expected record harvest of wheat. The report goes on to stateHowever, because 6,000,000 of the promised bags cannot roach Australia until early next year, farmers still have to find temporary emergency storage for about 25,000,000 bushels. Can the Minister inform the House the approximate date on which the 6,000,000 «acks are expected to arrive, and how long is it anticipated that farmers w ill require to make provision for temporary storage on their farms because sufficient sacks have not yet been provided by the Aust r a l i a n Wheat Board? has done everything possible to ensure the availability of adequate supplies of jute and cornsacks. B y close personal negotiation with the Indian Government, and by adopting a long-range forward purchasing policy, it has bought considerably more jute goods for shipment to Australia in 1947-48 than has ever been shipped to this country in any previous year. As However, it is a fact a result, there will be imported during the current year an all-time record quantity of 130,000 tons, compared with the average of 93,000 tons during the years 1936 to 1938. This 130,000 tons represents every ton of jute goods available to Australia., and places us in a most favorable position compared with other countries. The Government decided upon the policy of forward purchasing early this year, and also made arrangements with the Indian Government for a special increase of the Australian quota. It was anticipated not only that all Australian requirements would be met, but I am endeavouring also that a saving of more than £1,000,000 would be effected by purchasing in advance of the recent increases of Indian prices. The Government jute purchasing plan, which was introduced in 1940, has enabled Australian .requirements of jute goods to be met in each year since it was introduced, and it w ill be continued until the stage has been reached that sufficient stocks have been accumulated and private traders are in a position to resume purchasing. So far, on account of the financial risks, the jute trade has been unwilling to assume this responsibility, and only the operation of the Government's plan has ensured our having obtained Australia's needs of these vital goods. The figures in regard to cornsacks are interesting. The purchases for 1947-48 total 78,000 tons or 260,000 bales, compared with an average importation of 55,000 tons or 182,000 bales in the three years 1936 to 193S. There may be some short-term shortages owing to shipments running a little late, but the latest advice is that the leeway in shipment is being overcome, and shipments w ill be arriving",19,Income Tax Americanex Servicemen

The anticipated huge crop in New South Wales has presented this year an unprecedented problem in supplying cornsacks to meet the excess over what can be handled through the silos; special arrangements have been made in this regard. . On behalf of the Government, I acknowledge the splendid co-operation of the Government of India in facilitating supplies of jute goods in response to Australia's requests. Mr K. Punjab, Indian Secretary for Pood, and Sir Raghunath Paranjpye, Indian High Commissioner in Australia, have rendered most valuable assistance in this connection. Australia, in turn, has assisted India in meeting its foodstuff requirements, principally of wheat. Thus the two countries, by helping each other, have proved in the final analysis to have helped themselves. This is an excellent example of the benefits of reciprocal trade between two great dominions. for Commerce and Agriculture whether the Governments of India and Pakistan have asked the Australian Government to make available to them increased quantities of Australian wheat and other grain ? Can the honourable gentleman say what stage the negotiations have reached? In view of the surplus of grain sorghum in Queensland, will he consider lifting the embargo on the export of that commodity. .=o as to enable the surplus to be shipped to India and Pakistan? . of India, and Pakistan have asked the Australian Government to provide the maximum quantity of wheat that it can supply to them. The quantities that can be supplied have not yet been determined, an'd they will be the subject of negotiations in the near future. In regard to grain sorghum, I point out to the honourable gentleman that during the period oi' tlie drought, vast quantities of grain, mainly ""wheat, on which the Australian Government had paid a Bat rate subsidy of Is. '6d. a bushel, were ordered from Victoria. South Australia and other -States, so as to assist the people of New South Wales and. Queensland. That subsidy has cost the Australian Government £1,850,000, and it has been of direct assistance to the stock-feed industries in those States. Now that there is every prospect of a surplus of wheat in Queensland, and the cry of the world is that wheat shall be a priority grain, it is expected that the quantity of grain sorghum remaining in Queensland can be absorbed for stock-feed purposes, and that maximum quantities of wheat can be exported instead. As nearly 3,000,000 bushels of grain sorghum have gone into consumption since the last crop was harvested, it is anticipated that there will be no difficulty in disposing of the 1,000,000 bushels which, it is estimated, is at present in Queensland. There has been great pressure on the Government to permit exports to be made. That proposition, we can well understand, is most attractive to the grain sorghum suppliers. Minister what action the Government has taken to investigate the enormous growth of the number of Commonwealth employees, especially those who are employed in government departments?

[4.0] I On such a momentous occasion it is proper that I should quote the opening lines of Lincoln's famous Gettysburg address in which he said, inter aliaFour-score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on. this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether this or any nation so conceived and dedicated can long endure. Those words were spoken on a famous battlefield at the conclusion of a successf ul campaign for the abolition of slavery and the institution of freedom. T n reverse order, the fight that is now being waged on the Australian continent through the medium of this bill is almost a re-enactment of that scene. I recall the prophetic words"" Testing whether this or any nation so conceived and dedicated can long endure "". The testing is that our fight is for the retention of freedom against the proposal to introduce a system of regimentation, which is akin to slavery. Not only Australia, but also other countries, know that the fight for the retention of freedom will be just as",21,Appropriatio Nbill 1947 48

70,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [4.2],"Qstrenuous as was the fight for the abolition of slavery, but with this difference-that the weapons used will be tongue and pen instead of sword and pistol. In spite of the fact that from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the people of Australia recognize that democracy is threatened in this country, today, spokesmen for the Labour party persist in ignoring the principle inherent in Lincoln's conception of democracy. They pretend to believe, and they try to make intelligent people believe, that this is just a simple little measure, the trading banks versus the people. regularity with which the depression of the early 'thirties is imported into debates of this kind, and ascribed to the maladministration of the trading banks, is deplorable in. more ways than one. En the first place, such a statement cannot withstand five minutes of fact-finding examination; secondly, it indicates a complete lack of imagination and of constructive thinking; and thirdly, what is more alarming to Australia in this period of transition is the fact that in the consideration of a measure which may have far-reaching and even detrimental effects on the national economy, and, indeed, on a world economy which is now struggling for equilibrium, spokesmen on behalf of the Labour party can be so forgetful of their responsibility as individuals and as a corporate body that they can play the party-political game. Why? Because, in my belief, they lack the courage to get behind their constituents in this fight against the dictatorial edicts from their party machine. We may ask ourselves, "" Can we blame them?"" I frankly admit that if the position were reversed, and I found myself in the unenviable position of having to defend a. measure of this description, my defence would probably be equally futile and my remarks just as puerile as the statements which issue from time to time from government spokesmen hoth inside and outside this House. We can. blame them because we know that it is merely an attempt to fulfil the provision of what is now known as the socialist plot, hatched in 1921, to which every member of the Labour party pledged himself-let , us hope without realizing the seriousness of its import. The bill which was awaited with so much apprehension, irritation and impatience by the Australian people has at last been brought before the Parliament. It has satisfied every pessimist in the country; it is just as bad as he expected it to be. In my opinion, it contains something which is contemptible and extremely offensive. It is contemptible in the clauses which seek, to appease individuals, and even institutions, which have expressed hostility to the measure. These individuals must be warned that, whatever the methods employed, the end and The monotonous the objective will be the samea socialist state with all its humiliating possibilities. We all remember the Nuremberg trials at which certain convicted persons were sentenced to be hanged. Army personnel protested against the sentence, and pleaded to be shot instead of hanged. The end and-the objective would have been the same, but probably one method would have been a little less ignominious than the other. It is the same with this bill. Any one who succumbs to the lure of this sugar-coated pill will, metaphorically, be accorded the dignity of being shot instead of hanged. The offensive clauses postulate the belief that there is a price at which Australians are prepared to sell or sacrifice their freedom. Whether we like it or not, the major significance of this debate is not this miserable bill, but whether a free people in a free country shall remain free, or become little tin marionettes, dancing whenever the strings are pulled by the most totalitarian government that this country has ever known. This measure to me is easily recognizable as a major step in Labour's ultimate objective to destroy the federal system, the form of government which we ""now enjoy, and to substitute for it a system of unification. This action, which I describe as the most brazen yet attempted, has been preceded by many others-importan t in themselves, but which, compared with the arrogant assumption of dictatorial power inherent in this measure, are of minor importance, and were in the nature of a "" try on "" to test public reaction. Prominent among these legislative stepping stones was the uniform tax legislation of 1945-46, which has made mendicants of the States. That measure passed through this House with the greatest possible ease, and the ease with which the Parliament accepted the repudiation oi the written word and promise of two responsible Ministers has encouraged the Government to this greater arrogance. To use a colloquialism, it has encouraged the Government to "" turn on the heat and we are now faced with a situation which, if not thwarted, may have catastrophic consequences to the future of a hitherto free nation. If the Government's case is to stand at for all, it must stand on a basis of truth. The he will vote against it. Contrast the oft-repeated innuendoes by spokesmen of belief in this principle which I have just the Labour party that this bill is necesenunciated with the easy assumption by sary in order to ward off another depresthe political wing of the Australian sion is definitely not the truth. The Labour party that, because it is statement that the trading banks control believed that a power exists under credit, and may use this power against the Constitution, a party,, when it the interests of the nation, is not true. It gets into office, has a perfect right is rather a desperate defence designed to to meet a desperate situation. In other the people want it or not-in fact, to words, it means that the people, who have exercise it in utter contempt of public been very good to the Labour party, have opinion.

These spokesmen, desperate in intends to socialize industry, and the guilt, are trying to brazen it out by means of production, distribution and exmanufacturing evidence which, has no change, it has a mandate from the people basis in reality and, like the dictators of to perpetrate the outrage now contemthe past, these would be dictators of the plated. In point of fact, I will prove present and future are finding it that the Australian Labour party, increasingly necessary to stage circuses in through its leaders, has never sought such order to keep themselves in the limelight. a mandate-that it has, in fact, a manStrangely enough, the Minister for date to do the exact opposite. In order to Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) do that I will drag up a. few ghosts of and I are agreed on the proper method of the past-a t a most convenient time to procedure in matters of this kind. In haunt those who stray from the path of Hansard, volume 186, page 1286, the virtue. First, I will quote the following, Minister isrecorded as sayingThe Labour party is uot ashamed of its socialistic objective, and what is more, we have never been ashamed of it. I do not see any reason why ' the electors, when they are ready to accept socialization . . . should not have the right to do so under the Constitution. That would not be a matter for this Government, or for the Australian Country party, but for the people themselves to determine. The Minister may complain that, t have quoted a paragraph divorced I turn back now to 1911, when Andrew from its context, but there is no Fisher was Prime Minister. He said that escaping the conclusion that the Minthe Commonwealth Bank was not to disister meant that, when the people were place, but. to compete with, the trading Mv. Roirdni. ready to accept socialism, it was for them to move, in the matter, and not for any government or any political party to do so. I agree with that, and I assert as a general premise that, in spite of the conferring of powers, and in spite of the written word, when it comes, to fundamentals the only true constitution in democratic politics is' that founded on public opinion. The Minister and I are quite agreed on that, but there the similarity between us ends. I believe in it, and. I will vote it;, he believes in it, but exercise that power whether which is printed under the headline "" Plan of Action ""(T) The operations of the Commonwealth Bank to be removed from and made entirely independent of private banking interests and free from sectional influences or constraint; and (3) Expansion of the Bank's business as a trading bank, with branches in all suitable centres in vigorous competition with tlie private banking establishments. banks. More recently, the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), in his policy speech of 1931, said that the Commonwealth Bank was intended to be a trading institution, and to operate freely in competition with the trading banks. Again, in his policy speech of 1.934, tlie right honourable gentleman saidThe bank will ibe free to enter upon a policy of vigorous competition with the trading banks. We now come a little closer to the present-to 1937. The then Leader of the Australian Labour party, the late John Curtin, saidThe bank's business as a trading bank should be expanded, with brandies in all suitable centres in vigorous competition with the private banking establishments. Tn the Melbourne TownH a l l , on the 9th September, 1946, the present Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), saidWe have too much respect for the people -of Australia to be politically dishonest. T am waiting to find out how, in view of that statement, he is going to j u s t if y the present bill. All this shows that the leaders of the Labour party have never sought the mandate they claim, and that they have, I repeat, a mandate to do tbe exact opposite from what they are proposing to do. The elaim is so false that we can understand its being made only because it facilitates a convenient repudiation of another plank in the same party's platform. I refer to paragraph d, of plank 3, which states the belief of the Labour party in the initiative, referendum and recall. In deed, it demands the acceptance of that principle. Now, however, it is very convenient to forget that plank, when the people are clamouring for the very thing in which the Labour party professes in its platform to believe. It is necessary to draw a distinction between a political platform and a policy, so that we may make it easier for the people to understand the present issue. A platform, as all honourable members know, is a document drawn up by the inner council of a party and later submitted to a general convention of the same party, and endorsed at that convention ; but it is a. document which is nover submitted to the people for endorsement, and, consequently, is not approved by the people. On the other hand, a policy is a programme designed to meet the requirements of the present and immediate future, and it is the policy, not the platform, of a party which receives the endorsement of the people. The platform seldom, if ever, changes: but the policy changes from election to election. Therefore, the people understand the falsity of the claim made by honourable members opposite that they have a mandate to nationalize the banks. The falsity of that claim w ill be admitted by all who are not completely biased. The Government's refusal to meet the demand by the people for a referendum is understandable, because of two important factors. First, the Government ' knows that it would be soundly thrashed if it took a referendum: and, secondly, it is hoping that time will tend to allay public suspicion. We have all heard the saying ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a c r o w n "" ; I do not think that such uneasiness is to be compared with that which several honourable members opposite face in the future. Their hopes for the future are based on one of two contingencies, either, that the redistribution of electoral boundaries will favour them, or, that their old* friend political apathy w ill come to their assistance. To show that this is their line of l-easoning I shall quote the following from The Socialist Ploti n Action. published in 1921 by Mr Wentworth. The rules are only few in number, but they will have a familiar ring in the ears of honourable members. They are1. Wherever possible, introduce Socialist measures under other names, so that their .real character can be disguised. Use the excuse of some temporary emergency to introduce surreptitious socialization. 2. Where it is impossible to disguise a measure's real character, introduce it well before the election And this is what I emphasize when I sa.y that honourable members opposite hope that their old friend political apathy will come to their assistancein the hope that it will not be remembered when polling day conies round. 3. When an openly Socialist measure has been pushed through Parliament, operate it as little as possible until after the next elections. It will then be thought that the original outcry against it showed ""groundless alarm"". With an election safely passed, the measure can then be brought into full operation. 4. Ou no account ask for a mandate for Socialism. Pose always as a "" sane moderate, keeping tlie extremists at bay"". How familiar that isDo not make Socialism an election issue. There we have briefly set out the modus operandi for the implementation of the Socialist plot. The basis of the hope of those who perpetrate outrages of this description is that the people will forget their action by the time the next general elections are held. This legislation is one of the' greatest deceptions that any party has yet attempted to perpetrate upon the Australian people. They are asked to believe that communism is not making any strides at all in Australia. Honourable members opposite glibly point to the fact that Communist candidates lose their deposits at every general election. winning of elections as of secondary importance. Their main idea is to have their policy implemented; and can any one deny that nationalization of the banks is one of the major planks of the Communist platform 1 I believe also that the candidate who stands as a Communist at electipns is merely a decoy, his purpose being to ensure the election of the socialist who masquerades as an Australian Labour party candidate. That is a clear deception on the part of the full-blooded socialist who pretends to be a sincere democrat. However, the people danced to the tune which was called hy the Labour party, and I believe that we shall now be forced to pay the Communist piper. But if Government supporters depend upon political apathy to come to their assistance on this occasion, they are doomed to disappointment; because to-day our people exhibit a belated appreciation of the warning given by Mr Winston Churchill when he saidBeware of a state of society in which none but politicians a-nd bureaucrats will count in a. condition of affairs in which enterprise gets the management of the bank should be no encouragement and thrift gets no reward. If that is not an apt description of Australia to-day, it w ill be if ever this measure becomes operative. I shall now deal with some of the excuses offered of this measure; Mr Bowden. first with the weakest of all of them, the one propagated most assiduously by members of the Labour party, who flounder for reasons for this action, namely, that the Commonwealth Bank is not in a position to compete w it h the trading banks because it was strangled in 1924 by the Bruce-Page Government. Honorahle members opposite make a particularly unfortunate choice in the periods they select for their f a i r y stories; because it is unchallengeable that for industrial, commercial and social expansion this period in the 'twenties has no parallel in Australian history. But let us consider the process of strangulation. In 1922, two years before the stranglers got to work, the assets of the Commonwealth Bank were valued at £134,000,000. In 1932, eight years after the stranglers had heen operating, the bank's assets were valued The Communists regard the at £248,000,000, or £114,000,000 more. In 1942, ten years later still, the value of the bank's assets had increased to £481,000,000, or by £233,000,000 in that decade, and £347,000,000 more than its assets were valued at twenty years earlier. In the same period the staff of the Commonwealth Bank increased from 1,800 to 6,300. And I want honourable members to note particularly this sign of decay:. Whereas the profits of the bank in 1922 amounted to £405,000, they amounted to £726,000, or £321,000 more, in 1932, and to £951,000 in 1942, or £546,000 more than in 1922, when the stranglers were supposed to get to work. My only comment on those figures is that if such development can be correctly described as strangulation, the sooner the same process is applied to other governnnent instrumentalities the better it w ill be for the taxpayers of this country. What is more significant still is that in 1929-30 the Scullin-Theodore Government introduced a bill to establish a central reserve bank. That Government forced the bill through this House and proposed that conducted by the same gang of alleged stranglers as had been appointed by the Bruce-Page Government and obtained from exactly the same source. This indicates to me that prominent Labour men for the introduction do not believe one syllable of the propaand I shall deal ganda they issue for public consumption from time to time. They know it is completely false, but they are so unfair to the innocence of the elector that they t r y to poison his mind w i th lies in order to encourage him to vote for them.

""What a beanfeast the Labour party would have had had there heen a rush on the banks at a time when advances exceeded deposits and had the banks been forced to say to their depositors, "" We are sorry; we have lent all our money to the Government and to industry, and we cannot pay you "". Labour supportei'9 would have immediately characterized that as a repetition of the repudiation of 1S93 and would have said, "" We must smash the private banks "" ; but because that did not happen Labour still proposes to smash the private banks. It will he seen that the excuses offered by the Government will not do. In my view there is something more sinister behind the move to eliminate the trading banks than the mere implementation of a traditional Labour objective. It .is on all fours with Labour's objective to eliminate private enterprise, wherever it exists, in order to establish a socialist state. It unquestionably had its origin in. Soviet policy as announced by Lenin in 1917, when, in addressing a Bolshevist conference, he used these wordsWe are all agreed that the fundamental first step in this direction must be such measures us the nationalization of the banks and the trusts. Let us put into practice these and similar measures, and we shall see . . . We cannot at once nationalize the small consumers' concerns-i.e. , those with one or two employees-no r can we at once place them under a real workers' control. And .listen to thisBut the role of these small niuii can be made vanced to farmers on the security of small to the vanishing point, and through the nationalization of the banks they can be tied hand and foot. Undoubtedly that was the origin of this measure. I intend now to show how necessary trading banks have been to the progress of this country. The only gauge for the future, after all, is a consideration of the mistakes, and a study of the precedents, of the -past. I propose only to give one or two examples to make my meanings clear. The first concerns a public instrumentality. Commonwealth Bank refused to take over a Melbourne Harbour Trust loan of £600,000 maturing in London. The loan was eventually taken over by one of 'the trading banks without any demur; but Mr Bowden. the point I wish to make is that even with the excellent security offering, the Commonwealth Bank was not prepared to take up that loan. Had there been no private banks what would have been the result? Stagnation in the harbours and in Melbourne. The importance of private trading bank competition is emphasized by this further example: In 1938, the Commonwealth Bank refused an advance of £3,000 to the Chicory Board of Victoria, which had taken delivery of 400 tons of chicory from growers. The board had to approach a private trading bank, which readily made the necessary credit available and so enabled the board to satisfy the growers. The interesting point is that the chicory was worth £40 a ton, or a total of £16,000; yet that was not sufficient security for an advance of £3,000 from the Commonwealth Bank! Had the services of a private banking institution not been available, the board would have had to put that huge quantity of chicory on the market to be snapped up at whatever price the traders were prepared to pay. WhilstI believe that all people will suffer to a greater or lesser degree should this measure become operative, no section of the public will be more inconvenienced than the farming community, because in no other phase of industry is goodwill between banker and client more in evidence than in farm finance. Millions of pounds have been adtheir own integrity, and this treatment cannot be continued by a regulationcontrolled institution no matter how sympathetic the banker may be. Of course, the Government probably intends to relieve farmers of the obligation to manage their own businesses, because just as a lack of a mandate from the people has not prevented the introduction of this measure, the lack of a mandate will not prevent the socialization of production, and this would involve every primary producer in the community. It must be In 1931, the accepted as axiomatic that monopoly control of money means monopoly control of every human activity, and if we are foolish enough to let this -Government or any government regiment the people's money, the order of priority for the extension of the "" blessings "" of socialism to other industries will be relatively unimportant, because all will be completely hamstrung by the monopoly control of money. ""We .can imagine the insurance companies and the major industries coming automatically within the socialist edict, but the "" small people ""-whic h includes every farmer ' in the community whose love of freedom is indicated by his choice of calling, the soldiers of two world wars who have maintained the freedom of Australia on two occasions at a tremendous cost in blood and treasure, and the ordinary man in the street who is proud of his right to say, "" I shall do as I please "" zens of this country control of the nation's -must , according to Lenin, be shackled hand and foot by a dictatorship to render them more easily subservient to their own servant, the Government. I have received thousands of letters and petitions on this subject, many of them bitter in their denunciation and despairing in their sense of betrayal by this Government. Honourable members opposite argue that signatures to petitions have been obtained under duress; that bankers have stood over their clients and said, "" If you do not sign this we shall do something unpleasant to you "". But that argument is strangely at variance with the claim, that under Labour administration, primary producers have paid off their overdrafts and are far better off than ever before. It is twisted logic that can be suited to any circumstance, and it is a gratuitous insult to hundreds of thousands of honest people. To these honest people I say"" You have begun the fight by demanding a referendum. Continue that fight; you will never have an issue more worthy of your best efforts. A cardinal principle of democracy is that a government must be the servant, and the people the masters. If you permit that principle to be reversed, you will be recreant to your obligations to future generations, and you will be sacrificing the greatest heritage that your forefathers have entrusted to you-the heritage of freedom."" -Order! The honorahle member's time understand-term s of bread and butter. has expired. to support the bill. I should like to refer manual, applies with equalforce to the first to one or two unfortunate quotations made by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden). In his opening remarks, the honourable member stated that that great statesman, Abraham Lincoln, at the Gettysburg dedication ceremony, stated that the fallen had sacrificed their lives for liberty and freedom; but that this bill was aimed at filching the freedom and liberty of the people of Australia. The honourable member is palpably wrong. This bill will give to the people of Australia real freedomfreedom from the control of financial dictatorships and greedy' monopolistic financiers. It will also give to the citifinances-control by the people for the people. The honourable member also said that the Government was afraid of a referendum, and hoped that time would erase suspicion. Of course time will erase suspicion. Time will also Drove the desirability of the legislation now before us, and when the Labour representatives in this Parliament face their masters two years hence when the operation of this bill can be reviewed, the people of Australia will be satisfied that the Labour Government has done a very good job indeed. The honourable member also said that he and. his colleagues had received many petitions against the nationalization of the private banks. But petitions that have to be sought are not petitions in the true sense of the word. People will sign even petitions to save hardened criminals from well-deserved punishment. People can be induced to sign petitions for almost anything. Canvassers employed by the Opposition parties to organize petitions are paid £10 a week, but 31,000 signatures on a petition from ""Western Australia is a poor return from the flock of canvassers who have been pestering the people there to sign petitions. I do not intend to deal with the involved technical issues contained in this bill. Other speakers from this side of the House have already done that most ably.

76,Mr Sheehan (Cook) [4.37],"I rise country, both "" white collar"" andsmall businessmen throughout Australia who are dependent on credit and even more dependent on the working classes,, on whose patronage they rely, who have jobs and the money to buy the goods they want to sell. I intend to reply to certain statements made about this legislation by honourable members of the Opposition parties. It is suggested by the Opposition that detailed supervision of the Commonwealth Bank by politicians will take place if the bill is passed, but the Treasury's power over the Commonwealth Bank is in the direction of a general policy. Nothing could be more inefficient than the accentuating of the booms and slumps of the trade cycle, which is the inevitable result of leaving the contraction and expansion of credit to a private profit motive. Treasury policy will ensure the expansion and contraction of credit against the trade cycle for a social purpose. In the words of Professor Sir Frederick SoddyOnce the nation resumes control of the issue of its monej' it can place, as it should, the whole technical revision, control and operaThis is not communism but common sense tion of its financial system in the hands of experts who can be trusted to act exclusively in its interests. That is the Government's motive in proposing to nationalize the private banks. It is suggested by the Opposition that the depositors' money will be subjected to government confiscation and surveillance. The purveyors of this particular piece of mendacity do not dare suggest that the £428,000,000 in the Commonwealth Bank is so subjected. No depositor would believe them, and that it is not believed is shown by the absence of any move or run on the Commonwealth Bank. Honourable .members opposite also claim that governmental institutions are inefficient. The institution in question is the Commonwealth Bank. No convincing case that it is inefficient bas been made, or even attempted. They also claim that a great increase of taxation will take place when "" just compensation "" is paid to the shareholders of the private banks. The Commonwealth Bank will itself manage that aspect of the matter as part of its business activities, not the Treasury. . Mr Sheehan. It is claimed by the Opposition that to industry the proposal means progressive nationalization under the deliberate pressure of the one big government bank, which will control all finance. Is not industry under the control of government legislation? To argue that this Government intends to control all industry is contrary to fact and not based on firm ground. Just as under private banking the success of private industry is essential to national welfare, so will it be under nationalization. At least the threat of overseas control of our banking system is to be removed. The success of any industry is tlie success of those engaged in it. The worker contributes very largely to that success, and his reward is not in proportion to his efforts. Such a worker is entitled to some say in the results of his work; through this enactment it will be possible for him to achieve that end in an indirect yet satisfactory method. At present the benefit is confined to shareholders, promoters and the like. They are entitled to a just recompense, but not to absolute control. Many of these controllers are outside Australia. and justice. Neither is it socialism, nazi-ism, fascism or any other "" ism"". The Opposition claims that ""nationalize the banking system "" is the catch-cry that Hitler used when he simultaneously put all the German people to work and into chains. During the years 1940-45 we were regimented, pushed about and around, controlled and subjected to interference in many of our private affairs. The circumstances warranted such treatment. Present conditions, with the added threat of future instability, justify the Government's proposal as wartime conditions justified war-time regulations. The old catch-cry of "" socialism is the Opposition theme song. There is no such thing as Australian socialism. Never at any time has the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) or any Labour Prime Minister threatened us with dictatorship. This measure will implement the will of the majority, the working men and women, against that of the minority, the vested interests, who control a majority of the wealth. There can be dictatorship on both sides. The giving of reasonable conditions, the right of every workei to work, is not dictatorship. The majority expect this implementation of their desires. The Government was democratically elected ""by the people, of the people, for the people "". If this measure is the will of this democratically elected Government, it is not socialism. The Opposition, referring to the Government, claims, "" It will maintain full -employment but you will have to go to the job you are ordered to take-in Darwin or the coal mines"". Of course it will maintain full employment, and that is what is required of any government, but, under National Security Regulations, the Government did not send carpenters to coal mines, or bricklayers to dairies, unless their services would have been more gainfully employed in that way. That is reasonable. If I do not want to work, no government can force me to; but if I want to live, then I must be prepared, in a time of emergency, which may soon be upon u3, to work where my services will be best employed. Does the Opposition's argument imply that another government will keep us all in cities near the coast? If so, that is by no means desirable. Liberty of the subject is all very nice and is a good drum to beat, but in hard or dangerous times each one of us has a duty to his neighbour. The common good must come before that of tbe individual. Those who are not willing to accept that responsibility are not worthy citizens and any effort to make them shoulder it is a. good thing. Now, let us examine the Opposition's charge that the mere announcement of the Government's intention to nationalize the private banks has produced a business crisis. I will not bother to argue the charge, but let the facts speak for themselves. I produce three pages from the Sun Pictorial. They are dated the 16th, the 17th and the 18th September, 1947. Page 21 of the Sun Pictorial of the 16th September contains five columns, the headings of which are as follows: ""Profit rises at £41,320-Hum e Pipe's year"" -That is one prospectus which indicates a 6 per cent, ordinary dividend "" Sleigh's "" Yellow Express profit steady at £26,793""; ""Share values go higherdealings lighter "" ; and "" Snow's Men's ""Wear-recor d profit"". On the same financial page of the same paper on the next day, the 17th September, were the following headline's: ""Mutual Stores best profit-seventy-fiv e years trading "" ; "" Olympic Tyre expects satisfactory year "" ; "" Faulding's new share issuesgood asset covers "" ; and "" Share prices advance-man y small rises"". But, of course, these headings might have "" just happened"" in the same casual way in which the depression of the 'thirties "" just happened"". .SoI turn to the financial page of the Sun Pictorial of the next day, the 18th September. Again we get the same picture of industry, supposedly "" in' the grip of panic and prices tumbling""-word s almost reminiscent of the depression days. Here are the headings on that day"" ""Whisky and gin profits -product s in demand "" ; "" Australian Paper Manufacturers profit rises £42,577 to £269,889 ""-that is a lot of money to make; in fact, it is a startling amount by which to increase profits in these days of ""business panic and uneasiness "". There seems to be something contradictory about the Opposition's claim when it is considered side by side with such profits. In fact, it was a startling increase of profits in these days of supposed business panic and uneasiness. The third column had the heading, referring to Robertson and Mullens Limited, "" Profits raised slightly "". The next headline is an indication of the good government of this country under the Labour party administration. . It is, "" Tax abolitions help markets-Buying is stronger "". That reflects directly upon the Government's action in reducing taxes. The comments which I have quoted were all published after the Government announced its intention to nationalize the banks. Their whole tone is summed up in the head line, "" Buying is stronger"". I ask the Opposition to read those pages, or the financial pages of any newspaper to-day. They disclose a similar optimistic outlook, although two months have elapsed since the Prime Minister notified the people of Australia of his intention to nationalize the banking system. Therefore, our answer to issue opens to-day""; honourable members opposite is that they cannot rightly claim that the proposal to nationalize banking has created a business panic. I leave that point. Now, I deal with the working man's greatest enemy-depression. that this cry of "" depression "" would be bandied about by members of the Government party in any discussion of the nationalization proposal. Of course it would be! This is the biggest factor in the lives of the working classes. The people must not be allowed to suffer once more the indignities brought upon them by unemployment between 1931 and 1939, when they had to wait for a war to alleviate their conditions. Two hundred thousand people were out of work in Australia when World War II. started, and when the Labour party came into power in 1941 there were still 100,000 unemployed. Anti-Labour governments gave no consideration whatever to the circumstances of those thousands of people. Therefore, we will talk about depressions. During the depression in the 'thirties, 'hundreds of workers had their eyes on the Gosford district in New South Wales. Some of them even went there because of a rumour that the district was to be electristrong and healthy. Invalids were going fied. The farmers were to be supplied with electricity, but they lack it even to-day. What happened? The workers camped around the district. They had neither money nor food. Their bellies were empty. All that they could rely upon was a dole. Yet, just on the other side of the barbed wire fences outside which they were camped, fruit was rotting on the trees. The farmers who produced the fruit could not sell it. They could not afford to give it to the unemployed, because that would have further depressed the already low price of citrus fruit. So, we had the grotesque picture of hungry and miserable men on one side of the fence and fruit being allowed to rot on the other side; and the men who produced the fruit were not much better off than those who were on the dole. Most of the time, the soles were hanging from their working boots because they could not afford replacements. They had to do tedious work by hand because they could not afford machinery to lessen the hardship of their toil. They could not even take their wives to see a picture show because they lacked the money. Most of them were in debt to the banks and had the ever-present terror that the banks might foreclose. Honourable memMr Sheehan, bers on both sides of the House agree It was said that such things should not be, that men should not starve in the midst of plenty while the producers of plenty live like serfs, but under the terror of foreclosure instead of the knout. What was wrong ? What factor produced those conditions during the depression? It was not the men. They were prepared during the period to work. They were prepared to produce the boots that should have been worn on the farmers' feet instead of the worn-out rubbish that they were wearing. They were ready to dig the ditches and lay the mains that would have electrified the farmers' houses and given them and their wives relief from drudgery. They were ready to do anything. It was not the farmers' fault. They had done their hit. They had grown their oranges. They had contributed their share towards feeding the nation. But the nation was not being fed. Children were getting rickets who, if those oranges had been added to their diet, would have been without the vitamins that those rotting oranges would have provided because they did not have the price to pay for them. Harassed mothers in Sydney were desperately wondering how to feed their families while their breadwinners were laid off from the boot making factories, while, in Gosford, equally harassed farmers' wives were wondering how to raise the price of new boots for their husbands. -One doe9 not have to be very astute to know what was wrong. It was not the fault of the producers. There could be no use in them producing if people could not buy their products. Yet thousands of people needed their products. Was the fault with the producer? Obviously, no! Was the fault with the consumer? Equally obviously, no! I supply the answer that would be supplied by any intelligent person: the fault was with distribution. It is at this point that the Government and its supporters part company with the Opposition. Up to this point, we are in agreement that such things as occurred during the depression should not be allowed to occur. But, from this point on, we disagree. At this point, Labour says that such things must not happen again and Labour now has prepared plans to prevent them from could shelter behind the present banking recurring. But the Opposition mumbles system and, when the banks were calling pious platitudes and says that such in their money and foreclosing on homes things are inevitable, that depressions, and farms, say piously that it could not like wars, are inescapable. confession has been made on innumerable tioning of a bank.

79,Mr Sheehan,"I have fairly subparty finds itself in fundamental conflict with the Opposition. Of course, we shall feel the impact of a depression overseas, but the effect can be cushioned. We must discard all the mumbo-jumbo of the professional economists, and examine with common sense the problem with which one day we may be faced. No one will deny that this country has an abundance of the fundamentals of existence-food, clothing and shelter. The present housing shortage will be overcome. The problem during the depression was not to find a house to live in, but to provide the rent for a house. I emphasize that food, clothing and shelter are the most important things in a worker's life. If we can give to the people these basic requirements, they can never be so badly off as the workers were during the depression of the 1930's. I emphasize also that each of these requirements is in abundance in Australia. Even if the bottom falls out of the wool market, the price of wheat reaches an all-time low, and we never sell abroad a side of beef or pounds of mutton, those basic requirements will still be here in Australia, As they are already present, all the economic crashes that happen in other parts of the world cannot deprive us of them, but the people must be assured that they will have them, irrespective of what happens elsewhere. Economic crises in other parts of the world can deprive us of our fine motor cars-though when an Australian motor car is in production* even this will not happen -restrict tures which we may see, or even reduce a man's supply of tobacco and cigarettes. Those things are beyond our control. But the ability to give to the people the three not blame them. Profits are the reason fundamentals-food, -even in the most difficult of times, is not beyond our control. Provided distribution-call it banking if you like-is controlled by the people, for their own interests, we can, and will, give to the people a guarantee that they will never go short of the three working-class fundathe banks, and was as inevitable as death mentals. Can such a guarantee be given? The Labour party says that it can, provided the banks are nationalized, and the nation, not private interests, control the system of distribution, which is only another name for the financial machinery of which the banks are the most vital part. Ur. Sheehan. Recently, the banks issued an advertisement in which they quoted an extract, from the report of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking System.*. The extract, which was signed by all members of the commission, including the present Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) readsThere is no justification for the view that the trading banks, in order to enlarge their profits, deliberately expanded credit to produce a boom and then contracted so as to produce a depression. The banks should not have published that advertisement. It was bad tactics to do so. It makes people think; and that is what the banks should not encourage them to do. It is a great mistake to have people thinking about things which they have always accepted unthinkingly as a part of normal life. If they accept things without thinking, they do not see why these conditions should not be a part of everyday life. The banks' propagandists try to impress upon the people of Australia the idea that the private financial institutions are sacrosanct. The people should not be encouraged to remember that the banks manipulate the currency in order to create booms or (financial and economic depressions. A man does not deliberately go on breathing. He just does it because it is natural for him to breathe. Of course, the banks did not deliberately contract credit so as to produce a depression. A man does not deliberately flinch when he is hurt. He does it because he cannot help it. The the number of moving picprinciple, as it applies to the banks, i.? the same. The 'banks could not help it. They are conducted for profit and to safeguard the shareholders' funds. I do clothing and shelter for their existence, and the directors who failed to safeguard the shareholders' funds would soon be looking for another job or charged with criminal negligence. The expansion of credit, and then its contraction, did not have to be done deliberately. It was part of the make-up of and equally as natural. When money was plentiful, conditions were good and employment easily obtainable, there were more good risks offering than in less prosperous times. A bank manager's duty is to lend money when the risk is good; and the risk is always good when times are good. A bank manager knows that the bank will be repaid, for which he has responsibility, mally place upon us, were suspended. without much difficulty. So he grants loans, thereby unconsciously contributing to boom conditions. When the boom breaks, he must, as a good and faithful servant of his employers "" tighten up "". We cannot blame the individual for this, because he is working for an employer who needs profits to sustain him and safewe judiciously "" pumped in "" the means guards to ensure his continuance. But as the supply of money diminishes, at the time when people need assistance to meet the unforeseen contingencies of a falling market, he must safeguard his employers' money. So again, often unconsciously, he contributes to a contraction instead of a boom. This mode of operating cannot be justified. It is not scientific to pour money into a community at a time when money is plentiful, thereby adding to boom and inflation conditions, and when money is scarce, to close up and further reduce tbe funds available. That is not a common-sense policy. The proposition is as absurd as any that can be advanced. Yet it is the basis of the private banking system, and we cannot escape it while the banks are conducted on the present system. Ananalogy is to try to pour more water into a bucket which is already full. Some of the water overflows. That is what the banks do in good times. They pour money into the community, and the only result is the overflow of inflation, and a higher cost of living for the workers. Then conies the drought of hard times, when every drop in the bucket is valuable. So the banks figuratively rip a large hole in the bottom of the bucket by calling in their loans and foreclosing right and left. the war, when the relative unimportance That is not common sense. Personally, [ should have thought that one of the principal things that the war proved was the importance of men and materials and the relative unimportance of money. Even if we had had tens of millions of pounds more than was at our command, we could not have produced an extra shell. It was not money that counted. All the money in the world would not have provided an extra pair of hands, or the materials that went into the making of a shell, or a can of food for the troops. That was because, during the war, the artificial limitations upon distribution, which the banks norThere was proper, scientific distribution. Weestimated how many producers there were in the community, and Ave knew how much material was available. The matter was quite simple. When a pocket of unemployment occurred through men not producing because distribution was f aulty, of distribution. The banks then were fighting like the rest of Australia for their existence. Their profits, though still important, were secondary. At that time they did not yell about unsound finance. They accepted our dictates, and agreed with them. Now, the position is changed. The policy of the banks again places upon them the necessity for profit-making, and so their artificial limitations again apply. This cannot be permitted. The thing is too big for artificial limitations. The acid test must be nian-power and materials. We must ascertain whether all our men who want to work are at work. If they are not, we must do something about it. We must discover whether all the materials are available that will provide work for our man-power. If they are not, we must do something about it. We have had two great lessons. The first was the financial and economic depression of the nineteen-thirties. The second was the World War II . In the depression, it was not production that failed. Any one who looked at the long "" dole "" queues knew that it was not a falling off in appetities or a failure of the desire for a few of the comforts of life. It was distribution that failed. This failure was demonstrated by the depression, and was proved during of money was conclusively driven home, find the premier position of man-power and materials was irretrievably fixed. Let us profit by our two lessons! Distribution is only another name for the financial system. The system of distribution first employed was one of barter, then it progressed to coinage, then to banknotes, whilst to-day cheques drawn on banks is the system in vogue. The system of distribution failed us during the depression, and it will fail us again if it is left to the manipulation of irresponsible private enterprise. That phrase which went out of currency years system must fail under any form of priago? I have been present at a great vate control, and it is obvious that dismany discussions-, and that phrase iscertribution must be under national control. tainly not used by members of the OppoTbe bill places distribution under the sition. However, the most remarkable nation's control, and I commend its statement made by the honourable member introduction as the greatest step forward was that "" there is no such thing as Auswhich the Australian nation has taken ' tralian socialism"". I propose to read since federation. Its proposals will from the ""Federal Platform and create employment for the people, and Objective"" of the Australian Labour bring stability to, and confer economic party, which mentions as its aims: "" The freedom upon, the workers of Australia. socialization of industry, production, disT heartily support the bill.

80,The Chairman,"Order! TheThe honourable member for Darwin must address the Chair. Dame ENID LYONS I propose to address myself now to the speech of the honourable member for Cook. His speech struck a few chords in my own breast, and from the standpoint of the honourable member himself, I believe that it was a good speech. He made some points which were of considerable interest. He pointed out that because of the rates of interest charged on money borrowed to finance the construction of railways in this country, although railways have been paid for over and over again the capital debt still remains. I should like to remind him that the same can be said of the plight of small home-builders in this country under the legislation passed by this Government which he supports. Any one who wants to build a home is subjected to exactly the same kind of financial treatment. member went on to speak of the "" moneychangers in the Temple "". I am a somewhat sentimental person, and hi9 remarks rather affected me. However', I point out to him that the money-changers were driven from the Temple, not merely because they were changing money but because they were using it to cheat and to desecrate the House of God. "" My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves."" It is perfectly true that in all ages men have used money for ignoble ends, and it is equally true that they will continue to do so till the end of time, through government or private institutions. That will go on whether the banking system be controlled by the Commonwealth Bank or private concerns. Man's cupidity must always be kept in check, not only a moral suasion, but also by the introduction of physical restraints, amongst which we might include control of public credit. However, that is not the issue involved in this bill. There is another, far more fundamental, issue than the mere alteration of the method of providing finance. We must look not only at the bill, but also around and beyond it. We must look not only at its provisions, but also at the this. I believe that ministerial members moral and political sanctions upon which [401 its introduction. Even the time of its introduction becomes important. Those are all factors which tend to justify or to condemn the bill. It cannot be denied that it has been introduced during the greatest possible disturbance of social and political conditions which the world has known. The bill has been brought forward at a time when we should be working in a unified endeavour to make good the deficiencies and rifts in our social fabric which have come in the wake of war. Honourable members opposite profess to believe that the protests which have come from all over the country are manufactured, and unreal. Let me assure them that they are very real indeed. To say that all the petitions which come to the Parliament are the result of organization is true, inasmuch as some one must be responsible for the printing and distribution of the forms. However, let me assure honourable memThe honourable bers that in my electorate officials of branches of the Australian Labour party have walked into banks and asked for permission to sign forms of protest. genuine Labour supporters. Dame ENID LYONS -They are Labour to the backbone. I received a letter from a man, whose politics I do not know, who echoes the thoughts of many people. He stated that quite recently he had received a letter from the Prime Minister-n o doubt, in response to one of his owninforming him that, although abolition of the means test was part of the Australian Labour party's policy, it could not be implemented at present because it would cost £4'0,000,000 a year. The simple people are saying, "" If they cannot have £40,000,000 ready to abolish the means test, how can they have £100,000,000 ready to take over private banking ? "" At this time, there is in this country, and in every other civilized country in the western world, a growing fear of the prevalence and spread of communism. That also, cannot be disregarded when we are viewing a measure such as are astonished at the extent of the protest against this legislation, even though they",36,Chifley
81,Mr Daly,"Then they are notstill, I have no doubt, continue to believe that some of it is not real. I , myself, had rather a surprise when I received a telegram which read, ""Whole electorate is disturbed at projected banking legislation, which should first be referred to the people"". It was signed "" E . J. Ward"". When I saw that signature, I must confess, I was, for the moment, rather "" rocked ""-to use the colloquial phrase. But I found that the telegram had come fj'om a woman in my electorate who was very greatly concerned about the matter. If honourable members opposite believe that these protests are not genuine, that there is no real concern, that there is no real danger of seriously splitting the community, let me read to them this small extract from the North-Western Advocate, published at Burnie. It is the report of a smoke social of the Trades and Labour Council. A Mr Moline proposed the toast "" The Trade Union Movement "". Towards the end of his remarks, he said-and these words are quotedThere is a big possibility that a few of you that department for over 30 years. In a will be called upon to bleed before this battle press interview after his retirement, he is over. There is no room for "" squibs "". We must take more interest in the Australian Labour party and elect more trade unionists to Parliament. That is evidence from members of the party which is supported by those who sit opposite. I hope that they will not neglect it. It is something that cannot lightly be put aside. I beg the Government, even now, to consider well before it really splits this community into factions which will keep bitterness alive for many years to come. This is not the time, if ever there was one, when legislation such as this should be introduced. What are the reasons for the disquiet in the public mind? I believe the first reason to be fundamental, that deep and instinctive feeling against too much, or unnecessary, government control, which is inherent in Australian people. We had the first evidence of it at Eureka. That is a name which bas been put to very unfortunate and ignoble uses. But do not forget that that was the very first occasion in Australia on which repressive government action was resisted. That feeling has been reinforced recently by many serious events, the first being the experience of -controls which the war imposed upon us. Dame Enid Lyons. The methods of policing those controls have driven it a little farther. If any one wants to know how deep is the resentment against some of those methods, he has only to go into country districts, into places where agents of the Prices Branch move around, and actually tempt people to break the law in small, piffling, miserable ways, and then take them before the courts, while at the same time those people know that there are others operating in large ways who go "" scotfree "". There is, further-and I say this with very great solemnity-the growing distrust of officials and politicians alike in this country. One need refer only to the land sales scandals. It finds an echo in many people's hearts. There is grave disquiet in the public mind in regard to similar transactions in many places. During the last sessional period, I drew the attention of this House to a statement by a public official who had retired from the Department of Trade and Customs. He had been, as I recall, an official of said, "" All politicians are racketeers"". 1 raised the matter in this House. I regarded it as serious, coming from the source from which it had originated. It was treated with considerable levity. The Prime Minister promised me that he would make some inquiry. I have heard nothing since. There is also the frequent conflict of statement between members of the Government, so that one Minister cannot be said to be responsible to his Prime Minister, nor can the Prime Minister's guarantee be accepted with the complete assurance with which it used to be accepted. We come, then, to inescapable evinamely, dence of the abandonment of old standards of probity and integrity throughout the community. We find that in government circles. I refer to this matter with considerable sorrow. I have been a member of this House for four years. There have been occasions on which I have been shocked at the evidence of old standards having gone in administration ' and government. I do not forget the occasion on which the Commissioner of Taxation invited the public to send to him anonymous letters, not signed letters, the individual giving the information being guaranteed protection; and that suggestion received the sanction of the Government. Does the Government know what the writing of anonymous letters does to the one who writes them? It progressively undermines integrity. Does it know what effect that kind of moral rottenness in any section of the comrnunity has on the whole of the body politic? Then, quite recently, I was horrified to hear over the air, on an occasion when I was absent from this House, a Minister quote from a certain document, and upon being asked to place the document on the table of the House, say, "" I cannot; it is confidential"". Again, in the bill before us we have evidence that old standards have gone. Clause 23 of the measure, which offers certain rewards to people if they will set aside their legal rights, has been described in one newspaper as "" a subtle attempt to divide the banks"". It is, instead, an unsubtle revelation of a sharp decline of political morality. That is the background against which this measure has been introduced, and it is no wonder that there is a sharp reaction and a distinct fear throughout the community. That is the reason for the demand for a referendum. The Minister for Transport said quite recently that there had been no demand for a referendum on other occasions; there had been no complaint about the Bretton Woods agreement, and on other similar occasions. The very fact that there was no demand then and there is a widespread request now should be sufficient to induce the Government to take notice. Then we come to the Minister's further statement that there had been no plea for a referendum at the time of the Premiers plan, when pensions and wages were reduced all over Australia. There was no call for >a referendum; that is very true. But there was the suggestion of an election by no less a person than the late Mr Curtin. In his book, Caucus Crisis: The Rise and Fall of the Scullin Government, by Warren Denninga sympathetic history of the Labour party's history at that period-honorabl e members will find the following:Mr Curtin was one of the keenest opponents of the Premiers plan in the party. He regarded its adoption as fatal to Labour, foreseeing the inevitable loss of confidence and bewilderment which it would cause throughout tlie whole of the Labour movement. His advice to the Ministry, if no alternative existed to the adoption of the plan, was to resign office and seek a specific mandate from the people on banking reform, and so seek a way out of the financial impasse in this direction; or otherwise to accept defeat sit the polls, and allow the Conservative parties to implement the plan. Senate was against him. Dame ENID LYONS I shall say something about the Senate in a few minutes. At that time an appeal to the country was suggested, but it was ignored, just as a similar appeal is being ignored to-day. History is repeating itself. There is ample evidence to show that if this Government went to the country there would be no backing for the legislation which it has placed before the Parliament. But the present Government is not going to the country, no doubt for the same reason as on tie former occasion. The honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly) referred to the Senate. I was glad to hear his interjection, because hitherto the cry of the Labour party has been that the banks prevented the Government from carrying out its policy. It is perfectly true that at the time of the depression it was the banking institutions, including the Commonwealth Bank, that drew the attention of the then Government to the serious state of the country's finances. The whole of the banking institutions of Australia warned the Government of that day, but the Government was not anxious to accept their suggestions. And so it did what I believe was the only proper thing to do: it introduced into this House legislation designed to implement its own plan, in the face of the advice given by the banking institutions. That legislation was rejected in the Senate. In other words, it was rejected by the Parliament of this country. What happened then ? This is something which cannot be repeated too often, although, unfortunately, it has been allowed to slide into oblivion, while the same old propaganda is continued year after year by the Labour party. What happened was this: A plan was discussed at a conference of Premiers, and it was agreed upon Mr",37,Chairman Order The It Rests And The Circumstances Surrounding
82,Mr Daly,"That was because theCurtin, as I have already said, strongly opposed the plan. But the Government of the day, rather than accept his advice to go to the people and ask for a mandate, brought into the Parliament a bill to give effect to the plan which had been agreed to at the conference of Premiers which included a reduction of -wages and pensions. I do not know on what date the bill was passed by the Parliament, but it was assented to on the 17th July, 1931. Thath ill was the Financial Emergency B ill . It s f u l l title read, "" A bill for an act to make necessary provision for carrying out a plan agreed to by the Commonwealth and Statesf or meeting the grave financial emergency existing in Australia, re-establishing financial stability and restoring industrial and general prosperity"". the object of the legislation which the Labour party introduced-legisla tion which it now repudiates. -cannot imagine any more damning evidence of the insincerity of the Government when it speaks as the honourable member for Cook spoke this afternoon. That Government remained in office as long as it could, u n t i l a group of people, known, I think, as the "" Lang planners "" , turned it out of office. The Government appealed to the country. The result of that appeal was that 'the Premiers plan, was accepted by the people, and the Labour party was turned out of office. It remained out of office for years. The Lyons Government was returned three times. As the result of a later election another anti-Labour government assumed control. The whole point is that the Government of that day did not face the electors until driven to do so. It believed that its ulan was of such a nature that it would save everything, but the people did not believe it . I say that the present Government is in precisely the same position concerning this measure as the government of that time was concerning the Financial Emergency B ill . I have said that there is ample evidence to show that there is great disquiet in the country, and no confidence in this measure. to look at the results of Gallup polls as indicating public opinion. they are not final evidence of what the people think, but generally they indicate Dame Enid Lyons. public opinion f a i r l y well. The last poll provided overwhelming evidence that the majority of the people of Australia are against this measure. In Tasmania, 79 per cent, of the people are against it ; and even then some had not made up their minds. I ask the Government: I s it honest to proceed ? I say that it is not honest to do so. We are told that this policy has been included in the platform of the Labour party for years. That is perfectly true. subscribed to it . Dame ENIDLYONS I have been waiting for that interjection, and so I shall tell the honourable member for That was Hunter( Mr James) something about it later. I point out that the nationalization of banking, and a number of other things, I were in the Labour party's platform on the 12th March, 1936, when Mr Curtin saidIf that be the case, my accusation is that the Constitution imposes upon this Parliament the responsibility for determining the monetary policy of this country. Here1 point out that monetary policy is a distinctly different thing from bank management, or the management of treasury-bills, or decisions as to whether or not Brown shall get credit which is refused to Jones. I deny-and I hope that the country will regard my denial as emphatic -that the Labour party ever did, or does now, stand for .political interference with banking, as between bank and client. Further, I deny that this party has ever stood for interference with the Commonwealth Bank Board in the discharge of the functions of bank management. But when it comes to the rate of interest which governments shall pay for credit, based upon their own tax-collecti7ig capacity, and to deciding whether or not credit shall be issued by its own national instrumentality, on conditions favorable to the people or favorable to speculators and investors, then I say, most definitely, that if the people of this country are to he sovereign, their sovereignty must express itself in the national management of the credit structure of the nation. I could give other quotations, some of which would be from statements made in 1937 which, so fa r as I am aware, was the last occasion on which the Labour We have become accustomed party made a considered pronouncement on its financial policy to the electors. I know that The Labour party published a booklet under the title Why Australia ShovM Vote Out the Lyons Government. A f t e r",39,Chairman Order The It Rests And The Circumstances Surrounding
83,Mr James,"The honourable membera great deal of information on various points, we come to thisPLAN OF ACTION. (1) The operations of the Commonwealth Bank to be removed from and made entirely independent of private interests and free from sectional influences or constraint. (2) The abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board and the re-establishment of the original method of control as set up at the time the Commonwealth Bank was founded. (3) The expansion of the bank's business as a trading bank, with branches in all suitable centres, in vigorous competition with the private banking establishments. (4) A statutory provision that the banking of ull public bodies shall be reserved for the Commonwealth Bank. The last, of course, has been used as the excuse for this measure, combined with the adverse decision of the High Court in respect of the Banking Act passed in 1945. Therefore, when we are asked to believe that the existence in the Labour party's platform of nationalization of banking for a great number of years is to be regarded as a mandate for this legislation, I can only say that if that argument be valid there has been a great deal of dishonesty practised during a long period. Why is this bill introduced? If we analyse the speeches of honourable members opposite, the only reason is the failure of the Scullin Government during the depression years. Honourable members opposite have convinced themselves that that failure was due to the lack of absolute power over the banking machinery of Australia. I have shown that the Labour party had not the confidence of the people at that time, or for very many years afterwards; because, subsequently, the Lyons Government was endorsed at election after election. determined, the moment it got into office, to put into practice its nationalization plans, so that it would have these and other absolute controls; and it began its campaign as soon as it could after the conclusion of the last war. It started ""with the 1944 general referendum, when it attempted to obtain certain powers that would have made possible the implementation of a very great deal of the Labour party's platform which could not be put into operation by this Parliament earlier. But the people saw through the Government's proposals, particularly its proposal with respect to employment and unemployment. The' Government has been pursuing this policy ever since, but by rather devious means. It has been enacting coercive legislation, of which this measure is but a part. A long list of measures can be mentioned in this respect, including the Stevedoring Industry Act, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the Banking Act; and no*, this measure is introduced. A ll of thost. measures have one point in common, namely, none makes provision for any appeal from any authority which is set up under it. There is no appeal from a decision of the Stevedoring Industry Commission; there is no appeal from a decision of any of the conciliation commissioners; and there is to be no appeal from a Federal Court of Claims, to be established under this measure. That is the pattern repeated over and over again. In this respect, I draw the attention of honourable members to a statement by Aldous Huxley, who cannot be said to be a member of reactionary forces in this, or any other country. Speaking of the safeguards of general freedom, he saidIn the past there was always an appeal from the Pope to the Emperor, from the barons to the king; but we are fast approaching the point where there will he no appeal from the man-made, soulless State. That, of course, is becoming more and more obvious, and, as I have pointed out when discussing legislation in this House during recent years, that pattern has been not merely suggested but abo stated in precise terms. It is the position into which, this party has moved almost without awareness on the part of the great bulk of its supporters, and, perhaps, even on the part of some who Nevertheless, this Government implement its policies. Are the roots of this measure in the early 'thirties, or in 1921? I was a member of the Labour party in 1921, when the objective of the party was altered. Honourable members opposite do not like any reference to 1921, because they know that there were certain statements made then of an official kind which will not bear repetition at this moment before even their own supporters. I was a member of the Labour party then, and I was present at the convention of the Tasmanian Labour party when we were asked to ratify the change of objective. In those days in Tasmania, the general objective was stated to be secure to every man the full return of his labour "". I remember the argument I used against the .change of objective then proposed. I fought that proposal right from the beginning, and so also did my late husband. But, in 1921, the change of objective was made in face of my opposition. The argument I used was that we then had an objective which was a statement of a principle of justice. It seemed to me to be completely admirable, and it is one to which I still give allegiance. I still want to secure justice for every man according to his labour and deserts. I said, "" The change you wish to make is to substitute a statement of principle for a statement of the means you now regard as being necessary for obtaining your objective. By the time you are in a position to put your plan into operation it may well have the effect of defeating it "" . That is precisely the position which has been reached today. They no longer wish to ensure justice for each man; they want to give him something at the direction of a government. But those who support that proposition will find that they have robbed those people whom they wish to serve. The greatest thing they fought for, namely, their rights as private citizens has been taken from them by legislation such as this. What, then, was my position in those days when I had voted against the proposal to alter the objective of the Labour party, and fought against the new revolutionary doctrine which it accepted as its new objective? My position then was precisely that in which many honourable members opposite now find themselves; a position they are trying desperately to maintain. socialization; objective was something remote from ordinary practical politics. of supporters of the Labour party will find themselves in the position in which I found myself, but which I long since abandoned. No one now can for a moment believe that the stated objective has no relation to practical politics. The stated objective is the real objective. That is now abundantly cleaT. Does democracy-fa r harder than being the leadeT Dame Enid Lyons. any honourable member opposite deny that this is the first step towards putting into operation the whole objective? None of them answers. He dares not deny that he must fight to the very end for the objective of the party; and its stated objective is socialization. The honourable member for Cook says that there is no such thing as Australian socialism! There will be very many more outside this House who will see plainly, as many honourable members opposite should see, and probably will, that they"" cannot maintain their present position.. The whole speech of the Minister for Transport on Thursday evening suggested that this was the last step; but honourable members opposite cannot possibly maintain that position as they very well know. I suggest that this particular item in the stated objective has the greatest possible significance, because it is the key to all of them and will afford means by which the' others can be achieved. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. Dame ENID LYONS -Any act of government is of necessity in some degree coercive. Some number of persons, great or small, must through its operation act in ways they would otherwise avoid. The necessity to ensure justice in society, therefore, is the only sanction upon which an act of a democratic government can be based. There is no such necessity for this measure. Every possible power that social necessity could demand, except the final power to direct the placing of banking business, whether of private citizens or public institutions, already 1 resides with the Government by virtue of the Banking Act 1945. Time after time, the Prime Minister has said, either in connection with this measure or another, "" There is no guarantee that the power will be used even if it is there "". They do not believe in That is perfectly true, but the whole hisbut they thought that tory of recent times is such that we dare not trust to the easy optimism of that Thousands view. No man can answer for his successor-indeed , not always for himself. Let me, in the words of Boris Sokoloff, say this to the Prime Minister, with full and complete respect for his high office, and a profound appreciation of its responsibilityIt is a difficult tiling to be the leader of a of a revolution or a dictator, for there is no greater temptation for a man who has power than to abuse this power-to exercise it wilfully over a multitude.

Since the decision to bring all banking services, except State banking, under the control of the Commonwealth Bank was first announced, a deal, of criticism has been directed at the Government. That criticism was crystallized in the speech of the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) last Thursday, and in the speeches of other Oppositionmembers who have spoken since. Criticism has centred in matters of principle and de-. tails of method. I propose to use part of the time at my disposal answering some of the points made in criticism of the bill, and while doing so to draw attention to some highly satisfactory features of it . The remainder of my time. I in tend to use to substantiate the main case for this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition painted a black picture of the future of Australia if this legislation is operated. He spoke of servility and slavery. If there is any truth in what he said, this bleak prospect must be reflected in the outlook of business people. Who would want to invest in a country of the kind he prophesied Australia would become when this measure has been implemented ? A country which shows even the slightest tendency to totalitarianism or servility is not a. country in which commercial of a interests would seek to expand existing business or promote new enterprises. If the Leader of the Opposition would deny that, lie would, in fact, be saying that commercial interests, evidence of whose confidence in the future of this country I shall presently produce, prefer high returns in what he has said w ill be a servile state, to lower returns elsewhere. But what are the facts? Never before in the history of the Commonwealth has there been such overwhelming evidence of confidence in the future of this country, and this evidence has continued to accumulate during the months that have elapsed since the announcement of this legislation was made in August last. Two very large' overseas firms-Thos. Owen and Company and Imperial Chemical Industries -decide d in September to invest very I rise to speak on this large sums of money in new industries here. A representative of one of these companies, it is true, violently opposed this legislation in public, but the following week he was in my office discussing with me his plans for expansion. In the domestic field the number of firms seeking assistance from the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank during the last three months has markedly increased. Advances by this new department of the bank now exceed £6,000,000. Nowt u r n to the financial pages of the press of Australia. I have here a copy of the Melbourne Herald of last Wednesday night.

On the contrary all evidence goes to prove that the right honourable gentleman's statements about impending economic slavery are utterly mendacious and false. Later on, the right honourable gentleman said, and I quote his exact wordsThe only two countries in which the banks have been nationalized are Communist Russia and Fascist Argentina. That statement is also false. France has a nationalized banking system, but it is not the only other country with such a system. the banks was no doubt related to the fact that its post-victory government found that the private bankers had been the quisling collaborators with Hitler, proof of which in the form of an official cable I gave to the House in a recent debate. The Leader of the Opposition has accused us of following in the footsteps of Hitler. I wonder whether it is not really the Opposition and its friends who are following the advice and repeating the tactics of Hitler. Hitler affirmed that the bigger the lie the more people were likely to believe it, and that a big enough lie had only to be repeated often enough and loud enough to be implicitly believed by the people. This is precisely the course Opposition members are pursuing when they keep reiterating charges which I have proved to be completely false. Another serious charge levelled against the Government for introducing this bill to bring the trading banks under public ownership and control is that the measure is a threat to the liberty of the people of Australia. that the Government is threatening the liberties of the people, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, is not an accusation which can be taken lightly. I shall examine it carefully, therefore, and endeavour to expose this bogy which has been paraded before the people of this country so assiduously in recent weeks by the Mr Dedman. honourable members opposite and the financial interests which support them. The truth is that those in charge of the more effectively accountable to the people for what they do than ever before. At present, many of their 'powers are exercised in secret conclave, in the exotic board rooms of the trading banks, by the rich representatives of powerful financial, commercial and industrial interests, who, in practice, are responsible only to themselves. They are, as every one knows, closely associated with the Opposition parties, which derive their funds from them. It is incredible that any thinking man should really believe that the transfer of the control of the trading banks from a few dozen rich and aged bank directors, responsible in theory to their shareholders, but in practice only to France's decision to nationalize themselves, to a reputable public institution of nearly 40 years' standing, owned by the people of Australia, is a threat to liberty. Such a suggestion is a travesty of the word. Liberty is the most precious, word in the English language, and t ; should not be bandied lightly around the political arena and made the small change of party politics. Honourable members opposite seem to specialize in debasing the meaning of words. One party opposite has already polluted the ' term "" liberal "". At a time when we have just averted what was really a threat to our liberty, when the international horizon is still clouded with insecurity, and the world is torn by the sinister forces of darkness, the use of the word "" liberty "" in this context is a mockery and an insult to the intelligence of the people. Liberty is the ancient rallying cry of our people. It is dishonest to exploit it. Its appeal will not be enhanced by irresponsible politicians trying to stampede the country with cries of "" Wolf! Wolf! "" The word "" liberty"", when it falls from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition, and from his New Guard deputy, the honorTo say, in all seriousness, able member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), has a very ""phoney"" ring. This wild talk by the Opposition about liberty is, in reality, nothing but an attempt to befog the people by submerging objective thought in a torrent of poisonous propaganda. It aims to arouse too much emotional prejudice for the case to be examined closely on its merit?. T h i constant harping on liberty is merely a device to obscure the bankruptcy of the Opposition's case. The only liberty which is being destroyed is the liberty of smallprivileged groups to dictate in secrecy the financial destinies of thousands of people. The liberty which is being created is that of the people to control their economic destinies. Another charge is that the Government has no mandate from the people for this legislation. Nationalization of banking has been part of the official policy of the Australian Labour party for a generation. This fact is very well known and was well known when the people of this country returned Labour to power at the last elections. There has never been any secret about it. By returning Labour, the people endorsed the banking legislation of 1945, which aimed at bringing the banking system under full public control. The recent decision of the High Court, however, has thrown that legislation into the melting pot. Although the people endorsed it at the 1946 elections, its legality is doubtful. Although every one thought that the banking system had been brought under public control, we suddenly find that this is very doubtful. I confess that T was unable to follow the argument of the Leader of the Opposition that the 1945 legislation is not in jeopardy. The original statement of claim in the recent High Court case, in which the decision went against the Government on section 48 of the Banking Act contained a challenge to sections 18 to 22, which are the key sections in that legislation. honourable gentleman must keep silent. ment I made is true. statement of claim. The Leader of the for a lump sum to the Commonwealth Opposition may say that I have not used Bank, or by compulsory acquisition of the correct verbiage to describe the docushares by the Commonwealth Bank. ment. Be that as it may, I have seen When a shareholder, other than a dealer, the document and what I have said is sells shares at a profit, the profit is true. It is true that this part of the treated as a capital accretion and is not claim was not gone on with, but four facts confirm me in the belief that the banks are only biding their time. The first is that the banks have written in terms which suggest they will presently test its validity; the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) quoted one of the letters in his second-reading speech. The second is the sinister fact that the solicitors to the associated banks are also the solicitors to the Melbourne City Council, which defeated the Government on section 4S. The third is that when the 1945 legislation was before the House, the Leader of the Opposition pledged himself and his party toundo our work if returned! to power. The fourth is a statementby Mr Kemp, of the Institute of"" Public Affairs, one of the highsounding organizations working for the defeat of this legislation. Mr Kemp was quoted in the Melbourne TJeraM as sayingTho Government could have called the trading banks into conference in an endeavour to obtain a binding undertaking that in no circumstances would the powers of the .Government under the 1045 Banking Act be challenged by the banks. Just imagine the impudence of that suggestion that a government with sovereign powers under the Constitution to legislate in all matters relating to banking should go cap in hand to the private trading banks and ask them to give an undertaking that in no circumstances would they challenge the validity of the Banking Act of 1945. I am therefore fortified in my belief that if this legislation were not being brought forward, the private trading banks would presently be back in the saddle as they were between 1924 and 1941. The Opposition also criticized the provisions of clause 23 of the bill relating of the taxation of moneys received by shareholders as a result of the acquisition of the private trading banks.

""Interlocking directorates "" is the term used to describe the method by which big business firms retain monopolistic advantages through directorships in. related enterprises. Every big industry is represented on the boards of directors of the private trading banks. This provides the ideal set-up for discrimination against would be competitors. Take tlie case of Mr Jones, who requires some financial help to start a grocery business in a Sydney suburb, and goes to the Bank of New South Wales to get it. When he is refused assistance he will probably be unaware that Mr Mcllrath, of the firm which runs a chain of grocery stores in Sydney, is a director of the Bank of New South Wales. Or take the case of Mr Smith, who owns a property on which there are valuable.mineral deposits. Does he imagine that, if their exploitation would interfere with the profits of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited, the banks, on whose directorates that company is represented, would give him the financial assistance he deserves? The whole structure of the boards of private trading banks makes the practice of discrimination inevitable. This constitutes one of the strongest reasons why this legislation should be supported. Whatever may be said about the Commonwealth Bank, it cannot be claimed that its officers are in any way interested in whether applicants for advances will, if successful, affect the profits of big business monopolies. It is to be noted that the Treasurer has duced the maximum quantity of goods announced the intention of the Governand services which our' resources are ment to set up regional appeal authorities capable of producing. In the attainment as a safeguard against the refusal of of this objective the volume of money is advances on unreasonable grounds to any as crucial a factor as is the supply of applicant, and, indeed, as a safeguard water in a modern community. Just as against any discrimination at all by a shortage of water will restrict growth officers of the Commonwealth Bank. so an insufficient supply of money will That is a safeguard that has never been prevent that full employment of resources provided under the private banking without which maximum production cansystem. I propose to say a word or two about, ' water will retard growth so a too the criticism of the Leader of the Ausplentiful supply of money will generate tralian Country party ( Mr Fadden) forces inimical to maximum production. that the method of purchase through the Concrete evidence of the truth of these Commonwealth Bank is inflationary. two maxims is available to every one. The right honourable gentleman, as I have In the years between the two world frequently stated in this House, himself sponsored a scheme for financing our war effort much more inflationary in character than this-. The Treasurer has for six years managed the financial affairs of this country so efficiently that the stability of our economy is the envy of the world. The public can nest assured that such an efficient Treasurer has not approved of this method without, making certain that no harm will come of it. After all, the Commonwealth Bank started with nothing. In les9 than 40 years it has earned profits totalling £64,000,000. During the war it advanced £400,000,000 so that primary producers should be paid for their wheat and other produce. In the light of that record the provision of the £100,000,000 required to purchase the private banks does not seem too big a task for it. The bill now before the House will give effect to a principle that I have long advocated, the principle that the supply of all forms of money necessary for the Company economic life of the community should be wholly the responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank, answerable through the Parliament to the people. At the risk of covering matters which some may think are so elementary as to require no explanation, I propose to outline the arguments by which, long ago, I established this principle to my own satisfaction.

92,Mr Dedman,"I was never awars an insufficient supply of money condemned thousands to almost perpetual unemployment with consequent loss of production, causing an extraordinary amount of misery, and indeed, reducing a great many people in this country almost to the point of starvation; but as soon as the Labour Government took office and took steps to ensure the availability of a sufficiency of money, maximum production automatically followed. On the other hand, the danger of inflation caused by a too plentiful supply of money is too patent to require exemplification. The power to control the volume of money in the community is therefore a power the exercise of which can cause .untold misery and unhappiness to the people. It was an appreciation of this which moved Sir Reginald McKenna, chairman of one of the biggest banks in the world and an ex-Chancellor of 'the Exchequer in a non-Labour GovernBjienti n Great Britain, to say publicly^Chose who control tlie credit of a nation direct the policy of governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people. Another big banker, a director of one of the "" b i g five"" London banks, put it somewhat differently. He saidThe banker is the final arbiter of the world's economy. The statement of still another, Sir Basil Blackett, adviser to the then Indian Government on matters of finance, I put to m y listeners to-night in rhetorical formIsn't it strange to find modern States accepting as axiomatic a limitation of their sovereignty in the sphere of money so far reaching in its effects on the daily lives of their citizens? The method by which private banking institutions increased or decreased the volume of money is now too well known to require explanation. I link certain evidence on this point w it h the letter written by the then Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Robert Gibson, to the Treasurer of the day, in the depth of the depression. I re-quote that letterSubject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries, and allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, including war pensionsinterest and other factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board Mr Dedman. will actively co-operate with the trading banks and the governments of Australia in sustaining industry and rostering employment. The government of the day was left no option but to submit. How did the trading banks co-operate? The answer is to be found in the Bank of New South ""Wales circular of June, 1931. I quoteNot being able to borrow existing money, tlie banks come to the Government's aid by creating new money. This makes it crystal clear that the government of that day was forced to reduce wages, pensions and other social services because the banks, not the Government, had the power to create new money. Having shown how vital to the well-being of the community is the volume of money circulating, the question I now ask is this: Should private institutions operating for profit have the power to create and destroy credit, which is a form of money? Surely, the only answer a democrat can give is an emphatic "" No "". If one answers "" Yes "", what one is saying is that a few directors of companies concerned mainly with rates of profit, and not elected by the people, are able to set at naught the plans of governments elected by the people. That is the very antithesis of democracy. SinceI have a f i r m conviction that the great m a j o r i ty of the electors of this country are democrats at heart, I am certain that this measure w ill have their enthusiastic support. Those who are opposed to this legislation say it is undemocratic. Democracy has been well defined as government of the people, by the people, for the people. The directors of private trading banks, not of the people, not elected by the people, not for the people, but for private gain, wield a power over supplies of money which overrides the power of this democratically elected Parliament. I say with all the emphasis at my command that true democracy cannot flower in this country until the private trading banks are deprived of the power they have exercised, and would again exercise if this legislation is not passed. I have been directing my attention to substantiating the principle that the regulation of the volume of money is so all-important to the people that it should be controlled by the people through the Commonwealth Bank, which is answerable to the people's elected representatives i i i this Parliament. Every opponent of Andf r o m paragraph 565this bill expressed satisfaction with the policy of the private trading banks trading banks must bear sonic responsibility between 1924 and 1941. Let us have a for the extent of the depression. look at what happened during those years. And from paragraph 567I n 1924 the Bruce-Page Government emasculated the Commonwealth Bank by hanks, along with the Commonwealth' Bank, putting it under the control of a board, raised the rates of interest.

I have never had more pleasure in commending a measure to the House than I have on this occasion. That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) from concluding his speech without interrupof the community. I remind honourable tion. absolute majority of the whole number of members of the House present, and no dissentient voice, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative. Leader of the Australian Country party) [8.46] I do not propose, at this juncture, to endeavour to combat the futile and misleading statements that have heen made by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). I do not intend lo traverse the period from 1924 to 1931, upon which the honourable gentleman laid such emphasis, claiming that the events of that period constituted a foundational reason for the introduction of this bill, because everything that happened then in relation to banking was adequately dealt with to the satisfaction of the nation by a royal commission, which conducted a very searching investigation for two years and submitted its report in 1937. That commission decided by a majority-and its decision was accepted by the people-that the best system of banking in the interests of Australia was assuredly one which involved co-operation between the trading banks and the central bank as it existed then, but in respect of which certain recommendations were made. This bill marks a turning point in Australian history. It is, in fact, the obituary, notice of the trading banks. Fourteen strong, healthy bodies corporate have been condemned to mass execution by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) without benefit of appeal to a jury of their peers -the electors of Australia. But it is not only the obituary notice of the trading banks; it also sounds the death-knell of the freedom of the Australian community. Consequently, I speak in this House having behind me, not merely the support of the Australian Country party and the Liberal party, but also the support of a vast concourse of people whose opposition to this measure has been clearly and indignantly demonstrated during the last few weeks. I speak, primarily, not on behalf of the Australian Country party or of the Opposition generally, but on behalf of a great majority of the electors of all sections members that we are in Parliament for the purpose of giving expression to the public wall. It would seem, however, that the astounding uprising of feeling in every part of the Commonwealth against this legislation is of no concern to the Prime Minister or to those who sit behind him in this House. It is nothing to the Government that hundreds of thousands of citizens have protested against this legislation. It is nothing to the"" Government that thousands upon thousands of people throughout the Commonwealth have resolved that they are opposed to its proposals. It is nothing to the Government that the thousands of bank officers, who derive their livelihood from the banks which the Government seeks to destroy, have protested against its intentions. When the history of the present time is written years hence, much will be said of the bitter opposition which has been shown to this measure outside the House, not only by those directly concerned, but also by all sections of the community, because every section is at least indirectly concerned. The reason is that this bill means the control of the physical as 'well as the financial resources of each Australian citizen. That being so, it means control and regimentation of, and power over all that we have and all that we are. If the Prime Minister doubts the strength of public revulsion, let him take notice of the results of the public opinion polls. They have shown remarkable consistency iu forecasting election and referendum results in recent years. On this occasion, two different organizations took polls which show such a striking similarity that it cannot be swept, aside",47,Manufacturers

95,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"as a coincidence. One organization's poll showed 64i per cent, and the other poll 63 per cent, against nationalizing the banks. The small difference consisted of people who were undecided. The similarity goes even farther. Results for each State are so nearly the same that both organizations can class the States in the same order; and in every State, there is a substantial majority against nationalization. There is also another interesting aspect. One would expect that the majority against nationalization would be largely confined to trading hank customers. This is not so. One of the two organizations classifies results according to occupation, and naturally gets the largest majorities-8 6 per cent -amon g professionals, executives and farm owners. But, the next classification-clerk s and shop-hands, majority of whom do not deal with the trading banks-show s a vote of 71 per cent, against nationalization, whilst skilled workers were 56 per cent., semiskilled 51 per cent., and unskilled 45' per cent, against the proposal. Thus, only among unskilled workers is there less than a 50 per cent, vote against nationalization, but that does not mean a majority for it. On the contrary, the poll showed only 35 per cent, in favour, the rest being undecided. Therefore, even the workers have deserted the Australian Labour party on this issue, and who can blame them^ They know, as well as the Government knows, that this is a step towards industrial conscription. It could not be otherwise, because it is inseparable of another part of the Labour platfrom and a component part of the nationalization scheme. The nationalization of banking, L emphasize, will mean the control of the physical and financial resources of each person in Australia. The Australian worker does not like industrial conscription any more than the German worker or the Russian likes it. He hates being "" pushed around"", and he, fortunately, still subscribes to the plank in the Labour platform advocating the cultivation of an Australian sentiment, which the Labour party saw fit to abandon in favour of the nationalization plank 25 years ago. The people have revolted against this viewed against the background of legislation because they see in it the Labour's history since the time the Combeginning of the end of personal freedom, munists began to superimpose their ideas private property and representative government. Ample justification for this assumption lies in the vital part nationalization of banking assumes in Labour's platform and policy; accordingly this bill must be regarded primarily as a revolutionary means to a terrifying end. It concerns the very lives of the Australian people; it sounds the deathknell of the free Australian community, and of its way of life. The Prime Minister said that he would not heed public demands for a referendum because the Government had the power and the mandate to pass this infamous measure. He undoubtedly has the power, and even supposing that, without question, the people at the last elections were aware of the Government's intentions-of course they were not-the the Government would still not be absolved from the responsibility of ascertaining the people's will on such a revolutionary move. But the public opinion polls which have been taken since the elections and arguments advanced in this House show quite conclusively the Government cannot now claim to have the support of the people. The Government's reluctance to consult the will of the electors now is, of course, definitely related to its silence on its final objective whenever an election approaches. Why are members of the Labour party so anxious to put into practice its socialization platform, when it means in this instance, a flagrant breach form? They know that in clause 3 (d) of Labour's platform they subscribe to the initiative, referendum and recall. Notwithstanding public clamour, they are prepared to ignore this in their indecent haste to rush through this audacious piece of legislation. If Labour members have any regard for the principles of democracy, they will, even at this late stage, respect the people's will by taking a referendum on this revolutionary and far-reaching proposal. ,So inexplicable and astounding is the Government's attitude that it cannot be explained by examining the bill as a separate piece of legislation. It must be On the platform of the Australian Labour party. I shall so examine it .

These included legislative action to secure control of the banking, system by the Commonwealth Bank, and stipulated that the Commonwealth Bank should be subservient to the government.. In all, there were nine proposals. Mr W. C. Taylor, who was appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board by the Labour Government, was one who sponsored the resolutions. In doing so, he stated that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), who was then Treasurer, concurred with the committee's views. ' Incidentally, those proposals were, in the main, incorporated in the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1945. Later the conferenceadopted a resolution in the followingterms :"" That a nation-wide campaign/ for socialism be started immediately and that the implementation of such campaign be left in the hands of the Federal' Executive"". The Australian Labour party then proceeded to develop its plansto introduce comprehensive socialization.. The campaign associated with the "" fourteen powers"" referendum, which included the introduction of industrial conscription, was launched. The real intention was to foist socialization upon the Australian people. teen points have nothing to do with the bill. the history of the Australian Labour party's socialization plan, I must deal with the place and time of this important decisionBill will be still-born if the right honourable gentleman is not going to deal with it. the Banking Bill is part of a ten-yearplan, and that that plan had its inception in 1934.

But when the I turn now to an examination of some Government of the principal arguments that can be the advanced against specific points of the 1945, bill, and to the Prime Minister's speech private in support of it.

It is primary inwas simply part of the normal procedure flation, and is far more dangerous than adopted by the bank to ensure that its compliance was without prejudice to its the legal rights. That is a flimsy excuse to against apparently justify the introduction of such a farbelieve reaching and revolutionary measure as the can be provided present one, and the sensible and discernthe special accounts ing people of Australia will not accept intends to control them. it.

In peace-time, this objective ought was wrong. Surely it is not improper not to be pursued, because that would for an organization or a person to insist that the Government should act within involve travelling the straight road Mr Fadden. The"" special deposits"" system, unperpetuated this system by introduction of the Banking Act in the one object it had in mind was to curb the power of the banks to lend to enterprise. In that way it hoped the development of free enterhoped that the the "" special retiprivate If the Government wants He maintains that, as a to do so inflation to prevent the obvious way of the High Court judggovernment is to reduce wasteful secexpenditure, but this the resolutely refuses to do. The most potent, and indeed the only government or secondary inflation which the Government fears so much, and which it would have the people adequate and proper safeguards only if it has control of as it desires and In war-time, inflation is inevitable, and it is from to industrial conscription; towards forcing individuals into certain occupations with or without their consent. Tbe most powerful weapon which the Government could use' to prevent primary inflation is the simple and sensible process which it continually ignores, of stepping up production. That is the whole basis of. the welfare of this country. In addition, the Government should live within its means, and should avoid the calamitous expenditure that is being incurred daily throughout the country. It is obvious that the Government intended, by the Banking Act of 1945, to achieve the eventual owners-hip of the trading banks without paying for it. The pattern of government-operated airlines was to be followed, and the trading banks were to be eliminated by a process of slow strangulation. The key provisions of the Banking Act of 1945 which were to be used to achieve this objective were, first, those which gave to the Commonwealth Bank the control of the special deposits of the trading banks, and, secondly, section 48, which was designed ro give to the Commonwealth Bank a monopoly of the banking business of local authorities and other bodies. The Government was thwarted in its second objective, as the High Court decided that in that respect the legislation was unconstitutional. Instead of meeting the situation calmly and logically, the Government chose the drastic alternative of "" giving no quarter "". It announced its proposal for the complete nationalization of the trading banks, the special deposits of which the Commonwealth Bank, had control during the war totalled £26S,800,000 at the 30t,h June last. That was real money. It had been earned by and belonged to the people, and had been deposited by them in the trading banks for safe-keeping and for re-investment hy those institutions, virtually on their behalf. The control of this money by the Commonwealth Bank gave to the Government a powerful asset with which to further its socialistic plan. The alternative, which obviously was distasteful to the Government and its political advisers, would have been to hand back those hundreds of millions of pounds to the trading banks, by whom they would have been reticulated through industry for the re-establishment and strengthening of private enterprise. I say unequivocally that the Commonwealth Bank cannot hand those deposits back, because it has not the necessary funds. It holds special deposits aggregating £268,800,000. Those deposits were lodged with it by the trading banks as trustees for the people of Australia, who had earned and owned them. The Commonwealth Bank has not the wherewithal to meet a demand for their return, because it has invested £274,000,000 in Commonwealth securities, including treasury-bills. That is the real reason for this rush legislation to nationalize the trading bank9. I challenge any ministerial supporter who follows me in the debate to deny that. The whole basis of the banking business of the community is the confidence of the depositor in his bank, and the trust that is reposed in it by a borrower, who must be assured that his debt will not be arbitrarily called up. Let us compare the amounts held on deposit, and the advances made by the Commonwealth Bank, with those of the trading banks, in order to determine the esteem in which each is held by the average citizen of Australia who has to use a bank, has to be the means of somebody else using a bank, or through whose use of a bank somebody else is assured of employment. If the figures for the June quarter of 1947 are averaged, they show that deposits totalling £654,000,000 were held by the trading banks, compared with just over £60,000,000 by the Commonwealth Bank. I emphasize that £268,800,000 of that £654,000,000 has been deposited by the trading banks in special accounts with the Commonwealth Bank. The figures in relation to the Commonwealth Bank show that it held less than one-tenth of the total amount deposited. Is there any need to proceed further in order to prove whether the private banking system or the Commonwealth Bank is more favourably regarded by the people? The trading banks were seriously curtailed in regard to advances, in that they were compelled by law to maintain heavy special deposits with the Commonwealth Bank. Nevertheless, the average figures for the June quarter of 1947 show that trading bank advances amounted to more than £284,000,000. That is a barometer -of the confidence that is reposed in those institutions by the people of Australia who have to use large sums of money in order to develop this country, provide employment, and find the wherewithal for production, which is essential to the existment's wishes. All rural operations ence of the Government, both internally and externally. In the same period, the advances by the Commonwealth Bank aggregated 'only £21,700,000. In other words, tbe trading banks hold more than 90 per cent, of the total deposit business and more than 92 per cent, of the total advance business of Australia. Those figures cannot be challenged successfully. It has to be remembered that every person in Australia who finds it necessary to use a bank has been at liberty to transact his banking 'business with the Commonwealth Bank. There has been no restriction on where any one may bank. All have been absolutely free to place their money on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank if they wished to do so, and have not been compelled to rely on the trading banks to meet their financial requirements by way of advances or overdrafts. That freedom of choice is to be withdrawn by this legislation. The Government will be able to crush those who threaten government owned enterprises, and to liquidate any enterprise which it may consider undesirable. It is obvious, therefore, that this bill is not merely a faltering step towards socialization, but is the key to the whole plan for tbe full-blooded socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange in Australia. Let us now view the position from the rural stand-point. This bill is vitally important to those who earn their livelihood in the country. To them, freedom of choice is paramount. With a socialized banking system, tbe farmer who required an overdraft in order to finance his operaupon it by the Government, consistent tions would have to satisfy the manifold requirements of what will be, in effect, a government bureaucracy before he would be able to obtain it. The department's refusal, perhaps on grounds of Government policy in no way associated with either the credit-worthiness of the prospective borrower and his proposal, or the availabilitv of funds, would be final. With the trading banks liquidated, the process of lending to farmers and pastoralists would virtually become a government monopoly. A government offiMr Fadden. cial would determine the areas to be sown, the nature of the crops, and the number of stock on any holding. He could withhold financial assistance unless the client carried out the Governwould come under government control centralized at Canberra, and the granting of financial aid would be determined more by political influence than by genuine necessity. The country people of Australia have been pushed around long enough. They will not put up with bureaucratic control in times of peace as they did when the country was at war. The effect of this policy on Australia's foreign trade may be quite disastrous. I shall not pursue that aspect now, but I shall deal with it when the bill is in the committee stage. Let us consider now the position in respect of savings banks. In this connection I am reminded of what the Leader of the Opposition said in his brilliant and vigorous speech. The banking legislation passed in 1945 was designed to give to the Commonwealth Bank an advantage over the trading banks. What was the result? From the average weekly figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician, it will be seen that deposits in the general banking division of the Commonwealth Bank between September, 1945, and August, 1947, rose by only £2,700,000, whilst during the same period deposits with the trading banks increased by £49,000,000. Therefore, the individuals most concerned showed conclusively that they preferred to give their business to the trading banks rather than to the Commonwealth Bank, notwithstanding that the latter held all the trading advantages which could possibly be bestowed with its policy. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has said, the Commonwealth Savings Bank has had a virtual monopoly in the savings bank field, except in the States of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In those three States, where there are other savings banks, and therefore open competition, the figures show that the Commonwealth Savings Bank has lagged badly in the number of operative accounts. At the 31st August, 1947, the Commonwealth Savings Bank held fewer -than a quarter of the operative accounts in Victoria, fewer than a fifth of them in South Australia, and about a third of the accounts in Tasmania. It had a monopoly in the other States, and held a total of nearly 3,700,000 operative accounts throughout Australia. Including amalgamation payments to State authorities, the monopoly Commonwealth. Savings Bank made a profit of about £1,500,000 in 1947. The total Commonwealth Bank profit for that year, including profit made by the Note Issue Department, but excluding the. Commonwealth Savings Bank, was a little over £5,000,000. to compare that amount with the £2,800,000 aggregate net profit made by eleven trading banks for the financial year ended June, 1946. The Commonwealth. Savings Bank is supposed to be the workers' bank. It made a profit of £1,500,000, largely because it paid an -average of l £ per cent, interest on the deposits of the people and invested 83 per cent, of the total assets in Commonwealth securities carrying interest. I could say a great deal more about the loan policy of the Government and the degree to which -deposits with the Commonwealth Bank have been used in various directions. Sufficei t to say that no Commonwealth loan has been genuinely and bona fide subscribed since Labour came into power in 1941. The people have not been told that their deposits with the Commonwealth Savings Bank were used, without their consent, to bolster up every loan that has been raised during recent years. I suggest that honourable memoers should compare the £2,800,000 profit of the trading banks with the £1,500,000 of the Commonwealth Savings Bank made in the way that I have indicated. Those who have lived long enough ""to compare the relative efficiency of -government control with private enterprise are agreed that the former is far less efficient than the latter. Hitherto, the Commonwealth Bank has made profits because of the spur of competition with the trading banks, and because its staffs were trained in the trading banks. ""These men are no longer young, and they -are gradually disappearing. What will the future position be? Let us assume that the Commonwealth Bank will pay £100,000,000 for the business of the trading banks. If bonds are issued at the ruling rate of interest on government bonds-and I cannot imagine that just compensation would permit a lower rate of interest than that -the amount will approximate the £2,800,000 net profit made by the eleven trading banks. That would mean the creation of a new liability for the Commonwealth Bank-the payment of compensation amounting to £100,000,000. Even at 3 per cent., that more than absorbs the £2,800,000 profit that the I ask honourable members trading banks have made after 100 years of experience. During two wars and a depression they have given efficient service to the nation. Should history repeat itself, and efficiency decline, profits may drop considerably, and the trading bank business which the Commonwealth Bank will take over may show a net loss on the capital invested'. The £100,000,000 compensation to the trading banks will, in the main, be frozen assets, such as per cent, buildings, plant and equipment, and probably a secret reserve against bad and doubtful debts. ' The Government will take over frozen assets of the trading banks, for which it will pay £100,000,000 in bonds, and yet it talks about inflation! If the undue profits allegedly made by the trading banks are justification for their liquidation, the same allegation can be applied with greater emphasis against the Commonwealth Bank. Three strong reasons exist for the large profits of the Commonwealth Bank compared with the profits made by the trading banks. First, the Commonwealth Bank makes a large profit on the note issue. Secondly, trading banks pay heavy taxes, including income tax, land tax and pay-roll tax, to say nothing of the taxes levied by local authorities, while the Commonwealth Bank pays no taxes whatever. The Commonwealth Bank has the use of deposits by the trading banks amounting to £268,000,000, which is the figure at which they stood on the 30th June last. With the true instinct of the usurer, the Commonwealth Bank has paid an extremely low rate of interest on these compulsory deposits, . no more than 10s. per cent., and has then lent the money to the Commonwealth, either by taking up treasury-bills on which tbe charge is 1 per cent., or by investing in Commonwealth securities on which it receives, on an average, 3£ per cent. And yet, the Government says it proposes to nationalize the trading banks 'because they make excessive profits. Is it any wonder that the Commonwealth Bank is able to make large profits ? The Commonwealth Bank is so closely allied to the Government that monetary transactions between them are often in the nature of mere book entries, and no handling charges are involved. The trading banks have no such facilities for making easy profits, and they are required to give to their customers far greater service for the returns which they receive. Consequently, it must be admitted that the profits of the trading banks are most moderate in comparison with those of the Commonwealth Bank. In his dissent from the report of the banking commission, the present Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) recommended that the trading banks should be limited to 5 per cent, profit on shareholders' funds, or 8 per cent, on paid capital, whichever was the less. The profits of the trading banks have not reached either of those figures. On tlie contrary, bank profits have been in the vicinity of 4 per cent, on shareholders' funds, instead of 5 per cent, as recommended by the Prime Minister. In his second-reading speech on this hill, the Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth Bank would buy out the shareholders of the trading banks from its own resources, payment to be made either in bonds or in notes. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Bank has no resources of its own. Unless it resorts to inflation, it must buy the shares with the trading banks' own deposits, compulsorily lodged with the Commonwealth Bank. deposits, as I have said, amount to £268,000,000, and the assets of the bank constitute gold balances held abroad amounting to £138,000,000, against which are £139,000,000. Other Commonwealth Government securities held by the bank amount to £274,560,000. Therefore, I repeat that the Commonwealth Bank has no resources of its own out of which to pay Sir. Fadden. £100,000,000 to the shareholders of the private banks. It has no resources unless it creates them, and if it issues special debentures or bonds, it will be doing what it says the trading banks do, namely, creating credit. Will it run the risk of removing the safeguard against primary inflation, to say nothing of secondary inflation ? No regard has been given to the economics of this proposal, attention being focused on the legal aspect. As I have said, it is a fair assumption that bonds will be given to the shareholders in exchange for their assets. I cannot imagine any shareholder taking notes, especially fast-depreciating notes. Thus, a new liability of approximately £3,000,000 a year will be undertaken by the Commonwealth Bank. This will have to be paid out of revenue. On present profit and loss account figures, the bank's yearly profit is approximately £5,000,000.' To this must be added the profits of the trading hanks, namely, £2,750,000, together with the taxes now paid by the banks, which, of course, come out of their profits, and for which the Commonwealth Government will not be liable. These taxes total about £3,000,000 a year. The total gross profit, therefore, if available figures are any indication, will be about £10,750,000, from which must be deducted the amount of £3,000,000 to be paid annually to the bondholders. That will leave a net profit of about £7,750,000, some of which, especially in the Note Issue Department, is fictitious. However, under the Commonwealth Bank Act, one-half of the net profits of the central bank, the general banking division of the Commonwealth Bank, and of the Commonwealth Savings Bank must be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund, whilst the other half goes into the bank's reserve funds, These and cannot be touched by the Government. This basis of contribution cannot be altered by legislation except by repudiating the conditions under which Australian loans were subset liabilities amounting to scribed. Consequently, assuming for the moment that the change-over will not. affect the profit, £3,000,000 a year will be received by the Commonwealth Bank as extra profit instead of being paid into Consolidated Revenue by the trading hanks by way of taxation. £3,000,000 a year will no longer be under the control of Parliament, and a portion -of it will be ear-marked for sinking fund purposes over and above the amounts already deemed to be adequate under the National Debt Sinking Fund Act, and under financial agreements with the various States. None of the profits will go to Consolidated Eevenue, over which this Parliament has at least some control. What are the taxpayers going to get out of the deal? Consolidated Revenue will be reduced hy £3,000,000 a year, representing the taxes which the trading banks have paid. As a consequence, taxation on individuals will have to be kept unduly high in order to make up the deficiency. In the final analysis, that is the price the people will pay for the taking over of the trading banks. Erom whatever economic angle wo view the Government's proposal for the destruction of the Australian banking system, it must appear that the financial stability of the country will be adversely affected. The present banking system has served the country for more than a century. It enabled Australia to recover more quickly from the depression than any other country did, and it successfully financed the country during and after two gigantic wars. If it is destroyed, the effects will not be confined only to our internal position, but will also react to our .detriment abroad. At no time in our history have we experienced greater industrial development than we enjoy at present. This development is being financed in a large measure by British and overseas capital. We need that capital if we are to progress, and the destruction of our present banking system will not help us to get it. I can find no virtue in making this profound change in our economic life. It means a change from the British way of life to that of the totalitarian countries which we have so recently fought. The possible financial consequences must cause even the most irresponsible member of this House to ponder whether he is discharging his trusteeship in Australia's interests. Let us analyse the relative position of the trading banks that are to be acquired This by the Commonwealth Bank and that of the Commonwealth Bank itself. What consideration has been given to the economics of this change-over? Surely, the Prime Minister does not think that the 1,250,000 voluntary customers of the trading banks will be better served by being virtually conscripted into the Commonwealth Bank's clientele of about 120,000. The owners of the £654,000,000 of trading bank deposits have placed them in those banks because they have confidence in them. How can it be expected that their confidence will not be shaken if this huge volume of deposits is transferred to a bank' which, after 35 years of existence and government support and fostering, has only been able to encourage the degree of confidence reflected in only £60,000,000 of customers' money entrusted to it? The same may be asked regarding those who borrow from the trading banks. Will those who are now assisted and guided by tbe trading banks be encouraged and helped in their enterprise and initiative ? Will they get better support and, at least, equal service from a bank that has lent but £22,000,000 as against the £284,000,000 lent by the trading banks? These relative figures demonstrate the confidence which the community has in the present system. This House should pause and consider well before replacing the existing system with one that certainly can do no better, but will only destroy initiative and, consequently, the nation's general productive capacity. Will the long-suffering, overtaxed people feel that the change-over has been worthwhile when it is realized that one of the effects has been a forfeiture of taxation revenue of at least £3,000,000-revenu e which would otherwise be available to reduce taxes -and encourage initiative and production? Will they be consoled by the fact that sinking fund payments have been increased in their time and generation? There is a psychological factor as well. The nation will experience a sense of frustration because, as I have demonstrated, this is being done against their will. This frustration must shake confidence further. Eveni f the Government's measure had a single virtue, and I deny that it has, this is a most inappropriate time to shake confidence and frustrate initiative. We need production, both because we, ourselves, are short of many things we need, and because it is up to us, as a partner in. the British Commonwealth, to help hard-pressed and war-worn Britain. Can it be said that the Prime Minister has done more than pay lip service to Britain's needs in his assurances of further aid when he introduces this bill, which, instead of giving impetus to our productive power, will greatly hamper it? duction is our outstanding problem to-day. Why? Merely in order to implement a doctrinaire, socialist policy, which will destroy the British way of life that has made Australia what it is. Once the Government gets the power over our financial resources, it will have the power to direct every citizen to do its bidding. This means industrial conscription. That is the price Australia will have to pay when this bill becomes law. . In conclusion, let me say a few words to those Australians who voted the Labour party into power on the assurance that if the Chifley Government were returned, democracy would be in safe hands. These people now find that their hitherto democratic way of life is in the gravest peril. Are they satisfied to allow the very Government, which they returned to power to safeguard their interests, to filch policy, my support would go to this from them their personal liberty and freedom? Are they willing to be pushed around by a socialist government, to be told when and how they shall spend their money, where they shall work and in what occupations they shall engage ? Let me tell those people that they have been the victims of the greatest political confidence trick in Australia's history. That is the political crime which the Chifley Government committed when it introduced this bill. The Australian Country party and the Liberal party are thoroughly united to defeat this action by every constitutional means at their disposal. We are determined that Australia shall continue to be a bulwark of democracy, a citadel of freedom, and a Mecca of the white race. Sir. Fadden. banking policy has long been founded on three fundamental principles: first, that money should be the servant and not the master; secondly, that the nation's credit should be based on the real wealth of the nation; and, thirdly, that such credit should be managed by the banking system in the interests of all the people and not in the interests of the privileged few. Those are the principles to which I have subscribed all my political life, and for which I have fought. The real test of any banking measure is whether it will fulfil the principles I have stated. Both Greater proa private banking system and a national banking system can be used to defeat It has been disregarded. the principles laid down in the Labour party's banking policy. That is why I feel that the Parliament should be concerned, not so much with the machinery of the' proposed new banking structure, as with the policy upon which it will operate. A monopoly can be a two-edged sword. A monopoly designedto assist the people can, in the wrong hands, be used to oppress the people A monopoly bank in the hands of the enemies of the Labour movement might be a most effective weapon to crush the Labour movement absolutely and completely. That is why I believe that the Parliament should examine the banking policy of the present Government, the Government's background, and its record. If I were satisfied that the Government would implement Labour measure without any reservation. But how can I trust a government that sacrificed a vital principle of the Labour movement? It repudiated its own pledge to the people when it introduced conscription of human life. Is it prepared to apply Labour principles in banking, or will it again betray the Labour movement? What would be the policy of a monopoly Commonwealth Bank? Would it operate under a vigorous charter, plan the resources of Australia, finance new investments, reduce interest rates to a cost basis, and underwrite the future of Australia, by making it easy for people to obtain loans and establish new industries ? Or would the bank continue its present policy of hide-bound conservatism, far more conservative than any of the private",53,Manufacturers
110,Mr Lang (Reid) [9.47],"Labour' sbanks, and be a hindrance to tbe proper development of this country? An ultraconservative Commonwealth Bank, operating as a monopoly, would do far more damage than an ultra-conservative Commonwealth Bank in competition with the private banks. The policy of the monopoly bank under this legislation would .'be the policy of the government of the day. We cannot get away from that. Under a Labour government it should, but not necessarily would, be a Labour policy. Under an anti-Labour government the policy of the bank would be opposed to that of the Labour movement. Therefore, the first consideration should be to make certain that, at least in its initial stages, the policy of the monopoly Commonwealth Bank would be a Labour policy. It is not my intention to go back to happenings during the financial and economic depression except for one particular phase that has a direct bearing on this bill. The present Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) was a Minister in the Scullin Government. His economic philosophy to-day is the same as it was then. He has not changed. The policy of the Scullin Government was that of deflation, ef reduction of' credit, of restrictions, of reduced wages and pensions, and the idolatry of money as the master. The history of 'that Government showed the danger to the Labour movement of a banking monopoly. The Scullin Government was a party to that monopoly. It was the tool that carried out the monopoly's instructions. The monopoly at that time consisted, not of the Commonwealth Bank alone, not of the private banks alone, but of the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks working together with a common policy, under one direction and with one spokesman-the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank. At that time the Commonwealth was being paralysed because the banking monopoly refused to find the money for employment. Then, as now, a Labour government was in power. Then, as now, there were two schools of thought in the Labour party. The then Prime Minister, Mr banking is relatively unimportant. If is Scullin, supported by his protege, the present Prime Minister, by the late Mr the banks that is all-important. A monoLyons, and Mr Penton, followed the Niemeyer line of deflation. Other Labour men, like "" Frank"" Anstey, the late Mr Curtin, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) and a group of members from New South Wales, including the then honourable members for Werriwa, West Sydney, Lang, Hunter and Barton, demanded that the nation's credit should be utilized to provide money for work for the unemployed. In 1930, the Prime Minister went to England for an Empire conference. Mr Theodore was out of the Cabinet over the Mungana incident. Mr Fenton was left in charge of the Government, with Mr Lyons as acting Treasurer. Mr Theodore went to caucus and proposed that the Government should raise credits to the amount of £20,000,000 for public works to absorb the unemployed. Mr Scullin, who was then in London, was informed of what was happening in caucus. He then sent a cable to Mr Lyons setting out his own views in the following terms:To create credit for £20,000,000 for loan works is unsound and I expect the banks to refuse to do so. The Government cannot deliberately coerce the administration of the banks. Such a proposal means permanent inflation, which cannot be checked as implied and would demand further inflation. That cable wrecked the Labour movement. It meant the parting of the ways and a struggle that lasted for many bitter years. It was followed immediately by the demands on State Labour governments from both the Commonwealth Bank chairman and the private trading banks. The 'banking monopoly made the demands; the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank issued the orders. The leader of the Commonwealth Labour Government supported the banking monopoly up to the hilt. That was how a Labour government failed this country in time of need. That was how a Labour government surrendered to a banking monopoly. It was the issue that brought the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) into this Parliament. It was the policy of the Government that was wrong. The Government refused to govern. What happened then can happen again. The machinery of the policy of the government that controls poly Commonwealth Bank under a government with the same outlook as the Scullin Government would fail the people of tiis country in exactly the same way as that administration failed them.

That statement was a clear operate in exactly the same way as the enunciation of the principles for which Adelaide declaration defined the fundathe Labour movement in New South mental principles of Labour's banking, Wales had been fighting, and provided policy.

Tbe Labour party's banking and taken to ensure that interest rates shall credit policy as set out at that time has be reduced to an actual cost basis. never been altered. It reads as follows:Purpose: The utilization of the real wealth of Ausparty.

(2) The ensuring of essential community purchasing power by the organization of employment and the expansion of social services to enable Australian primary and secondary industries to operate at their maximum capacity.

We do not want shibboleths about full employment or promises of a golden age. We want reality. There should be written into this bill a provision that the Commonwealth Bank shall be a. non-profit-making institution. That would be strictly in accordance with Labour policy. There should be a provision stipulating the maximum rates of interest for both deposits and advances. There should be a provision to make certain that advances shall not be subject to the arbitrary whim of a particular employee, but that there shall be some speedy appeal to a representative advisory body. The only test of the Government's sincerity on banking is whether or not it has made a real attempt to put into operation the Labour party's banking policy. The 1945 Banking Act was intended to give to the Commonwealth Bank, not some of, but all of the powers specified in the plan of action. The operations of the Commonwealth Bank were removed from the control of, and made entirely independent of, private banking interests. The Commonwealth Bank Board was abolished, and the original method of control restored. There could be no further hindrance to the expansion of the Commonwealth Bank's business as a trading bank. encountered so far has been the failure of the statutory provision that the banking of all public bodies should be reserved for the Commonwealth Bank. But how has the Government carried out the mandate it received under the 1945 act? The Commonwealth Bank is still the most conservative bank in the Commonwealth. Its lending policy is rigid and restrictive. There has been no real competition with the private banks. There has been no attempt to force down the rate of interest. Apart from the financing of the Government's guaranteed housing loans, the Commonwealth Bank has made no attempt to underwrite the industrial expansion of the Commonwealth. Althoughi t no longer turns away customers by ordering them back to the private banks, it offers no real inducement to them to transfer their business. By healthy competition, the Commonwealth Bank could have captured the banking business of the Commonwealth. It has failed because its executives are still steeped in the idea that tbe function of a bank is to be at all fact, if the basis of compensation is times ultra-cautious, and ultra-conservative. What guarantee is there that when this bill becomes law, that policy will be reversed? This Parliament is entitled to know who is to be the Governor of the bank and who is to be responsible for banking -policy. With the passing of the 1945 act, this Government had the responsibility to introduce Labour party policy. It has not done so. Its failure clouds the entire consideration of the present measure. This question of policy is of paramount importance. The Government has the fixed idea that another depression is around the corner. The banking system has failed Australia in every depression. That applies both to the private banks and to the Commonwealth Bank since its establishment. If the Prime Minister is right in his diagnosis of the world's future, we are surely entitled to know something imore of the Government's banking policy. If the Government adheres to the same ideas as the Scullin Government had in the last depression, then the outlook is grim indeed. In the hands of this or. some other government, the monopoly control of banking could be used to enforce a plan of ecoThe only impediment nomic conscription. The wages cheques of even many of the largest industrial firms are financed week by week on bank overdrafts. By restriction of credit, it would be possible to force those firms out of business. If the Government wanted to close down certain kinds of industries, then all it would have to do would be to call upon them to reduce their overdrafts. One other aspect of this bill that flouts every known principle of Labour policy, is its compensation provisions. No one can assess the amount of money involved. The actual current share valuations could be regarded as a basis only. The High Court might have other ideas regarding the just price principle that it has held must rule in such transactions. Who is going to get these compensations? According to the Prime Minister's own official organ, and also the official organ of the Communist party in New South Wales, the amount of compensation paid to 527 shareholders would amount to £18,000,000. It is for the Prime Minis-' ter to say whether that is a statement of higher than that anticipated by the Government, those shareholders will benefit, accordingly. More than £100,000,000 will probably be involved. With that amount of money suddenly becoming fluid, assets would be created that could be employed with the most damaging effects against the Australian economy. It could be the spring-' board for inflation. Labour's policy never envisaged such compensation. Had the Commonwealth Bank implemented Labour policy, the need would never have arisen to compensate the private banks. A peoples' bank, operating on a nonprofit-making basis, would have destroyed, by vigorous competition, all threats of a private banking combine. It was only the failure of the Commonwealth Bank to carry out Labour policy that provided the excuse, on which this bill is based. The mergers of private banks in recent years have demonstrated that they were vulnerable to competition. The Commonwealth Bank never took on the fight. Now the taxpayers are to be called upon to pay huge amounts in compensation, not only to return capital actually invested in the private banks, but also to compensate them for their huge concealed reserves. It would appear that the Government is entering upon a marathon litigation that will please the legal fraternity and appal the community at large. If it lasts till after the next elections, the result might prove just as appalling to many supporters of the Government. That is the bill with all its imperfections, and all my reservations. The Government elected by Labour votes says it cannot fulfil the trust imposed in it by the Labour movement without this legislation. This bill is its responsibility, and I accept no share of the responsibility for its introduction. But I am not prepared to give this Government any further excuse for defaulting on Labour policy. If it is granted all the powers it asks, and then fails to carry out Labour's pledges, it will be responsible directly to the people. The responsibility for the policy to be followed rests, not only on the Prime Minister, but on every member of his party. The Government has framed its own bill. It has an absolute majority in both Houses. SoI am prepared to vote to give it a mandate to' provide itself with the machinery it says it needs. For that reason, and for that reason only, I propose to vote for the second reading of this bill. adjourned.

Has the Government any views on the matter? If it has, whai. form of control does it intend to propose shall be imposed? Has the right honourable gentleman noted Russia's interest in the region ? The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : Largely through the efforts of the Australian delegation to the Paris conference, a treaty of peace with Italy obliges the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, w it h whom the final decision on this lies, to take into consideration the' views of other interested governments before making a decision. The Government has taken all possible steps, as indicated by the Minister for External Affairs in his statement on international affairs tabled in the House on the 6th June, to ensure that its views will be considered to the maximum extent permissible under the treaty. Preliminary consideration is now being given to this question by the special deputies of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The immediate objectives of the Government are that it shall receive in good time all information available to the deputies, including reports of any commissions of investigation which may be sent out to ascertain the wishes and welfare of the inhabitants of the areas concerned and that its final view Council of Foreign Ministers.
