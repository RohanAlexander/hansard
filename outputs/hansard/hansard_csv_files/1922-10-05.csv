The Committee was in the midst of the Bill which had been given first place on the notice-paper; suddenly, after the closure had been applied, progress was reported. Then, when I sought to learn what business was to come before the House-whe n I asked what measure could be so important as to warrant this extraordinary procedure, I was given to understand that no fresh business was to be introduced, but that the House would revert, in Committee, to the consideration of the same measure. I give timely warning that if the Minister( Mr( Mr Blakeley) has done. There is only Greene) pursues this course upon which he has entered, the Government will have' to continue to do the same throughout the next week or two.

I understand now that the Leader of the House is prepared to go no further in that direction if we will give reasonable despatch to business, and get the Bill through. I think that every man on this side will agree that it was our desire' to get the measure through to-night, and. the feeling aroused has been engendered by the action of the Minister himself.

I then suggested that all those who were still alive, and who had forty years' service to their credit, should be has given a different entitled to their second furlough or six The distinct spirit of the law months' pay in lieu thereof. The .date fixed in the clause, namely, the 30th November, 1919, is an arbitrary one, and I suggest that it should be omitted, and that those who are qualified in the way It is laid down I have indicated should be entitled tc their second furlough. in my possession several letters from former public servants who have served for upwards of forty years in the State and Commonwealth Servioe.

111,Mr Blundell (Adelaide) [9.51],"Lmy proposal to returned soldiers who have not less than two years' service to their credit, and are declared by the heads of their Departments to have carried out their duties in an entirely satisfactory manner. I make the further proviso that the work shall be of a non-clerical character. It may be said that this would be unfair to returned mem outside the Service who are waiting to get in , but Mich men could only obtain employment on the discharge of returned soldiers already in the Department. The passing of this provision w ill not prevent men outside the Service from entering it . Some of the men to whom my amendment would apply have been temporarily employed for seven or eight years, and in ordinary circumstances may continue in the Service for another ten or twelve years. The trouble is, however, that they are liable at any moment to be discharged. No objection to this provision can reasonably be offered by men already in the Service, because it will apply only to returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed for at least two years. We have already agreed to clause 38, which declares that a man who has served in the Navy, and has a satisfactory record, may be appointed without examination to any office in the Fourth Divisioni n the Department of Trade and Customs. We have made that provision for men who have served in the Navy, and there is no reason why we should not place in the same position men who have served in the Australian Imperial Force. We ought not to make distinctions between the two classes of service. Some of these men were temporarily employed in the Public Service when the war broke out. They are still on the temporary list, and can be discharged at a moment's notice. people in this country. the policy of the Government is preference to returned soldiers, I think we ought to give the returned men who have been in the Servicef or not less than two years, and who are performing their duties to the satisfaction of the heads of their Departments, an opportunity to become permanent employees. I hope the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) w ill accept the amendment. I desire to associate myself with the hondell) in this amendment, but I do not propose to speak at length or to repeat what he has so well said. I would draw the attention of the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) to the fact that, while these men are described as temporary employees, and have been employed in the Service two years and upwards, the work they are performing is not of a temporary c h a r a c t e r The y are doing the ordinary work of the various Departments, and it is simply the tenure of their position that can be regarded as temporary. They are liable, as the"" honourable member has said, to be dismissed at any time. It seems to me that these returned soldiers deserve consideration, and the fact that for two years and upwards they have been doing the ordinary regular work of the Departments in a manner that commends itself to their departmental heads should be a sufficient guarantee that they would make efficient officers of the permanent Servioe. port the amendment. There are many returned men in the Public Servioe working as temporary employees who have been incapacitatd as a result of their war services. They do not receive sufficient by way of pension to enable them to provide for themselves and their families, and they do not desire to be a burden upon the community. I may cite the typical case of a man who iost a .leg. Before the war he had been a labourer. A f t e r his discharge from a military hospital he obtained employment in the . Postal Department, and worked in a mail room. In the course of several years' eervice as a temporary hand he has given every satisfaction.

On more than one occasion I have had to go to t h e Postmaster General and ask that this man be employed for a further period.

117,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Attorit. If the Government were to be consistent and give the same concession to clerical workers as to non-clerical employees, about 400 former soldiers who have passed a competitive examination, and have made themselves eligible for employment in the Commonwealth Service, would be affected merely because certain other returned men had had the good fortune to get in ahead of them and secured temporary employment. All returned men should be put upon an equal footing. The Act specially provides for that. If returned men occupying temporary positions are made permanent employees, the Government w ill be setting tip a special class of ex-soldiers to the exclusion of all other former soldiers. VvThen temporary positions are about to be made permanent, the canons of f a i r play demand' that these posts shall be thrown open to all returned soldiers who have rendered themselves eligible for permanent employment in the Public Service. admitted to certain permanent positions in the Customs Department, foT example, without being required to' undergo an examination ? covers only certain men who possess special marine qualifications. a long way towards getting over the difficulty which some honourable members foresee by leaving out sub-clause 4. able members can have real cause for complaint as matters stand. I hope the Attorney-General w ill reconsider the position. A returned man who has given satisfaction in a temporary post, in the course of two or three years of unbroken service, should not be called upon to? stand down for another returned soldier merely because the latter has succeeded in a competitive examination. of a temporary position has also the opportunity to qualify himself by passing the same examination. MrM c WILLIAMS porary positions are at work all day in the Government service. What time have they to "" stew "" for an utterly unnecessary examination ? How many members would be prepared forthwith to undergo this examination ? I would not care to do so, at any rate, and if these returned soldiers in temporary positions were called upon either to pass an examination or "" s t a nd d o w n "" the great bulk of them would have to leave. What would be ths use of that? Where would the fairnes come in , seeing that the vacancies wouM be filled by other returned men ? I heartily support the amendment of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Blundell). The Attorney-General does not seem to me to have given a convincing reason why the amendment should not bs accepted. Why should not returned men who have satisfactorily worked in temporary positions be permitted to retain them permanently ? Why should they be called upon to give way to other returned soldiers who happen to have qualified by passing an examination ? My sympathies are certainly w i th those other returned soldiers who have fitted themselves to W h y are naval men enter the Service, and are waiting; but, surely several years of satisfactory work on the part of those returned soldiers who are temporary employees must be taken as an adequate offset to passing an examination!
