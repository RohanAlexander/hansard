2,Mr Crouch (Corio) [3.1],"Last week,be for thirty-five years only,"" whereupon the honourable member for Melbourne Ports replied that that was not correct, that the statement was not made in his speech, and the honourable member for Gwydir added, "" Another unscrupulous interjection by the honourable member for Corio."" I should not have taken notice of the remarks of these honourable members, whose denials cr contradictions are immaterial to me, had not my statement been commented upon outside. Let me read from the official re.port of the Brisbane Conference what the honourable member for South Sydney really did say. I shall read only those passages of his speech affecting the matter immediately in question. The honourable member is reported to have said thatHe bad carefully scrutinized Commonwealth expenditure, and admitted that the amount set down would not do all he would like it to do; but, on the other hand, to take even what they were asking would possibly be a bit of a wrench for the States. Four sentences further on he addedThe proposal meant, in effect, that Â£ 1 or 25s. per head would be paid to the States out of Commonwealth, revenue, no matter from whence it was obtained by the Commonwealth. And a little later he saidThis scheme met the objection raised by> the the Commonwealth law reports .in South Premiers' Conference against Sir William Lyne's proposals; the Premiers objected to there not being any provision after thirty-five years, and Mr O'Malley's proposition was open to a simiconsidered by the local pressmen to be lar criticism. It is clear that the honourable member for South Sydney thought that the scheme would have effect for a longer period than thirty-five years, because he said that it would meet the Premiers' objections to the proposals of the honourable member for Hume, and to there being no provision after thirty-five years. Prime Minister whether he will have inquiries made with a view to ascertain if it is true that vessels sometimes leave Australian ports with cargoes stowed above empty ballast tanks, thus raising the centre of gravity and correspondingly lessening the vessels' stability, and increasing their tendency to capsize in a heavy seaway ? Is he aware that some nautical experts hold the opinion that the loss of the Clan Ronald and other vessels was due to that cause? Will he see that suitable provision is made in the Navigation-o r some other-Bil l to prevent vessels from proceeding to ' sea in such a condition as may jeopardize the safety of life and property from this orother avoidable causes? deals with the unseaworthiness of rhips; but I do not know how farthe suggestion of the honourable member would conflict or harmonize with its provisions. I shall, have pleasure in referring the matter to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has charge of the measure.

Debate resumed from 29th October (vide That this Bill be now read a second time. there is only one matter in connection with this Bill with which I have not already dealt. When the debate was adjourned I was about to point out the very considerable danger that arises in connection with the postal voting system. I expressed the opinion that the whole system should' be abolished, and, of course, I am therefore strongly ooDosed to anv extension of it. The Commission that investigated the matter a few years ago made this statement in their report:Without concluding that undue influence was we all desire to see every facility given to used in connection with the postal vote the evidence adduced shows that under the present women to-exercise their vote with some desub-section advantage might be taken to destroy gree of comfort, we must not forget that the free and secret exercise of the franchise. Although since the Commission reported we at such long intervals, that it is somewhat have amended the law,I hold that if a straining the point to talk about the effort wider inquiry into its operations were posthat is necessary to get to the polls. Many sible, the statement 1 have quoted would women in their every-day life have to cover be borne out. I have referred to the safelong distances; and the elections and poliguards which we provide to secure the tical meeting are now conducted with such secrecy of the ballot and prevent the exerdecorum that there does not seem to be cise of undue influence at elections.

All the short notices which appear in the local these safeguards are provided in order that press, and the information afforded by inelections may be properly conducted, and to terested canvassers and tourers. prevent the exercise of undue influence, but greatest safeguard can be obtained only by there is not one of them associated with the arranging that every woman shall go to the operation of the postal voting provision. polling place, while, of course, facilities This fact should of itself make us only the are provided for those who may be away more careful about extending that operation. from home on the election day. The Every one who has had any experience of radius of 7 miles appears to be very the way in which voting by post is carried small, when we consider that people are on must be aware that under that system willing to walk quite that distance, or to unfair and Undue influence is frequently ride 50 miles, to attend a political meetexercised. strongly in favour of providing this class, it might be thought I should prefacility to vote for persons who could not fer to vote for extended facilities; but, be present in their . electorate on the under the "" Q "" form, when the electors are [196] day of polling, I have now come to the conclusion that it would be wise to abolish the postal voting provision. With the facilities that are now afforded in other directions, there is less need than ever for postal voting. Statements made to me as to the undue influence deliberately used in Queensland, show that the vote recorded in this way is not the honest vote of the people, but one influenced by fear. This was shown distinctly at Charters Towers, where the women were told that if they did not vote for certain candidates their husbands would lose their positions; and husbands, who had the courage to vote as supporters of the Labour party did suffer. DoI understand that the Government are opposed to the proposal of the honourable member for Balaclava? because it means that there is no likelihood of the suggestion being accepted.

33,Mr Fuller,Yes.,18,Electoral Bill Second Reading
34,Mr Spence,"I am glad to hear that,subjected to dose questioning, and are under the public gaze, I think every safeguard is provided. That leaves only the sick to provide for, and the percentage of these cannot be large; and it therefore seems that we have to choose between the disfranchise of a limited number, owing to such adverse circumstances as we all must meet, or taking the risk of ten times the greater evil by the extension of the postal voting system. As I say, I am very glad to hear ithat the Government is not prepared to accept the proposal of the honourable member for Balaclava; and, further, I may repeat, in my opinion, the 7 miles' limit is too large, seeing .that in Sydney and Melbourne, where half the population of the two States reside, the electors can easily use the trams for that distance. It is unnecessary, on the second reading, to deal with all the details of the B ill , but I urge, as I have previously urged, that instructions beyond those already printed and issued are necessary for returning officers and others concerned in the elections. this Bill through, so as to start on that work as soon as possible. lay the passing of the B ill . to which -1 have referred is one of the utmost importance, for a blunder made by an officer in connection with an election is both troublesome and costly. should be a careful selection of officers in the first place, and instructions should be given to inexperienced officers so that risk of mistakes will be reduced to a minimum, more particularly in connection with postal voting, which is not carried on under the eyes of properly-trained officials. tion relating to the Department of Home Affairs is not showy, but has certainly an important bearing on the public. Nothing is more to be desired than a thoroughly workable and effective Electoral Act. Electoral legislation is essentially a people's question, and we want ""a people'* measure, irrespective -of party political views. . The Parliament that supplies the 'people with an -easy, honest, and ready method of recording their votes does them mo more than justice. This Bill is really a machinery measure, and, whilst important, is not as far-reaching as should i>e the 'legislation of a Commonwealth Parliament, which should be able to pride itself at least on the possession of effective electoral machinery. I am not carping, nor do I desire to reflect on the Minister of Home Affairs, but it is remarkable .that, since 1902, we have had no less than five amending Electoral Bills. Patch after patch has been applied to the original Act instead of a complete and thorough Electoral Bill being introduced. The Minister has probably not held office long enough to enable him to introduce such a B ill , and no doubt an amendment of this will be found necessary later on. The honourable member for Darling, notwithstanding the name of the constituency which he represents, is opposed to the extension of facilities for voting by post to women. It was only yesterday, figuratively speaking, that the partj to which he belongs was most pronounced in its advocacy of the principle of voting by .post, and T admit that one of the essentials of a Democracy is that all the electors, male and female, weak and strong, shall have the readiest method of recording their votes. tion which takes place in connection with voting by post. The matter to secure electoral reform, we can forget mere matters of party ascendancy. The Labour party have the most complete organization, and their opponents, who make use There of voting by post, are, for the most part, people who are not accustomed to work as part of a large political force. No one knows better than I ' do that the political labour forces of Australia, to their infinite credit, vote with almost religious fervour, and avail themselves to the utmost of the work of their organizations. We are asked now to affirm, not a new principle, but the extension of the principle of voting 'by post plus a further, guarantee of the preservation of the secrecy of the ballot. The new forms, copies of which have been distributed by the Minister, are most admirable. Their provisions are simple, and they will prove of great use to the average elector. The Minister is entitled to credit for having supplied honourable members with illustrations of the procedure under this measure, which, although they may savour of the kindergarten, are undoubtedly very useful. While honourable members opposite object to voting by post the honourable member for Darling has indulged in a. paean of praise for the ""' Q ""'-",18,Electoral Bill Second Reading

It allows an electoral claim to be entertained simply on the representation of the claimant. There is no witness, and no guarantee is required. The clanger is that such claims can be made just before an election, and that, when made, they have to be honoured by the electoral registrar. During the fortnight preceding polling-day, these claims are likely to be made in shoals. People will rush to the registrars,, claiming the right to beenrolled in certain electorates. The police authorities will have no time to check the claims, and there will be no guarantee as to whether they are genuine, or not. in the subdivision for which they desire to vote a month before an electionapplication there is no test as to whether the applicant has resided in the subdivision for a month, or any shorter period. Even the signature of the claimant has not to be witnessed. The fact that these forms are to be superseded furnishes an extra reason why this Bill should be put through speedily. If there has been corruption of a serious, character hitherto,, it has occurred in consequence of these forms being used. If a man. named Smith, for exThe average ample, said that he resided in.

I never saw more questions jammed into a smaller space in my life. These forms will be used by people, some of whom are in a hurry, some of whom will be nervous, and some of whom write a large hand. No fewer than six questions have to be answered upon a very small card. Does the Minister really think that the card is sufficiently large ? I do not know whether a spasm of economy has suddenly overtaken him. simply require an elector to answer "" yes "" or "" n o "" ? answers to questions, the card has to contain the date of the application, the signature of the claimant, the signature of a witness, with his occupation and place of living.

I do not know whether the Government have asked the Minister of Home Affairs to cut clown the expenditure of the Electoral Department, but I hold that, in regard to electoral matters, he should not be governed in his actions by a consideration for pounds, shillings, and pence. agree with the honourable member. electors to cast their votes should not be regulated by that consideration. I do not suggest extravagance in the Department; but I certainly ask that every elector shall lie afForded the fullest facilities for recording his vote, and that an amount sufficient for that purpose should be provided. I have never been much impressed by a Chief Electoral Officer who, in his report, claimed that he had conducted an election more cheaply than had any one else. Now, we can have cheap and nasty elections. It is only once in three years that the people get a chance to speak their mind; and we always hope, that they will speakwith a coherent and powerful voice. I have ever been opposed to the rolls being collected in the present manner, I hope yet to see the Minister propose a broad and comprehensive amendment of the electoral law, instead of relying upon a system which, if looked into, would be found to be very costly. I venture to say that the services of the police, the postal officials, and the registrars, if properly appraised, would represent a very large sum. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Electoral Office should work in conformity with the State Electoral Offices; in fact, there should be one large.

It should carefully watch the arrivals in, and departures from, every electorate, and maintain a system for the purification of the rolls, which, whenever an election was sprung upon the people, should always be found, by the Parliament and the country, to be almost perfect.

I consider that the Minister has acted wisely in adhering to and simplifying the system of voting by post. I had hoped that, in addition to providing reasonable facilities for voting, the Bill would have also provided for the contingent or preferential vote, not the proportional vote, which isa different thing. Many persons confuse the two things. It has been rumoured in certain newspapers that a system of preferential voting would be introduced. stated here the other day that it would be done. that the Minister will have charge of a Bill of that character. ery measure. expenditure on electoral matters, the Minister ought to be intrusted with unlimited power, because we cannot expect him to provide a proper system unless proper machinery is placed at his command.

To the resident of a city or a suburb that is considered something, but, of course, to a resident of a country place it is nothing. In the latter case it serves to kill time. A man's nearest neighbour in the country may not be much closer than seven miles, and, therefore, the distance is considered nothing. But, unfortunately, in the congested areas, the more means of locomotion that is provided the more do people dislike travelling a distance. It is of no use to beat about the bush. Townsfolk get lazy and almost want a polling booth to be established alongside their door. I believe that country people are far more active on polling day than are the residents in congested areas. The latter have many other things to occupy their minds, but in country districts a general election is one of the few excitements which the people get. Before voting by post is abolished it should be remembered that in our large cities and their suburbs there is a tendency for a certain proportion of the people at certain seasons of the year to reAlthough the Commonsort to country districts to recuperate.

The system has so developed as to have become almost the substitution of a postal vote for a personal vote. to travel 7 miles in some country districts than it is to travel 14 miles in other districts. but, in most districts, the elector has no difficulty in travelling 7 miles. Any one who may be prevented by serious illness or infirmity from attending a polling place is also entitled to vote by post. There can be no objection to that. But I complain that the continued extension of the system has made it dangerous. It is quite unnecessary to give any party complexion to the objection to the present postal votint provisions. I assume that all political parties desire facilities for the free exercise of the will of the electors. Any scheme lending itself to coercion of any kind must be viewed with grave suspicion, and its operation hedged round with all kinds of safeguards. . member speak of "" coercion "" ? perhaps, a rather stronger term than it is their dignity. necessary to use.

The master or mistress asks them if they intend to vote. If they say they do, a postal voting certificate is obtained, and they are asked such a measure will not be passed. The to sign it.

The whole business is carried out as a sort of family arrangement, and in such circumstances only strong-willed persons, who may be careless about annoying a master or mistress, are able to exercise their free will in the matter. This is a species of intimidation, or undue influence, that is exercised at every election. It is idle to say that it is not, because, as a matter of fact, we know that the ballot system is being undermined, as a result of the extensive use of the postal voting provisions. We have gone in our law very much further than any provisions adopted in South Australia. Under the State law we had at least this safeguard, that the elector wishing to vote by post had to attend at a post-office and record his vote in the presence of the postmaster, some time prior to the election.

In conclusion, I wish only to express the hope that we shall not have introduced year after year Bills to amend the electoral law. It would be far better for us to put up with some slight inconvenience rather than to be constantly amending tlie law, since these frequent changes tend to confuse the-electors and to prevent votes being recorded to the extent' that they would otherwise be. [4.48] I am sure that the Minister has introduced this Bill with the intention of providing the fullest facilities for the electors to record their votes. If there is one thing that is required more than another in connection with our electoral legislation it is that the most ample facilities for voting shall be provided, because we find that, in connection with most elections, the proportion of votes recorded is remarkably small. In quite a number of instances not more than 50 per cent, of the persons enrolled have recorded their votes. That shows either that fhe people do not take such an interest as they ought to take in a. Federal election or that the facilities to record their votes are not what they ought to be. In this connection I regret to find that some honourable members are opposed to the facilities fot voting by post for which this Bill provides. Under this R l l persons, who are ill or who expect to ; be not less than 7 miles, distant from a polling, booth on the day of an election may vote by post.. Some honourable memI t is not proposed to do bers in objecting to that provision have said that a, distance of 7 miles is a mere nothing. One honourable member declared that it would be an easy matter f o i people to travel that, distance by tram. I regret to say that there are many parts of my electorate where t is impossible to travel ; that distance either by tram or train, although they are enterprising people there who could record their votes in an intelligent manner if reasonable facilities were afforded them. In many districts in my electorate the polling booths are far more than 7 miles apart, and to say that it is nothing for a woman to leave her home and her children and to travel 7 miles or more to record her vote is to display a total ignorance of the conditions under which people are living, or a want of interest, which is even worse. WhileH a d such a prothe system of voting by post may be sub-1 ject to abuse the advantage which it offers is that it gives every one an opportunity to vote. If the Minister is not disposed in country districts to provide polling booths less than 7 miles apart, then voting by post is the next best provision to make. If we were able to provide a polling booth within easy reach of the residence of every elector the position would be different; butj we are not able to do so, and if we were to do away with the system of voting by post we should practically declare that people who had the courage to gowork of pioneers should be denied a voice in the selection of the members of this Parliament. I am sure that no honourable member desires that. Voting by post must, of course-, be safeguarded from abuse, but I am inclined to think that the abuses said to be associated with the system are considerably magnified. In country districts more particularly, many people are constantly travelling. Men travel with stock or engage in various businesses which take them miles awav from the polling booths in respect of which they are enrolled. Then there are commercial travellers who are seldom at home. All these people have appreciated the postal' voting system. travellers use "" 0 "" forms? travellers do not always know when they are likely to be home.",26,Electoral Bill Second Reading

The facilities for voting should be made as easy as possible. objection 1 have to the Bill is that electors who intend to vote by post will be able to obtain the necessary ballot-paper only from the returning officer of their electorate. Cowper lives at the extreme end of the electorate, and it would be impossible for people in some parts of the electorate to obtain a reply to an application for a postal ballot-paper in less than ten days. Many people are not aware ten days before polling-day that they will not be at home on that day, and consequently many people, because of this provision, have been and will be debarred from voting. I should like to see power given to the deputy returning officers to issue postal ballot-papers, and I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion. system of voting by post should not only be retained, but, subject to proper safeguards, increased. I-desire to refer relates to the way in which names of persons are allowed to remain on the rolls in respect .of an electorate from which they have removed. having become enrolled for a certain district, leave without notifying the Electoral Department of their change of residence, and their names consequently remain on the rolls for a considerable time. possible for a man to vote for an electorate in which he has no interest. Many persons on changing their places of residence do not take the trouble to have their names placed on the roll of the electorate to which they have removed, and if they vote at all they vote in respect of electorates in which they have no interest or sympathy. Their homes are not there, but if their names are on the roll they can record their votes. 1 should like to see provision made for purging the rolls of the names of persons who have removed, and I trust that the Minister, before we reach the Committee stage, will consider these matters. -The honourable member for Dallev said that the Labour party had favoured the extension of postal voting. I remember when the system was introduced in South Australia with the object of allowing seamen who could not go to a polling-booth to record their votes. cil then saw fit to extend that provision in the direction for which both the Commonwealth and the South Australian law now provides ; but the working of the system has been anything but satisfactory. If we The only provide facilities for fraud, undoubtedly fraud will be perpetrated. The grossest kind of fraud has occurred in connection with postal voting. I took part in a re--> cent State election to fill the vacancy cau.'ed The returning officer for by the lamenteid death of the late Premier of South Australia, Mr Tom Price, and during the campaign I discovered several kinds of frauds. 1 am sorry to say that one of those frauds was perpetrated by the manager of one of the largest business concerns in Adelaide.

In this instance, however, even that safeguard was of no value. Two respectable lady canvassers called on an acquaintance of my owna lady who was seriously ill and could not possibly go to the polling booth on polling-day.

"" O h , "" my friend replied, "" my husband and I always vote for the Labour candidate."" They then coolly told her that they had interviewed her husband, and that he was not going to vote for the Labour man.

A number of houses were visited, at which the same sort of thing was done. At any rate, the postmaster admitted, when I made inquiries through the Deputy Postmaster General, that he had gone to different houses in a cab with the Commonwealth stamp. That is the kind of fraud that was perpetrated. member mean to say that electors in Soutli Australia were simple enough to vote in that manner? one thing about which the electors know little-and about which members of this Parliament know Httle-it is our electoral law. that kind of thing in Victoria. The honourable member is speaking of South Australia. of thing was done, wholesale, in Victorianotably in the electorate of Melbourne. It will be done elsewhere. When I went into the electorate of Wakefield at the recent election, I found that some intelligent people were not aware that an illiterate could go into the polling booth and direct his vote to be recorded by the returning offilong as it did not interfere with his duties cer, in the presence of a scrutineer. officer in St. Kilda at the last election, who business brought to them by leading residid not know that the Federal law allowed an illiterate voter to vote in that manner. vote at a State election in South Australia; that is to say, any one can inform him whether the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote is in the first, second, or third square on the ballot-paper; but he is not allowed to make use of the presiding officer in actually recording the vote, as I am pleased to say is the case under our Federal Act. of the Act to one returning officer, to prove to him that an illiterate voter could vote in that manner. to whom I have referred did not know the law.. He is a very honest man; but I have papers in my possession which show the kind of pressure that is brought to bear upon some postmasters by persons with whom they are dealing in the way of business. A postmaster who has a little store is naturally anxious to oblige a man with whom he has business relations; and although I am satisfied that the postmaster to whom I have been alluding did not know that he was breaking the law, yet I also know that the law has been broken systematically at every election. While the honourable member for Eden-Monaro wasPostmaster-General, I pointed out to him that in a country district in South Australia ""a postmaster was driving round in a vehicle with the Commonwealth stamp, and taking the votes of all and sundry. He told me that that sort of thing must be stopped, and that he would give directions that the stamp was not to be allowed to go out of the office. Nevertheless, after the Torrens election, the Deputy Postmaster General to whom I said that the Minister had told me that the stamp office, showed me the instructions that he had, and which contain no such direction. He showed me the instructions which he received in 1905 from Mr Sydney Smith, who was then Postmaster-General in the Reid Governmentinstructions which, I am glad to know, were given against the advice of the officers, who did not believe in them. These instructions permitted a postmaster to take out the stamp in the manner described, so to do so. Imagine the position of a number of postmasters dependent upon the dents in country places. These people would have no difficulty whatever in inducing the postmasters to travel for miles outside their own districts with the Commonwealth stamp. I know that in the Barker electorate a postmaster went miles outside his own district, and the most atrocious frauds have been committed. I am sorry that no punishment has been inflicted, though I gave the names of those who had done wrong in this matter. I believe that it is my duty to stop fraud under the Electoral Act, as far as possible. It is for these reasons that I object to the postal voting provisions. I know that the abolition of the system will inflict a hardship on shearers and seamen; but I bad rather see seamen, who may be at sea at election time, deprived of their vote, thanhave the frauds that are committed under the present system.

I doubt very much if the expense was not defrayed by honourable members, but I have no proof of that. It is a shocking scandal that 70,000 copies of a newspaper which was not registered, and which was circulating the most atrocious lies about the Labour party that I have ever I do not know that I would not read in the press, was permitted to pass through the Post Office at the same rate as registered newspapers. It was a fraud upon the public revenue.

Such proceedings ought to be safeguarded against. Under this Bill that man will have the power to strike the name of any person off the electoral roll. I have never been able to find out by whom such acts have been committed. A provision of the Act requires a sum of 5s. to be deposited by any person who applies to have the name df a person struck off the roll, and I desire to know whether it has been strictly enforcecf. the matter, and I understand so. Minister will ascertain if the provision is strictly carried out, because I doubti f it is. I know that names are struck off the rolls regularly. by the registrars? objections to .the names? sponsibility of making an objection after a private person has suggested that a certain name should be struck off. objections have been found not to be valid. The number of persons who come to me with a complaint that their names have been left off the rolls for an election has been astounding. We cannot take too much pains to insure that the name of a person shall not be struck off a roll without just cause being assigned. My chief complaint is against the postal voting provisions of the existing law. We should expunge every provision which creates a procedure liable to wholesale abuse. with the honourable member for Hindmarsh and others that we should do all that is possible ""to prevent fraud, but I am not in favour of abolishing the privilege of voting by post merely because abuse has occurred in connection with it, any more than I would be in favour of abolishing sovereigns because counterfeits are made, or cheques, because signatures are sometimes forged. Like the honourable meml;er for Cowper, I wish to encourage all to vote. The man who has broken his leg, or is otherwise in such a state that he cannot come to the polling booth, is as much entitled to vote as is the man who is strong and healthy. Such persons, and women who cannot get to the booths, should be allowed to vote by post. The postal voting provisions are also of advantage to persons living at places far removed from polling booths. In closelysettled districts and in cities the disadvantage of distance does not exist. I have always been in favour of postal voting, and hope that it will be continued. I hope, too, that provision will be made for preferential voting. When the right honourable member for Swan brought forward legislation affecting the Senate elections, I proposed the adoption of what: is known as the Hare system, but my proposal did not receive enough support to justify me in pressing it to a division. I still believe that that system is the best for making Parliament a truly representative Ixidy. Its adoption is not necessary, if all that is desired is to have the whole community voting for one or other of the main political parties, but if Parliament is to represent all shades of opinion, so that matters may be fairlv and impartially discussed in the public interest, p-ovision should be made for proportional voting. I hope, therefore, that some amendment will be moved here or in another place which will provide for the true representation of the whole, and not of part, of the people.

I am considering the matter impartially. If it is right to limit the expenses of candidates, it is also right to limit the expenses of organizations which work for the benefit of candidates. Without some such limitation, the wealthy must have an advantage over those who are without means. Without some such limitation, those who are well off must win, while the poor will go to the wall. I hope to see the day when party squabbles will cease, and all will try to do what is best, in the interests, not of a party, but of the whole community. [5-37]-I wish to remove trie misapprehension under which the honourable member for Hindmarsh was labouring when he said that frauds had been permitted in South Australia in connection with the absentvoters' provisions. He referred to cases in which postmasters were brought to certain houses to impress the office stamp on voting papers, and spoke of that as a fraud. I had, with the late Mr Kingston, something to do with the consolidation of the Electoral Acts in 1896. That codifying Act contains no provision requiring postmasters to be at their post-offices when applications are made to them for absent voters' papers. It being found inexpedient to allow postmasters to leave their offices, as was done in some cases, to go to private houses, the law was altered by the Act of 1908. But no fraud was committed by the action complained of under the Act of 1896. I think that these irregularities ought to be brought under the notice of the Department concerned^ so that if any officer has done wrong, the fault may be corrected. concerned; but the Department has received no information regarding these matters. Al l the Act of 1896 says is that the elector desiring and entitled to obtain an absent-voter's paper may, after .the issue of the writ, apply for an absent-voter's certificate. It was under that provision that the actions complained of were done. The Act of 1908 inserts, after the words ""may after the issue of the writ,"" the words, "" upon making a declaration in the prescribed form before a postmaster,"" and adds the proviso that the declaration shall be made, and the vote recorded, only at the post-office of which the postmaster is in charge. What was done before the passing of the Act of 1908 cannot be termed a fraud under the Act of 1896, or even a straining of its provisions, though they appear to have been taken advantage of. not desire to have the amount which a candidate may spend on an election-^100 increased, but I think that candidates should be allowed to spend their money with fewer restrictions.

224,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.50).,"Iat large too often labour under the belief that the partiality displayed by tlie press is an inspiration. We recognise the value of a free press, but we abhor the abuse of liberties. To avoid and prevent the further growth and repetition of these vile abuses, we humbly beg that the Government will for the future regulate the business of our elections as hereinafter suggested. While being cognisant of the cost to us as a people, we pray that our Parliament will enact that for three months prior to a general election newspapers shall not be allowed to refer to candidates in any way whatever, nor should they be allowed to in any way direct the electors in the selection of a candidate, nor should candidates be permitted to advertise in the press. In lieu of practices hitherto obtaining, we respectfully suggest that the candidates' names, views, and a list of proposed meetings shall be submitted to the electors by the Government, through the medium of the post. This may be a little costly, but we feel the expenditure would be well merited, as the present abuses will thereby be swept away. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. That petition has been signed by thousands of electors. aware that a candidate who has the backing of a powerful daily newspaper is enabled to speak, not to 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 people, but to speak with 100,000 tongues to 100,000 people. We know also that many of the statements published in the newspapers for political purposes at election time are the reverse of truthful, The petition I have read was prepared primarily to overcome this difficulty. 1 signed the petition, but it was not o t up s by me. It was got up by Mr Atkins, who was a candidate for the Senate at the last Commonwealth election, and who, in his own opinion and the opinion of many thousands of people who voted for him, was very unjustly treated by the press. What chance has the average man in a political contest against a man who has the backing of an important daily newspaper? His election expenses are limited to Â£ i o o , but if he were to spend the whole of that amount in advertisements one little paragraph published on behalf of his rival in the news columns, or side by side with the European telegrams, would be worth more than columns appearing in the ordinary advertising pages. I have fought the press for twenty years. The newspapers have been unceasing in their opposition to my political views. I have perhaps had to fight harder on that account, but 1 have so far been successful. 1 must admit that I possess an advantage which few members of this House possess in the fact that the constituencies I have represented have been compact constituencies. I have to-day the privilege of representing the most compact city in Australia. Sydney, splendid city as it is, isdivided, for Federal purposes, into four constituencies, all represented by the points of the compass. The fact that I have represented a compact constituency has enabled me to fight against tiie press by merely taking, the platform. The honourable member for Adelaide, the honourable memoer for Perth, and some other honourable members possess a similar advantage; but what chance has the man contesting a country constituency against the opinion of a large daily newspaper that speaks each day to a hundred thousand persons? He has to' contend against the influence of leading articles that are unsigned. The authorities of the newspaper address the electors with the important little word ""we,"" which is the prerogative only of royalty and the press, and I maintain that in this Honourable members are way the newspapers exercise too great a power. The petitioners to whom I have referred suggest thatIn lieu of practices hitherto obtaining, we respectfully suggest tliat the candidates' names, views, and a list of proposed meetings shall be submitted to the electors by the Government, through the medium of the post. That would not involve the engagement of a single additional postman or clerical official, and would not increase the expense of the Post and Telegraph Department by a penny piece. I can speak of the State of Victoria with some knowledge, and some time ago I estimated what it would cost to take a referendum of the electors of this State. My figures were checked by Mr McCutcheon, a mam of vast experience in this city, and a member of the State Parliament, and they showed that the views of every elector in Victoria might be secured at a referendum for a little less than Â£700. That is what it would cost to print the papers necessary to take such a referendum, and they could be delivered by the existing postal machinery without additional expense. The Postmaster-General is aware that if the papers were registered as newspapers it would be possible to send fifty or sixty of them through the post for one penny. I admit that no candidate would be so foolish as to expect to be fully reported by the daily press, but it is distinctly unfair that certain candidates should not be mentioned in the press. If the mighty daily press of this city combined to support the election of three persons to the Senate, what hope would any one, outside, perhaps, the members of the Labour party, have against those candidates? One newspaper is supposed to represent the Conservative interests, and is very fair in the expression of its opinion, even of its opponents, while the other is supposed to present the Democratic view, and does so, especially in regard to Protection and the referendum. When those two papers differ there is a chance for an independent man to slip in. As I have said before, if the Labour party had no organization. we could not possibly hope to fight this domination of the press. As the petition truly says, a newspaper is, first of all, run for. the purpose of making money, and not as an act of philanthropy, or with any very high ideal. . True, a newspaper may advocate a high ideal; but that is not the object for which it is conducted; to paraphrase an old Spanish proverb, from, I think, Don Quixote, "" Charity is a makeshift of the rich."" If this House is really honest in its desire to limit a candidate's expenses to Â£100 we should provide that, when a newspaper mentions the names of candidates, the publicity should be appraised at the current rates for advertising. If there had been such a law in existence many members who have had the luck to be returned on a wave of press opinion, would have had to certify to an expenditure of considerably more than ,Â£100. point to which I should like to draw attention is that of the use of vehicles at elections. If a man has friends, rich and willing enough to lend vehicles, he may have assistance representing ten times the amount that he puts down in his sworn statement for the conveyance of voters. In England we know that in this connection bribery is carried on to a disgraceful extent. I remember a late Premier of Victoria, Mr Munro, telling me that when he was asked to contest a seat in Great Britain he was told that he would have to plank down at least ,Â£2,000, though, of course, the cost of the contest would be considerably more. One member of the -House of Commons informed me that when he was granted a walk-over it cost him ,Â£25 for the official who declared that no other candidate had come forward. In England, in a constituency of 10,000 electors, the cost to the candidates is at least Â£500, so that, if there are two, it means .Â£250 each, an amount which, of course, is never returned. With our freer franchise we have not that bribery and. corruption, Dr. Maloney. but there is still the objection I have indicated in regard to the use of vehicles. In this connection the electors are humbugged, because here is afforded an opportunity for a rich candidate to spend practically as much as he likes. The streets of Melbourne have been filled with the dust of motor cars all in use for one candidate. Sydney. honourable member for Wentworth, that I am not making any personal attack, but merely pointing out that north, south, east and west we have this abuse. Of one honourable member in the House, who has my highest personal regard, it has been told me that while his expenses represented about two motor cars, he had, at least, the use of seventy motor and other vehicles, lent by his friends. I point out that the Act uses the words ""directly or indirectly; "" and I am sure that the Minister of Home Affairs will admit that it seems to be, the privilege of the profession to run a coach-and-four through any Act of Parliament. I know that the Minister is sincere in his desire for electoral purity ; and we may hope to have the benefit of his legal knowledge and acumen in providing that no owner of a vehicle shall be permitted to carry strangers to the poll on an election day-that no one shall be Another carried in a private vehicle except members of the' owner's household, up to, say, the number of ten, so as to include servants and so forth. I know how an employer can bring pressure to bear, though the ballot-box is, I believe, as secret as the grave. I know of only two exceptions in Victoria, one when three ballot-boxes were missing between eight at night and nine o'clock on the morning after fhe election in Melbourne, and another when the returns sent down were changed. As to voting by post, I have it from the confidential man of my opponent that he knew how ninety-nine out of every hundred voted; and in one subdivision of Melbourne, where the furthest distance from a booth was one-third of a mile, there were more postal votes than in the whole of the large State of South Australia. The proprietor of one of the largest hotels in Melbourne stood over his servants whilst they signed the certificates, although, as honourable members know, such a procedure is against the law. The result of that election was that I had a bill of costs of over ^200 in the highest Court of Australia, though I may say that that bill has not yet",35,Brown W E Do Not Do Was Not To Be Allowed To Leave The

We cannot be too -stringent in regard tovoting by post and I think the Minister of Home Affairs will not controvert any statement that I have made in this connection. The honourable gentleman may tell me that, if any illegal practices are carried on, the law wil 1 step in ; but we know that there are a greater number of criminals outside of gaol than in, and the law ought to be plainly set forth, so as to prevent any subterfuge. dying hours of a dying session of a dying Parliament a Bill may be easily slipped through; but we must prevent the unjust usage of wealth. of a man who wore knuckle-dusters in order to fight a man with bare fists, of a man who fought with a loaded revolver against blank cartridge, or eleven players being asked to meet twenty-two on a cricket field ?

If a policeman outside a polling-booth saw a conveyance repeatedly bringing voters to the booth, could he not interrogate the driver, even if he stopped or pulled up 200 or 300 yards away ? ous candidates could also keep a check and say how many times motor cars, carriages, dog-carts, or cabs had been driven to the polling-booths loaded with passengers. If there is no other way out of the difficulty, why not provide that every candidate shall be allowed to use a certain number of vehicles the cost of which shall be stated in a sworn declaration, and that any voter travelling to the polling-booth in any other conveyance should be liable to a fine. I have I know that postal voting enunciated my objections to the present system. One of these is the dominance which the press secures under it. No doubt the present Government will have the support of a majority of the newspapers; but the Labour party are so accustomed to fight the press that they would be inclined to think that they were in the wrong if I have seen elections in every they found it fighting strongly for them. I have no other arguments to address to the Minister to induce him to adopt my view with regard to the other matter to which I have referred; but if he did, then, even if fate decreed that he should not be returned to this House again, or that he should ibe returned but not as a Minister, his name would go down to posterity as that of a man who had put down the infamy resulting from the friends of candidates, figuratively speaking, walking through the Electoral Act.

The voting being equal, there was not a majority of the Committee in favour of the proposal for a fixed term. It is unnecessary to examine the combination which brought about the equality of voting. On one side of the House there may have been considerable differences of opinion; whereas, on this, side the votes of one-half the members of the Committee were in favour of the agreement as it stands. Under those circumstances, it appeared to the Government that the only course to be pursued was to proceed with the measure, and to deal with any specific amendments which may hereafter be moved when they are before us. move That the following words be added to proposed new section 94B :"" Until such time as such payments amount to the annual sum of Seven million five hundred thousand pounds, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides."" This is the amendment which I indicated ir. the course of tbe debate last week, and I regret that it has become necessary for me to submit it. I do so with the greatest feeling of responsibility. The question has now narrowed itself down to very small limits. It is not the agreement which I and other honourable members who differ in some respects from the Government-on this matter are questioning. We say-and I think I speak for all of those who have pronounced their opinion on the matter who have been acting with me in this matter. members who voted in the negative did not agree with the honourable member's proposition. the honourable member. fnr those who are in agreement with me, and who have publicly announced their views. My task to-night is to put into concrete form the ideas which we entertain regarding an amendment of the agreement which shall not be a refusal to entertain it or to adopt its. essential principles. We accept-o r I dc, at any rate; I shall speak in the first person to avoid interruptions-tli e main principles of the agreement. It is not my intention to alter its financial terms as submitted to Parliament by the Prime Minister. We accept it. VVe know absolutely well that any agreement must be open to criticism as to its various parts. In some respects this is not an agreement which I should have cared to propose. But I set aside all questions as to whether the agreement in itself is right or wrong. I am prepared to accept it, save on one point. An attempt is now being made to place the Parliament of Australia in the position of recommending, to the people a certain alteration of the Constitution. I emphasize that, because we have been told by various speakers and in the press that we are keeping certain proposals from the people. I say that our duty, imposed upon us by the Constitution, is to take the responsibility of recommending to the people a course which we think it desirable that they should adopt. We, therefore, have a solemn responsibility not to ask the people to vote for a proposal which will take away from future Parliaments the right which we enjoy to-day as the Parliament of the Commonwealth. It is not merely a question of finance. As honourable members are aware, the proposals which I have made have been in the direction of recognising to the fullest extent that it. is the duty of the Commonwealth to provide for the wants of the Slates. I have gone beyond most honourable members in my desire to see that the obligations which the States have incurred shall be covered by the Commonwealth as far as that is reasonable and proper. I submitted a scheme which would have involved a much longer period than that embodied in the proposal now submitted by me. My individual opinion has always been that if this Parliament fulfils one of the main objects for which it was created, and for which Federation was brought about, theassumption of the State debts, it will, immediately it assumes responsibility for any portion of the debts, practically assume anobligation for the whole. I was prepared, therefore, in a spirit of liberality, to secure to the States a payment up to the extent of their full obligation for interest on. loans which they have incurred up to the present time.

245,Mr Harper,"I am only speakingmaking is one which does not go so far. The reason why I move it is this: It will be admitted that the Braddon section, as part of the Constitution under which we are working, makes a certain provision for the wants of the States. It provides that after a certain time-namely, ten years -Parliament shall provide. WhatI fail to see is, why honourable members should be asked to make an arrangement, or to advise the people to make an arrangement by which the power conferred upon us by the Constitution shall be taken away from this Parliament. I know that it may be answered, as it has been answered by the Prime Minister, that the -power which places this provision in the Constitution can also be invoked to remove it. But I feel that the provision deliberately placed in the Constitution by the framers of it confers upon this Parliament a power which we should not lightly be called upon to forego. It has been said that what the people do-and do, be it remembered, on the recommendation of both Houses of this Parliament-can be undone in the simplest possible fashion when public sentiment so permits. 'But that argument, while plausible and on the face of it apparently unanswerable, is absolutely fallacious. Let us assume that this provision is put into the Constitution as proposed by the agreement. Suppose that it becomes desirable, in the interest of the people of this Commonwealth, that at some time it shall either be removed, or that the proposal now before us shall be modified or altogether abolished. We should then be faced with this position, which I wish to emphasize. We should have first to secure that this House and another place should, by majorities of the whole number of members, recommend an alteration of the Constitution to the people. That is the first step. We will suppose that the House of Representatives of the day agrees to an amendment considered to be suitable to the circumstances and the occasion. But it may be that a majority of the Senate, where all the States, whatever may be the population, have the same representation, will oppose an alteration of the arrangement now proposed, and which I am assuming will be in existence. We have then the possible position that this House may, in the interests of the whole people, desire to make an alteration, but the smaller or larger States may be represented in another place by men who are Mr Harper. pledged to refuse to make any change. I know that the Prime Minister will be ready to say that there is a way out of that position, because it is provided in the Constitution that a question which may be submitted to and carried by one House and refused by the other, may ultimately be sent to the people. I admit that, and I shall, therefore, pass away from that phase. l t is now proposed to go to the people with a proposition which is not of an abstract nature, which is not like the question of Federation which the Prime Minister adduced the other day as showing the growth of public opinion in favour of a certain movement. The conditions then were not like those which would exist in circumstances such as 1 am supposing. There will be a direct pecuniary interest created which may differ in the several States, and in order to alter the Constitution we have to obtain a majority of the people voting in all the States, and a majority of the States. That is practically a condition of things which would place this Parliament which, according to the Constitution, was evidently intended to have the control and direction of the Commonwealth revenues, in the position that it could not even consider the question of making an alteration which, in its opinion, and in the opinion of a great majority of the people, might be desirable because it could not secure a majority of votes in four States. Several honourable members have given a concrete example of what might happen. The reference was to the last referendum when it was shown that the wish of 973,113 electors as expressed by their votes, could be defeated by 86,055 electors, representing a bare majority of the votes cast in the three smaller States. -In such a condition it is perfectly evident that if it suited the interests of the smaller States to hold on to the arrangement as it was they might defy the opinion of the great mass of the people of Australia. I ask myself and also the Prime Minister why this question has been raised. I am quite prepared to admit that the Premiers, in the interests of tlueir Staites, had a right to placa 1 their views before the Government and the Parliament of the Commonwealth when the time had arrived for us to deal with questions arising out of the expiry of the Brad-. don section.

In this statement, Mr. ask what reason can be given for making Kidston, who, I am given to understand, this larger demand upon the Commonis the strongest advocate of the agreewealth. The Prime Minister has been carement, as it is in the interest, not of f u l to tell us that he submitted the requirethe Federal Parliament, but of the ments of the Commonwealth and the States submitted their requirements.

If carried with that addendum, it will give them all that fhey are entitled to ask for, but nothing more. I have no feeling against the Premiers. To most of them. I am personally unknown.

270,Mr Harper,"We are likely to meet the views, not only of fully half of those sitting on the Ministerial side of. the chamber, but, apparently, of a considerable majority of the whole Committee. I would, remind the Minister of Defence, -who asks, why I refer to the Premiers, and says, "" These are our proposals,"" that the Premiers, are one. party to the agreement, while this Parliament is the. other. The Prime Minister made a mistake in going beyond the terms of the Fusion agreement which created his party. He has admitted that he did go beyond the terms of that agreement, that he was doing it. He made a mistake in doing more than submit the agreement. Seeing that a majority are prepared, to agree to its essential provisions, he should have given to honourable members the f u l l liberty to vote as they thought right in regard to it, according to the terms of the Fusion arrangement. an adjournment so that the Government might meet the Premiers.. irrelevant statement. I was in favour of the Government meeting the Premiers, and have never expressed the contrary view.

We, on the Ministerial side, had the right to expect that any arrangement entered into would not be antagonistic to that which brought us together. ment. member's opinion; it is not mine. there has been an alteration. question of money. As I have indicated, I do not think that the terms are important. My view hasalways been that, so long, as we keep within the amounts to in respect to the interest on their -debts, we shall be safe, because we are faced with the obligation of taking over their debts. It was stated the other day, in the newspapers, that the Premier and Parliament of New South Wales do not view the transfer with favour; but, if I. live a few years longer, I sliall see the day when the States, or some of them, will be only too glad to come under the wing of the Commonwealth with respect to their debts. That is why I am willing to allow my proposals, for the taking over of the debts of the States to remain out of the agreement. When I look at the list of liabilities falling due, and consider the difficulties, which will be experienced in converting this enormous amount of indebtedness, I am sure that the day. will come when the people of Australia, and even the State Premiers themselves, will beglad to place themsetve^ under the wing of the Commonwealth Parliament and have its powerful, asand the Premiers knew sistance in the conversion of the State debts and the renewal of their loans at a reasonable rate of interest. But the terms of my amendment will not go as far as that. I have fixed the amount to be paid to the States at Â£7,5.00,000, which is practically equivalent to fhe annual interest due on the debts existing at the time of Federation. It would work out in about fifteen years according to the present ratio of the increase of population. I think that seeing that the Braddon section was enacted for ten years, and has answered its purpose, if we give the States a contribution of 25s. per capita for another fifteen years, the provision to be terminable in the same way as the Braddon section, so that thereafter it shall continue in force until this Parliament otherwise provides, we shall make a sensible and reasonable arrangement which I believe the people, if they understood it, would approve. I may say that in addition to those who recorded their votes for the amendment on' which a division was taken the other night, there are at least half-a-dozen honourable members on this side, some of whom have spoken to that effect, and some of whom have privately intimated their entire approval of a limitation of the operation of this agreement. ber's' arguments have convinced them that a limitation is not necessary. which the States are committed so. has not yet spoken, and I do not know what his opinions are. directly if I get a chancefor the honourable member to give the names of the honourable members to whom he refers.",43,Constitution Alteration

It was not my intention to do so, but my honourable friends are so restive, so .impatient, and so irritable that they have made me prolong my remarks. If I stay here until midnight "" I shall say what I stood up to say. joying ourselves. for the night. I repeat that if the amendment is carried it is my humble opinion that the State Premiers will accept it. to think that the honourable member does not mean it ; he has said it so many tivnes. honourable members to allow the honourable member for Mernda to proceed. I have noted that certain honourable members are interjecting continually, and if I find them interjecting again I fchall name thert, the State Premiers will be prepared to accept the proposed amendment of the agreement. That is my conviction. I say so because I recognise that they are hardheaded business men, and know what is best for their States. We should, by carrying the amendment, relieve the Government from a very difficult position. Suppose, for the sake of argument, the State Premiers resent any amendment of the agreement and insist that in the event of its being amended ihe Government shall withdraw the B ill, and suppose the Government take the Bill to the country, which is the other contingency to be considered, I say that when it is put before the country I shall ask the Prime Minister how he can advocate an agreement against the views of many of his supporters, and'oppose a proposal which gives the State Premiers all they want, and carries OVA Viis bargain with them, and which refuses OL \y to give away the rights of the Common health Parliament. I can face that contingency with perfect equanimity. I feel that I shall have no difficulty when the concrete fact becomes known to the electors. It is not known at present, because, owing to the way in which the matter has been represented by the press, it has been impossible up to the the position really is. In my constituency at any rate, I shall let my people know that the real question at issue is not the terms of this agreement is not known in his constituency. ber for Fremantle may have no constituency at all after the next election, and that will be worse for him than it would be for me were it true that some of my constituents do not know who I am. I ' feel thoroughly enthat when the concrete fact becomes known to the public, that what has divided us is not a refusal to carry out the agreement or a desire to take from the State Premiers anything for which they have asked, but a refusal to part with the We aie beginning birth right of the Commonwealth, a totally different aspect will be put upon the matter. I trust that the Committee will acI . a g a in appeal to cept the amendment, and that some honourable members who have not yet given us their support will see their way to do so. If they do, I believe the matter will be settled. There were other points on which I intended to touch, but I think I have said I say that I believe enough, and owing to the interruptions I have said more than I intended to say. There is one other point, however, with which I might deal, and it is thus: This Parliament is intended by the Constitution to be the Parliament of Australia, and we should look to its privileges and its rights. It has been the object of vituperation in many quarters since the establishment of Federation, and has been referred to in a most improper and antagonistic manner. This. Parliament has, I believe, done its duty well. It has made mistakes-it has done things of which I disapproved, and against which I voted-but , on the whole, it has done its duty admirably. It has taken over a great many important functions which were formerly administered by the States; and I look forward to the time when all parochial and sectional feeling, which is incidental to every Commonwealth and Federation, shall' have died away-when , in fifteen or twenty years, the pride in the Commonwealth Parliament, and the desire to uphold the Federation, shall, as in other countries, have become the prevailing sentiment amongst the",45,Constitution Alteration

A re-reading of those various contributions, including my own, has shown that this was, perhaps, a necessary stage of the debate But most of us -will admit that no sufficiently distinct leading was obtained from them, to render it necessary to pursue those lines of argument further. We come, therefore, as the honourable member for Mernda very properly and aptly said, to a .single issue. In what manner shall this agreement lae placed in .security ? Whetherby fixing a term .of years, subject to revision afterwards, as tlie Braddon section is now to be revised ? Or whether, instead of endeavouring to fix a definite term, we shall trust to the power of the people of Australia to amend the Constitution as they may think necessary in the light of ihe times to come? That is the whole point at issue between us. Do we suggest that this amendment shall be embodied in *he Constitution for a definite term of years, after which it shall be remitted directly to -Parliament, and through Parliament to the people? Or shall we pass it -for .an indefinite term, so as to permit either earlier or later than the fixed term, as circumstances may dictate, the power of amendment to be in the hands of the electors as well as of Parliament? That is frankly and clearly the issue which the honourable member put; and we may argue it with frankness and clearness, for it is the point at issue between us. If , therefore, I commence by taking exception to one phrase of the honourable member, it is not because he has coined it, but because it has, perhaps, been too lightly adopted. He spoke of the proposal to embody the agreement in the Constitution, subject, therefore, only to the amendment of the Constitution in the wav provided, as "" taking away"" power from this Parliament. that this is an incorrect, or, at all events, may be, a dangerously misleading statement. When it is proposed to place ihis or any other proposition in the Constitution, that Constitution still remains unthis or any other question.

If this Parliament possessed the power now, independently of the electors-whic h no honourable member, I -venture to think, will assert-and then transferred it wholly to the electors, they might speak of its being ""taken away.'' But since it needs the consent of both this Parliament and the electors to put it into the Constitution, or, when it is inserted, to take -it out again, it is not fair to speak of taking away the power of the Parliament, .except so far as the electors are given a direct voice.

In future, some phrase other I submit than that of ""taking away"" the power from Parliament ought to be used, since it is not strictly correct, and conveys misleading impressions.

Consequently, whether or not this Bill be carried by a sufficient majority to allow the electors to speak specifically upon this question, they will speak at the next general election through their representatives. that. am perfectly certain that if this language were employed on the public platform as it has already been employed in the press, it might produce grave misapprehensions on the part of many of those to whom we are about to appeal. Honourable members, however they may carp at any particular phrase I may use, now realize that in any case it is unfair-and I take now a further step-to speak of this Parliament as if it were not an appointed and delegated body, subject at every stage to its constituents. is raised against placing before the people a proposal that they may feel pleased to place in the Constitution, my honourable friends opposite consistently and persistently choose to forget that it cannot be placed there at all except by a majority of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. a minority. stage; one stage at a time. It cannot be kept unless first placed there by a majority of our people. My honourable friends consequently exhibit their apprehension that if this question be put separately to the people, a majority of the whole of the electors of Australia will be found in its favour. fident that the electors agreed with them as they would have us believe, would they fear to send this agreement to the people? On the contrary, they would cry, "" Why delay in the Legislature? Why not appeal to the electors? If the majority accept it, we are prepared to accept it . "" We do not hear any such cry. We observe the liveliest alarm on their part that this agreement may be allowed to go to the electors. must either take the whole or none. able and learned friend implies that, because the electors must take either the whole or nothing, we are proposing to put the question at a disadvantage. We are content to accept that disadvantage; it is ours, not his. That interjection illustrates the extraordinary anxiety of my honourable friends not to let this agreement get to the people of Australia. It is said that we shall recommend them to adopt it. I accept that statement. Those who vote for the Bill certainly will recommend it, and they must represent a majority here to get the question submitted. That majority will be on this side of the House. Honourable members opposite speak as if they, too, were recommending it to the people, and as if they feared that this effort would be the last. They have still their inexhaustible resources. They have their platforms, their leagues, their influence, and their organized strength to use against the Bill on the appeal to the people. How, then, can we interpret the extraordinary anxiety shown by the Opposition not to permit When an outcry this question to be submitted to the people unless we attribute it to an absolute want of confidence in their own cause, and in their, own power to convince the electors that this agreement is undesirable? This proposed amendment must be approved by a majority of the people, independently of the States, as well as a majority in the States, to secure its adoption. Is it not exactly the same process that will be required to take this agreement out of the Constitution? Precisely the same. require a majority to put it in, but a minority will be able to keep it there. point. In the course of this argument, my honourable friends opposite have but one point. They run away from the fact that to secure the insertion of this agreement in If they were as conthp Constitution, we must have a majority of the whole of the people as well as a majority in the States. Of that we hear nothing from them. They add that the people who put this into the Constitution would, when it was proposed to take it out again, have also to capture a majority of the States. That is perfectly true. We can form individual opinions as to what provocations would be necessary to win the support of four out of all six States. On elaborate the argument of last week. First of all, this is a financial question, and financial questions press most directly upon the electors as taxpayers.

At present, and in my previous remarks, it has been sufficient for me to defend the policy which we have proposed. If I can prove that it involves no injustice and presents no insuperable obstacles to revision, should the terms become sufficiently irksome, I have proved my case. It is not necessary for me to attack the project of the honourable member for Mernda, or that of the honourable member for Parkes. Th* argument between us is whether it would or would not be prudent to specify the period for which this agreement is to be made, and thus specify a time when it must come up for revision; or whether it is not the safer course to allow the people themselves to say when the time shall have arrived to amend the agreement. These are arguable alternatives. No one pretends that this agreement is the result of a Divine revelation, neither to be criticised nor to be amended, even when amendment commends itself to our judgment. We are content' to say that the agreement, as it stands, appears to us to be a fair one, and that this power of amendment in the Constitution appears to us to be a sufficient safeguard against the time when some amendment will become necessary. That is our case for the clause' as it stands, and that, therefore, is the whple case which it is necessary for me to submit. The honourable member for Mernda was perfectly right when he contended that under his proposal he had studied the interests of the States. He also made it clear-as his amendment shows-that he proposes to place the provision in the Constitution. He relies, I apprehend, upon the votes of honourable members opposite, who strenuously resist the proposition to put any amendment of any kind in the Constitution. now wants to "" divide and conquer."" We can see what he is after on the benches opposite amendment of the Constitution. ment is to be carried it must be by the votes of those who take exception to the very means by which surety is sought to be given. The one thing that commends it to honourable members on this side'of the House, is the one thing objected to by honourable members opposite, though all vote for it. voting for the agreement is against the convictions of some honourable members opposite. hear these allusions to "" convictions!"" The honourable member up till lately had his own convictions.

At our party meetings there has been no vote. At our party meetings no resolution has been proposed, or carried by a majority to which the minority must conform.

It is because the members of our party are unable to see eye to eye with us on this matter-takin g a different view, and acting upon it-as they are entitled to do-as to the duration of the agreement, that the present situation has been caused.

I have, however, dwelt upon that point sufficiently. The honourable member for Mernda alluded now and again in his speech to the position occupied by the State Premiers. It is not my province to defend them. They are answerable for their own actions. They are quite capable of speaking for themselves. They have concurred with the agreement. Mr W. H. IRVINE -The honourable gentleman wants to make some of us answerable for them. proach that very problem. As for Conferences of State Premiers, I think that the honourable member for Mernda, after commencing in a critical fashion, concluded by admitting that these were useful and practical, and that the common interests of the States were well considered in them. grettable in every respect if the members of the Federal Parliament were found engaged during a State election in taking a personally active part in the conflict. which we should apply in our own case applies in my opinion in their case. I should regret to see State Ministers or members of State Legislatures taking a personally active part beyond the recording of their votes in their own district, or perhaps acting in their own immediate district, but certainly not taking a strong part, in any Federal election. is aware that they have already publicly threatened so to do. always do. opposite are so sensitive that in this case I shall not draw a parallel. It is highly desirable that members and Ministers, Commonwealth and State, should refrain from personal interference with any elections except their own. But seeing that both represent the same body of electors and are concerned in the particular question now before us, it is perfectly impossible to prevent either from making the fullest statement.of their case and claims to the public. By publications, by statements made-no t at election time, or not on election platforms-the y are, I take it, as much at liberty as we are to discuss all proposals vitally affecting them. citizens of which we cannot deprive them. We cannot forget that ours is a Federal Constitution, of which State Administrations are as much an integral part, looking at the whole organization, as is this National Parliament. We have a greater scope of legislative area and the vital question of defence. I do not attempt to compare our two separate Governments. We are so interlaced that it is perfectly impossible to deal with any great Federal issue without cutting across State issues, or to affect the States without affecting Federal interests. Consequently we cannot, or ought not,' to be hypersensitive if in matters affecting the States they take all the means they have of putting their case before the public. It rests with us to correct them when we consider ourselves challenged, in order that the public may form a sober verdict. to oppose every man who may vote against this agreement.

This Parliament consists of two Houses-thi s House, elected by the people according to their numbers, and the other Chamber with an equal representation of States at present differing enormously in population. No measure accepted by this House, whicli represents a majority of the Commonwealth as a whole, can find its place on the statute book until it has run the gauntlet of another Chamber, whose members are chosen by States without regard to population. The Senate represents practically the vote of a majority of the States; it sanctions the proposals adopted here by representatives of the majority of the people. to say that the question was settled by Foxton. two shapes which the referendum taÂ£es when sanction is sought for an amendment of the Constitution is plain. The people first vote for the whole continent, as in this House, and then the peoples of the States are counted by majorities, as they are, roughly speaking, in the other Chamber. to be run to get it back again. the Constitution runs two gauntlets instead of one.

Many other considerations, need to be taken into account before you can place in the scales, with any attempt at equity, the proposal of a fixed term, for a revision of this agreement, and the proposal to leave it to the double referendum. We consider that the opportunities for amending the Constitution,in relation to matters so immediately urgent and pressing as financial necessities often are, will suffice. We have confidence that they will not be found burdensome by the people, or that when they are found burdensome this agreement can, without undue effort or unreasonable delay, be there and then amended. I , like the honourable member for Mernda, attach the greatest importance to the growing sense of unity among the people of Australia-and look forward to that increase of population which shall bring State and State more closely in touch at their borders-to a steady development of Inter-State commerce which shall make our commercial interests more indissoluble, to fuller opportunities of intercommunication, to a better distribution of knowledge relating to Commonwealth obligationsI rely upon all these forces to multiply the means which the electors now possess of forming a judgment upon large matters of policy. At present, one State is separated from the other by several days' journey, and one or two States are remote from the centre of government. In this Parliament, Federal affairs have been conducted under greater disabilities in the past than they are in the present.

I find thht in 1906 there was a Conference held in Melbourne, at which the ston, was present, and that that gentleman was prepared to accept a proposal made by the present Commonwealth Treasurer, to give the Federal Parliament full control He is undoubtedly a clever up to 1920. In that year, however, Mr Kidston desired that there should be an amendment of the Constitution, and the present Commonwealth Treasurer denounced the idea most emphatically. The Treasurer declared that he would not ask the Commonwealth Parliament to give up their The honourable member when he powers; and "" Mr Ashton and Mr McGowen, representing New South Wales, who is the Leader of the Labour party in the State, saidWe have to stand in front of the Federal Parliament and say, "" For ten years of Federation you have met us generously with a true Had the Customs and Federal spirit, having regard to the State interest and to the national interest, but we do not know how you will meet our successors fourteen years hence."" We do not know how the Federal Parliament will act. I am perfectly willing to incorporate that, but I think it my duty to submit to my friends whether it 000 is not possible that we are asking too much, and are not likely to obtain what many of us think it is possible to obtain. He referred to the proposal to have a releaving Â£5,000,000 ferendum in 1920 on the question whether This gives the arrangement should continue. The present Commonwealth Treasurer, at the Bris* bane Premiers' Conference, again emphasized the declaration that the National Parliament would not give up its rights. He urged that it was our duty, in the inand each terests of the people, to adhere to the Constitution, and asked what would be thought of a Commonwealth Government and Parliament who, by giving up the powers vested in them, declared that they were not fit to be trusted with them ? Such a step, the Treasurer declared, would strike at the veryfoundation of the Constitution, which ought to remain intact until 1920, when, perhaps, we would be in a position to see how it If the worked.

May I , at this stage, quote from the remarks made by Sir Joseph Carruthers, at the Brisbane Conference, showing that he was totally opposed to the powers of the Federal Parliament being taken away. The following is an extract from the report of his speech at the Conference: It is a very serious thing to ask the Commonwealth of Australia to commit itself irrevocably to a scheme of finance between the Commonwealth ancl the States, the results of which no man here can talk of. Just look at our revenue for the last year. It is beyond the expectations of any man in Australia. The PRESIDENT It is not irrevocable at all. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS -Not irrevocable; but we know how very few alterations have been made in the equally irrevocable Constitution of the United States. We know how difficult it will be if anything is put in the Constitution to get it amended under the complicated process provided by the Constitution The PRESIDENT -It would be very easy to amend it if it were causing financial dislocation. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS -Tak e this contingency-that it is found that this arrangement works harshly and unjustly to two States, but works favourably to four States. You have then to ask for an amendment of the Constitution against the interests of the people of four States, and against the interests of the Treasurers of four States, and you have to get that amendment carried by a majority of the people in a majority of the States. You can't do it. It will be far easier in dealing with a question of this character to get an amendment made by the Federal Parliament than it will be to get an amendment made by .the Federal people, because if you have got four States who are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, and have only to appeal to their sense and honour to give up something for the benefit of others, it will be very difficult to carry the amendment, especially when some people may think that they would have to give up a certain amount of revenue over and above what they are justly entitled to surrender. That was the opinion expressed by theexmember for Parkes for voting against the Premier of New South Wales. what would be the difficulty experienced in duty to my constituency, where thousands securing the removal of thisagreement from of persons, are employed in various industhe Constitution if it were embodied in it, tries.

In Victoria every seat was contested, and the Much as I revotes secured by the successful candidates totalled 189,342, or a total of 405,848 for the two States. In Queensland 71,639 votes were cast; in Western Australin 32,629; Pouth Australia 40,080; and TasmaniaI n my opinion, it 26,448, making a total of 170,796 votes in the four States. It will thus be seen that in New South Wales and Victoria 225,053 votes were enst in excess of the total polled in the other four States, yet on that basis it would be impossible to secure an amendment of the Constitution, although the vast majority of the people of New South Wales and Victoria favoured it. We offer to give to the States a per capita allowance of 25s. per annum; and that, according to the Treasurer, would make the States secure. At the Brisbane Conference the right honourable gentleman said that it was the duty of the Commonwealth to make itself secure first of all, and a proposal by Mr Evans, then Premier of Tasmania, that the Conference should agree to a per capita payment of 34s. per annum was lost. -The representatives of Tasmania voted for it, whilst the representatives of New.South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland opposed it. The representatives of Western Australia did not vote. My opposition to this proposal is based largely on the opinion which I hold that it would prevent a high Protectionist Tariff being brought into existence. That was the opinion expressed by ^Ir. J. M . Davies, a representative of Victoria, at a Conference held in Melbourne in October, 1906. Speaking as a representative of this State, he saidAs we go on manufacturing machinery and a whole lot of other articles, if those duties that are put on for protective purposes have the effect which they are intended to have of promoting manufacture in the States, the necessary consequence will be a great diminution in the total of our revenue. member for Parkes will vote against the agreement ? the reasons that may actuate the honourable To show agreement.

A few moments ago the honourable member alluded in no unmeasured terms to references made by the Prime Minister to the solidarity of his party. I should like to urge upon the consideration of the gentlemen whom he leads-the Labour party-the desirableness of taking the public completely into their confidence. How is it that that party has voted absolutely solidly upon a number of burning questions that certainly did not form part of their party's programme, as submitted to the public?

How is it that the Labour party, without any mandate from the constituencies, voted absolutely solidly against the Naval Agreement? I would go a step further, and ask the Leader of the Opposition why it was that his party, with only one exception-that of an honourable member who got up and said that he would not be mean enough to be bound to vote in an) such direction-vote d solidly against the Queen Victoria memorial ? These are a few of the things-al l turning in one direction, it will be noticed; all questions affecting Imperial sentiment and consolidationupon which the Opposition voted solidly. Consequently, I think I am justified in saying that my honourable friendsopposite are not altogether sincere when they state they are not bound by the Caucus except on questions affecting the platform of their party. I hope that we shall have no more humbug and nonsense from the Opposition in reference to this matter.
