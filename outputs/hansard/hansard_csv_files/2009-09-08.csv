Employment Services (Question No. 807) Dr Southcott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the progress briefings by the department to the former Minister for Employment Participation on the tender for the Employment Services Contract 2009-12 and employment services providers who were offered business on 2 April 2009 but were not a preferred tenderer on 16 March 2009: how many (a) sites, (b) Employment Service Areas, and (c) Employment Service Providers were added to the progress briefings of 9, 13, 20, 22 and 27 March 2009, and to the final decisions of 31 March 2009. Ms Gillard-The Minister for Employment Participation has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Consistent with normal processes of government it would be usual practice to provide regular update briefings to the Minister. On3 March 2009, the department made its decision regarding preferred tenderers. The department’s decisions of 3 March 2009 were advised to preferred tenderers on 16 March 2009. There were no changes between the department’s decision on 3 March 2009 and the advice to preferred tenderers on 16 March 2009. No decisions on additions were made until the department made its final decision on 31March 2009. The department informed the [previous] Minister’s office of its final decisions in relation to the tender on 31 March 2009. The [previous] Minister received a verbal briefing for information of the department’s final decision on the morning of 1 April 2009 just prior to his announcing the high level results that afternoon. A written brief for noting dated 1 April 2009 was provided. The department’s final decision saw four organisations which were not initially identified as preferred tenderers that subsequently received an offer of Job Services Australia business and nine organisations which received business in additional Employment Service Areas. The Employment Service Areas where these changes were made were: Canterbury Bankstown NSW, Fairfield NSW, Inner Sydney NSW, Liverpool NSW, Macarthur NSW, Nepean NSW, Wollongong NSW, South Brisbane Qld, Northern Adelaide SA, Western Adelaide SA, Peninsula Vic, Westgate Vic. Central and West Metro WA, North Metro WA and East Metro WA. Detailed consideration, assessment and quality assurance, all overseen by the probity adviser preceded the department’s final decisions being made. Employment Services (Question No. 808) Dr Southcott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the tender for the Employment Services Contract 2009-12 and employment services providers who were offered business on 2 April 2009 but were not a preferred tenderer on 16 March 2009: (a) in which Employment Services Areas did this occur, (b) in how many Employment Service Areas did this occur, (c) in each Employment Service Area; (i) what was the reason for adding an additional provider or providers and (ii) how were the providers who were offered business chosen; and (e) what was the business share of these providers in each Employment Services Area in which this occurred. Ms Gillard-The Minister for Employment Participation has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Final decisions had not been made at the time of the advice to preferred tenderers on 16 March 2009. Consistent with paragraph 4.14 of the Request for Tender (RFT), the period between 16 March 2009, when preferred tenderers received the without prejudice advice of their status, and 31 March 2009, when final decisions were made, gave preferred tenderers the opportunity to bring any issues, or other relevant matters, to the Department’s attention. This was particularly critical where some organisations could have proposed to use the same subcontractor. Also, around that time the release of the new unemployment figures provided a more detailed picture of the extent of the impact of the Global Recession. A final review was undertaken to ensure that the level of service available in those locations was consistent with the demand for the service, and that job seekers, would be well serviced into the future by providing new services that would deliver better, more tailored assistance to job seekers, particular disadvantaged Australians, and place greater emphasis on assisting employers in addressing skills shortages. The department’s final decision, made in accordance with the rules of the RFT, saw four organisations which were not initially identified as preferred tenderers that subsequently received an offer of Job Services Australia business and nine organisations which received business in additional Employment Service Areas. The Employment Service Areas where these changes were made were: Canterbury Bankstown NSW, Fairfield NSW, Inner Sydney NSW, Liverpool NSW, Macarthur NSW, Nepean NSW, Wollongong NSW, South Brisbane Qld, Northern Adelaide SA, Western Adelaide SA, Westgate Vic. Central and West Metro WA, North Metro WA and East Metro WA. Detailed consideration, assessment and quality assurance, all overseen by the probity adviser preceded the department’s final decisions being made. Providing a breakdown of business shares would disclose information relating to the business affairs of identifiable organisations and it is not appropriate to disclose this information without consulting them in case its disclosure could substantially and adversely affect the business, commercial or financial affairs of these organisations. North Korea (Question No. 855) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Has the Government contacted other countries, urging sanctions against individual members of North Korea’s leadership; if so, (a) which countries, (b) on what date/s, (c) at what level, and (d) what specific sanction/s were discussed on each occasion. (2) What specific action has Australia taken to increase pressure on North Korea’s leadership to adhere to United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding nuclear weapons and missiles. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Following North Korea’s nuclear test on 25 May 2009, the Government has had discussions with a range of countries at ministerial and officials level urging the imposition of further sanctions against North Korea. Following the adoption on 12 June 2009 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, the Government has made representations to a large number of other countries urging full enforcement of the sanctions mandated by that resolution and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 of 2006. Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, I do not intend to elaborate further as it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments. (2) As I announced in a media release issued on 12 July 2009, the Government has amended relevant regulations to implement in Australian law the sanctions mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, with effect from 11 July 2009. Australia has also implemented the nonmandatory provisions of Resolution 1874 calling on countries to restrict financial assistance to North Korea. The necessary frameworks are also being put in place to enable relevant Australian Government agencies to give effect, as required, to the other non-mandatory measures called for under Resolution 1874. These new measures are in addition to Australia’s full implementation of the sanctions mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 of 2006, and the autonomous measures Australia has had in place against North Korea since 2006, including a general ban on visas for North Korean citizens, a ban on entry into Australian ports by North Korean-flagged vessels and financial restrictions against 12 North Korean entities and one individual. Australian bilateral development assistance to North Korea has been suspended since 2002. In addition to Australia’s own implementation of sanctions against North Korea and our urging of other countries to fully enforce United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea, the Government has made direct representations to the Government of North Korea urging it to comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Most recently, on 9 June 2009 during a visit to North Korea, Australia’s non-resident Ambassador to North Korea, H.E. Mr Sam Gerovich, made direct representations to H.E. Mr Kim Yong-nam, Head of State and President of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly, H.E. Mr Pak Ui-chun, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and senior North Korean officials, urging North Korea to comply fully with UN Resolutions.

A decision is expected by late October 2009. In the interim, part of the aircraft painting facility is being used in support of overseas operations pending the refurbishment of permanent facilities elsewhere within RAAF Base Richmond. (b) It is acknowledged that there is pressure for suitable maintenance accommodation at RAAF Base Richmond. As such Defence is considering the adaptive re-use of the aircraft painting facility including the option to utilise it as a maintenance hanger.",116,Questions In Writing

This will include, where appropriate, pay in lieu of long service leave and recreation leave calculated to the day the member dies. Separate to salary and allowances, superannuation benefits will also be paid and dependants of a deceased member are entitled to compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. Family Tax Benefit (Question No. 881) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 11 August 2009: In respect of the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) now being claimed through Centrelink, rather than through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO): (1) How many people who have previously claimed the FTB through the ATO will claim it through Centrelink in the 2009-10 financial year. (2) Will these people have to complete a Centrelink form in addition to their tax return in order to obtain the FTB. (3) What average length of time will it take to receive the FTB payment after submitting a claim, and how does this compare with the length of time taken to obtain the FTB payment when it was claimed through the ATO. (1) It is estimated that 160,000 customers who previously claimed FTB as a lump sum payment through the ATO will claim it through Centrelink or Medicare Australia in the 2009-10 financial year. (2) All customers who claim FTB as a lump sum payment through Centrelink or Medicare Australia are required to complete a claim form. Customers who previously claimed FTB as a lump sum payment through the ATO were also required to complete a FTB claim form, which was separate from their tax return. (3) FTB claims are generally processed within 21 days from the date they are received by Centrelink, provided all required information is available to assess the claim. Additionally, customers can now claim FTB online. Online claims are generally processed within 14 days from the date they are received, provided all required information is available to assess the claim. From1 July 2009 customers are no longer able to claim FTB through the ATO. Prior to 1 July 2009, FTB claims lodged with the ATO were subject to timeframes as outlined in the Taxpayer’s Charter.",120,Questions In Writing
