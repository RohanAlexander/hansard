Thursday, 16 October, 194.7. Mr SraftKKR. (Ham. £. & Besevear) took the chair' at 2.30 p.m., and Tesd prayers. 1 I present a petition from certain electors of the division of Maranoa, praying that no further steps be taken to nationalize the banking system in Australia until a referendum of the people has first been held. In movingThat the petition be received, I wish to say that, although this petition is respectfully worded and is otherwise in conformity with the rules and orders of the, House, I have received other petitions and letters containing many thousands of names which arc not so worded as to entitle me to present them to the House. In due course, I shall present them . to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). Question resolved in the affirmative. Petition received and read. Other petitions in relation to hanking in Australia were presented as follows electors of the division of Moreton. electors of Western Australia. certain resident of Ech-unga, South Australia. electors of the divisions of Eichmond and New England. electors of the division of New England. electors of the division of Calare. Petitions received and read. Minister's attention heen drawn to a special article published in the Sydney Morning Herald to-day, under the name of C. Griffiths, a member of the Australian Labour party executive, who is obviously an official spokesman for the Labour party, in which these statements are madeLabour does not consider the election of a few Communists to. union leadership as a matter' of extraordinary importance or even one calling for investigation. Labour is not nervous about the Communist party's activities or future . . . and in which the writer says, in . effect, Communist and Australian Labour party policies? Do these statements represent the official view of the Australian Labour party towards Communists, and does the Prime Minister subscribe to the view that the policies of both Labour and Communist parties are similar? read to-day's newspapers and therefore I hare not seen the article to which the honourable member has referred. Secondly, I am in no way responsible for any statements made by Mr Griffiths. Thirdly, Mr Griffiths does not speak for the Australian Labour party either in the Commonwealth or State spheres. The president of the Australian Labour party speaks on behalf of that organization. Fourthly, as to whether the policies of the Communist and Labour parties are similar, the answer is "" No. Commerce and Agriculture know whether there .is any foundation in fact for the allegations in this morning's press that a black market exists for second-hand cornsacks? Has any variation been made in the past policy of the Australian Wheat Board, which has refused to accept second hand sacks or is any variation intended ? W ill the Minister discuss with the Prices Branch the need for an investigation of the press report and, if it be well founded, ask the branch to take steps to protect the interests of the wheat growers? . Have State railway and silo authorities undertaken to co-operate with the Australian Wheat Boardi n handling and transporting the expected record H as the Prime crop in the coming season ? Is the board satisfied that it has sufficient cornsacks available to avoid unnecessary delay to growers during harvesting operations? dence that there is a black market in second-hand cornsacks, and I doubt whether there is, but, should .there be, I shall be glad to discuss the problem with the Prices Commissioner in an endeavour to ensure adequate attempts to prevent it.

11,Mr Pollabd,"I know of no evidelivery of wheat in second-hand sacks. A. good reason exists for that policy. I believe that the Australian Government and the Australian Wheat Board can expect from' the State railway authorities and the silo authorities the fullest possible co-operation in the handling of the wheat crop. Owing to the promised bountiful nature of the crop, the cornsack situation may be tight, but I am sure that the railway authorities, the silo authorities and the wheat-farmers will have suffiare correct? I understand that about cient Australian initiative to overcome any problems that may arise. the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to supply a statement showing the number of cornsacks for wheat in store in Australia, the number in transit from India, the number ordered in India but not yet shipped, and the approximate dates of loading. When will the Minister be able to supply this information? supply the information as soon as I receive it. Commerce and Agriculture either verify or deny the press report that cornsacks unsold last season, when the price was 16s. a dozen, are now being sold to wheat farmers at 27s. 6d. a dozen? Does the honourable gentleman know what number of cornsacks will be available for the forthcoming wheat crop? mately the number of cornsacks available in Australia to-day, but I shall not mention the figure because I should like the honourable member to be given exact info''raation. Subject to information that I might glean from a further check, 1 should say that it is the practice of the Australian Wheat Board to sell wheat, -sacks at varying prices, and that it is quite possible that wheat sacks which twelve months ago cost the hoard 16s. a dozen are now being sold at 28s. a dozen. The honourable member will be pleased to know that there is an equitable distribution of the sacks cost involved among those who contribute bagged wheat to the pool. Therefore, if a wheat-grower now pays 28s. a dozen for sacks, he will receive a return later when the sack factor has been equalized by the wheat pool. OATS. for Commerce and Agriculture whether arrangements have recently been completed for the export of a very large parcel of oats from Australia to Belgium at 7s. or 8s. a bushel. As the guaranteed price of oats to growers is 3s. 3d. a bushel, will the Minister inform the House what will be done with the difference between 3s. 3d. and the 7s. or 8s., if those figures £A.60,000 is involved in the transaction of last season, t'he Australian Government did guarantee a price at sidings to known oat-growers for oats delivered to the Australian Barley Board. Recently, owing to the promise of a very good grain crop, authority has been given to the board to export some of the government owned oats. The price obtained is reasonably good. Use of the money paid for those oats is a matter of Government policy,' which is now under the consideration of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and no announcement can be made until it has been decided. The Government paid a fair price for oats last season and will pay an increased price for the forthcoming crop. Commerce and Agriculture inform me what action, if any, has been taken to set up the board in accordance with the provisions of the Apple and Pear Organization Act, which the Parliament passed last June. What is the reason for the long delay in appointing the board ? When is it likely to be appointed? taken to set up this board, but necessarily, in the appointment of a new authority, a good deal of machinery work is involved. That preliminary work is still proceeding, and, in due course, the Government, will announce when the board is to be established. for Housing read in the press a statement in which Mr W. J.

Collinsville is a coal-mining centre and I am informed that it is impossible to buy a bar of soap in the town. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether he will indicate the exact position in regard to soap supplies, and also the future prospects. In any case, will the honourable gentleman give his immediate attention to arranging for supplies to be forwarded to Collinsville without delay? member is no doubt well aware that the Australian Government has no power whatsoever over the distribution of products within Australia. It is quite possible that adequate supplies of soap are available in Australia to meet all requirements, but it is also possible that inadequate reserves existand that as the result of maladministration of distribution facilities and the lack of coordination on the part of manufacturers and distributors, soap may not be available at some centres where it is urgently required. This illustrates the stupidity of the present system of distribution. It is also true that the lack of reserves of legislation. It is not likely that speeches soap may be due to two other factors over which the Government has no control, one being the inadequate supply of soda ash and soda potash, which are essential constituents of soap and upon the supply of which we are dependent on overseas sources, and the other the supply of tallow. The Government has no control over tallow manufacturers or processors, and it is probable that insufficient supplies of tallow have been made available to soap manufacturers to enable them to provide an adequate reserve of soap. I shall take steps to do whatever can be done on a voluntary basis to increase the supply of soap to the important centre of Collinsville which is represented by the honourable member.

I believe that, after they have made certain investigations, there will be considerably more expedition towards the commencement of operations than has been the case during the last twelve months. I understand that there have been certain difficulties in relation to supplies of water, but I have been informed that discussions on that matter have'taken place with the Government of New South ""Wales and have proved very satisfactory. There are other difficulties in connection with the supply of labour of the types required in this industry. I believe that the directors from the United Kingdom who are visiting Australia are quite impressed with the potentialities of the locality in which the factory is to be established. The mere fact that they are interested in establishing a factory there at an early date shows that the financial policy of this Government does not appear to place any obstacle in the way of overseas firms embarking on new enterprises Australia.

47,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [3.17].,"The policy of the Government is that the defence of Australia is to be provided first of all by a permanent military force. Evidently, this permanent force is to be regarded as a nucleus around which is to be formed, in time of need, a fighting force, by the absorption of trained reserves. Those reserves, it would appear, are to be drawn from a trained citizen force. We should remember that in the future Australia is not likely to have such an opportunity to train its fighting men as it had in the last two wars. In those wars, there was available to Australia a considerable breathing space in which to train raw 'recruits to a point where they could take their place in a fighting force. I am firmly convinced that, in the event of another war, such a breathing space will not be accorded us. It will be a case of defending ourselves bitterly from the very beginning of hostilities. must provide for the training of a defence force which can take its place in the field at short notice. The success of the Government's defence policy will depend largely on the method followed in the training of reserves. I am not afraid of what is likely to happen in respect of the training of the permanent forces. We can leave that with confidence in the hands of our military authorities. But the training of the citizen forces, from which the reserves which will expand our permanent forces into a fighting force will be drawn, is to be determined by government policy. particular importance that we should ensure that that training is efficient and effective, particularly in view of the fact must be no opportunity for the laggard that the amount to be made available to be expended for that purpose is necessarily limited. As one who has had considerable personal experience of military training I condemn utterly the training system proposed for the citizen forces. The Government's proposals for the training of the citizen forces provides, first, for a continuation of the systemof voluntary enlistment. That means that only the cream of our youth will offer for training. I regret to say that it is my belief that that in itself will considerably training must be of such a character limit the field available. But there is a more important factor which must' be taken into account. This system also Mr Davidson. means that if we have to take part in another war the cream of our youth will be called upon to bear the full brunt of the first onslaught. That has taken place, not only in Australian history, but also in the history of other nations on several occasions in the past. It means that the cream of the country's youth, which is called upon to bear the first bitter onslaught, will also be called on to die in great numbers. Any policy which deliberately or otherwise sets out to perpetuate such a system, which is so dangerous to the continuance of a high level of citizenship, is disastrous. We know that present-day wars are "" all in "" affairs, that every man and many women will be called on to do his or her part, and as I have already pointed out, all must be trained to carry out the particular task to which they are assigned. In short, an adequate defence policy must Therefore, our defence force provide for all those likely to take part in hostilities to be prepared to fight at the traditional "" drop of the handkerchief "". I do not like having to say this; I am no jingoist; but I have too many times been under conditions of utter horror ever to want to see any of our youth forced to face similar conditions. But the facts must be faced. We may be called upon to defend ourselves, and if we are, the only chance of success will lie in our capacity to look after ourselves. A consideration of the factors I have briefly outlined gives rise to two inescapable deductions. The first is that every Therefore it is of man, be he "" duke's son, cook's son, or son of an engineer"", must be included in the training programme. In short, there to leave it to the other fellow. That remark is not a general condemnation of our youth; it simply means that we must face up to the fact that there are many youths in the community, particularly under present-day conditions, who give no thought to their great responsibilities to the nation. .Under the system the Government proposes to adopt, no opportunity will be given to them to measure up to their full responsibilities. The second deduction is that our military as to ensure that every man, when trained, can, at short notice, take his place in the field as an efficient soldier, capable of giving a good account of himself and not proving, as WAS the case so many times in the past, mere cannon fodder. I invite honourable members who have had experience of active service to cast their minds back to the number of times they have seen their units built up by reinforcements and in a following action the majority of the casualties taking place among the reinforcements. Intensive training is essential if we are to give our young men a fair chance of survival should the testing time come. Let us consider how the present programme will measure up to the factors I have mentioned. It is prescribed that in one year training is to be provided on the basis of fourteen days' compulsory training and 24 days' home training, a total of 38 days. Of the 24 days' home training, twelve days only are obligatory; the remainder are voluntary and will, I assume, be carried out under some system of night parades as was the case previously. In short, there appears to be a continuation of the same ineffective system which found Australia at the commencement of World War II . almost entirely incapable of offering adequate defence at short notice. When laying down defence policy it is desirable to ensure that the training is of such a character as to avoid giving the impression to our youths that it is something to bo avoided. If when they start this voluntary training, they see-as they will see-that it is a sheer waste of time, there will be established in their minds an entirely erroneous impression . and, perhaps, an invitation to attempt to avoid training. The system of training proposed for the citizen forces will represent a wanton waste of money. It is well known to any one with a sound knowledge of modern warfare that at least three months intensive training are required to train a raw recruit in the use of personal weapons, the rifle and bayonet, the Bren gun, and the mortar. I am confining my remarks to the Army, because it is the only arm of which I have any knowledge. Further, it takes more than three months to perfect a man in field training. Only at the end of a period of six months' training is a recruit able to take his proper place as an efficient soldier in the fighting forces, whether it be in a platoon, a company, a battalion, a troop, a battery or a regiment. It must be remembered also that to give a young man six months' intensive training of that kind, unbroken by any form of sport, would be ridiculous. The man of military experience knows that considerable periods of training, in which there is interspersed various sports and other subjects designed to develop esprit de corps, are essential to a complete training policy. The demands of our present economic position and the demands for man-power for the rehabilitation of the country make a complete defence system, such as I have been leading up to, in this country unthinkable at present. I cannot he sure, .but I hope I am right in doubting whether we shall have to defend Australia in the next two years. SoI doubt whether an ideal defence policy is advisable at present, but it is essential, since we need to turn as much of the finances of the country to reconstruction as is possible and to reserve man-power to develop industries, that the money we spend on, and the men we attract to, the defence forces, shall be 'used in the most effective manner, so that, by the expenditure of the minimum amount, we may he able to develop a force that will be capable of defending Australia, if necessary. Under the proposed system we shall never have forces, apart from the permanent forces, capable of taking the field unless we are again fortunate enough to have a considerable breathing space at the beginning of the war in which to train our reserves. My remarks do not convey any personal criticism of those responsible for the matterj but I know what I am talking about and I hope that further consideration will be given by the Government to the defence policy on which money is proposed to be expended. for the Army) [3.32],I appreciate the tone of the comments of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson).

The United States of America is our natural ally and it will be our ally for all time. After the 1914-18 war, Germany was left intact. Its industrial capacity wa9 not touched. It lost men in that war, but froim 1919 onwards, it was in a position to go to war urgently require man-power. at almost any time. The situation to-day in Germany is entirely different. Its industrial capacity no longer exists. The position in Russia has been examined by world authorities. No less an authority than Field Marshal Montgomery, who has recently returned from Russia, has just expressed the opinion that that country's industrial capacity to wage war cannot be brought into efficient motion for many years. Russia has not discovered the secret of the atomic bomb, no doubt. pointment as Minister for the Army last year, I spent the Christmas vacation in Japan and I travelled extensively through the areas occupied by the American troops and by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.

Having seen the devastation caused by Since the end of the war atomic bombs in Japan, I am convinced that in another war in which atomic energy was used, it would not matter, except, o.f course, from the point of view of casualties, whether we put 1,000,000 or 1,000 men in the field. That was an experimental bomb. It killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese. The victims included not only persons who were in the vicinity of the explosion but also thousands of others who died months later as the result of radio-activity. That leads me to the conclusion that if there is another war and the nations use atomic energy as a weapon, it will be the end of civilization. despair. defence at a l l "" . in a position, after World War II . , to conscript all its man-power for the defence of Australia.

I do not desire to traverse the observations that have been made in regard to defence generally, but I wish to refer specifically for they show clearly that we cannot place much reliance on what he says, for the two statements to which I shall refer indicate his complete lack of understanding of the realities of the international situation and show that he is shirking the responsibilities of the important position which he occupies. The honourable gentleman said that a very high military expert, in discussing the possibilities of Russia being able to wage a world war, expressed the opinion that Russia would not be capable of waging a world war within the next few years. The Minister's remarks were indeed fatuous, and remind one of the opinions expressed prior to the last war by so-called experts relative to the capacity of certain other countries to go to war. There is no doubt that to-day Russia is wielding the heavy bludgeon against the smaller nations in Europe, and is doing so without challenge. Does the Minister for the Army consider that Russia is engaged in a gigantic bluff, or that it can hoodwink the other nations? Would Russian leaders make such remarks as they are making unless they were prepared for their country to take full responsibility for what might happen? Such statements as the Minister has made are mischievous, and cannot be allowed to pass without criticism, particularly as they relate to a nation which seems to be set on pursuing a policy of political and imperial If a country is weak, it aggrandizement. The statement that I have quoted was provocative enough, but the Minister went on to say that if Russia went to war with America, it would not necessarily follow that Australia would have to introduce conscription.

The United States did not hesitate to apply conscription to its own people in order to resist fascist and other totalitarian aggression, and it sent troops, navy shall be maintained. We need an with all necessary equipment, to Australia to help this country also to resist such aggression. America became a complete 'ally of Australia during ""World War II . , and substantially helped this country, with men, arms and munitions, to become a first-rate fighting force. Yet the Minister for the Army would have us believe that if the United States found itself in dire distress and at war with Russia it would not necessarily follow that conscription would have to be applied in this country, and that we would not need to do anything to help America in that regard at all. we would not have to conscript troops in this country in order to help Americai f battle were joined between that country and Russia. But surely the honourable gentleman realizes that nothing short of a total war effort would be demanded of us, which would include conscription, if America called on us for help. I direct attention to the loose stateaircraft carrier by the 30th June, 1948, ments made by the Minister for the Army, because I think it is essential that our people should not be misled in these matters. Such statements may do a good deal of damage in a democratic country among peace-loving people. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that if war occurred it would be total war. That possibility must not be allowed to slip out of the minds of our people. There should be an early debate in this Parliament on defence policy, particularly in view of the outlook that the Minister for the Army seems to have on the international situation. The sooner provision is made for a full dress debate on defence policy the better it will he for everybody. The Australian people should be informed of government policy, and of the views of individual Ministers and members on this subject. wish to'discuss defence policy in relation to the senior service, the Royal Australian Navy. I am glad to notice that the proposed vote for the Navy exceeds £20,000,000, the exact figure being £20,601,000. I firmly believe, and have frequently said, that it is of the utmost importance to Australia that a first-class effective navy, not only as a striking force, but also as an agency for transporting men and supplies to wherever they may be needed. Our Navy needs to be maintained on an up-to-date pattern. Through the courtesy of the Minister for the Navy( Mr Riordan), I had the privilege of being aboard HMS. Glory when that aircraft carrier was engaged in exercises recently, and I was deeply impressed by the capable way in which the vessel was handled. I was astounded to learn from members of the crew, while I was watching rocket practice, that one of the rockets had a fire power equal to that of an 8-in. gun. That, certainly, is a considerable striking force. One realizes, of course, that they do not have the fire power range of a cruiser's guns. But I was told that their striking power was so great that they would penetrate anything from the deck down. That slight experience has convinced me that the Minister and the Government have acted rightly in ensuring that we shall have a balanced navy, by adding to the present fleet one and a second by the 30th June, 1949. On a previous occasion in this chamiber, I said that it was necessary to have a balanced navy if we were to have one with a sufficient striking force. That is most important. We hear much talk of war at different times. I have always contended that there would have been more wars in the past had it not been for the striking force of the navies of the British Commonwealth. That is why I speak as I do to-day. There is an old tradition that those who join the senior service must be British born, and it has been worthily upheld. I was pleas*ed to note that the rates of pay, and marriage and separation allowances, of the Australian naval serving men, have heen increased. That is a point which we anust keep in mind; because, when a man joins the Royal Australian Navy, he is obliged to serve on any sea, and he is on active service from the time he becomes a trainee Or a member of the crew. The Navy has always been most particular in",22,Miscellaneous

93,Mr Sheehy (Boothby) [3.58],"Iits selection of recruits, and has been fortunate in having been able to secure men of a really good type. No matter what 'may be the political beliefs of the government of the day, full recognition must be given to the services that are rendered by men of the Navy. I do not wish to detract from the other services. I point out, however, that men who join the Army or the Air Force may obtain their training not far distant from their homes, whereas men who join the Navy are required to spend a lot'of their time at sea, in peace time as well as in time of The Japanese, who constituted the danger war; therefore, every consideration must be given to them. I understand that Hobart was somewhat remodelled in 1941, and that Australia has the most up-todate radar equipment procurable. I commend whoever was responsible for those improvements. As I said earlier, the British Commonwealth needs a naval striking power of sufficient force to ensure that it will receive in the future the recognition it has had in the past. Any measure designed to achieve that end will have my support. Whilst there are many good propositions in the speech of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), as well as in the proposals of the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) and the Minister for the Navy( Mr Riordan), there are also many serious weaknesses. I have had considerable experience of the Army, and claim to know a good deal about it. I have considered very definitely for many years, and have advocated very strongly, that there should he a permanent force in Australia. For some years prior to World War II . , I urged that provision should be made for at least a fully mechanized brigade. Every one must realize that that would have been of the utmost value to the people of 'Australia, if only as a training cadre-me n who had had actual experience of mechanized warfare with modern, weapons-whe n war was declared. One brigade of 4,470 fighting troops is quite inadequate. In time of peace, a very large proportion of the permanent troops must be devoted to instructional work, training cadres, and similar duties. Such a force would be as a "" mere drop in the ocean"". The Government has decided to have a field force of only two divisions of infantry and ancillary services. That is hard to understand, in view of the fact that in pre-war days seven divisions were undergoing training of approximately the same type as that which is proposed to-day. At that time, we had a natural defence, because any potential enemy was at a -very considerable distance from us, and unable to attack us without assembling a large fleet of transports, a very considerable body of men, and all the necessary supplies. nearest to us, had a very long flank which was open to attack by the Americans. We all admit that the provision ""which we had then made was quite inadequate. I remind members of the Government that they then insisted that there was no justification for a defence force of that size, which the anti-Labour Government established despite continued resistance by powerful influences, which to-day dictate to the Government of this country. The Minister for Defence has said that because of the state of its industries Russia is not in a position to make an attack on this country. I well remember that very shortly before France and Britain were attacked by Germany the same sort of statements were made, namely, that Germany could not possibly wage war beeause it had not the necessary financial resources. I have heard quite prominent members of the present Government party say that there was no justification for our defence budget. The late John Curtin said in 1939 that there was no justification for the tremendous expenditure on war then contemplated, and that the Government was only trying to work up war hysteria in this country for political purposes.

98,Mr Rankin,"They have not. Thevery time when Germany was preparing to attack us. Field Marshal Montgomery may have told the Minister that Russia is not in a position to attack us. We do not know what information he had, but it would be fairly sketchy. All of us have heard of the "" iron curtain"". Many people have paid the price of trying to get behind it in order to learn something of.what was going on. The war potential and man-power of Russia are terrific. We know that that country has guided missies. If it had the atomic bomb, it would be potentially very dangerous to any country in the world. The present rulers in Russia have the same imperialist outlook as the Czars had. They have their eyes on the wealth and man-power of India and China, and very definitely on the Bosphorus and an outlet into the Mediterranean. They are definitely a danger to us. No government is entitled to refrain from training our young manhood, and thus making them capable of going into the field and using modern weapons. In my time, men were armed with rifle, bayonet, sword, machine gun and field gun. A short, intensive period of training made them capable of using those weapons effectively in the field. Still we all know that, even with the training which the members of the 1st Australian Imperial Force had for several months in Egyptand it was a very severe course-whe n they landed at Gallipoli they were amateurs when opposed to the regular Turkish army, which was composed of professionals, and paid the price for that lack of training in good Australian blood. We are not doing sufficient in regard to our defences. That applies not only to the Army, but also to the Navy and the Air Force. Every young man in this country should be prepared to defend it. I do not say that every one, when he has reached the age of eighteen years, should be called up and be expected to do six or twelve months training, but all should be examined and classified in "" A "" class or "" B "" class. The Australian Government, in collaboration with the British Government, the governments of the other Dominions, and the Government of the United States of America, should decide what number of men should be trained. The minimum strength of the Army should be at least 100,000 men, ' and the Air Force and Navy should he of proportionate strength-. All recruits for the Army should be selected by ballot, irrespective of their position in the community. If they were given a period of six months' training it would not affect their civilian occupations to any marked degree, nor would it upset our national economy. No one can say when we may go to war, or with whom we may be at war. Of course, there are certain nations which we can disregard. It is unthinkable that we should ever fight with any of the English-speaking peoples. They will all be forced to work together and fight together, because that is their only hope of survival. Field Marshal Montgomery has been quoted as saying that there is no danger of war in the future because the nations are exhausted from the recent war. I point out that the late General White, who was perhaps one of the best staff officers Australia has produced, said after Hitler's drive to Dunkirk that it would be impossible for him to make a similar drive for three or four months at tlie earliest; yet ten days later, his armies rushed up the Seine valley to the Swiss border, and cut off a great French army in the Ardennes. What was impossible in the past is not necessarily impossible to-day. Previously, Australia always had time to assemble men, and give them at least some military training. Now, however, we know that we could be attacked from the air without warning by forces from Japan, or Russia, or China, or India. We know from the experience of the Japanese at Hiroshima that an attack with atomic bombs could wipe out our .war potential in a night; Our great industries at Newcastle, Port Kembla and Maribyrnong could be flattened in a few hours, and we should then be reduced to waging guerrilla warfare. . Staggering damage could be inflicted on our great cities. Our only hope lies in the possession of modern weapons, with men trained in their use. We should have enough trained men for our Army, our Navy, our Air Force, for the manning of our coastal defences, and the defences around our great cities. The next time, the country which is about to attack us will give no warning of its intention. The first that we shall know is when the bombs are raining down on our great industrial centres and our capital cities. I have a great admiration for FieldMarshal Montgomery, who is a remarkable man and a great soldier, but I do not agree with him that there is no immediate danger of war. There were times during recent discussions over Trieste, Greece and the Bosphorus by delegates to the United Nations when it would seem that we were playing with a lighted candle around a barrel of gunpowder. Australia must have adequate defence forces, irrespective of the cost. We know that if a man's life is threatened by some malignant disease, and a surgeon convinces him that he has a chance of recovery if he undergoes an operation, he will pay his last penny to have the operation performed. It is the same with nations. They must defend themselves, no matter how hard it affects their finances, or how many men are required. Those nations which make adequate preparations for defence are not likely to be attacked. It is not the strong welldefended though peace-loving nations that are attacked, but the weak nations with great industries, great potentialities, in most directions. For instance, I great aerodromes lying along world aviation routes, and great harbours. I am glad that the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) has decided to abolish the stupid test applied to military recruits by psychiatrists. young men from the country who wished to -join the forces for service in Japan, but who were rejected by the psychiatrists. I also saw the foolish questions which were asked them, and upon which their rejection was based. Those young men had the ordinary education, but perhaps had not had educational tuition for the last eight or ten years. The questions were of the kind that might be answered by some long-haired professor with a good memory, but I am sure that many senior army officers could not have answered them; yet these young men, who are probably the hest military material in the world, farm labourers or men from their own farms, were rejected because they did not answer the questions to the satisfaction of the psychiatrists. After looking at the questions, I was convinced that the wrong Mr Rankin. people were being examined, and I suggest to the Minister for the Army that he should get three or four competent soldiers to have a look at the psychiatrists. If the Government is determined not to introduce compulsory training, I , as an old militiaman, advise it very strongly to do what the Germans did when, under the Versailles treaty, they were not allowed to have a large standing army. They concentrated on the training of officers and non-commissioned officers, and it was due to this that, in so short a time, they were able to build up what at that time was possibly ithe greatest fighting force in the world. 1 am convinced that very little useful purpose is served by training men for ten or twelve days in camps, and then sending them home where they get another fifteen days' training. In the Navy and in the Air Force, also, it is necessary to have a welltrained nucleus around which an effective force can he built in time of war. In my opinion, the Government is not doing enough for the defence of Australia. What it proposes to do is fairly sound thoroughly agree with the proposal to establish a permanent military force. The time has come when we should explode the old myth that only regular soldiers should serve on the staff and on I know of military boards. . I believe that we should have on such authorities representatives of the citizen army itself. The others are only the school teachers of the Army.

Speaking on the budget of 1940-41 Mr Curtin, then Leader of the Opposition, saidTlie Opposition does not seek to reduce by a single shilling the provision which the Government, in its wisdom, regards as necessary in order that the programme in relation to the conduct of the war may be adequately carried out in the financial year that we are considerits -methods by honourable members oppoing.

I put it in that way because I think it is desirable that the whole world-and more particularly our enemies-shoul d know that whatever may take place in this Parliament this week will not in any way affect the complete unity of the Australian people, or the determination of this Parliament as a united liody to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion.

The families of the fighting men have tlie first right to any special privileges that the country is capable of conferring in time of war. He then dealt in detail with what he regarded as the lack of proper organization and proper provision in the Government's plans for the prosecution of the war, and with the f a i r treatment of all the elements of the community that would be engaged in it.

106,Mr Ryan,"First, I wish to directby Soviet Russia, the possibilities of war are by no means remote. The Minister went on to say-and this is where I disagree with him-that if war again broke out in this atomic age, an army would not be of much use. His thoughts in that respect differ, not only from my own, but also from those of a large body of construcclass naval air force arm. If the naval air tive military thought in the world to-day. To-day our army scarcely exists. The Government's defence plan provides for a Navy consisting of 10,450 men, a per : manent Army of 19,000, and an Air Force of 12,000, or a total permanent force of approximately 41,000. In addition, we are to have citizen forces numbering 50,000, the value of which-and I believe the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr poor relation of the Royal Australian Air Eankin) will agree with me-wil l be nil. Not only is the whole world unstable, not only is there great uncertainty as to what future developments may arise, but there is also present another disturbing factor, namely, the weakening of the strength of Great Britain. In the last fortnight or so the United Kingdom forces have been reduced from approximately 1,000,000 to fewer than 750,000 men. It has been agreed here, and elsewhere, that Australian should accept a greater share of responsibility for the defence of the Empire. How can we do so with a total force for the three arms of only approximately 41,000 men? On a population basis, we should have a permanent force of approximately 125,000 if we are to play a proportionate part with Great Britain in the defence of the Empire. Our plans for the defence of this country, and for our share in the defence of the Empire, are absolutely inadequate. We must improve them. I turn now to a consideration of the Navy, particularly of the proposed carrier force. We understand that, shortly, we are to have two carriers, one of which is nearing completion and the other likely to be completed at some later date. We are in a very favorable position in that we are starting'from scratch. When this force is built up, and the necessary equipment obtained and personnel trained, we shall have a carrier force second to none in the world, one able to play an important part in the defence of the Empire in the Pacific. That is appreciated in the United Kingdom, and I am informed that Mr Ryan. we have been given priority by the United Kingdom Government in regard to the supply of the carriers and of the aircraft included in their complement. The aircraft are, I understand, to be of the latest type and, if everything goes according to plan, we should have a firstarm is to be successful, however, it must be free from interference by the other services. The Minister for the Navy( Mr Riordan) and his advisers will be responsible for the recruitment of its personnel, but the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) should ensure that it is not subjected to interference by other service departments, not made a sort of Force. It must be trained and administered as a separate service. The Minister was rather optimistic when he said that it may be possible to secure aircraft of the jet-propelled type for the naval air arm. I understand that swh aircraft will not be produced for nttachment to the Navy for some considerable time. To man the naval aircraft we shall require, I believe, 80 officer pilots. Inspectors have already begun the examination of applicants. I understand that mow than 700 applications have been received, but that only 25 applicants have been provisionally accepted. Apparently the screening of applicants has been very careful in order to ensure that we get, only the best men, and it is difficult to find them. the honourable gentleman got his information.

If we' are unable to do so, I suggest that the Minister should endeavour to secure the services of ex-Royal Navy pilots now in the United Kingdom who had participated in the defence of this country during the war.

We require immigrants in large numbers, and hy bringing British ex-servicemen here to join our fighting services we would solve at least the problem of their accommodation and employment in the first few years of their residence in this country. We should follow the policy adopted in Great Britain in connection with the inspectorate branches of the services. In Great Britain, until <a few years ago, each of the services had its own inspectorate branch; but, as the result of war experience, it was found to he more economical, both as regards numbers of personnel and quality of work, to divorce the inspectorate branches from the services and to constitute a separate inspectorate service to cover the requirements of the three services. That suggestion might well he considered in the re-organization, and, I hope, the expansion of our services. Some time ago, when the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) informed the House of the Government's decision to increase by 7s. 6d. a week the pensions of war widows with one child or two children he said that that was the only concession that the Government was prepared to make to war widows. If the Government is prepared to increase the pension payable to those war widows why not extend the concession to widows with three, four or five children, of whom there aTe many. In any event, members of the Parliament and the people generally believe that the pension is inadequate. I have received many letters from various people and organizations pointing out how extraordinarily inadequate is the pension of these unfortunate war widows. Part of a letter I received yesterday from the Mornington Mothers Club contains the following paragraph:Certainly there has recently been a small increase, but we, as a representative body of mothers in this town, consider that while it is a step in the right direction, it still is far below the support tliat should be given these women to enable them to keep their homes and families at a decent standard of living. We can only sincerely endorse Mrs. Vasey's views and efforts on behalf of the war widows, and trust as a club that this protest may add to her appeal in some way, however small. All the other letters are in the same strain; all stress the urgent need for an increase of the pension. I have never been able to understand the attitude of the Government in this matter. A woman reconstruction trainee with two dependants receives £5 10s. a week-that is regarded as insufficient-whereas , even with the increase recently granted, a war widow with two children receives only £5 a week. Then, why should war widows receive less than a permanently disabled ex-serviceman. After all, he is still alive, even though permanently disabled, but the war widows have lost their husbands. Their pensions are entirely out of proportion to the cost of living. War widows ' and their children are experiencing great hardships, as every one knows who has studied their conditions. The former husband of a widow with one child living in my electorate earned £650 a year in civilian life before he joined the forces; later he was killed in the Middle East. The couple were buying a house. With the increase of 7s. 6d. a week, her pension is now £4 weekly, out of which she has to pay 27s. 6d. for rent, 3s. for light, 3s. for gas, 6s. for meat, 6s.. for milk, 2s. for bread, £1 for groceries, and 4s. 6d. for medicine. member say "" medicine "" ? ordered her to take emulsion, which, apparently, is not on the pharmaceutical list. That leaves her with 13s. for clothes, shoes, fares, household expenses, wood, ice, stamps and newspapers, and all the other incidentals required in a home. She is ill , but the only thing she can do is disobey the doctor's orders and go to work to make up the deficiency. There are hundreds like her. The result is that their health is deteriorating from day to day. Cases of neurosis among war widows are multiplying, and I believe that many have contracted tuberculosis. One reason why the Government is disinclined to be more generous is that if it were, the war widows' pensions would be out of line with pensions paid to ordinary widows. The Government's attitude is, "" Why make a difference .between war widows and civilian widows ? "" But their circumstances are absolutely different. tial difference between the two.",28,Miscellaneous

113,Mr Barnard,"We make a substansufficiently substantial. The war widows' husbands died for their country, and it is the country's duty to ensure that they shall not suffer financially in consequence of their husbands' deaths. The guiding principle must be that they and their dependants shall be free from want. Had their husbands returned, no doubt the greater majority would have been free from want. There are 12,000 war widows in all, and hundreds of them are suffering seriously as the result of the penurious pensions paid to them by the Government. I ask the Minister for Repatriation to ensure that they shall be properly treated. I now refer to the way in which repatriation hospitals are conducted. I refer particularly to what was the Heidelberg Military Hospital. It was controlled most efficiently as a military hospital. The Repatriation Commission then assumed control. I understand that, according to normal standards, it is still conducted effia historical sense. I do not think that ciently, but, whereas when the Army was in control there was no timetable and a 24-hour service was operated, now the hospital is conducted on a civilian timetable, and nurses, doctors and orderlies are rostered for duty. Under the rules laid down by the repatriation authorities, all emphasis is laid on the machine instead of the patient, on whom it should be laid. As the result the patients suffer. I give two examples of how the system operates. A couple of week-ends ago, a patient, after examination by a doctor, was ordered to have a blood transfusion, but when the doctor returned to the hospital on the Monday morning, he found that the patient had not been given the transfusion. When he asked why, he was told that all the staff had. gone off duty and that no one had been there to do the job. In other words, the machinery turned according to schedule, but nothing was done for the patient. In the other instance, the patient was admitted for diagnosis. He spent three months in the hospital without being diagnosed. Why? Because the details of his case got into the department's files and travelled the whole course without appropriate action being taken. Those are examples of what takes place when things are done according to red tape methods. I impress upon the Government that at repatriation hospitals, and all government hospitals, the Government may establish under its medical and health scheme, first consideration must be given to the padent and that red-tape nules must not be laid down for controlling the establishments. I know that the Minister for Repatriation will investigate the complaints I have made and I hope that, as the result, we shall have something better than we -have had. night the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) said that I supported the Communists on every available opportunity. I am sure that he made that remark in the heat of debate. The statement. I made that brought forth that remark related to the book Who are the Beds? I pointed outprobably the honourable gentleman did not hear me under his own thunder-that the writer was traversing the "" reds "" in warranted the accusation that I support the Communists. It was an unfair statement. I need not labour the point, because the charge is so utterly false. The honourable member for New England aptly comes from a place named Wingen. He is always crying.

I would not presume to send a cable to President Truman. In his customary well-rniannered speech, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) dealt first with the remilitarization of Australia, and secondly, with war widows. What makes war widows but war? That there are war widows is proof of the stupidity of militarism. No man who has served in the forces can be without feelings of pacificism.

Wars are only the creation of the minds of men. wise. we shall not be attacked and that we do not need to be prepared^ but the pity is that before we have repaired the spiritual and material damage of the last war, we are faced with the need to organize ourselves, even to the debatable point of conscription, lest there should be another war. As regards pensions for war widows, no payment can compensate a woman for the loss of her husband. The pensions now payable to war widows are hetter than they were after World WarI . , but I doubt whether any war widow could be given the measure of prosperity by means of a pension that she enjoyed before a war. Money is not the measure. On the matter of pensions generally, no matter what Minister has administered the Repatriation Department, it has always been "" Heartbreak House"". Everybody has tried to do these things. The act is alleged, by parliamentary draftsmen, and those who understand the drafting of bills, to be an almost perfect measure, but it has worked most imperfectly under most Ministers. The present Minister for Repatriation has approached the subject with a broad mind, and a desire to do things. Although he has made some useful improvements, the act is still far from perfect in its effect. It will continue so to be, because, after a war, no one is prepared to pay the price of the conflict. Whether or not people are patriotically inclined, they must fact the proposition that once the war is ended, and the threat removed, it is a niggardly payment indeed which is made to the dependants of those who have paid the supreme sacrifice, or have been maimed or wounded. However, that has been the aftermath of all wars. To blame a government for these conditions, and say that the allocation is not sufficient or that we should set one section of service against another, is entirely wrong. The only satisfactory assessment must be made on the poignancy of the cases concerned, and, in the first priority, I certainly place the war widows. Having done that, legitimate claims are to be considered from other sections of the fighting forces, such as the partially disabled and the blinded men, the neurosis cases, the children of members of the forces who were killed in action, I do not suggest that and prisoners of war, on whose behalf the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) has made such a valiant fight. We require many millions of pounds in order to enable us to make a level payment for the services rendered, but we never seem to be able to do it. The reason is that there is, on the other hand, the problem of reconstruction. If we decide that what has gone is gone, and that seems to me to be the criminal decision on war, we should decide to do something for the survivors and allocate £80,000,000 for reconstruction and rehabilitation purposes. Immediately that is done, other ex-servicemen and their dependants appeal to the Repatriation Department and ex-servicemen's organizations for justice. Every man has his own case, and feels that there is great merit in it. He appears before the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, and finally submits his case to the Minister for Repatriation. In the main, these matters are worked out by a plana merciless plan-whic h depends upon the money available. These matters are fully judged, not on humanitarian grounds, but by £ s. d. No matter how strongly we fight for these cases, and make appeals in the House on their behalf, the conditioning factor is the amount of money in the Treasury for ex-servicemen and their dependants, for rehabilitation and re-construction, and for the services of the country. In all wars, from the Crimean War to World War IT., service men and women have "" missed out"". Wordy expressions of wisdom in this House do not contribute ultimately to the solution of this problem. The question to be answered is: What, sacrifices have been made, and how are they to be rewarded ? Again, this depends upon the amount of money available. Every government, regardless of its political views, does attempt, by maintaining the closest possible contact with ex-servicemen's organizations and repatriation",30,Miscellaneous
120,Mr White,No one suggests other,31,Miscellaneous
121,Mr Haylen,"commissions in the States, which know everything that there is to know about pensions and welfare payments, to do its best on behalf of ex-servicemen. If any glaring anomalies arise, they are adjusted, because every one has a fair outlook towards ex-servicemen and their problems. A campaign for an increase of war widows' pensions is now blowing ,up from Victoria and elsewhere. This campaign has pressure, justification and sincerity to support it. To what degree it will be possible to meet this demand with the money available, I do not know. But what happens when we have met, as adequately as we can, these claims for increased pensions? The pot fills up again and again with other requests from ex-servicemen and their organizations, until ultimately we come back to the recognition of the utter futility of paying adequately for the sacrifices of war. War does not pay.any dividends in blood, tears, sacrifice or rewards to the survivors. It is with great diffidence that I say that some honourable members opposite indulge in just a little too much talk of war, and preparations for war. I may be wrong. In my own mind, I was wrong on another occasion regarding the outbreak of waT. I thought that World War II. might have been prevented. I believe that there will not he a third world war. Now, however, we may adopt one of two courses. If we decide that Australia should equip and maintain forces and make preparations to defend itself, and conduct atomic research and investigation into other deadly and even more modern appurtenances of war, we must immediately cut into our financial cake, and allocate larger sums of money for defence. Whether good or bad, the decision would have some effect on the Government's policy of full employment. If we propose to provide, as Hitler did, for full employment for the people by making war a great public work, we shall be on the way to another world war. If we resist this course by putting all our eggs into one basket, and depend on our powerful allies overseas, because of their armed strength, money and proximity to our enemy, and on the processes of the United and slow as they are, we might be in imminent danger of having ""picked Mr .Haylen. the wrong horse"" again. The position might well cause us to despair, believing that man might ultimately remove himself from the scene of conflict on the earth which he inhabits. I do not know vhat the solution is, but, undoubtedly, we should give the subject of peace a little longer consideration, and should not give way to despair. We should not conclude immediately that war is inevitable, because that is the short path to another, war. It is distressing, and I cannot solve the problem. Only the people of the world can do that. However, I do desire to place on record my own opinion regarding this matter. We shall not be wise to rattle the sabre so much, because, to be candid, we have no sabre to rattle. Australia is a small nation, with a population of 7,000,000 persons. The inference to be drawn from the speech of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) was that the British people who come here will make a fine army, but in my opinion, that would be too great an impost to place upon these immigrants. Mo9t of them served in the British Army for six years, and it is time that they had some furlough. I i they do come here, we do not want to regard them as potential cannon fodder. Rather than that, we should leave them in Great Britain to build up industries there. Many people believe that for Australia an increased population means safety. What a pitiful kind of safety it would be, if we had even an additional 1,000,000 people, in view of our close geographical proximity to the teeming millions of the East. In point of numbers, our position is intolerable. The influence of the atom bomb on the size of ground forces in future has been studied by military experts who know some of the difficulties and some of the prospects. I still contend, and this opinion is borne out by the views of most military writers, that we shall still require soldiers, after atom warfare, for cleaning up and mopping up operations. Therefore, the personal unit in war will not he dissolved. If numbers still count in the defence of Australia against inNations, tortuous vasion, we are in a pitiful position. I shall now summarize my views. I believe that we should continue to adhere to the United Nations, and help to strengthen it by a courageous approach to the battle for peace. We should also prepare, but slowly and with reluctance, lor any other eventuality; but for the lime being, we should carefully consider how much expenditure we can safely incur on preparatious for defence. This expenditure is like a snowball. Once we have one unit, we must proceed to establish others. A nation becomes poor in maintaining its defences against a possible attack hy an enemy. Here, I admit that there are two points of view on this subject, but I believe that, for the time being, we can expend a limited amount of money and a great amount of goodwill on the strengthening of the peace structure. If we f a i l again, there w ill be very tion wanted the Government to set one little left to live for. We still have a vast undischarged debt to ex-service men and women. We must face it frankly. with the policy which the Labour party the Government is doing.

We still have tragic reminders of Any ex-serviceman who is employed by World WarI . Many of the ex-servicethe Australian Government, a State men who took part in that conflict are government or private enterprise, and now in the old-age groups.

126,Mr Hamilton,"T h a t is just whatof an ex-serviceman who settles on the land. Such an outcry was raised against this action that recently the department saw fit to cease deducting the pension which was payable to the wife or children, but it continued to deduct from the ex-serviceman's living allowance an amount equivalent to the soldier's war pension. I also believe that, under that instruction, the Government would stoop so low as to deduct any decoration allowance which a settler might be receiving as the result of his war service. Income from all sources . must be deducted. It applies also to war pensions. The Minister should inquire into this matter immediately and issue an instruction that the practice is to be discontinued at once. This is a very sore point with ex-service men and women and their organizations. These men are endeavouring to establish themselves on the land with tlie help of an inadequate allowance of £1,000, which leaves them very little to spare. Any deduction at all from their living allowance is therefore a great hardship. It is disgraceful, in my opinion, that such deductions should be made. I wish also to request that the amount of £1,000 should be increased. request has been submitted by ex-servicemen's organizations to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction because the men know, from bitter experience, that £1,000 is inadequate. Their requests, however, have had only the barest recognition honourable T believe, that this request was one of the 40 made to him by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia almost twelve months ago. When regard is had to the rising cost of implements required on farms and of all necessaries of life in rural areas it must surely be appreciated that £1,000 is inadequate for the purpose. There is a leg rope even on that amount, because an advance of the full amount of £1,000 depends upon valuations by the prescribed authority, which will advance only up to 90 per cent, of its valuations. Unfortunately its valuations are not always satisfactory to the persons concerned. I had a case brought to my notice which indicated that the valuation on which the prescribed authority based its Mr Hamilton. grant was made twelve months before the ex-soldier applied for an advance. This matter also should be investigated immediately and the difficulties under which the men are labouring should be removed. The amount of the advance should be increased to £2,500. The matter to which I shall now refer involves the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) who, I am glad to see, is still in the chamber. We have had correspondence on the subject, but unfortunately the results have not been satisfactory. I refer to an advance of tickels made to prisoners of war on their release from incarceration in Siam. When the men were released they, of course, had no pay books and very little else. They were immediately issued with an interim pay book and a small amount was put to their credit in tickels. Later they received some more money which was practically forced upon them, and not entered in their pay books. In this case an amount of £8 15s. was made available and it was understood that the money was provided from a fund raised in Australia to assist prisoners of war on their release from incarceration by the Japanese. Six months after their This discharge these men were written to and asked to refund the money to the District Finance Officer.

In some cases, however, where gentleman will recall, men had amounts to their credit in the Commonwealth Savings Bank they were directed by registered letter to return their savings bank passbooks and the amount they had received under this heading was deducted from their accounts. I was fortunate enough to contact in Perth the Commonwealth Savings Bank official who actually made deductions' from the savings bank passbooks of one of these men. The men who had savings bank accounts were directed to return their passbooks but the amounts were not treated as being associated with the tickel transaction, but were regarded as overpayments in deferred pay. of the Army collaborate with the Commonwealth Savings Bank in this matter?",33,Miscellaneous
127,Mr Anthony,"Did the Departmentunder an ancient act, such deductions may be made provided that the Department of the Army can establish certain facts, but that is not my point. I put it to honourable members that we have one category of men who paid the money back without a quibble, another category who said that they would not pay it back in any circumstances, and another who, having savings bank accounts, were obliged to return their passbooks and to submit to the money being forcibly taken from them. When these transactions began to smell to high heaven the department ceased the practice. However, the only way in which this matter can be dealt with satisfactorily is for the Department of the Army or the Treasury, I care not which, to refund the money to those who paid it back voluntarily and to those which were obliged to pay it back through the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The matter cannot be allowed to stay where it is. The practice of deducting the money from savings bank accounts ended on the 2nd August, 1946. Any man who was discharged after that date was not obliged to refund the money. I sincerely trust that action will be taken without delay to remedy this complaint. I now refer to the war gratuity. Under section 1.7 (1.) of the War Gratuity Act provision is made that the war gratuity shall be paid to certain individuals in the event of the soldier who was entitled to it having been killed in action. The view of ex-servicemen's associations is that, irrespective of whether the soldier entitled to the gratuity was killed in action or not, (he money should be paid to his estate. The men earned the money and it should go to their estate without any question. I do not think that it should be paid only lo specified individuals. Brothers and sisters of servicemen who were killed in action have often been in great difficulty over this matter. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson) told me the other day of the sister of a serviceman killed in action who was almost starving, but still could not obtain any benefit from the gratuity that her deceased brother's estate was entitled to. This should be altered. I understand that the Prime Minister is considering referring to the committee of ex-servicemen certain quesI understand that, tions in relation to the war gratuity. This should certainly be one of them. loosening of the hardship section too. honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), and I intended to come to that point. Many returned men are endeavouring to establish themselves on properties for the purpose of poultry raising, orcharding and so forth, and they have invested practically every penny of their own money, choosing not to wait until funds became available for the purpose from government sources. Such men should be allowed to draw upon their gratuity in order to relieve their urgent need of finance. There may not be very many individuals in this class, but I know of eight in my own electorate. These men are seeking to increase food production, not only to help people in this country, but also, to some degree, to help starving people overseas. I know of one individual who desired to obtain money to purchase a pumping outfit in order to establish a private irrigation scheme. The Prime Minister was written to on the subject, but he said that nothing could be done in respect of the war gratuity, and advised the individual to write to tbe Repatriation Department. be entitled to assistance from that source. Department of Post-war Reconstruction would not make money available unless the applicant had been engaged, before his war service, in the industry in which he desired to expend the money. I believe that that instruction is set down in Directive No. 8 to Sec. 91, sub-paragraph 3. The effect is that even if a man learned a good deal about some branch of agriculture during his war service, he could not obtain any assistance from the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, for assistance from that source was limited to avenues of agriculture in which the man had been engaged prior to his war service. That is a most unsatisfactory situation. A man cannot obtain .any help to establish himself in the new industry which he has chosen, although this is supposed to be a generous Government.

The pinpricks to which ex-service men and women are being subjected in this regard are causing a great deal of dissatisfaction, and trouble will continue until the complaints have been remedied. 1 come now to the subject of flood relief for certain individuals in ""Western Australia. In Western Australia the two seasons immediately following the conclusion of hostilities were the wettest in the history of the State. Considerable areas of country were flooded with the result that crops of barley, wheat and oats, were ruined. Unfortunately the individuals who suffered in this way were misled by the then Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia, for they believed that he had made an application for flood relief from the Australian Government, whereas in fact he had not done so. This year these same individuals are faced with a drought. May, June and July were very wet months, but August turned out to be exceptionally dry in Western Australia. In wet years they were unable to do the correct amount of fallowing to enable them to have some insurance against any lean spring, and this year were faced with a particularly dry August, with some very heavy frosts. I understand that recently a notification was sent to the Government of Western Australia that, as the flooding had not been severe and widespread, or national in character, the Commonwealth, unfortunately, could not assist on the same basis as New South Wales was assisted last year. Honourable members will recall that I then spoke very forcefully in favour of paying £750,000 to the drought-stricken farmers of New South Wales. I did so because I had had the experience of living through a drought as well as a flood. I earnestly request the Government to reconsider the application of the Government of Western Australia, with a view to giving to those farmers who are situated in both the north and the south, including the electorate of the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon), some measure of assistance to compensate them for very serious flood years, which unfortunately were followed this year by drought conditions. Mr Hamilton. Before concluding, I want to deal' with defence. I have not heard any honourable member, while discussing' defence, make mention of the Indian Ocean, which laps the coast of Western Australia. British Navy, a portion of which would be devoted to the defence of the Indian Ocean. honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy) for his sincerity and earnestness in that regard. What we must bear in mind is that the trade route across the Indian Ocean is the life-line between Australia and Great Britain and Europe. It is the line which carries most of our communications, as well as most of our cargo and passenger traffic. If the people who live in countries bordering that ocean have no security, their plight will be serious should war break out. In Palestine the position is, to say the least, ticklish indeed. If honourable members will take their minds back to the position that existed after World WarI . , they will recall that there was then some strife in that part of the world, organized by the armaments king Zaharoff. There were similar happenings immediately after the cessation of hostilities recently. One of the root causes of the present trouble, as was the case after World WarI . , is the desire to control the oilfields in that area. The whole of the territory from the Gulf of Persia almost to the Caspian Sea is "" floating on a sea of o i l "" . Trouble has developed also in India. I recall very vividly people warning the British Government that if Britain withdrew from India one of the greatest bloodbaths in history would ensue. I have conversed with high military officials from India who have told me the same thing. That has now come to pass, and we do not know what will be the outcome. We also know that there is trouble immediately north of Australia, in Indonesia, and cannot say what will be the outcome of it. Not many years ago, when there were internal troubles in certain countries, an outsider'would take complete control with a view to restoring peace. Not very long ago we read of",35,Miscellaneous

134,Mr Hamilton,"I thank thethe uproar that was caused when Mr exclusively of the British race with Winston Churchill, at Milton in the United States of America, mentioned something about the "" iron curtain"". What he then forecast has since happened. As the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) remarked this afternoon, Russia is following the Czarist doctrine in relation to territorial expansion. It is well within the realm of possibility that at any moment Russia will extend its operations so as to embrace Palestine, Transjordan, Iran, Iraq and India. We must not lose sight of the fact that it could advance through China to Indonesia. At Yampi Sound, in Western Australia, there is at sight 100,000,000 tons of better than 90 per cent, iron ore. If the Russians were to move down to Indonesia a "" hop, step and jump "" would carry them to those iron ore deposits. Some persons will claim that nothing can be done with the ore because of the absence of power, which could not be generated because the coal supplies are not close enough. The nearest coal we know of is at Collie. But I direct the attention of honourable members to this statement, which appeared in the Daily News, Perth, on the 17th March lastMoscow radio reports that tests in using the force of the sea to produce electric power forces. I suggest to the Minister for have been successful at Leningrad. The apparatus consists of a generator in a drum anchored at sea. The drum, when the tide reaches a certain level, begins to rotate, setting a generator in motion. The radio claims that the invention can produce up to 1,100 kilowatts. At the spot to which I am referring, the tide rises and falls, at the very least, 27 feet. Honourable members can appreciate the inrush and outrush at the flow and ebb of that tide, and what electricity might be generated from it. By mean9 of the production of electricity, that 100,000,000 tons of ore at sight could be developed into very substantial armaments, because there are available all the other minerals that are required for the process of smelting. Geographically and climatically, Western Australia is suitably conditioned for some system of defence. I remind honourable members that the coastline of that State is longer than the eastern seaboard. The people who live in the State are the exception of the immigrants who have arrived in it since the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) has used Eremantle as a terminal port. The disadvantages to Western Australia are its size, its small population, and its industrial backwardness. These make it a very dangerously exposed portion of the continent. Anything that can be done in defence of this country in that State or in the Indian Ocean would materially assist Empire defence, because protection would be afforded to the whole of the Indian Ocean, as well as to South Africa, India, the Suez Canal zone and all the other adjacent territories in which Britain has interests. Unfortunately, there are no deep-sea harbours on the coast of Western Australia. But there is no reason why they cannot be provided. A t the moment, investigations are proceeding in the northern part of the State, with a view to establishing a deep-sea port. Albany has the greatest potential; as a naval seaport, it is equal to any other port in Australia. Admiral Eraser, who was in Australian waters during the war, was astonished when he found that there were no facilities at Albany which would enable him to operate from that port in conjunction with the American naval forces in the final destruction of the Japanese Defence that very serious consideration be given to the development of Albany as a naval dockyard and a defence post of the Western Australian seaboard. Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [5.42] I want to answer one or two of the points that have been raised by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton). The honourable member suggested that I had failed to recognize claims that had been made by ex-servicemen's organizations for an increase of the amount of loans for agricultural purposes permitted under the act. The maximum amount permissible is £1,000. I say, at once, that I always answer any correspondence that is addressed to me by ex-servicemen's organizations. I am sure that the honourable member cannot produce any letter on this subject that has",36,Miscellaneous

Letters have to be sent to me, or a deputation has to wait on me, if the matter is to be brought to my notice. No deputation has waited on me, and no letter has been sent to me to which there has not been a reply in writing. I challenge the honourable member to produce any letter, or to mention any deputation which has approached me and avers that I have not given an answer. This matter has been considered on a number of occasions. It was reviewed by Cabinet just before I went overseas, about six months ago. In the light of all the circumstances, Cabinet decided that no increase should be made of the £1,000 that is allowable under the scheme. 10,000 applications for it, and the total amount so far advanced to applicants under the scheme is £3,000,000. Yet the honourable .member for Maranoa( Mr to enable him to maintain a reasonable Adermann) says that it is useless! be effective. had to be taken into consideration in determining the maximum amount. In the first place, the amount of assistance which should be granted to individuals who desire to re-establish themselves on the land has to be considered in relation to the amount of assistance that is availsuffers from some form of war disability able to other ex-servicemen who want to cannot work like a fit man. establish themselves in business.

If a man suffers from a war the land is far greater than that which disability, the effect will be manifest in is available to any other group of indithe amount of work which he is able to do viduals who desire to re-establish themon his farm. If he cannot do enough to selves. There has to be a balance earn for himself a reasonable amount on between the assistance given to one section which to live, the Government will make of ex-servicemen and that given to other up the difference. However, in the light sections. It must also be recognized that of what the honourable member for Swan this is only one of two schemes. There has said, and what the honorahle member is, in addition, the general land settlefor Bendigo( Mr Rankin) has just interment scheme operated by the States as jected, I shall have another look at the agents for the Commonwealth, and a matter. At first sight, it seemed to me great deal of money will be expended on that the Government was doing a that scheme, also. The scheme under reasonable thing. which loans of £1,000 are made to settlers is merely ancillary to the main scheme, I did not mention It has, in fact, certain disadvantages. For example, ex-servicemen, having in mind the present high prices for produce, may be prepared to pay quite a large amount for land, perhaps more than they really should, when, for their own welfare, it might be better if they refrained from doing so. ""We have to examine applications very carefully. It is not desirable to advance amounts of more than £1,000 to applicants, when the probable effect would be to encourage men ' . to go on the land under conditions which would prevent them from making a success of the enterprise. The honourable member also objected to deductions being made in respect of war pensions from the living allowances paid to men who had received loans of £1,000. I point out that the allowances are made to men to enable them to live in a reasonable state of comfort while their farms are coming to production. It is right and just that the Government should take the view that, if a man's income from his farm is not sufficient standard of living, the Government should make up the difference. The amount paid for this purpose is not a wage, or a reward for the services which the man has rendered to the community. It is, in fact, a living allowance, so that the man and his family may live in a reasonable state of comfort until his farm comes into full production.",37,Miscellaneous

Moreover, I do not believe that the bank would pay over the money even if the Department of the Army tried, to make such an arrangement.

The honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) suggested that, seeing that Great Britain am prepared to proposed to reduce the number of naval units in commission, Australia should try to obtain some of thoseunits, particularly destroyers, on loan. We have at the moment five destroyers on loan from the Royal Navy, namely, Quadrant, Quality, Queensborongh, Quiberon and Quickmatch. The conditions of loan are similar to those which applied to the "" V "" and "" W "" class destroyers which came to the Royal Australian Navy after the 1914-18 war. If this country is to play its part in future Empire defence, it must develop its naval ship-building potential. _ The reasons for this are obvious. That is why we have already embarked urjon a programme of naval ship-building. One destroyer is in course of construction at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and another at Williamstown, while four' other destroyers are to be built. As for reserve training, for the moment all our resources must be concentrated on expanding and training a modern, seagoing force.

Many of those trained men are anxious to join the Fleet Air Arm, and I believe that we should give them the first opportunity to man Australian carriers.

As a matter of fact, I have not previously heard criticism of the type which he directed against the administration of that institution, but I shall have investigations made. Our great difficulty lies in getting sufficient staff. I believe that such difficulties as exist are due to staff shortages rather than to regimentation and red tape.

As these charges were made in relation to members of the delegation which attended the International Labour Conference at Geneva, the matter should have been discussed, not on the proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs, but on the proposed vote for Miscellaneous Services under the control of that department, namely, division 210. I regret that the honourable member for Warringah is not present in the chamber to hear my reply. In preferring his charges, the honourable member sought to",39,Miscellaneous

I took my wife with me when I visited Paris two years ago as a representative of the Government, but not one farthing of my wife's travelling expenses was borne by the taxpayers. The honourable member for ""Warringah then proceeded to make an attack upon Senator Amour, who also attended the International Labour Conference as a representative of the Government. I have no desire to discuss the pros and cons of that matter; I am sure that the honourable senator will answer it from his place in the Senate. The honourable member for Warringah said that the cost of Senator Amour's visit to Geneva amounted to £31,000. The truth of the matter is that that amount represented the total amount provided on the Estimates for the delegation, and not one member of it. The honourable member also made an unwarranted attack on Senator Amour because of some statement he is said to have made to a pressman in Eire. In reading the statement to the committee, he sought to convey the impression that Senator Amour had been ashamed of his good Australian name and, while in Eire, called himself Senator L'Amour. Although it was obvious that the mis-spelling of the honourable senator's name was a printer's error, the honourable member emphasized it in almost every sentence of his attack. He was followed by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who did likewise. People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. After all, the honourable member for Warringah was not able to vouch for the accuracy of the newspaper report. If we are to judge people by what is written about them in newspapers, I remind him that when he made a visit overseas not long ago-a t his own expense, it is true, and not at the expense of the Government-h e travelled on Orion and, according to reports, he and his wife were known on the vessel tenant-Colonel Percival Spender, KC., M.P., and Lady Spender. The honourable meraiber's attempt to .belittle Senator Amour because of a printer's error was in exceedingly bad taste. of the Government The honourable member for Reid confended that it was illegal for members of missions and delegations overseas, to accept travelling allowances. The honourable member even went so far as to say that such allowances were in the nature of a bribe and were corrupt and that, by accepting them, the honourable members concerned had forfeited their right to continue to sit in this Parliament and should resign. It i9 characteristic of him to make untrue charges against honourable members on this side of the chamber. Ever since he became a member of this Parliament, he has done nothing but level charges and conduct a continuous muck-raking campaign against the Government and its supporters. He knows very well that appropriations have been made every year for the past 26 or 27 years for meeting the expenses of representatives of the Government at International Labour Conferences. Provision is made for this purpose under division 210 of these Estimates. The honourable member also said that the allowance paid to members of delegations representing Australia overseas amounted to approximately fifteen dollars a day. When I interjected that that statement was untrue, the honourable member for Reid said, "" I shall have an opportunity to state whether or not it is true "". I repeat that the statement is absolutely .untrue. While I was abroad I was paid an allowance in Australian currency of 30s. a day on land and 10s. a day at sea, a considerably smaller amount than that mentioned by the honourable member for Reid. Several honourable members thought they had discovered a mare's nest when they asked questions relating to the total expenses paid by the Government in respect of overseas missions. Replying to a question by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton), the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) stated that the total amount paid in respect of the three representatives as Lieuto the International Labour Conference, Senator J. M . Fraser, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and myself, amounted to £8,899. I have taken the trouble.to ascertain the actual cost of my own trip abroad. It was £937. These figures demonstrate the falsity of the charges made by the honourable member for Reid. The honourable member for Reid also alleged that government representatives on overseas conferences were selected by the Labour party as a reward for their services to the Prime Minister and to the Cabinet. He knows as well as I do that such representatives are selected by an absolute majority of the party. In 1925 I attended the International Labour Conference in Geneva when it was governed by the League of Nations. In my report I pointed out to the Bruce Page Government that in my opinion the conference was of paramount importance to the people, particularly the workers, of Australia. I made certain recommendations, some of which I am pleased to know have since been carried out. I sincerely hope that the Government will continue to be represented at the International Labour Conference, because during its deliberations matters of great importance to the Australian people are discussed. I felt compelled to say what I have said because of the charges made, particularly by the honourable member for Warringah and the honourable member for Reid. to refer to certain items appearing in the Estimates under the heading "" Miscellaneous Services "". The first is that which provides for the cost of conducting elections for various primary producers' boards. I understand that at least two more boards are in prospect. Those boards are being progressively established by statute in circumstances purporting politically to give primary producers control over the industries in which they are engaged, but, in fact, the boards are explicitly designed to do the very reverse and remove from the primary producers any authority over their own industries and to centralize all authority over those industries in the hands of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr issues. That is to be capped by the bankPollard). The Australian Wheat Board, we were told, as an election bait, was to be reconstituted and that a majority of its members would be primary producers' representatives chosen by themselves. That promise was carried out. concerned with primary production was so constituted, but the very act that gave effect to that promise stripped that board of every vestige of authority and placed all authority over the operations of the wheat industry-the area that could be sown, who might sow wheat, where wheat could be sold, who should sell it, to whom and at what price, and every other aspect of the industry-in the hands of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, who sits as a dictator over the Australian Wheat Board. Exactly the same process has been followed in respect of the meat industry. The Australian Meat Board includes representatives of the producers, but again the act provides that the chairman shall be appointed hy the Minister. The chairman has the right of veto of any decision of the majority of the board, and sitting above him is the Minister, who can negative any decision of the board, and can give to it any direction he likes. Exactly the same pattern has been followed in the establishment of the Australian Apple and Pear Marketing Board. We shall soon have before us for consideration the establishment of a dairy produce export control board, and again exactly the same pattern is to be followed. We have been warned of an egg board, which no doubt^ will reveal the same dominating figure of the Minister removing every vestige of freedom from the primary producers. The' same kind of authority is established in respect of the Australian Wool Board. So we have unfolding a progressive plan to place under the control of one man, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture of the day, not only the ultimate destiny of every producer, but also his day-by-day activities and his year-by-year financial returns. Lest anything should escape through that net, there are the other complementary provisions ensuring that the Treasurer shall exercise a similar arbitrary control over land sales and capital ing legislation. It is completely at variance with the desires of the Australian primary producers that there should he this constantly growing aggregation of authority in the hands of two Ministers. This is almost an exact copy For the first time, a board of the plan that was followed by Mussolini. That statement is not to be laughed at. It is almost exactly the same as",40,Advance To The Treasurer
157,Mr Mcewen (Indi) [8.16],"I desirehi9 plan, except that he finally took all the portfolios himself. All authority over the industrial activities of the Italian people was placed in the hands of one man, Mussolini. That was the ultimate step in the establishment of the dictatorship in Italy. It is well that this country should be warned. ""We are not discussing some figment of the imagination in warning this country that the Government is following the traditional path of dictators. It is already well on the path. It only requires the passing of the referendum on prices control to put on the coping stone. Having made that protest, I pass to another item under the same heading, [t is in the Estimates only because of the very circumstances that I have related. I refer to the item of £2,000,000 to be provided by the Australian taxpayers on account of the wheat agreement with New Zealand last year. That agreement, which, of course, was achieved in most regrettable circumstances in this Parliament of barefaced lying, suppression of the facts by the Ministers concerned, evasion and equivocation and brazen and shameless deception. That was shown by our statement of the facts. Those are not exaggerated statements. They are completely justifiable comments upon an astonishing business transaction, the contractual sale to New Zealand of 18,000,000 bushels of Australian wheat at the ceiling price of 5s. 9d. a bushel in circumstances in which the price has gradually risen until the export parity of wheat is known to be 17s. a bushel. The provision of £2,000,000 in these Estimates for that purpose is inadequate because the contract, as we are told, provides for the sale of wheat to New Zealand at 5s. 9d. a bushel. The contract provided that last year we should sell to New Zealand 4,500,000 bushels out of the total provision of 18,000,000 bushels. It seems likely that New Zealand will again be supplied with another 4,500,000 bushels this year at 5s. 9d. a bushel from the same silos as those from which wheat is being sold to the United Kingdom at 17s. a bushel. The discrepancy is l is . 3d. a bushel. A simple calculation shows that to make up to the Australian Wheat Board the deficiency on that quantity of wheat, the sum of £2,531,262 will be required. So, the Estimates understate the commitment of the Government to the extent of more than £500.000. That is not the end of the story, because we have read that the Government of the United Kingdom is desirous of entering a long-tenn agreement for the purchase of Australian wheat. On what terms are we to sell wheat to the United Kingdom? Isi t to be recorded in the annals of this country that we sell wheat to New Zealand for 5s. 9d. a bushel and to the United Kingdom from the same silos at 17s. a bushel? Is that the intention? If it is, why can we not be told? If it is not, what does the Government propose to do ? I know what it ought to do. The first step it should take is to consult the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board upon the terms that should be arranged for such a sale. I asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture .the following question a few weeks ago:In view of the suggestion that the Commonwealth Government may enter into a contract, perhaps a long-term contract, for the sale of wheat to the United Kingdom, w ill the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture give an undertaking that no commitments for the sale of wheat, which represents the livelihood of our whent-growers, w ill be made without first securing the fullest advice of the Australian Wheat Board on all aspects of the proposal, as the sale of substantial parcels of wheat without the f u l l knowledge and advice of the board would represent a complete negation of the purposes for which it was established and render utterly valueless the placing of a majority of growers on the board? That was a simple, straightforward and reasonable query to put to the Minister. The answer I received wasThe submission made by the honourable member w ill be given consideration. If the Minister is prepared to consult the board on this issue, why does he not say so? I did not ask him to act on the advice of the board, although I think he ought to. My question merely asked him whether he would consult the board. If he is not prepared to say, "" Yes, I will consult the board "", the only reasonable inference I feel justified in drawing is that he intends to follow the course his predecessor followed when the negotiations were in train for the sale of wheat to New Zealand, and absolutely ignore the existence of the board, and negative any value it may possess. If that is the course he proposes .to take, I cannot voice it clear that I do not agree with it, but my protest with sufficient emphasis. The wheat-farmers of this country will not tolerate the sale of their wheat behind the backs of their elected representatives. able value, and Australian wheat-growers If, however, it is his intention to consult bear the loss. WhatI do not believe the board, or if he has consulted it, it is time that he told the Parliament that lie will consult or has consulted it. That which did not involve the growers in any would be the end of the matter. I should then feel that our fight over the New Zealand agreement had borne fruit in respect to future contracts. implications could be more serious if tlie wheat requirements of the United Kingdom were sold to it at rates substantially below the reasonable value of the wheat, if the wheat-growers were to carry the loss, and if the Governrequires some explanation. In the very ment were not to follow the course which it followed in an announcement immediately before the elections in respect of the' wheat agreement with New Zealand. I do not know whether I am entitled to interpret anything from the gestures of the Minister, and I do not desire to intertralian Wheat Board before he enters into pret him wrongly, but he seems to believe that there is some inference to be drawn from my inquiry as to whether the wheat growers will be called upon to carry the burden. able member knows all about it. able member has some inside information. Minister, but not because his interjection affects me. I could obtain inside information only by approaching some one on the board or in the department. I give to honourable members and the Minister my word that I have no inside information whatever. My original question was founded upon a news item which appeared in the daily press on the day I asked the question. If I interpreted the Minister correctly a few minutes ago, as thinking that it was an improper or unjustifiable suggestion that wheat-growers might be asked to bear whatever loss is involved by selling wheat to the United Kingdom at a price lower than that which might otherwise be realized, let me raise this point with him. For such a sale there could possibly be an economic and political justification. I hasten to make arguments could conceivably be advanced as to why wheat should be sold to the United Kingdom for less than its realizcould be justified would be the sale of wheat to New Zealand in circumstance* loss, because the contract happened to be revealed immediately before the elections. But a similar agreement, made with the The United Kingdom, in the safety of post-election days, follows different principles. If a contract is made before an election the Government bears the loss; but if a contract is made after the election the growers carry the burden. That limited period which honourable members are allowed for this discussion, I do not propose to exhaust all the time which is available to me, but I feel that I am entitled to ask the Minister to state whether he will fully consult the Ausany more contracts for sales of wheat overseas. I ask him also to state whether he will apply the same principle of consultation to other primary production boards when any overseas contracts may be in prospect. I have referred to the item of £2,000,000 in respect of the New Zealand wheat agreement. On the figures which I have quoted, I have not the slightest doubt that next year's budget will reveal that the obligation exceeded £2,500,000, which will be provided by the taxpayers of Australia as a gesture of our bounty to the Government of New Zealand. I shall now draw some comparisons. The soya bean is one of the greatest food and industrial crops in the world. In this respect, it is comparable with wheat. For some reason or other, we in Australia have never succeeded in establishing the soya bean industry on a commercial basis. Our purchases of soya beans are made in the dollar area. But these estimates provide only £200 for investigations of the soya 'bean industry in this country. Again, the artificial insemination of cattle is a recent innovation which could have far-reaching and revolutionary consequences to our livestock industry. For investigations of this technique only £100 is provided on",42,Advance To The Treasurer

In addition, a mere £10,000 will be paid to the States to assist for Commerce and Agriculture) [8.40]. them ^ in scientific investigation of, and experimentation with, tobacco-growing. Tobacco is another normal agricultural crop. We have not been able to produce nearly enough tobacco to meet Australian requirements, but I am convinced that, with adequate investigation and experimentation, we could solve our problems in this industry. Our purchases of tobacco from the dollar area cost millions of pounds a year. This considerable expenditure could be avoided by the adequate production, of this crop in Australia. Yet an amount of only £10,000 is provided for investigation. This sum would be sufficient to pay the annual salaries af only a dozen men. That is the relative .valuation which the Department of Commerce and Agriculture places on these problems which await solution. How could one expend £100 a year on an investigation of the technique of the artificial insemination of cattle? This amount is hardly the salary of an office boy. And what can be done with £200 for the soya bean industry ? I should like some honourable member who is wiser than I am to explain these riddles. I do not pretend to understand them. industry necessary when the Menzies Goof his fix by saying, "" Under emergency vernment, of which the honourable member war-time conditions"", but the fact was for Indi was a member, was in office? but Australia then did not have the same accuses me of occupying, and, as I admit, dollar problem that it has now.

In conclusion, to my mind. What else did the MenziesI request the Minister to make a clear Government do?

He then proceeded to point out that legislation provides for the Minister to sit as a dictator over the operations of other primary production boards. What the honourable member failed to tell the chamber is that, in respect of every semi governmental instrumentality and in particularthose organizations dealing with primary products, the Government of which he was a member either made exactly the same provision, which had the same ultimate effect, or perpetuated authorities which were in existence when that Government came into office. I shall prove the truth of that assertion. When the Curtin Government came into office, it found that a national security regulation, gazetted by the Menzies Government, provided for the handling of the Australian wheat crop. time conditions. that the Menzies Government placed veto the decisions of any of those authorime to cite instances, the Australian Wine duction.

Opposition members interjecting, the Opposition cease interjecting and refrain from indicating their discomfiture when confronted with the facts, I shall proceed with my speech. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Mulcahy) -Order! The Chair will prevent further interjections. that the Menzies Government, in which the honourable member for Indi was a Minister, certainly did include in the agreement a clause providing for a review of wool prices. The agreement was for the duration of the war, but the Menzies Government allowed a year to elapse and did not ask for a review. When the Curtin Government came into office, it succeeded in obtaining an increased price for Australian wool growers. Let me return to this so-called autocratic, dictatorial power which resides, through me, in this Government. Under regulations gazetted by the Menzies Government, exactly the same power operated. On the Australian Wheat Board, which the Menzies Government appointed to handle Australian wheat, the representatives of the growers were in a substantial minority. The representatives of merchants and the flour milling industry dominated the board. It is true that the final authority resides in the Australian Government. The honourable member for Indi is completely confused in his thinking. He asked me whether I would give an undertaking to consult the Australian Wheat Board in regard to the possibility of long-term contracts with the United Kingdom Government. At this stage I do not intend to tell him whether I have done so or not. The honourable gentleman considers that I should not only consult the board, but that I should also accept its advice. In other words, he desires the Australian Government entirely to abrogate the powers vested in it under the Constitution. He considers that its powers should be handed over to the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Wine Board, the Australian Dairy Produce Export Control Board, and other control boards that have been, or may be, constituted. If the Government did so, it would be throwing away the birth right of the Australian people. The view of this Government is that the boards that may be established must be answerable finally to the Executive. If the Australian Wheat Board, for example, had complete authority in itself it could sell Australia's wheat to any foreign government, or to the British Government, or to any other authority for any price that it chose to fix, and the executive government would have no say in the matter. This Government does not intend to divest itself of its responsibility' to the Australian people. Under the Commonwealth Constitution, the Australian Government has power over trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. Any government which threw aside that authority, or delegated it to some subsidiary body, would be guilty of a serious breach of trust. In the coming year the Australian Wheat Board will be required to handle a crop valued at probably £100,000,000. In respect of that vast sum, it will be responsible to the Australian Government, and if this Government were to seek to divest itself of its responsibility in this connection, it would be false to the trust which the Australian people has put in it. The Government, therefore, makes no apology for retaining final power in its own hands. It is so much humbug for the honourable member for Indi to talk about dictatorships and the like. There has never been an Australian government, tory or otherwise, which has not exercised the power that this Government is exercising. It would be entirely undemocratic for the Government to abrogate its powers and vest them in some entirely semi-governmental body not responsible to the Parliament or the people. That would not be a fit and proper action for a democratic government to take. The honourable member for Indi said that I should accept the advice of the Australian Wheat Board. That would mean, in effect, that I should give the board a blank cheque. I am not",45,Advance To The Treasurer

It will the Council for Scientific and Industrial be seen, therefore, that the Australian Government is alive to the possibilities of establishing this industry in Australia. A vital fact which should not be overlooked, however, is that the development of the industry, the determination of suitable areas for the growing of soya beans, and the encouragement of people to embark ""upon the enterprise are matters almost exclusively for the State governments. The State departments of agriculture are staffed by highly equipped technical and practical officers, many of whom hold a science degree in agriculture. In these circumstances it is unjust to -charge the Australian Government with inactivity. This Government could not do more than it is doing to develop the industry without substantially increasing the personnel of its appropriate departments, and honourable gentlemen opposite are always ready enough to utter criticism about the growth of the public service. The matter in fact is one for attention by the State governments. Those matters -must he taken into consideration. The soya bean industry may have very bright prospects in Australia. It is a very great industry in the United States of America. From memory, I should say that the area under cultivation in that country is 13,000,000 acres. The greater portion of the oil extracted from the soya bean in the United States of America is used for shortening purposes. The demand for shortening is not so great in Australia as in the United States of America. The shortening products used .by the Australian housewife are derived mainly from the beef industry. Therefore, there is not the same call in this country as The Government financed there is in the United States of America for shortening products from the soya bean. The honorahle member for Indi has directed some criticism against what he has described as inadequate provision in the Estimates for artificial insemination. All that I have to say to him on that subject i9 that at one stage it was suggested that the Commonwealth should Those gentlemen were engage extensively in that particular work. I ruled, and I had the backing of the Government, that on the scientific side the Commonwealth had done a good job in connection with the work through Research; that on the practical side, everybody should know that the State departments of agriculture have a large number of veterinary officers, to whose particular functions that class of work is related; and that it was for the States to get busy on this work for the improvement of the Australian dairying and other industries. I admit that there may be some scope in the future for the Commonwealth to give financial assistance, hut I am opposed to its engaging in the work directly with its own officers. I trust that the people of Australia will pay heed to the advocacy of the honourable member for Indi in respect of the appointment of authorities not responsible to the people with power which the framers of the Constitution determined should reside in the executive government and should not he delegated to any other body.

As he is aware, a government-controlled airline was established first in Great Britain. The British example was quickly followed by Canada, and later a government-owned service was established in Australia which has been a credit to its organizers and has played a valuable contribution to aviation in this country. able member to discuss the proposed votes before the committee. and operated by the Commonwealth provide an excellent service. Those who travel across the continent on the Trans-Australian Railway regard the service as unsurpassed in this country. Indeed, I have frequently been told that it is equal to any similar service in the world. For many years the men employed on the railway line which stretches across the great interior of the continent lived under conditions which were far from satisfactory. In my most recent trip on the Trans-Australian RailwayI found that excellent amenities are being provided for those who service the line and the crews who operate the trains. Very fine homes are now being built for them. I have every reason to believe that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) has been mainly responsible for these improvements. Long before any improvements had been effected his voice was raised constantly in this chamber asking that better amenities be provided. It is to the great credit of the honourable gentleman that when he took office as Minister for the Interior he immediately began to provide improved amenities for these people. There is one further improvement which may not be immediately practicable but to which consideration might be given. I refer to the desirability of abolishing class distinctions on our railway services generally. First and second class travel is completely inappropriate in a country like Australia. As a student of Henry Lawson, I feel sure that the Minister will recall that this great Australian in a poem written many years ago expressed the fervent hope that in the world to come there will be no notices erected reading "" Second class wait here "". Whilst it may not be possible to provide one-class travel on the Trans-Australian line immediately, the policy pursued by the Minister gives me reason to hope that at the appropriate time he will introduce such a reform. The Postmaster-General's Department renders extremely valuable service to the public, but due to shortages of various kinds it is unable to cope with many of the demands made upon it, particularly for improved telephone services. Another urgent need is the provision of new post offices and allied facilities. In Western Australia, and I presume in other States throughout the Commonwealth, the conditions under which the postal staffs live and work are, in many instances, far from ideal. I trust that the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) will be able to provide better amenities for them in the near future. In a survey of the conditions under which these employees work I found that even in heavily populated centres staff amenities were very crude indeed. Postal officials are very loyal and hard working members of the Public Service and the Government should provide adequate amenities for them as soon as it is possible to do so. The Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Perth has informed me that telephone installations are held up principally because of the shortage of switch equipment, which is imported, and not hecause of a production lag in Australia. I trust that the Government will provide improved telephone facilities as rapidly as possible. Finally, there is an urgent need for the building of new post offices throughout Australia. I do not urge that post offices should take precedence over houses but I ask that as soon as the housing lag is overcome the rebuilding programme of the department be proceeded with as rapidly as possible. I , and one of my colleagues in the Senate, have been pressing for some time for the construction of a new post office at Inglewood. We hope that the new building wall be provided at an early date. I rose principally to pay a tribute to the Minister for the Interior for the excellent work he has -rendered in providing improved amenities and better housing facilities for the staff",52,Department An Airline And While We Cannot Get A

230,Mr Burke,"The railways ownedof the Commonwealth Railways and to urge that postal services of all kinds be improved as soon as practicable. I am glad that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnston) is present in tbe chamber because there is a matter upon which I should like some advice from the honourable gentleman. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to make his department responsible for the construction of new post offices. The Estimates include an item concerning the renting of buildings does the honourable member refer? item covering' the repair and rental of buildings. I should like the Minister to explain why the Department of the Interior constructs buildings on behalf of the Postmaster-General's Department. I am at a loss to understand why the Postmaster-General's Depaa-tment, which is a separate undertaking, does not construct the buildings for which it is responsible. practice for new buildings to be constructed by the Department of the Interior. orable member is dealing with a matter' which .may be' discussed only when the WorksEstimates are before the committee. would get better service from the Postmaster-General's Department if it constructed its own buildings. I have no man, but I am in a difficulty because of this conflict between the two departments. AVork in many of our post, offices is detrimentally affected because of the lack of room for the staff. Provision is made in the estimates of thePostmasterGeneral's Department for rent and repairs to buildings but that department has to wait for the inspectors of the Department of the Interior to authorize new constructions, notwithstanding that the work may have been classified as urgent by the Department. An explanation of the reason for this might be made either by the. Minister for the Interior or the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. I am greatly interested to know why the present policy is pursued. I notice that the Estimates provide for the expenditure of the following amounts in the various States on inland mail services, excluding railway services:-Ne w South Wales, £510,000; Victoria, £241,500; Queensland, £262,500; South Australia, £70,500-; Western Australia, £65,050, and Tasmania, £60,340. Victoria is only one-third the size of my electorate, and Queensland does not appear to be equitably treated in the proposed allocations, in view of the enormous distances that have to be travelled. There have been many increased mail services in variousparts of my electorate, and, I presume, in other electorates, but there are many places still not served with mail deliveries. We realize that mail services to those places would not pay, but the Postmaster-General's Department is expected to provide them with a. service without expecting a full return. The settlers outback may not compensate the department directly for mail services, but they pay in other ways, by producing the wool, wheat and other primary products that create our national income.. The sparsely settled districts in the inland demand a far more liberal service and far more sympathetic consideration from the Postmaster-General. I am not speaking in. a condemnatory way, for I am grateful for the excellent services that the department gives. I . agree with what: the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) said about airmail services. Perhaps the Postmaster-General's Department will be able to subsidize the Flying Doctor service so. that it may deliver mail along the routes of the service. Every flying route ought to be exploited in order to give a better service to the people in the inland. support the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) in complimenting the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) and his department for the three-to-five-year programme in which they expect to Postmaster-General's spend £30,000,000 in extending postal and allied services throughout the Commonwealth.

238,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [9.4s]',"1raw materials, and it may Tie seven years before tbe programme can be completed. I gather from the annual report of the Postmaster-General's Department that there has been a tremendous demand for mail services, telephone services and other associated services throughout the Commonwealth. Between June, 1939/ and June, 1947, there was a 40.51 per cent, increase of ' telephone installations in capital cities and a 30.6 per cent, increase in country districts. In spite of .those great increases, there are 107,472 applications for telephones still outstanding. Over the last five years 74,202 new telephones have been installed every year in the Commonwealth. That is an outstanding performance, considering that for most of that time we were at war and the manufacture of telephone equipment for civil use was difficult. On page 159 of the Estimates provision is made for the expenditure in Tasmania of £71,S81 more than last year for stores and material, £18,348 more for mail services and .£26,010 more for -engineering services other than new works, a total of £116,239, which is indeed -a commendable aim. We appreciate those plans for extension of postal and telephonic facilities in Tasmania. In the last two years various aspects of telephone services affecting country residents have been reviewed and more generous conditions introduced. Conditions under which exchange services are provided were liberalized in October, 1945, to provide that where the department has no existing construction along a -public road in the direction of the applicant's home and where only one exchange service is concerned, the department will erect at its own cost a new pole line for a distance of 60 chains. Up to £100 will be spent for the service where a departmental line is already available for all or part of the distance and more than one exchange service is required. Before October, 1945, the department allowed only £50 to be spent on the provision of such a service. The amount now is exactly double. twice as good a service. longer line can be erected. case. The cost of raw materials and wages has risen. greater distance from the exchange and have to lease long lines, substantial reductions were made from the 1st January, 1946, of the extra mileage charges that are applied to the departmental section of lines extending beyond two miles radially from the relevant exchanges. Originally the rate in rural areas was 7s. 6d. a quarter mile a year for the section of the departmental line extending beyond the two-mile boundary. The rate for each quarter-mile has been reduced to 6s. 3d. for any section between two and three miles from the exchange, to 5s. for any section between three and four miles from the exchange, to 3s. 9d. for any section between four and five miles from the exchange and 2s. 6d. for any section beyond five miles. In November, 1946, with the object of extending such facilities to rural centres under the most favorable terms practicable, the Department extended the trunk-line .service to new localities wholly at its expense, except where the cost is out of all proportion to the probable revenue. People affected by the exception are asked to co-operate in the construction of the line so that the capital expenditure to be borne by the department shall be reduced. There are many localities of that character in Tasmania and I daresay that there are a great number more in the larger States. Near the town of Cressy, in my electorate, there is a group of four farmers who will be placed at a disadvantage by that provision. They will be required to provide between £200 and £300 if they are to have the telephone installed in their homes, which are beyond the 5 miles 18 chains limit laid down by the department. I think tlie Postmaster-General might well re-examine that provision, for many farmers a long way from exchanges will be penalized if it is not modified, as I think it could be in view of the credit balance in the accounts of the department. The farmers whom I have paroutlay required by the department and have turned down the proposal. There must be many others like them, but not",54,Department An Airline And While We Cannot Get A

242,Mr Duthie,"Wher e people live asufficient to involve the department in undue expenditure. The department has determined that the daily period of service available at telephone exchanges shall be increased at more than 2,000 exchanges. I have been told in a letter from the department that the automatic exchange system in country districts is being extended, and that 500 automatic exchanges will be established in isolated areas. In that rethe 30th June last, 976 subscriber lines gard I have received great assistance in the Wilmot electorate from the Postmaster-iGeneral. Three automatic exchanges have been promised for isolated areas in my electorate and I am sure that others will he forthcoming as the occasion arises. Since the end of the war, the department has installed more than 500 additional trunk lines and plans are being carried out for the provision of a further 2,000 channels, the majority of which will serve rural areas. I again thank the department for its help in Wilmot. Other lines have been promised from small country towns in Tasmania to Hobart or Launceston. They will greatly relieve the pressure on existing lines. In addition, experiments are proceeding with a view to determining the extent to which radio-telephone facilities can be provided in remote localities where, on account of cost, it is impracticable to provide the ordinary land-line facilities. To illustrate how this would work out, a base transmitting and receiving station would be established at a suitable centre connecting to the main trunk system. Trans-receivers would be installed in subscribers' premises within a range of approximately 200 miles at places not connected by land-line with the trunk line network. Through these facilities the public would be provided with access to the whole telephone system of the Commonwealth. I commend the department for such a progressive plan and the installation of radio telephone facilities. made strenuous efforts to obtain equipment, particularly magnetic telephones, wires and insulators, and I believe that the Postmaster-General speaks sincerely when he consistently explains that the shortage of these requirements presents General's Department for the current Sir. Duthie. very great difficulties. The Postmaster General informed me that the output from the department's workshops has increased, and imports from the United States of America have been accelerated. In spite of these difficulties, and this is important as revealing the grand work that the department is doing, it has installed in the country districts of Tasmania during the twelve 'months ended and 1,275 telephone instruments compared with 710 subscriber lines and 907 telephones in the year 1938-39. This increase was achieved despite the serious shortage of materials last year. Of course, materials were not in short supply in 1938-39. The Non-official Postmasters Association has succeeded in obtaining for its 7,000 members throughout Australia an increase of remuneration amounting to £250,000 a year. overdue. subject last year when we were considering the Estimates. Many honourable members opposite know that non-official postmasters in their electorates are rendering a splendid service to farmers and others residing in isolated areas. The amount of the increase is from £13 to £22 a year. In terms of money, that is not large, but, at least, it is an advance. Here, I desire to pay a tribute to the Postmaster-General for his progressive policy, which he has impressed upon his officers in the capital cities. I also compliment postmasters and their staffs who, during the war, performed as fine a service as any section of the Public Service. All kinds of jobs were loaded on to them, and they did their work cheerfully and courteously, and showed every consideration to customers. I am indeed proud of the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, and I wish the Postmaster-General himself every success with his plans for the The department has future.

It is difficult for us to consider thefinancesof the department, particularly when it is making extraordinary profits, without the assistance of this document. If , next year, we are obliged to base our calculations on the report for 1945-46, we shall conclude that more than printing difficulties are to blame. The Minister will have to give a better explanation than that. The Auditor General has to examine these reports, and, as I stated, they could be laid upon the table or placed in the custody of the Clerk of the House, who could make them available to all honourable members interested. In that way, we could carefully scrutinize revenue and expenditure.

Could inquiries be made as to -whether Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited could manufacture this equipment ? General's Department in Melbourne produces a considerable amount of the equipment required for a telephone exchange. I wish to pay tribute to the fine work which was done in South Australia by Mr J. Adainson, who was transferred some time ago from Queensland to South Australia. It waswith very deep regret that I learned of his death through illness, and on behalf of the South Australian representatives in this Parliament [ extend deep sympathy to his bereaved family. I pay tribute to the excellent work that is being done by non-official postmasters throughout the country and I hope that this service also will be extended. I trust that some of the accumulated surpluses being heldby the Postmaster-General's Department will be used for the purchase of post office sites in areas which are rapidly becoming more thickly settled. I have in mind certain localities in my own electorate where big housing schemes are in process of completion by the South Australian Housing Trust and the War Service Homes Department. The Postmaster-General's Department should take care to acquire suitable sites for post offices in these areas, so that, when housing needs are being more adequately met new post offices may he builk [10.20] I join issue with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) concerning the condition of Commonwealth railways'. The honourable gentleman saw fit to eulogize the authorities, but it is plain t'o me that he cannot have travelled on any Commonwealth .railways other than the Trans-Australian line. The fact is, of course, that practically all the fund's available for' expenditure On Commonwealth, railways have been devoted to the improvementof the railway from Port Augusta, to ""Kalgoorlie'. This 'has meant that no funds have been available to improve the Quom to Alice Springs line or the line that runs 320 miles south from Darwin. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner has apparently devoted all his attention to providing a Luxury line from Perth to Adelaidei n order to make Postmastera good impression on overseas visitors and members of parliament who use the railway. There was something "" fishy "" about the way the accounts were stated in connection with work done on that line ten years or so ago. If the charges have been. properly allocated I am informed that the job would have cost about £70 a sleeper. To put the matter briefly, money Was filched from' other Commonwealth raihvay lines in order to make easy travelling possible for the plutocrats who use the Trans-Australian line. We all know that there was practically a revolt among' senior officers of the Commonwealth railway service about ten years ago over the signing of railway accounts. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner demanded that certain accounts should be signed, and the officers concerned took objection to his' orders. The result was that subsequently many of those officers' were "" crucified"",. and pushed off to less attractive positions: Nationalist government was' in office. : about that point. I consider that the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) should take final responsibility for the management of Commonwealth railways and that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner should be divested of the plenary powers, which he at present possesses. The old saying that Minister's come and. Ministers go but permanent administration goes on, is,, to my way of thinking,, no reason for vesting plenary powers in the Commonwealth Railway* Commissioner.. Ministers, should accept the full responsibility of their office, and they should be responsibletothe* Parlia^ ment for theiradministration.

I come now to the estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department, with particular reference to the provision of telephone facilities in outlying areas. For this matter. I am enclosing herewith a reply many years, I have been trying to persuade the department to tap the copper overland telegraph line from Darwin to Alice Springs, so as to assist small pastoralists in North Australia. I have in mind particularly a man who is 30 miles south of Tennant Creek. His name is Fred Harris. He was a lineman in the employ of the department, which he left to take up a small cattle property about five miles off the overland telegraph line. ordinary or urgent rate. For instance, I ana He has three children, one of whom is studying for the intermediate certificate at the High School at Alice Springs, and the youngest of whom is only twelve months old. He has guaranteed that he would provide the necessary poles, and do all the labouring work. The departmental inspectors apparently try to make good fellows of themselves by keeping down expenditure although the department is making a profit of £3,000,000 s year. The wife of this man is fretting because, during the absences of her husband on the cattle station, she has no means of obtaining medical assistance in the event of illness. Being a cattle dealer, people wish to contact him in connection with sales. wireless ? gist who wants to run a telephone line for a distance of 30 miles to facilitate his work, can secure one. The technical objection is raised that the tapping of the copper wire .would interfere with the service. I contest that. I am amazed that the Postmaster-General should act on the reports of inspectors who are merely making good fellows of themselves. I urge him to accede to any legitimate request by a pioneer. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has mentioned the pedal wireless. I have received this letter from a man about 600 miles north-west of Alice Springs, in one of the most areas of the Northern TerritoryA matter which I would like you to investigate is that of charges for telegrams to and from pedal radio stations. When Mr A. G. Cameron was representing you I wrote him on this subject, and he had some communication with the Postmaster-General on to Mr Cameron from the Postmaster-General. As you know, the charge is 2e. for every telegram of sixteen words or less, and l i d . for every word over sixteen. These telegraphic charges I find, are generally to many people who have pedal radios, a heavy item of expenditure. In my own case I find this to be so. A t times, in these isolated areas, one has to do a considerable amount of business by telegram. I understand all telegrams to and from pedal radio stations go at urgent rates. However, I think one should be given the option of sending the telegram either connected with the Alice Springs Flying Doctor Base, and if I transmit a telegram to the operator there, addressed to a person in the town, the post office merely date stamps the form and either delivers or places the telegram in a post office box. There is no use of post office telegraphic equipment for such a telegram. For sixteen words this telegram costs 2s. and if over, l i d . for each additional word. I know tlie Flying Doctor service gets a certain amount for each telegram, which I do not begrudge them, but 1 think the Government could easily lower its share. Private individuals have to pay up to £200 to install a "" Transceiver"" radio, and the high cost of the telegrams is a very real item in their expenditure. If mail services were more frequent there wouldn't be such need to resort to telegrams, but in our case here, as in many other parts of tlie Northern Territory, our mail is a fortnightly service. I hope you w ill make some inquiries into this matter. I would be particularly interested to know what amount the Flying Doctor Service receives for each inward and outward telegram. I do not expect the Postmaster-General to realize what vast distances there are in the Northern Territory. On that point, the Minister for the Interior is competent to advise him. member made any representations to the Postmaster-General? have said, and I repeat, that he is dominated by the inspectors. For thirteen years, my efforts to have something done have been frustrated by those officers.

IThe honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adenmann) has argued that the provision of post office buildings should be -the responsibility of the Postmaster General's Department. In Darwin, they are the responsibility of the Department of Works and Housing. A t one time, they were provided by the Department of the Interior. I have received this 'letter in connection with the reconstruction of the Darwin post office, from a young man who wishes to have his identity remain (unknown Mr Wccdon, a former builder and contractor, offered to do tbe conversion in six weeks at a maximum cost of £3,000.

Various estimates by competent private contractors in private conversation figure £15,000 that a considerable proportion of the emas the lowest possible amount at which it could have been done.

I had agitated for the provision of those amenities long before I expected to enter this Parliament. I do not know of any other group of workers in Australia who had to live under such disgraceful conditions for so long a time as had the Commonwealth -railways employees on the Trans-Australian line. Previous governments had made no .attempt to improve conditions. This was done only with the advent of a comparable with those in any other part of Australia. Work has so f a r progressed ployees are now comfortably housed, and have refrigerators in their homes. The train from Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta is recognized as probably the best in Australia. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) complained of travelling conditions between Quorn and Alice Springs. There is some have already instructed the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner to investigate conditions in the hope that the service w ill be brought into line with that between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta. The honourable member also complained of the condition of the track, and I agree .that the track is not as we should like it to be. During the war, the railway from Quorn to Alice Springs was called upon to render very heavy service. Because of the shortage of labour and materials, it has not been possible to repair the track properly. However, through the good offices of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), it has been arranged to bring out 500 men to work on Commonwealth railways, and it ( Mr is hoped that before long conditions will to ensure that private conbe greatly improved.

The people of Alice Springs cannot be expected to tolerate the reference to country telephone services. presence of the yards so close to the town, but I remind honourable members that all these big undertakings cannot be put in hand at once, having regard for the shorcountry telephone services and to tage of labour, and the urgency of other work. However, I assure the honourable member that the yards will be removed. I regret that the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) is not present to answer the criticism of the honourable member for the Northern Territory regarding the works programme at Darwin. I am sure that he could have answered it most effectively. Honourable members should realize that the rebuilding of Darwin is a colossal task. Because of Darwin's geographical position we have been faced, not only with all the ordinary problems arising out of the shortage of labour and materials, but also with particular problems caused by transport difficulties. The honourable member is forever criticizing the new town plan. I think he wants to restore the old tin-hut town. The Government is determined to build a town at Darwin of which Australia can be proud. If that takes a year or two longer than we .might like, the Government will nevertheless proceed so that when overseas visitors first land in Australia at Darwin they will receive a favorable impression of Australia. I do not want to trespass on the time of the committee and I want to give other honourable members an opportunity to speak. I remind the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt)., -who appears to be resentful that I have spoken in this debate, that I have taken very little time. I am justified in replywho have newly settled or returned ing to the criticisms that have been .levelled at my department by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I do not regard his comparison between conditions on trains travelling between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie and bet-ween Quorn and Alice Springs as a fair criticism. However, I assure him that conditions on the Quorn-Alice Springs trains will be improved in the near future services should not be viewed in a merand raised to a standard as near as possible to that of other trains. address my remarks to the Postmaster General's Department, with particular I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to state the policy of the Government in relation to announce what priority is granted to applicants for telephones who live in rural areas. Country residents are in the dark as to their priority rights. I do not criticize the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs in New South Wales or his staff. I have found them to be courteous and helpful, and I believe that everybody recognizes that they are doing a splendid job. Many country residents want telephones not as a luxury but as a matter of urgency. Telephones are often necessary in outback localities. Farms are often widely scattered and communication services are bad so that people are obliged to depend on telephones not only as a means of keeping in touch with their friends but also for use in emergencies. With the recent further restrictions on petrol supplies, they will be even more dependent than previously on telephone -communications. For many country -people, telephones should be regarded as essential. During my short experience as a member of this Parliament I have dealt with many applications for telephones. The cases presented by the applicants in support of their claims are often very distressing. Some of them have no means of transport although they live many miles from a township. Many of them have young families. Some have wives who expect to require medical attention and are afraid to leave them alone without means of sending for help should they need it. Others who 9uffer are ex-servicemen to the land after war service. Existing party telephone lines are overloaded to an absurd degree. In some instances, as many as thirteen subscribers are connected to one party circuit although the policy of the department is to restrict the number to six. In view of the profits made by the Postmaster-General's Department, applications for telephone cenary light. The policy should not be",62,Department An Airline And While We Cannot Get A
277,Mr Howse (Calare) [10.52],"Ito ask: "" Will this particular line pay? "". I remind honorahle members that every telephone call made by these people is a trunk-line call. They cannot simply pick up an instrument and make a twopenny call as city .residents can do. For this reason, the telephone bills of those who are fortunate enough to have instruments are fairly heavy. In view of all these circumstances, the department should not allocate telephones according to the probability of making a profit from their use. God knows, it is difficult enough to keep these people in the country areas! The best people are leaving, and we should give them every encouragement to stay. Here, surely, is an instance in which the Government could afford to pay small subsidies! In view of the conditions under which country people live, the Government should say to them, "" We are glad that you are there. You are doing a good job and we are going to provide you with every amenity and every facility that will encourage you to stay where you are"". My second point in relation to the Department also affects country residents. I refer to mail services provided by service cars. operated at a loss because they have to travel great distances in order to visit only a few homesteads. However, there are many children at these places and they are too far away from towns to be able to attend schools. The only way in which they can be educated is by means of correspondence courses, and for this system to be efficient, mail services must be provided regularly. I hope that the Government will announce the priority system according to which telephones are allocated to applicants in the country, and I appeal to it to disregard the mercenary attitude which I have mentioned. It can well afford to subsidize country telephone services. MT. GEOBGE LAWSON (Brisbane) [10.58] I rise to speak about a matter affecting Department. Many years have elapsed since I rose in this chamber to prevail upon the then government to proceed with the erection of a new general post office in Brisbane. In those days, the conditions under which employees at the Brisbane post office worked were, as I repeatedly declared, disgraceful. The structure was nothing more or less than a hovel. I continued my advocacy for the erection of a new building for a number of years until, in 1939, the then Postmaster-General, the present honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) visited Brisbane and saw for himself not only the disgraceful building that we still see there to-day, but also the shameful conditions under which employees had to work. He was good enough to make provision in the next Estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department for an amount of £50,000 for the commencement of a new building. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and tlie money provided was diverted to war purposes. I fully agree with that diversion. During the war period, I did not press the matter, but now that conditions are improving, I again raise it for consideration. I congratulate the former Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley), and the present occupant of that office, Senator Cameron, for their Postmaster-General's splendid work in the department. Both have been responsible for many improvements of a permanent nature to the Many mail cars are existing building. Recently the Postmaster-General visited Brisbane for the purpose of opening tbe new cafeteria, one of tbe many amenities provided by tbe Labour Government. I attended the opening function, at which were present many hundreds of postal employees. The Postmaster-General indicated to those present that the cafeteria was but the first instalment of the many improvements that the Government intended to make. Tbe cafeteria is a great boon to the people employed in the building. I am pleased to know so many permanent improvements are being provided, and I congratulate and tender my sincere thanks to those responsible for them. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) blamed the Government for the shortage of telephone equipment which, he said, was due mainly to intlie Postmaster-General's dustrial disputes. material for the equipment. week as many representations are made to me in the electorate of Brisbane as are made to any other honourable member",63,Department An Airline And While We Cannot Get A

I am satisfied that the Postmaster-General is as anxious to overcome the lag in telephone installations as is the honourable member for Moreton. worse each month. the honourable member knows it. ceipts of the Postmaster-General's Department showed an increase during the last financial year, but expenditure has also increased. The Postmaster-General has no desire to accumulate huge profits; he expends a great portion of the revenue on the provision of improvements in the interests of the people and his staff. The installation of telephones has been delayed because of the shortage of table :i-nd desk equipment which is imported and not because of the shortage of cables which are locally made. Many hundreds of my constituents find themselves unable to obtain telephone services. ber is satisfied with the position I certainly am not. satisfied with it, but I realize that the Government is doing it3 best in very difficult circumstances. If the Government of which the honourable member for Moreton was a member had carried out its task efficiently there would not be the make investigations with a view of shortage of telephone equipment that exists to-day. Responsibility for that shortage does not rest with the present Government. WhilstI have not been successful with many of the representations that I have made to the Postmaster General, I have at least succeeded in having some improvements carried out in my own electorate. For instance, during the last twelve months, as the result of my representations, at least three non-official post offices have been established mail or papers owing to the railways not there. As the result of the energy and work of the Postmaster-General, the residents of Toowong, a big centre in the Brisbane electorate, will in the near future have an automatic exchange in place of the obsolete manual exchange. The date of completion of the automatic exchange will depend upon the availability of imported equipment. Compared with the Estimates for 1946-47, the vote for the Postmaster General's Department for this year shows an increase of £385,000. The Postmaster General has promised the people of Brisbane that no time will be lost in making preparation for the construction of a new general post office in Brisbane in keeping with the importance and architectural excellence of the city. I am unable to ascertain whether any amount has been provided on the Estimates for that purpose. No specific mention has been made of that project. I trust that at least some provision is included in the Works Estimates for the commencement of the first portion of the new building. I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster General to consider this matter. I wish to record my appreciation of the unfailing courtesy extended to me by well) who represents the Postmaster General in this chamber.

Thanking you in anticipation, I am, yours truly,, . WILLIA M CROWE, Secretary. L wish to make a brief reference to the recent statement of the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) that he may arrange for the carriage of mail by air wherever possible. That is most commendable. As an. example of the advantage of air carriage of mail matter over surface carriage I need only mention that recently it required just as long to carry a newspaper by ordinary mail from Mildura to .Melbourne as it did to transmit a letter by air from London to' Melbourne. Some time ago the' honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) made a request to the Government, which I supported, for the creation of a special fund for the installation of telephone facilities in isolated areas. I should like to be informed of the present position in regard to that proposal. I appreciate the change which is being made in the carriage of mails by road instead of by rail. The Victorian train services do not always operate at convenient periods. The road service, on the other hand, is adequate for the conveyance of mails, and as much mail matter as possible' should be carried by road. I pay tribute to the courteous 1 and efficient treatment which I have received from the Postal Department. My written representations to that department have been, answered promptly, and the department has provided some sented valuable services and extended others in my electorate. Of course, I am looking forward to further favours,, because 2^d. is a lot to pay for postage on a letter. If the department will not. reduce its postal charges it has, at leasts an obligation to provide the best possible service. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [11.13] I have insuffi'cieni time to reply to all the representations made by honourable members, but I assure them that the Postmaster-General (Senasider their representations, and letters will he forwarded to the honourable members concerned on the matters each one has raised. I thank the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull.) for thecomplimentary references to ,me and I shall convey his expressions of appreciation of the services of the Postal Department to the Postmaster-General. Consideration will be given to the matters raised by the honourable members for Boothby( Mr Sheehy), Perth( Mr Burke), Brisbane( Mr George Lawson), Wilmot( Mr Duthie) Maranoa( Mr Adermann) and Calare( Mr Howse). I have already informed the honourable member for Calare that 58,000 telephones have been installed in country areas since the war and 116,000 in metropolitan areas. However, I point out to the honorahle member for Moreton( Mr Francis), who advocates a reduction of the postal charge from 2^d. to 2d., that he is ill advised to press his request if he really desires to have telephones provided in country areas. He cannot have it both ways. One thing which is obvious, however, andi which has not been mentioned, is the present prosperity of the country. Most of the people who* are' now seeking the installation, of telephones could not. afford them in other days. However, the Government will' do its best to supply those telephones and to maintain the condition of prosperity which has produced the demand for such amenities.

291,Mr Bernard Corser Asked The Minis,"Uth October, in which a former staff member uf the Bcon, the British Commonwealth Occupation Force's official newspaper in Japan, alleges that Public Relations officers heavily censored news to the British Occupation Forces in Japan? 2. Is it a fact that, soon after Bcon started publication, the Director of Public Relations in Japan (Colonel 6. S. Jenkins) issued censorship instructions that the stall of Boon must submit all news of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces to Publio Relations before publication and that they must always present to the troops an optimistic picture of the world's news? 3. is it a fact that Army Public Relations officers-(a ) ordered Boon to publish a story that a sergeant had died from natural (Muses when, in fact, the sergeant's body had been found, hacked to pieceB, in a street in Kure; (6) instructed members of Boon staff that they must review favourably all films shown to occupation troops, although the majority of the films were American B-class productions; (o) censored all mention of communal rioting in India, although Indians last year, were the biggest single section of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces; (d) permitted publication of Creat Britain's withdrawal from India in the English section only, although Bcon published a section in Urdu, a language which most Indiana understand; and (e) suppressed the facts of a strike by the crew of the Australian merchant ship River Clarence, in Japan in October, 1946. 4. Was the policy of Army Public Relations instituted on the Minister's instructions; if not, has he taken or will he take action to rectify this state of affairs? honourable member's questions' are as follows:1. Yes. 2. and 3. Bcon is a newspaper published by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force authorities in Japan for issue to troops which comprise British, Indian, New' Zealand and Australian components. The paper publishes press information supplied from all these countries and, as is the case with all newspapers, the news is edited before inclusion. Because of space limitations, the editors are compelled to exclude or abbreviate news items from the four countries concerned, and the same considerations limit controversial comment. While I was in Japan, the Boon establishment was visited by me and the daily issues of the newspaper, which were issued at the time, appeared to me to be quite satisfactory. Copies of the newspaper are 9ent to me regularly from Japan and it is my view that it presents news from Australia in u fair and impartial manner. 4. No. the honourable member for Boothby( Mr. Sheehy) asked a question concerning the shortage of socks for school children in South Australia. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information:There is a shortage of school socks which are manufactured from worsted yarns, due mainly to the dearth of female labour in the spinning industry, the supplies of worsted yarn coming forward, whilst in excess of pre-war production, are not sufficient to meet the full demand for all purposes. The Government does not control the manufacture or distribution of yarn or of goods manufactured therefrom, but from inquiries made, f t is evident that manufacturers and merchants are distributing the supplies coming forward equitably between the States and to the various sections of the trade concerned in accordance with pre-war practice. Victorian manufacturers specializing in the manufacture of school ' hose confirm that deliveries arc going forward regularly to South Australia and in the case of two of the manufacturers consulted, further supplies arc going forward this week. The Government is mindful of the importance of maintaining children's clothing particularly utility types, in good supply. Although production and distribution has now reverted entirely to commercial channels, the Government is doing everything in its power to encourage production and fair distribution of these essential items.",67,British Commonwealthooowpatiok Force Army Pdbltoation B C Ou
