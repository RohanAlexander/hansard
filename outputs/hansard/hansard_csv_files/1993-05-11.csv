So the Prime Minister said-as clearly as The historical records clearly indicate that anyone could have stated it-that the price of the price and the demand will come back.

That was a clear-cut, every single case where the Minister has flashing neon light to every buyer of wool in stood his ground, had confidence in and stood the world that the price was going to be behind his Australian industry, this country reduced. has been richly rewarded.

Without a statutory market IfI could draw a simple analogy: the effect we will go through the terrible traumas that of removing the reserve price for wool was we are going through in the wool industry like removing tariffs overnight from the now, .and with it we will have the same textile, clothing and footwear industry or the success stories of the sugar, tobacco and motor car industry of this nation.
