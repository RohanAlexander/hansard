The only negative reaction I have had about that 20-hour cap is from people who think it When I travel around the child-care centres is too much. People have rung my office and in the electorate of Dunkley, I am refreshed said, 'I work. I'm out most of the week trying by the positiveness of their approach.

When you explain to them that same manner as those child-care facilities in most people do not use that amount, that their the private sector.

285,Mr Speaker To Present A Bill For An Act Immediately And Decisively To Halt The Fright,"Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9135 Thursday, 2 October 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 October, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the bill benow read a second time. upon which Mr O'Keefe moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "" noting the representations of a wide number of graingrowers and, in particular the West Australian Graingrowers' Association and the Australian Grain Industry Taskforce, the House declines to give the bill a second reading pending consideration of the report on the measure by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which is due to be presented by 23 October 1997' to implement a new strategy for wheat marketing in Australia that will eventually lead to the conferring of export monopoly in one grower owned company. It provides a framework for the complete restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board and gives the board revised functions that will completely change the marketing structure for an industry that has traditionally been subject to strict government intervention. Earlier this century, Australian producers' returns were subject to the market distorting influences of price and shipping cartels which colluded to depress prices and control transport. Government got directly involved in supporting the industry during the Great Depression when, after several abortive attempts, a bounty of four pence halfpenny per bushel was paid for all wheat marketed in 1931-32. During the 1930s, both state and federal governments became involved in a variety of direct support measures for the industry. Orderly marketing and price stabilisation schemes came into effect with the bill of 1948, with guaranteed prices, including domestic consumption prices, and Australian Wheat Board and other stabilisation arrangements remaining part of subsequent legislation. The Australian Wheat Board had sole receival and marketing powers over wheat grown in Australia in return for the absorption of most of the risk of downward prices by the government. Under the pressure of several critical reviews of the AWB in the 1970s and 1980s, the Wheat Marketing Act 1984 introduced the first significant changes to the monopoly role of the board, including permits to allow stock feed trading and separate categories of wheat to reduce cross-subsidisation. Then the royal commission of 1986-87 recommended the setting up of marketing authorities, which would no longer be required to grant sole receival rights to state agencies for receival and storage. As well, the recommendations included removal of restrictions on transport of grain by road and the implementation of charges for port and shipping services to more accurately reflect the costs incurred. Then the Industry Assistance Commission's review in 1988 recommended even further deregulation of the industry, including the discontinuation of the underwriting provisions.

287,Mr Andren (Cal Are) (10.00 A.m.),"This legislation is the first part of a two-stage process9136 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 1989, legislation was introduced that created strong tensions between the industry and government, with its mix of further marketplace deregulation but a rolling back of government commitments, including a fixed government guarantee on AWB borrowings, removal of the requirement for major grower membership of the board, a wheat industry fund financed by grower levy, and passing back of more costs to growers. Following this, the industry took the reality of deregulation and lesser government support by the horns, when the Grains Council initiated the Grains 2000 project and the eventual establishment of the national grain marketing strategic planning unit, made up of all major industry players, to create the flexibility in the market required to meet the challenges of the new market realities, both here and abroad. Led by the Grains Council, the debate of 1994-95 centred on the form that any lasting restructure of the Australian Wheat board should take, with retention of single desk selling for exports and grower control and ownership foremost in industry minds. The grower corporate model was essentially the model announced by the minister in April this year for wheat marketing in Australia. The Western Australian Farmers Federation has been dissatisfied with the one-grower, one-vote system, based on what it sees as the greater productive output of growers in that state. That in fact is a reality. Hopefully that issue has been resolved with shares to be allocated on a delivery basis. Although the National Competition Council has been urging a review of the wheat industry before the expected 2000 date set for such reappraisal, the government has indicated through the Minister for Trade( Mr Tim Fischer) that it firmly is committed to retaining the wheat export monopoly. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) is on record too as saying: In a corrupted world market ... the adage that you ought not to divide your strength applies. He says also that he is 'absolutely convinced of the value of single desk arrangements,' which perhaps begs the question how this philosophy fits into the general attitude prevailing in this government about the value of deregulation and the view that the unregulated marketplace will deliver all the benefits. The single desk status is under challenge from international grain traders who are already active in the domestic market. I wonder how long the resolve of the minister and government can hold out, particularly with a cartel of multinationals like Cargill, Continental, ConAgra, Dreyfus and certain Japanese traders circling our industry like sharks and sure to stir World Trade Organisation activity to challenge this export monopoly, presenting it as some sort of free market distortion. The planned ACCC review of the industry in 1999 is also, on that commission's form to date, likely to advise a scrapping of the single desk, and the resolve of any minister for trade and others will be sorely tested again at that time. The trade minister is on record as making no apology for defending the monopoly against the 'eco rats, the extremely dry economic rationalists,' and he says he would continue to do so. In the Land on 31 July, the Minister for Trade said that: The AWBs export marketing arrangements allowed many small producers to combine and to be confident they would not be exploited by the multinational trading companies. Well, bravo! I only hope, come 2000, that we will not be overwhelmed by forces beyond our control who want to control our industry, aided and abetted by the WTO. Retention of the Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9137 AWB' s export monopoly is not only advisable but essential to the Australian wheat grower and our wider economic fortunes. The main features of this bill retain the AWB' s functions to control export of wheat and the marketing overseas of Australian wheat. It repeals the AWB's power to buy wheat in Australia or overseas, to import wheat into Australia, or to sell or dispose of wheat in Australia, and it establishes three wholly owned subsidiaries of the AWB to take over wheat marketing and financing arrangements. CompanyA will be engaged in matters, including value adding, for the purposes of foreign trade, including the promotion, funding or undertaking of research into marketing or value adding. I surely hope this will, in some way, lead to a restoration of incentives to continue the kind of value adding work conducted by the Manildra group of companies in my electorate and also on the south coast in its ethanol development program-a program cruelly and shortsightedly terminated by this government's abolition, prior to its agreed date, of the ethanol bounty scheme. This has not only penalised a company with a multimillion dollar commitment to regional Australia and the wheat industry-incidentally, it was engaged with the sugar industry, and I know the Deputy Speaker, the member for Cowper( Mr Nehl) would be interested in extracting ethanol, under the same bounty scheme, from sugar-but also has seriously hampered development of alternative energy sources at a time when our national commitment to greenhouse gas emission reduction is under worldwide scrutiny. Under this bill, we will have a holding company with a single desk power and two subsidiaries. One will handle all pool wheat and will be charged with maximising returns to the growers; the other will handle the company's commercial activities to maximise profitability. There are many in the area of primary industry who are-not wheat growers but end users, such as the stock feed or lotfeed industry, who would want a much more liberalised wheat marketing system. However, claims that the existing system, even after the changes this bill will bring about, will not deliver the growers the returns they deserve or the grain using industry the flexibility of market it wants really deserve a closer scrutiny, because I do not think they are accurate. A new range of branded wheats built on quality gradings developed by the AWB will be part of its operations still-and expanded-and that is headed by premium white suitable for instant noodles, baked products and pan and flat breads. Other brands that have been developed through the AWB include soft, prime hard, durum and the Australia standard white. Customers for Australian wheat are becoming more and more discerning and now 40 quality differentiations are available. As well, there is an active involvement by the AWB in value adding and marketing initiatives. Research and development into end use is taking place at the Academy of Grain Technology with its recently installed Asian Food Research Centre. There is a joint venture flour mill in the Chinese province of Shenzhen, with similar ventures committed in Suez and Ho Chi Minh City. Long-term trading relationships are developed with buyers and, to my mind, the single desk of the AWB system offers surety to growers, not the gamble the complete deregulation of the system, with its domination by foreign traders, would present. The AWB will, hopefully, be able to maintain a credit rating it has built up through solid accumulation of grower levies, so that when the government guarantee runs out in 1999, both 9138 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 a strong capital base and strong reliable reputation will still be intact. Board chairman, Trevor Flugge, in an article in the Bankers Trust annual review of 1995, says: ... if we had full deregulation here, the Board would probably be one of six or so ... you'd definitely have Cargill here, Conagra, Continental Grain, and probably a couple of Japanese trading houses dominating-and frankly Australia would lose its market power and strength that the current system delivers. I realise that there is still a Senate committee report on this bill to be completed and tabled by the third week in October. With the proviso that there are no substantial problems from the industry about the restructuring of it-and I have not fielded any significant objections in my office-I will not be supporting the opposition's amendments and I commend the bill to the House. an interim measure which, in my mind, is a very doubtful necessity, which is aimed at establishing a holding company to become the company owned by the Wheat Industry Fund holders-otherwise know as WIF-and controlled by Australian wheat growers. It is an interim measure that the second reading speech tells us is necessary to allow the Wheat Board to start to get a commercial base out there in the real world. The only bit of real world that it does not confront today is the fact that it has a government guarantee to its borrowings. Funnily enough, this legislation does not remove that guarantee. It is proposed to be removed in 1999, so one would wonder why it is necessary that the Wheat Board get into the commercial arena at this particular time when its cosseting is to remain. In fact, there is a proposal in this legislation to create a holding company, a pool sale company, which would deal with the export of wheat and a domestic trading company. The interesting thing is that, by doing this at this stage, the parliament sets a process in concrete which I think will be difficult to get out of when the second round of legislation comes forward. The major concern I have is that it is proposed that, within this structure, the companies will be the holders of this single desk monopoly. The second reading speech makes some suggestions that might not be the case, but we have got to understand that the proposal has grave difficulties in what it sets out to achieve. This is not necessarily a criticism of the minister or the government, which is responding to the requests of the grain industry. I might add that it is the industry who got itself into this mess in the first place. Therefore, I wish to point out to the House and particularly put on the record my objections on behalf of my constituents-and, in a single electorate, I represent between 60 and 70 per cent of the total grain exports of Australia. Furthermore, in that regard, I point out that that is the only component of the grain industry where the Commonwealth has any interest. We control the grain market in Australia through the export powers of the constitution. If it were not for that export sector, we would not be passing this legislation. The domestic market, which is significant to the company that is going to operate under this legislation, is a deregulated market open to all comers. This is a grower model, yet as they presently propose, the structures are totally unworkable. The problem is that the proposal is to create a company that is run by its customers but which seeks over time to attract non-customer share capital. This creates a massive conflict of interest that will, at least, probably. deny existing WIF contributors any chance of recovering their forced contributions through the sale of the proposed B class shares.",125,Representatives Main Committee
288,Mr Tuckey (O'connor) (10.12 A.m.),"The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 isThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9139 I refer the House consequently to a news release from the Grains Council on 29 September, headed 'GCA pushes on with AWB restructure'. In this they say: Growers have also been seeking advice from the council regarding our support for the public listing of the new company structure post-1999. 'This issue is pivotal to ensuring that growers can have access to their wheat industry fund post-1999 and ensuring that the AWB has a mechanism to maintain an adequate capital base,' Mr Stewart said. The council has resolved that listing should occur as soon as commercially possible after the revocation of the government underwriting of AWB Limited's borrowings on 1 July 1999; and that a mechanism be put in place to guarantee capital value at conversion. That sounds pretty interesting, seeing that we are going into the field of commerce. But the point of all this is-and I think it is well recognised in those words-that the problems are as follows: the AWB, which has been a statutory authority, cannot exist, as a private company, without the WIF capital base. Many grain growers today-and with the current El Nino effect, drought and everything else, this situation is being aggravated-cannot afford to continue to provide these funds. I have wheat growers in my electorate who every year go to their bank and borrow money to put in a crop, yet they have WIF funds of up to $200,000 which they cannot access. The solution proposed-and Mr Stewart makes it quite clear-is to list the holding company on the Australian Stock Exchange, thus allowing those-WIF or B class shareholders as they become, to recover their forced contribution by disposing of their shares to interested investors. It sounds nice and simple. The question is whether the proposed structures will achieve this outcome. Firstly, there is the problem that the Australian Stock Exchange rules oppose company structures that restrict access to the board of directors. Recognising this is a proposed company in which you must be a wheat grower to be a director and must be elected by wheat growers, I do not think the Stock Exchange will be too keen about that. I have had correspondence with financial advisers who recognise the problem but say that they think they can get around it. If this obstacle is overcome, then the question arises of investors being interested in shares when the directors' main interest is in returns to their customers. Is the AMP going to go and buy a lot of my farmers' shares when they desperately need their WIF money back? Are they going to buy their shares and say, 'This is a great investment. The directors do not want to make a profit. They want to return all the money to their customers, the wheat producers.' Of course, there is another aspect to all that, and that is the fact that company law provides that the directors' first responsibility is to the shareholders. So how can they represent the interests of the customer, the wheat grower, and the shareholders at the same time? Under the proposed structures-as I will read to you, they have a solution to this which is equally alarming-the reality is that outside investors are not going to be interested in buying shares where there is grave doubt over what sort of returns they might get. So this is a problem. In recognition of the problem, the Grains Council of Australia proposes dividends to shareholders based on-to use their words-' a commercial rate of return' . Let me read to you what Mr Stewart said about that: The council was also able to support the principle of a commercial rate of return which included the establishment of a service agreement between the pool subsidiary and the AWB holding company. The commercial rate of return must be commensurate with the risk borne by the capital providers, the competitive market for capital, and will fluctuate over time to reflect market circumstances. Mr Stewart also said: 9140 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 The council support for the principles of a commercial rate of return protected by the service agreement is contingent on the acceptance by government of the council's pool subsidiary board structure. What they are saying there is that to overcome the problem that no-one wants to buy shares in a company run by its customers, they will be guaranteed a commercial rate of return-I 0 per cent-on their investment. That will certainly attract investors. But what if the company, this free enterprise business operation out there in the real marketplace where we are sending it, is grossly inefficient? What if it is a poor performer? The normal response to a poorly performing company is for its shareholders to flog the stock, they devalue the shares. That is a discipline over the directors. But, suddenly, the shareholders under this proposal are going to be in absolute comfort. They can buy shares and they are guaranteed a return. Where is that money going to come from? From one place only: wheat growers returns. So you could end up with a mob of mugs, of no-hopers, running a company and paying themselves big salaries, and the shareholders are not going to go crook. So all the normal disciplines of the share market disappear. How can we have that? It is silly-and that is what we are talking about. And, as I said, it gets worse. We are going to have a group of farmers who have just had this big fight, which is resolved. As an issue of fine detail, which I think is worthless, I have supported my constituents in arguing for their voting rights in the election of directors, which primarily resides with A-class shares-and these are applicable to wheat growers. You can grow 30 tonnes of wheat a year for three years and you get a vote for a director. But the argument now is that if you are a substantial grower of wheat, wherever you live-and they particularly reside in my electorate-then in fact you will get additional voting rights. There is nothing wrong with that, except that when you send the bloke there, someone is going to drop the company law in front of him and say, 'I know that you have gone and made all these promises to your wheat grower constituency but, mate, your responsibility now is to the shareholder.' And it is, legally. Here is the dilemma: people desperately want their WIF money back. There are people going off their farms with a residue of money in the Wheat Industry Fund. That is how bad it is in some situations. This is recognised by the Grains Council; they say so in their press release. Their solution is to say, 'Yes, we will get you your money back. We'll guarantee the AMP or, for that matter, Cargills or whoever buys it, a commercial rate of return with your money.' That is what we have got. There is a solution. I have argued it extensively in my electorate. I have even brought with me and made representations to the Senate committee on all the places I have run this story, and not one person has criticised my solution. It is not beyond achieving. trying to respond to what the grain industry wants. The grain industry is out there cutting its own throat. I do not think it uses halal slaughter; it may as well! But the reality is that the solution lies in retaining the single desk at total arms length from the company, not as is proposed in the bill-and they talk about transparency, which I could refer to as well-in not giving it some involvement of any nature with the AWB commercial structure. The export monopoly is a creature of government and it should be retained in a statutory authority to which we elect wheat growers on some representative production basis. We say",128,Representatives Main Committee
289,Mr Fitzgibbon,What about the minister?,130,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Tuckey,"I have talked to the minister. But the reality is this: the minister is stillThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9141 that is yours. It is your property; It is the decision of all your people that you want an export monopoly. You sit there with only two functions. The first is to let a contract to a marketer which, I believe, would be the AWB in its corporatised form. Your second responsibility-and we will give you some resources for this purpose-is to monitor the performance of that contract. The contract can have benchmarks in it. It is not difficult, in the international grain industry, looking to the Chicago futures exchange and whatever other indicators are available, to say these are the levels of performance that we. expect you, Mr Corporatised Wheat Board, now owned by the AMP and all sorts of other people and it does not matter, to deliver. What is more, we will give you a bonus if you exceed those benchmarks which will give the company the right sort of profile out there on the stock exchange because it can say, as it constantly reminds us, that it is better than the rest of the world. It will achieve above those benchmarks and make additional profits by doing it. Similarly, it can trade, as it presently does, in the domestic market provided, as the Grains Council suggests, that business is at arms length and it is not discounting export wheat to itself so that it can make major profits in its domestic trading. I believe they have been making $17 million or $18 million per year out of domestic trading and that is good. That is a commercial function. Their asset becomes their contract and not a government provided export monopoly. Just imagine anyone else knocking on our door and saying, 'We want you to grant us an export monopoly. We are BHP; we want to be the only people in Australia to export steel products.' We would laugh them out of the room. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about corporatising a body and letting it hold the export monopoly. I say the export monopoly should stand in total independence of the commercial structure. There should be a contractual arrangement and then it does not matter. The growers do not need to press for wheat growers on the AWB-the marketing arm. They should be people determined to maximise the profits of their shareholders, whomsoever they may be over time and to do so by being super-efficient marketers which return the best possible benefit to the customer but the customer is represented by the holders of the export monopoly. It is not a difficult thing to do. It is still possible as a flow-on from this legislation. That is why I will not oppose it although I am criticising it strongly. I think these issues should have been set in concrete and, as I think the opposition is trying to say, one piece of legislation would have been better than two. I am not convinced that there is any great advantage to the wheat industry in passing this legislation at the moment but I will not be opposing it because a lot of the outstanding issues have been settled. I just do not think that the people in the Grains Council know what they are talking about. I think, as we have found in so many of these commodity councils over recent times, they do not understand the views of their constituency. They have become too distanced from them over time. I might say I am disappointed to see in the second reading speech that there are certain matters which are going to be done in the future, and we have selected the Grains Council for that purpose. I have been reminding people that there is a simple opportunity for plebiscite on some of these major issues and that is by running these elections concurrent with local government elections. It is always a major problem when one sets out to have a plebiscite to decide issues in agriculture because it is a very expensive process but if it was brought in with 9142 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 local government elections, in truth the only cost would be the ballot paper. I think local government, considering it is their own constituency that they are servicing in this, should be prepared to do it for nothing or, at most, no more than a very minimal cost. It could be done through their postal ballot arrangements or it could be done through their polling arrangements. It would be just another vote that people cast at the time. I would encourage people to think about that in the broader sense. WhatI am really saying is that the proposals that the Grains Council talks about are simply not practical. They will not achieve what the Grains Council says it wants to achieve. That is to create a mechanism where there is adequate capital for this export marketing operation which is the WIF funds and an opportunity for wheat growers who need that money, or do not like that sort of investment, to get their money back. To achieve those two goals you have to be able to list on the stock exchange-you have to have a vehicle that is listable-and you have to have a vehicle that stands on its own two feet and does not go running around enticing shareholders to buy shares on the basis of robbing the people you are servicing, that is, the wheat growers. That is what a commercial rate of return will do. Trevor Flugge will ring me and say, 'I'm going to be perfect. I'm going to be so good to all these people. You'll have no doubt and worries about my efficiency.' There is no discipline on them under that arrangement to perform-none-yet there has got to be a process whereby they perform. There is the cost of managing the process and there is the financial return by way of wheat sales. They are both extremely important but if it has cost an extra $1 a tonne to sell wheat, that is one thing, but if you lose $10 a tonne on one million tonnes, that is a real problem. The disciplines are not there, and they will not be there while the AWB holds this export monopoly. There is a suggestion the government is going to control it. If that is the case, why are we changing anything? There is no point, we may as well just leave the existing statutory authority in place, and a lot of my wheat growers would argue for that. The reality is that if you are going to have a market situation, then have a market situation. Have proper contractual arrangements at arms length and then the company stands on its own feet and its share price reflects its ability to make profits for its shareholders. It will only do that if it is properly servicing its customers. member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey). This is an issue on which I would not dare take him on head to head because it is a subject that he would know much more about on the basis that he has been in this place much longer than I, and also on the basis that he represents an electorate with a very large wheat interest. I was very interested in what he had to say about democracy in rural Australia and the plebiscite idea. I have just recently experienced great public uproar in the Merriwa area in my electorate as a result of the New South Wales state Labor government forcing an amalgamation of the Merriwa and Mudgee Rural Lands Protection Boards. It has been very difficult for those with an interest in the boards to put their case to the government because the concept has been supported by the peak council that oversees the Rural Lands Protection Boards in New South .Wales. Here we see a fine example of the peak body of an interest group not necessarily taking into account the interests of those people who make up its organisation.

291,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.31 A.m.),"I must say I enjoyed the contribution of theThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9143 government elections is a very interesting one and one I would be prepared to have a look at. The member for O'Connor has made some very valid points. It is fair to say that if a master of business administration came down from Mars today and took a look at our rural sector and how government involves itself in it, he would probably faint. He would surely be surprised that there is such strong government involvement. In markets such as wheat, we do offer guarantees of price and export market monopolies and other things. However, what he would not understand is the historical context of these things. He would not understand that people have involved themselves in these industries over many generations on the basis of the status quo--on the basis that government does have a hand in the industry, does express a strong interest in our rural sector, and does involve itself to ensure that we maximise our returns as a nation. Government has done .so for many years and quite often that involvement has its roots in wartime conditions. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill today. I would have liked to have been here earlier to hear all of the comments from the member for O'Connor but I was at a Public Accounts Committee inquiry into Internet commerce, which in the longer term might have some impact also on this industry. The Australian Wheat Board is a statutory authority which has existed continuously since 1948. Its principal function is to control the export and overseas marketing of Australian wheat, but it also has responsibility for a number of domestic functions. The bill before the House today puts in place the first phase of a two-stage process to transform the Australian Wheat Board from a statutory authority to a grower owned company by 1999. The transitional phase is supposed to commence today so that still has me a bit confused, . and it raises a number of questions. The Australian Wheat Board's commercial wheat. marketing and financing functions are to be transferred to a wholly grower-owned holding company and its subsidiary. The subsidiaries will include a trading subsidiary and a pooling subsidiary. Shares in the holding company will be issued in two classes, A class and B class. Of course, as the member for O'Connor has pointed out, it is those holdings in the A class where the real power will reside on these issues. OneA class share will be issued to each grower and the Wheat Industry Fund will be converted to B class shares. The shares will be distributed to those with an equity in the fund in proportion to their equity holding. The single desk system will remain, at least for now, until we work out some competition policy issues. The Australian Wheat Board will continue to manage the Wheat Industry Fund, and will be accountable to the parliament and to the industry. The holding company will of course operate under the Corporations Law. Australia is the fourth largest wheat exporter in the world, trailing only the USA, Europe and Canada. Our wheat producers produce, on average, 15 million tonnes each year of which around 60,000 tonnes is produced in my own electorate, not a significant amount but certainly an important amount to my electorate. Most of that is grown in the Merriwa and Quirindi and surrounding areas. Of the 15 million tonnes that I have mentioned, some 85 per cent of that is exported. So no other country is as dependent on the wheat export market as is Australia. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 is a very important bill to the nation and indeed to my electorate. That is why I rise today to support the amendment put forward by our shadow minister, the member for Burke( Mr O'Keefe). It does appear extraordinary that, with so many issues remaining outstanding, as the member for O'Connor has articulated so well, 9144 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 the government should be proceeding to the second reading of this bill in the House when at the very same time the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee is holding an inquiry into the bill. The committee has identified the outstanding issues. The nature of the evidence being placed before the Senate committee and the various concerns being expressed in the media, in the community generally and, indeed, by the member for O'Connor, should have set the alarm bells ringing within the government. The Senate committee is due to report to the Senate by 23 October so what is the rush on this bill? This is a process which effectively began back in 1989 and has essentially been driven by the Australian Labor Party. So our position in terms of this amendment is not one of opposition but one of a carefully, carefully approach. We support the main thrust of the bill but the industry is entitled to be extensively consulted and the Senate Gommittee process is an appropriate forum for the airing of those concerns. It is a chance for the government to make amends for an earlier period where it has not been prepared to listen carefully enough to the concerns of the industry, and there certainly have been some concerns, Mr Deputy Speaker. One only needs to look at the screams coming from the Western Australians about the allocation of A class shares. I did not think that issue had been resolved but I thought the member for O'Connor said something that would indicate to me that maybe it has. And then there was the member for O'Connor's submission to the Senate committee which he also mentioned. For those who have not read the submission, it is very extensive and it is very critical of the government's approach. From what I heard him say today that was only partly representative of that extensive submission. Of course, we are speaking here of the member for O'Connor, a member of the government, who represents an electorate which produces 60 per cent, as I understand it, of Australian wheat exports. I was disappointed that he did not answer my question when he was talking about his preparedness to speak openly on these issues, both before the Senate committee and publicly. When I asked him what the minister had to say about his concerns, he avoided the question. His submission to the committee, as I said, was extensive, and can best be described as a bombshell, as was his speech in here today. member for O'Connor is well-known for criticising his own government, and has been criticising it on this issue for some months. I should not say it was a bombshell, but it certainly was a good shot at his own government in terms of the way it has approached this issue. Just last Friday, the chairman of the Grains Committee of the New South Wales Farmers Association gave evidence before the Senate committee. He told the committee, and I quote: The majority of our members have a strong view that what has been successful for nearly 60 years should mainly be left alone. Some may see that as an extraordinary statement not reflecting the reality of today's world, the globalisation of the economy and all the rest. The point is that we have a bill before the House today which has many in the industry most concerned, but the government is not prepared to hold it over until those people have had the opportunity to put their case. The Senate committee is a perfect opportunity and again, I do not understand why the government is rushing this through before the Senate has given them that opportunity. Too many questions remain unanswered to allow the passage of this bill through the House at this point: questions relating to competition policy and the single desk issue, and questions",132,Representatives Main Committee

293,Mr Fitzgibbon,"Maybe not a bombshell. That is probably the wrong term, because theThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9145 relating to whether the proposed statutory arrangements will run into problems with respect to World Trade Organisation negotiations and so on. As I said earlier, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the main thrust of the bill. It is an important part of a process which will deliver to the industry ownership and control of the Australian Wheat Board, and it provides a mechanism for maintaining at least the existing level of harvest payments. It will deliver greater commercial flexibility and will go some way toward making the industry players masters of their own destiny. The industry has been the subject of a number of High Court rulings, Senate standing committee reports and Auditor-GeneraI's reports, and two Industry Commission reports. I hope that we are at least partly on track to getting it right this time around. Allowing the Senate inquiry to proceed and make recommendations before this bill makes its passage through the House is one very effective way of ensuring that that will be the case. I commend the member for Burke's amendments to the House. genuine concerns and questions of the member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon). The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill is an historic piece of legislation, and very important to an electorate like Mallee, which produces-and I will be kind-a lot more grain than Hunter. I am not churlish about this. My grain growing constituency have urged me very much to support this legislation. The view needs to be adopted that this represents an enabling bill to start a process. The member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) enjoys the same level of respect from me as the member for Hunter. I believe that through the process-and the government is indicating quite clearly there will be further legislation on this-we will get the rest of it right. The significance of this bill to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, comes from the vast grain growing interests of the Wimmera region of my electorate, and the roIling sandy dunes of the Mallee. As we see it now, thanks to the providence of the heavens, we are very hopeful that just from my electorate we will make a contribution to the GDP this year probably nudging at least a billion dollars. That is the extent of the interest that I have in a piece of legislation like this: roughly a million tonnes. In the Mallee and the Wimmera we are talking about a region with the potential for up to three million tonnes, if the good Lord will provide adequate rainfall at precisely the right time. So the activities of the Australian Wheat Board are of keen interest to me and my grain growing constituency, and I am very pleased today to have an opportunity to make a contribution on this legislation on their behalf. As I have mentioned, this bill is the first stage of what will be a new suite of legislation, with improvements and further detail next year. I will be as actively involved and as interested as the member for O'Connor and many other members of this place in what is a very, very significant industry to the Australian interest. This bill is enabling legislation to set up a process to transform ownership of the Australian Wheat Board to growers. That is something that the industry and the grower organisations they represent have driven themselves. I am willing to acknowledge the member for Hunter's suggestion that the previous government was part of that process. It needs to remember that for years now growers have wanted access to control their own destiny.",134,Representatives Main Committee
294,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (10.42 A.m.),"I will attempt to answer, for his benefit, the very9146 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 The restructure of the Australian Wheat Board brings to fruition a process that goes back seven or eight years now aimed at putting ownership and the control of wheat marketing firmly in the growers' hands, driven by the industry itself, for a very good reason, which I would like an opportunity to point out later. The push for change started in 1989 when industry commenced building up funds for a capital base fora future grower owned Australian Wheat Board via a levy on wheat sales paid into the wheat industry fund. We were grateful for the legislation that enabled that at the time. As anybody knows who has had association with agropolitics over the years, and particularly the wheat industry, it is like any form of agriculture and any form of commodity in trying to get a geographically diverse constituency together. We have seen the same ingredients with wool, another very significant commodity to the Australian economy. We are currently seeing it now with beef. It is a difficult process to embrace all of those different interests and the variety of debate to get a consensus. We have that-within reason. The debate that the member for Hunter needs to understand that is going on now is the detail: the assignment of the shares, even the name of the new organisation. I am quite confident that the consultation process and the confidence which the organisations and the growers themselves now have in that process will see us get it right in the final end product. A key element of the new arrangements is the government's intention that, by 1 July 1999, its' only involvement in the wheat industry will be in relation to the export monopoly, which is to be conferred on that independent grower owned company. If you look at the history of the wheat industry, for someone like me who has lived in the Mallee for the majority of his life and my family contacts who are still in grain growing, the history has been a torrid one. In speaking on a wheat marketing bill way back in 1984, my predecessor, the former member for Mallee, Peter Fisher, said that in the early part of this century: ... wheat was being given away at two bob a bushel. There was no stability. Producers were at the whim of a small consortium of buyers who played one grower against the other and reduced an expanding industry to a very sorry state. That has been the history if you go back 50 years. The impact on Mallee farms in that era is now a matter of recorded history: devastation and people walking off their properties, many of them soldier settlements at that time. Today, owing to a sensible approach to orderly marketing, the fortunes of the grain industry are vastly different. In our modem era there is a very positive approach. But it has been undergirded by that concept of orderly marketing because of this difficulty of geographic divide, with an industry that spread from the west coast right across to the east coast, and an almost impossible task to get that broad consensus and so many people with different interests together. That has been achieved and undergirded by that concept of orderly marketing which has been provided by the single desk concept. In 1979, legislation of the Sinclair-Nixon primary industry ministry portfolio was the most positive for wheat marketing in Australia since the original formation of the Wheat Board. The guaranteed minimum price arrangements gave producers, at long last, a known price for their product. This was achieved at small risk to government, whose only exposure was the contingent liability of guaranteeing the borrowings to support the pool. That is something that these days in the late 1990s governments do not wish to be exposed to, even though it is a very minimal risk. There are other reasons why that link needs to be removed. Growers wish Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9147 to have control of their own destiny and, by their own monetary contributions now through the levy, established a very significant fund to undergird those borrowings. But to go back to the guaranteed minimum priCe, it gave some security because, like many Australian commodities, we are so exposed to the domination of world prices. A crisis in some part of the world creates a crisis for our own growers here, through no fault of their own. But it did give the industry opportunity, through its very good intelligence to a well-structured, good organisation in the Australian Wheat Board, which has to be in corporate terms regarded as one of our most successful Australian companies. It gave the industry access, in avery organised way, to the market signals and ensured continued productivity and efficiency increases. It gave growers some security that they would receive a certain price for their commodity whilst they watched it grow and continued to invest in it, with weed control and all the other things that need to be done in any form of agriculture. It gave them some security to adopt some innovative farming techniques and for a gradual restructuring of their industry without the massive trauma, crisis and personal social costs so regularly experienced in many rural areas because of the lack of prospects for the primary iridustries that undergird the activities of the economy of the small communities in rural areas. One of the successful things was the 95 per cent up-front advance providing a high delivery payment which enabled growers to rapidly repay their immediate costs of production. This positive cash flow situation had an ongoing benefit for the surrounding communities, and gave many rural townships some buffer against some of the other rigours that country communities face. A lot of this still continues, and much of the focus of the government's current policy is directed to address this. A fortnight ago we were very proud to announce a very specific policy directed towards advancing Australia's agricultural prospects, which has been received very positively in an electorate like Mallee. But, as I have said, things have changed for the grain industry. The last decade has seen a greater willingness by the industry to assume greater control of its own destiny, and these changes are now represented in this enabling legislation before us today. Fortunately, the view today has achieved a lot greater consensus than it did in the very early days. If you go back and read the history, which I wish I had time to read-and I am sure other members and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be keen to read the tortuous history of the wheat industry and government's role in it; it is a fascinating history, and I commend readers to it-it involved the parliament, members crossing floors and changing parties. But the end result was a very good result. Most of my growers now speak very highly of the manner in which the Australian Wheat Board has operated. . Of course, there is diverse opinion. Even in my own electorate, there are those who say that if it is time to rejig the industry, let us do it completely and expose it completely to competition and repeal the statutory marketing operations. That is a view I am listening to, but I have to form my final view based on a broad consensus. Somebody earlier made reference to democracy. Democracy is all about 100 people in one room with a problem to solve. Humans being what they are, you will get 100 different suggestions on how that problem might be solved. At the end of the day, you can get 51 of those people agreeing on one solution and that still leaves 49 unhappy ones. That is democracy. That is the process and that is probably what this parliament is all about. 9148 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 There are some people who want greater access in our own right to export markets., There is provision for that. There is a permit system within the statutory marketing arrangements that currently exist, that will continue in the new arrangements. If people discover a niche market-whether it be a particular small volume of a particular variety of grain or a market for bagged grain into Asia-and if there is opportunity to put that, there is a permit system. In fact, tomorrow, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) is visiting my electorate for a very large meeting at Warracknabeal, which is roughly the geographic centre of my electorate. I have provided some time for him to see somebody with a particular interest in this; this person does not agree that this legislation goes far enough. I have to accept that he is in the minority in the general view of my constituency. I am supporting the legislation. There is another reason. In February this year, I had an opportunity to visit the United States. I have been very concerned about the view of the United States Congress. They seem to have a very jaundiced view about the use of the word 'board' in the name of the Australian Wheat Board. They have a very near neighbour in Canada whose grain board is very uncooperative in terms of trading arrangements. That jaundiced view extends to their attitude to the Australian Wheat Board. As part of a brief from my growers, I was able to speak with quite significant congressmen involved in agricultural committees over there. In recent times, my particular visit has received the focus of national attention; I used the provisions provided in members' entitlements via a study allowance to attend that visit. Essentially, the invitation to visit Washington was extended to me by the congress to attend their international prayer breakfast. You might permit me some indulgence here, Mr Speaker; it is relevant to this particular issue. My objective was to attend that very significant event and represent my constituency and the parliament. It coincided with President Clinton's inaugural celebrations as well. Some members of the press seem to make it their purpose in life to portray members of parliament in a very unfavourable light. I take a very dim view of my use of my study allowance on that visit being considered inappropriate. I suggest that anybody who wishes to make any comment ought to speak with my constituency, particularly the wheat industry, and more particularly the citrus industry, whose interests I very actively pursued during that visit. Members of parliament, naturally, are fair game for the media. I can accept that we trip up and make a mistake. As long as the reporting is fair and reasonable. I think the attitude of some journalists, and particularly radio commentators, ought to be based more on a principle of fairness. My growers believe that the investment of their taxpayer contributed funds in that visit was appropriately expended. I found a very interesting view from some very important congressmen. They see the Australian Wheat Board and raise a smokescreen in terms of their own activities in subsidisation and distortions in the trade mru;ket-the buyer subsidies. My concern at the time was a $500 million proposal from President Clinton, as a budget provision, to allow for subsidisation. I was assured by the congressman involved that that was simply there to give them some threat against the Europeans, whom they see as bigger rogues than us, and that they would not use those subsidies against their good friends in Australia,and I hope they are up to those assurances. They have a very misguided view on what the Australian Wheat Board does, contributed to by the fact that we provide them protection via the parliament to have a single desk Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9149 monopoly on the exporting opportunity. Because of the statutory marketing arrangements which currently exist for the Wheat Board, their concern was that this represents some form of indirect subsidy. That is simply not true. The only exposure to government-as I mentioned earlier-is that listing as a contingent liability which appears when the government guarantees the borrowings for the pool. What the process will end up with when this enabling legislation is passed and we subsequently introduce the rest of the fine detail, is that the United States will no longer be able to allege that a smokescreen exists. We will have a completely grower owned, grower managed operation in the Australian Wheat Board--or whatever name it comes to be known by later as a new operating company. I am very pleased to stand here today and represent my constituency. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy who, unlike the member for Hunter, I would like to assure has gone out of his way to facilitate consultation on this matter and he deserves credit for that. He has done the same with the wool industry and is currently engaged in the same process in the beef industry-both of them are significant primary industries to my electorate. I think that he deserves congratulations and he certainly has them from me. I am looking forward to a very positive process down the track. From1 July 1999, there will be an industry standing on its own two feet and in partnership with the government, whose involvement will be in relation to the export monopoly-and for very good reason. On many occasions already the public benefit has been demonstrated. The industry will survive any test that competition policy will place upon it. I would simply urge all members to support this bill and I commend it to the House. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (11.02 a.m.)-Let me acknowledge, before I commence my discussion of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, the contribution by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Forrest). His electorate is certainly one where the wheat industry is critical to the economic survival of the region. I do not think there would be many in this parliament who would doubt his own bona fides as far as wanting the best outcome for the wheat growers and the wheat industry in Australia. We are dealing here with one of the major rural primary industries in this country. The wheat industry has been the mainstay of many rural communities across the length and breadth of this country-in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales particularly. It is an industry that has made a massive contribution to Australia's economic advancement down through the years. When you look at Australian primary industry and the big industries, the wheat industry is certainly up there. It has undergone massive change over the period of its existence in Australia. At present nobody on the floor of this parliament would doubt the economic significance of it. Australia, of course, is a major exporter of wheat to the rest of the world. We are the fourth largest exporter of wheat, behind the United States, Canada and the Europeans, and we account for some 10 or 11 per cent of world exports. So we are a significant player. Our exports are focused in very key and strategic markets-the Asian markets, with Japan and China, and the Middle East, with Egypt and Iran. It is an industry that is facing significant change to the framework in which it has operated histurically. It is an industry that is under significant pressure externally, from influences such as the World Trade Organisation and the interests of major wheat exporters from other countries, namely the United States, which has some concerns about the framework in which 9150 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 Australia undertakes the export of its wheat products. Internally, the framework in which the industry has operated is also under challenge from competition policy and the imperatives that that puts on the industry. It is an industry that is significant but it is one that is in a process of change and the bill before this House extends the process of change that has taken place. The member for Mallee mentioned that this is an industry with an extraordinary and interesting history in terms of the involvement of government in it and the imperatives that gave rise to that involvement. The federal government's involvement goes back to 1915 with the creation of the Australian Wheat Board. As with the involvement of the federal government in the marketing arrangements of many commodities, that involvement was initially necessitated by the deficiencies that existed in the market at that time, which saw the wholesale exploitation of farmers in a corrupted marketplace, and by unscrupulous merchants. It was the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act of 1948 that set the framework and the objectives for the industry and the legislation that governs it. That particular act had two key objectives which have set the framework for all that has gone on in this industry and the government's involvement in it down through the years. Those objectives were price stabilisation and the maintenance of predictable and consistent returns to farmers, and the establishment of orderly marketing arrangements to ensure that the corrupted marketplaces did not deliver a bad deal to farmers. The political party that I represent in this parliament has a long association with wheat marketing reforms. It was the Wheat Marketing Act 1984, with its key change of altering the guaranteed minimum price arrangements to send more correct market signals to producers, that set the framework for reforms that have taken place over the past 15 years. We saw in 1989 the most significant reforms to wheat marketing arrangements. In those particular reforms, we saw the deregulation of the domestic wheat market through the removal of the Australian Wheat Board's compulsory acquisition powers and the termination of administered domestic pricing arrangements. We saw also a removal of the requirement that there be a majority of growers among board members; the establishment of the Wheat Industry Fund; and the expansion of responsibility of the Australian Wheat Board in its ability to trade in other grains. We are now in another era of reform and, as in the past, the reforms that have been proposed by the previous government and are being pursued by the current government have excited considerable debate among growers of this country, all sections of the industry and within government itself. We are challenged in this new environment that this industry operates in, in the global and domestic sense, to debate fully and to consider fully the arrangements that will propel this industry beyond the year 2000 into the next century. I find it an odd state of affairs that when this particular legislation was brought back into this House there was a Senate legislative committee process already under way to provide wheat growers and others in the industry an opportunity to air their concerns and grievances as far as what is being proposed with this particular restructuring is concerned. There has been sufficient disquiet within the industry for the Senate to approve this hearing process, and those hearings, as you would know, got under way in Canberra last week. These hearings are extremely important to the process of consultation between this parliament and the industry itself. They provide the opportunity for the airing of grievance. They also provide an opportunity for the articulation of new perspectives. They have been an important Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9151 opportunity for many people to highlight potential deficiencies in the marketing and financial structures that are being proposed for the wheat industry in this bill. I mention here the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) to those Senate committee hearings. We acknowledge on this side of the House that the honourable member is somebody with an intimate"" knowledge of the industry. He is someone who has had a long standing interest in it. When the honourable member for O'Connor gets excited about any particular proposals that are being put by any government, I think it is beholden on all of us to sit up and listen to what he has to say. I was interested in the proceedings of the Senate committee hearing on Monday 15 September, when the honourable member for O'Connor had this to say: I doubt the need for this particular piece of legislation in any form whatsoever. It was a fairly strong statement that the honourable member made. I have not read all of the proceedings of that committee, but he has rung an alarm bell. That, in many ways, reflects the diverse opinion within the farming constituencies on the direction of this legislation. There are some concerns and they have been well articulated by the growers themselves before that particular Senate inquiry and certainly by others on the floor of the parliament in this debate. In the light of the matters of concern that have been raised, my suggestion to the minister would be to look, perhaps, at some alternative marketing and financial structures that would overcome some of the concerns and the problems that are being articulated at this point in time. Certainly, I think that on both sides of the House and within the industry there is a consensus on the need to support the concept of the single desk. Certainly growers themselves have expressed, as many of them always have, their concern for the maintenance of grower control over the direction of their industry. Growers have expressed some concerns about accessing their funds in the Wheat Industry Fund, which will provide the capital base when the new companies take over the functions of the Wheat Board. There have been concerns raised about the conflicts of interest that might be generated between providing for the interests of growers and the interests of shareholders who might take equity positions when these particular companies are set up. Those concerns have been articulated and I do not propose to go over them here. In concluding my comments in this debate, let me say that this is a significant industry in this country. It is one which supports rural communities in key states of the Commonwealth and any arrangements that any government makes must be taken after a period of extensive consultation with all the players. I know the history of this industry is one of great conflict within the industry itself over its direction, and there are those who are arguing for a more pronounced deregulation of this industry to put it on a commercial footing and be more accepting of the global realities as well. as domestic realities. However, we on this side of the House will support reasonable arrangements for this industry that are based on the consultative process and on the retention of the single desk, and that do give growers an important say in the future of their industry. ( Mr O'Connor) in this debate on the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill. I endorse much of what he said in this debate, although I think it would be only fair to observe that the member for Corio's claim to have had a certain sort of monopoly on wisdom in the wheat industry on his side of the parliament was just a shade uncharitable, given that the changes that occurred",135,Representatives Main Committee
295,Mr Andrew (Wakefield) (11.17 A.m.),"I am very happy to follow the member for Corio9152 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 in 1984, which I very well remember and in which I participated whilst in opposition, were changes that were supported by the opposition. The member for Corio, while he was not here at the time, would at least have to concede that it was the fact that the opposition was prepared to support the then government, in what were politically difficult changes to make, that made it possible for those changes to proceed. I would indicate as well to the member for Corio that the political difficulties were much more acutely felt on the coalition benches than they were on the government benches of the day because of the way in which the majority of coalition people were representing affected wheat growers. Nonetheless, the member for Corio is perfectly right. Here we have a significant, by any standards, Australian export industry. As the member for Corio has said, we are the fourth largest exporter of wheat around the globe. This significant industry is an industry that has been built following the difficulties that it faced through the early part of this century, an industry that has been built on the proposal of a guaranteed minimum price, giving growers price surety, but not necessarily giving them a sensitivity to marketing arrangements. The changes that have occurred, partly as a result of pressure from the wheat industry and partly as a result of the pressure that we faced from the World Trade Organisation and from the movements into competition policy, have meant that we now have a wheat industry that is obliged not only to be an efficient producer of wheat, in which capacity it has always led the world, but to be an industry that is sensitive to world markets and an efficient marketer as well. There is always a difficulty for any industry at any time with a scheme that guarantees a minimum price, and even greater difficulties with a scheme that guarantees a cost of production. IfI were able, as a legislator, to guarantee a cost of production to agricultural commodity producers and to do it knowing that I was not going to affect their marketing schemes, I would instantly have solved all of the major agricultural problems and I would have every investor in Australia desperate to get into agriculture as a way of guaranteeing forever a return on their investment. It is, as the wheat industry knows, as the wool industry knows, as the dried fruit industry knows, and as the member for Mallee( Mr Forrest) illustrated, simply not possible to guarantee growers the cost of production. Even a guaranteed minimum price tends to send the wrong signals to producers. The wheat industry, under pressure from both the WTO and competition policy, is now going through a major restructure. As I said in my response to the remarks from the member for Corio, I was here in 1984 when we dealt with the first step in this restructure, which was the deregulation of the domestic market for Australian wheat. I recall all of the apprehension that was expressed at the time, much of which has subsequently proved to be unfounded. That is not to be critical of it. It is easy to be wise with the benefit of hindsight. We now have a situation in which we are being pressured to amend our export marketing provisions. This pressure, while it has partially come from the WTO, has been largely resisted by the government but it has wisely agreed that the marketing powers, and the single desk selling arrangements that exist for the Wheat Board, should be retained and should be defensibly retained so long as our competitors have the sort of non-competition sensitive policies that they have. Make no mistake: there are very few growers around the globe as exposed to global realities as are Australian grain growers. So long as our competitors continue Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9153 to thwart the market pressures, as they do by sundry and assorted support mechanisms, we should make no apology for the retention of the single desk. But as part of the commercial reality that is seeping into the wheat industry, as part of the exposure of the wheat industry to the cold winds of market reality, the industry and the government have agreed to restructure the Australian Wheat Board so that we will now have, as other speakers have said, a grower-owned company which will have, through A and B class shareholders, control of a fund to be known as the Wheat Industry Fund, a fund which I understand currently sits at about $440 million. This fund will provide the sort of surety that is needed to enable growers to be paid in advance for the wheat that they are growing. That very technique of paying in advance out of a grower-owned fund means that the reality of the market is not something that the growers are insulated from, because the government will no longer be the insulator that has sat between the growers and the marketplace. There have been some criticisms levelled at the government, and at the way in which we have entertained our involvement with the World Trade Organisation, particularly by the member for Calare( Mr Andren). In participating in this debate, can I say that, uncomfortable as it may be, if we are to continue to be exporters, and if we are to continue to have any sort of say in world export markets, we have no choice but to be participators in the WTO and, through the WTO, in the GAIT agreement as it exists. The simple reality is that, in spite of our predominance in the wheat, grain, and wool industries around the world, we remain participators on the world scene with little more than two per cent of world export trade. That means that, as a nation, we have no levers to pull in world export terms. We cannot adjust the settings. We are largely ignored by our competitors. That is why we choose to be participants in the WTO-not to the disadvantage of all Australian producers, as the member for Calare has suggested, but so that those of our competitors who have in the past manipulated their markets to our disadvantage can now be eyeballed by us around the WTO table. I am the last one to talk about a level playing field. I regret the fact that any such phrase ever entered into the marketing vocabulary, because there is not, and never will be, a level playing field in the corrupt venue of world markets. We should not talk about a level playing field. We should recognise that under the WTO, and under the arrangements that we are talking about today, which allow us to retain some credibility around the WTO table, while there is no level playing field, it is leveller than it has been at any other time in your lifetime or mine. I notice the schoolteacher sitting opposite looking a little bemused at my term 'leveller', and I understand his bemusement. Mr Eoin Cameron-More level. Stirling's remark-than it has been at any other time. WhatI am saying to the member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) is that this is the lesser of the available evils and so we ought to pursue it, uncomfortable as it is. While the WTO has obliged on Australian traders and on the wheat industry, in particular, the changes that we are debating here today, we need also to recognise that our adherence to the WTO has gained for us market access in places which were previously closed to us and has given us the opportunity to eyeball competitors who would otherwise treat us unfairly. We have nothing to apologise for as representatives of the Australian grain growers, but we need to recognise that our competitors have used the present Wheat Board arrangements as",141,Representatives Main Committee
296,Mr Andrew,"For want of a better word, it is more level-picking up the member for9154 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 if they were something that we were accessing to their disadvantage. We are now able to eyeball them and say, 'We have set the industry apart from the government guarantee that was once in place in order to meet our WTO obligations'; and they, too, are obliged to reduce the sundry and assorted protection mechanisms and market restriction mechanisms that they have in place that have been to our disadvantage. As my colleagues know, and as I suspect the member for Port Adelaide knows, there is no shortage of illustrations of those markets that are now open to us, or at least more available to us than they were, under the arrangements that the Minister for Trade( Mr Tim Fischer) has entered into and under the arrangements that previous ministers for trade entered into as well. But we are only able to continue to access those markets while we meet our obligations under the WTO, and the legislation currently before us is one step in meeting some of those obligations. This is legislation that has been controversial. It is legislation that has caused some disquiet in Western Australia. Along with every other member, I am conscious of the comments of the member for O'Connor. I have to say, as a South Australian, that the same sense of apprehension has not existed in my state. In fact, I have had very little lobbying from my constituency, which is largely a wheat growing constituency, about these changes. Most of my growers accept the changes as well-founded. I understand the concern of Western Australian wheat growers, because they are such large contributors to the Wheat Industry Fund, but in participating in this debate it would be wrong for me not to mention the degree to which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) has shown himself prepared not only to listen to but also to heed the concerns of Western Australian growers and, with legislation likely to come in at a later stage, to endeavour to recognise some of the needs they have for further representation. My view of the Senate inquiry referred to by the member for Corio is very simple. I privately think the purpose of the Senate inquiry was largely mischievous-it has obviously suited the purposes of the opposition to refer to it-and the amendment that we currently have to this legislation is equally mischievous. The government is well aware of the concerns of some large wheat growers across the nation, particularly in Western Australia. It is not deaf to thein, and it intends to heed them so far as it is able, without disadvantaging other growers and without making the scheme unworkable. For that reason I support the legislation and believe the amendment to be unnecessary. speak in the Main Committee, that we do not grow very much wheat in Page, being on the north coast of New South Wales. Nevertheless, having been the Minister for Agriculture in the New South Wales government, I have certainly had some involvement with the grains industry across that state. I am well aware of the fact that the Grains Council of Australia has been pushing since 1989 to deregulate the Australian wheat industry in some way and try to make it more modem to compete in the very competitive world that we have just heard about from my good friend the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew). The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 is intended to facilitate the transition of the Australian Wheat Board to a wholly owned subsidiary which will eventually become a corporate body to take over the selling of Australian wheat. I know, and we have heard, that there has been some disagreement and some differences of opinion as to what should be the right structures and how this transition should take place. Having dealt with farmers for quite",143,Representatives Main Committee
297,Mr Causley (Page) (11.29 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to confess, in rising toThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9155 some time, I can assure members that they are very independent people, they all have opinions, and they certainly put those opinions very forcefully. It is a great effort by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, and by Senator Winston Crane, the chairman of the backbench committee. I know Senator Crane has put a lot of work into it. It is a great tribute to those people that we do have a sense of agreement within the industry that this is certainly the right way to go. I should mention something about the single desk selling because I come from primary industry myself and have quite an involvement in it. There is still a great debate going on as to whether under the competition policy single desk selling is anti-competitive. I have some grave concerns about the debate at the present time and the directions that it is taking. I do not disagree with competition and efficiencies. In fact, you have to live with them all the time in industries that are certainly at the mercy of world markets. Australia is at the mercy of world markets because of the fact that we export such huge volumes of our product. In most industries at least 80 per cent of our product is exported to world markets and we are at the mercy of those markets. Nevertheless, we should understand the fact that farmers are not in a position to go out there to barter and bargain with their own product. They really do need a single desk arrangement to get the maximum price for the product that they have. That is not easy because, obviously, when you have a single desk arrangement, there are people within the industry who feel disadvantaged, people who feel that they have a superior product, people who feel they are not getting the maximum for that product and, therefore, probably disagree with the idea that there should be single desk arrangements when selling to the world market. It came home vividly to me, as Minister for Agriculture for New South Wales in 1994, when I had agreed that the rice industry in New South Wales should have single desk status, and the Japanese went through that terrible typhoon in 1994 where, for the first time, they were going to import rice into Japan. I have to say to you that they were not impressed when they came to Australia and found they had to deal with the Australian Rice Board because they had to pay the price that was commensurate with world market price-the maximum world market price. They could not barter and play one off against the other. They could not drag people down to the lowest common denominator. They had to pay true value for the product. I think that is what is lost and what is forgotten in some of the argument about competition policy. It is not policy that is disadvantaging the consumer; it is policy that is advantaging Australia to get the maximum value for products. But, having said that, when you have a single desk arrangement there is a huge responsibility on that body to make sure that it takes into consideration all the niche markets that might be available around the world to maximise the price of the product. That is where some of the argument about it has come in. People have a niche market and they believe they can get more value for that product. Therefore, the Australian Wheat Board, or the new corporation, must take that into consideration and be flexible enough to allow that to occur. I recently had the privilege with the Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to interview members of the Australian Wheat Board and go through with them very carefully the arrangements that they have in place for the selling of Australian wheat.. I think we came away with the opinion that they were across the issues, that they do give licences to independent people who might be accessing some of these smaller markets to maximise the value, and that they are aware of the responsibility that is placed on them 9156 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 because of the single desk arrangement that they enjoy. But, at the end of the day, I believe it is in the interests of the majority, and probably all Australian producers, to see that they are in a very strong position on the world market. The United States of America has been mentioned in this debate and I think that we should say something about that because we are tied to the World Trade Agreement. The World Trade Agreement is certainly valuable because Australia does need to access markets across .the world. It is a valuable agreement as long as people honour that agreement. I have been very disappointed in recent days to see some of the actions of the United States of America. I am in no way surprised because we have seen them do this in the past. They are very aggressive marketers on the world scene; they certainly subsidise in their home production areas; and they use export enhancement programs to market around the world. They cause us extreme pain, in many instances, in these world markets. Because they are a major player, they have a major responsibility to act in a way that is responsible in world markets. It is disappointing, I think, to see some of the actions that they have taken in recent days to inhibit the importation Of products into their country. I note that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, has had something to say about that; it does certainly impinge upon the arrangements that we have. We are doing these things in good faith; we in Australia are trying to abide by the World Trade Agreement. We are trying to be good citizens and to have a free and open marketing system. I think it behoves the United States of America to act the same. I believe that even though my voice is not going to do much to the United States of America, we do have to speak up around the world about what we see as unfair trading. There is a little bit of suspicion in my mind when we see some of the debate on competition policy, because one of the things that worries me is that the debate is often driven by multinational companies. We must watch carefully whether the value that is being reduced on the producing side of some of these industries is in fact transferred across to the consumer. I watch closely some of those, and I start to question whether that is happening. That is one thing that obviously we, as parliamentarians, should be watching closely, because the philosophy of competition policy is that consumers should get a cheaper product. If that is not happening, then we have to ask ourselves, 'Who is gaining from this policy?' If the answer to that is that it is the intermediaries, the big companies, and the people who have the power to manipulate, then I think we should be looking very carefully at what is happening in that particular area. As I said, that leaves farmers in a very vulnerable position. These arrangements have been mooted for a long time. The industry has certainly worked its way through them. They set up a wheat industry fund to make sure that they had reserves available; the minister is now putting in place this enabling legislation so that the transition can take place; they will have reserves; and the industry itself will have control over its own destiny because of the way the structures are framed. In fact, with the A class shares, only wheat growers will be able to get A class shares arid they will elect the majority of the directors; they can keep control. Those shares cannot be transferred. That is very important; we have learnt that lesson in cooperatives in the past. That is a very important part of the whole legislation. As far as I can see, and as far as I have heard from producers generally, there is an acceptance that this is the right way to go and that there are great benefits in it. Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9157 'If the debate continues, and if people are still dissatisfied with this single desk arrangement, my orily suggestion would be for a dual desk arrangement and no further. A dual desk arrangement would in fact put competition into the marketplace. It could be a private competitor competing against the statutory company that we have at present or the corporate entity that is being formed. If there are some concerns about competition, it would inject competition into the marketplace as far as the buying of grains from individual producers is concerned. I think that most of the dissatisfaction is probably in the barley industry, not so much in the wheat industry. I know that there is quite a bit of dissatisfaction in the barley industry about the maximising of values in that industry. As I 'have said before, if there is total deregulation and if the individual growers have the responsibility to go out and market their product, they neither have the time nor the expertise to do that. If that were the case, I am sure that the big companies involved in the buying of grains across Australia would rub their hands in delight because they could then play one against the other, and they would certainly bring prices down, to the lowest common denominator. That is all I want to say about this bill. I congratulate the minister again. I do not believe that the amendment would add anything to this legislation. I believe this is the right way to go. Obviously, as the years progress, there will be more legislation following to ensure that the transition takes place. Motion (by Mr Sawford) agreed to: That further proceedings on the bill be conducted in the House. Family and Community Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 4 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the House take note of the paper. take note of the summary report entitled Aspects of youth suicide. I am pleased to note that I will be followed by my friend and colleague the member for Mallee( Mr Forrest), who is the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. This report, a very small but very dynamic report, flowed from a very successful one-day seminar held in the House earlier this year. Experts in the field were able to paint a very accurate and very clinical picture of the trends in youth suicide: methods chosen by males and females; the differences in the success rates between males and females; the suicide ratecapital city, major urban, major rural, remote towns; hospital separation rates and death rates. It is all. very clinical and all very statistical. The information is there for us members to use as we. seek to compare our Australian figures with those from other countries. The second half of the seminar revolved around the support services provided by a broad spectrum of non-government organisations and was a general, broad ranging and very informative discussion on this very important issue. To my mind this was the key part of the one day seminar.",144,Representatives Main Committee
298,Mr Quick (Franklin) (11.41 A.m.),"'-I am delighted to be able to speak on the motion to9158 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 What did we find? Firstly, Australia has an absolutely appalling record. We are at the wrong end of the spectrum. Australia, the so-called 'lucky country', has a depressing, almost Jekyll and Hyde psyche when it comes to the issue of youth suicide. Evidence was given at the seminar about the complexities of youth suicide. We were asked: do we bring the topic out in the open? By taking this issue out into the light, do we encourage our at-risk youth to attempt to solve their seemingly· insurmountable problems by taking their lives? Will vulnerable friends of a suicide victim copycat the successful suicide if we focus on trying to work through the reasons why the young person took his or her life? As it states in the report on page 7: A major part of building effective suicide prevention programmes is recognising the major factors that affect young suicidal people. This will always be a difficult task, as the factors are myriad and complex and not always obvious to those close to a suicidal young person. That statement is the crux of the whole issue. It worries me and I often ask: why have we got to the stage where our young teenagers find it so difficultto share their feelings and inner fears with their parents, siblings, close friends, teachers or church leaders? Why are so many parents and extended families left wondering after the tragic death of their son or daughter, 'Why did they do it'? It is not just parents, extended family or the deceased peers who wonder why. The teachers who have charge of these young people for probably one-third of every day of their lives are also left wondering why they have not been able to pick up the signs and perhaps been al5le to intervene to provide the necessary counselling which might have prevented the tragedy from occurring. At the seminar, we were informed that there are some significant sociological factors that bear on the possibility of young people attempting suicide. As I read through these, I would ask the people to remember some of the things that have been mentioned in the papers recently. These significant factors are: firstly, a high divorce rate in the country; secondly, a high youth unemployment rate; thirdly, high female employment; fourthly, extremely high alcohol consumption; fifthly, a high number of unwanted pregnancies and, interestingly, sixthly, low church and religious participation. However, it is important to note that these factors are not of themselves the cause of youth suicide, but they are present in countries like Australia, which, as I mentioned, is at the higher and tragic end of youth suicide statistics. The seminar was told that events which can trigger thoughts of suicide and potential suicidal behaviour are: the death of a family member or a close friend; divorce in the family or some other major family upheaval; the break-up of a relationship with a boyfriend or a girlfriend; excessive use of alcohol or some other drugs; physical or. emotionall()neliness; confusion over sexuality, or rejection because of sexuality. And the last one was the issue of contagion: school friends or peers committing suicide; heroes committing suicide, and media reports of other suicides. These are the cold facts. The thing that concerns me most is the human dimension of youth suicide that faces our nation. I am sure .that all of us in this place can recount stories of young people in our electorate who have chosen to try and end their lives-and so many have succeeded. When I returned to my electorate last week, a constituent of mine, a good friend, related the story to me that at the weekend her friend came home unexpectedly and, as it turned out, Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9159 just at the right time. What did she find? She found her teenage son hanging from the ceiling. Because of her unexpected arrival, she happened to be there at the right time. She cut him down and was able to revive him and then take him for medical assistance. Governments of both political persuasions over the years have allocated considerable resources to try and tackle this problem. The Keating government allocated $13 million for the years 1995 to 1999 for the very successful here for life programs. The Howard government has provided an additional $19 million under what they call the national youth suicide strategy. Between them, these two programs have set up a series of services to attempt to address the issue of youth suicide-services such as follow-up for young people presenting to hospitals and health services following self-harm, and support for GPs and health workers to identify, treat and refer young people at risk of suicide. It is interesting to note on page 6 of the report that a survey was done by the Jesuit Social Services, and they found a very mixed result amongst hospitals, both in the Catholic and public systems. And it is amazing to me to read that some hospitals have minimal psychiatric and/or psychological care, and have actually discharged suicidal patients with no counselling or follow-up. That absolutely amazes me. If you had someone, for example, with a rifle involved in some situation of violence there would be immediate reaction and counselling and following up. But because a young person presents at a hospital with slashed wrists or a drug overdose, it is a matter of treat, discharge and you are on your own. Other hospitals have an established process when dealing with young suicidal people, including mental health assessments and appointments with youth workers and their GP. It makes sense. But why have we got this dichotomy between almost total rejection on the one hand and on the other a considered, socially responsible approach to these young people? In our report we made three recommendations which, to me; are pivotal to the government's response. Hopefully, once implemented by this government, and supported wholeheartedly by the community, they will result in Australia finally and successfully addressing this horrendous issue. We did something similar with the horrendous road toll in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s-and look how successful we have been since we adopted a national approach to the road toll. Priority 1, as we saw it, was to establish a national advisory council to provide strategic advice to the minister and the government on youth suicide prevention and related matters. The council should be responsible for creating appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation between governments and the community at state and territory as well as at federal levels. Priority2 states that a research advisory committee should be established to complement the work of the national advisory council on youth suicide prevention. The research committee will be responsible for advising the National Health and Medical Research Council on the management of research projects and research grants, and ensure consistency with national research priorities. Priority3 to me is the key to getting an immediate response. It recommends, firstly, the setting up a depression awareness campaign to educate young people and their support networks on how to recognise depression and get help. That is the key-recognising and treating. Secondly, it recommendstandard procedures for hospitals to adopt when treating a young person presenting with attempted suicide or self-harm injuries. 9160 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 Thirdly-and it has continued to amaze me since I have been a member of this House that we have not done this-it recommends ensuring consistency in data collection at all levels of government. I am absolutely amazed that this just does not happen as a matter of (;ourSe.· When you ask states, it is a mish-mash. Finally, priority 3 recommends an immediate review of current funding, and redirection of some funds to more appropriate and better targeted. programs. There are some excellent programs out there, but they do not have enough in the way of resources, despite the $32 million. Some programs are not working and need to be wiped. I look forward to bipartisan support for our recommendations and hope that our thr-e priorities are implemented by the end of this year. Unless we do, daily we will be hearing stories in our electorate offices of young people, in the prime of their life, taking their lives because of what, to them, are seemingly insurmountable problems. I am sure that my friend the chair of the committee, the member for Mallee, who is sitting opposite and is going to speak after me, will be dealing with the problems faced by young people in the rural areas. It is bad enough in the big cities. Once you get out into the small country towns, there are very few services and there are cutbacks by state governments of all persuasions in hospital and community services. If the services are not there on the ground, it is ridiculous to expect a young person, who probably is not of driving age, to access a service in a country town 60 or 70 kilometres away. They need the service in their country town. I look forward to the government responding as quickly as possible. Hopefully, by the end of this year we can have those three priorities from Aspects of youth suicide adopted and we can say to our young people, 'We are going to do something for you.' say, from listening to previous speakers and looking at the long speaking list, that there would not be a member in this House who has not been involved, either as a family member, relative, associate, good friend or parent, with this tragedy of suicide. I am really pleased to be following the member for Franklin( Mr Quick) on the speaker list and I am going to refer to the member for Franklin and me in terms of what is a key element in resolving this difficulty. The member for Franklin and I enjoy a good relationship. Somehow we have been able to find a way to bridge the dreadful political void that we often see and experience in the chamber. There are a couple of reasons for that. The mother of the member for Franklin lives in Nhill in my electorate and she reminds me very much of my own mum. WheneverI am going through I always like to drop in and have a cup of tea with her. She is always full of good advice. That is one reason. The second reason is that I am now elevated to the lofty status of chairing the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs which was responsible, under the previous chairmanship of the honourable member for Fisher( Mr Slipper), for conducting a seminar earlier in the year and producing the report which we are commenting on here again today. Attending that seminar and in the discussions we have had since, we are reminded again of the tragedy that families experience, having to go through self-doubt and questioning. Parents of young people especially go through the dreadful self-doubt of 'What did I do wrong? It must be my fault,' when very much of what occurs is a mismatch of a society that I think has lost its way a bit. I know the report speaks about every age group and in every age group the issue is awful. But my heart is with the youngsters. These are future Australians",147,Representatives Main Committee
299,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (11.54 A.m.),"This issue of youth suicide involves us all. I wouldThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9161 who somehow have lost themselves and have sought to end it all as the only option, when really; With the opportunity we have, they should be positive about their future. They should have facilities in their own sense of self-security to deal with life's difficulties. Nobody wants to pretend that life is not going to be difficult and that"" there are not going to be crises to confront. For example, there is going to be the first time the most precious gem in your life rejects you at the age of 16 and wants to go out with somebody else. We need somehow to find a way to undergird our youngsters and warn them that this is going to happen and that dealing with rejection is something you need to develop strategies for. The thing that alarms me is having been close to where a young man committed suicideonly 30 metres from where I slept across the street; we were neighbours. People said they did not see it coming. I think that the clue to resolving all of this is to have some obvious triggers learned by people across the community because we are all going to be part of this. I support the member for Franklin's plea for complete non-partisanship in respect of this. I really appreciate the very positive way in which members have spoken already and their response to what our committee has put on paper and tabled in the parliament. I would like to make reference to my own 16-year-old daughter who last Saturday night brought home a friend of hers from school. They have developed into really good friends. I had had a busy week in parliament; if you remember what happened last week, all I wanted was a nice quiet night at home to relax and have an early night. But she was concerned about this friend who has already made three attempts to commit suicide. In a sort of desperate plea I said, 'Honey,I don't need this.' But we put the time in. We made an investment. Her attitude was, 'Dad, I just want to love this person. I love this person and I want you to help me help her.' If we can find a way to trigger that kind of caring concern amongst the school community and amongst the adult community, then I think we will all have achieved a great deal towards addressing the tragedy. The seminar provided a real focus for the preparation of the report. I do not want to focus as much as the member for Franklin has done on the alarming nature of the statistics that are presented there but we have to accept the fact that in the last 30 years the suicide rate for males has trebled and the suicide rate for females has doubled. I do not want to make that the focus, I want to make the solutions the focus. Our report very clearly, with a priority one rating, recommended: That a National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention be established to provide strategic advice to the Minister and the Government on youth suicide prevention and related matters. That will involve the whole community. I hope that the examples given by the member for Franklin and me might provide some lead. There have been in excess of 25 suicides in my electorate in the four years I have been the federal representative. My observation is that there has to be a caring, concerned group of people who have some insight into the body language and the emotional state that causes somebody to take this step. Those troubled people have to be embraced in a caring community, a caring environment, and they have to feel wanted and needed. It is as simple as that. It is not. complicated. It is not about spending millions of dollars on research and psychoanalysis; it is simply about ensuring that people feel that they are needed and that somebody cares about them. If they have an emotional crisis, whether it be the tragedy of losing someone they have loved, or the tragedy of being rejected by their first girlfriend, they need assistance. We have all experienced the latter. Infact, in my time. I have had quite a few. 9162 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 One needs some strategies to deal with that because rejection is something that human beings have a great deal of difficulty in coping with. The only mechanism to cope with it is if people have a sense of well-being about themselves, that they have a regard for themselves as being a person of worth, and that involves a view that can only come from inside a person, almost like their soul, so that they feel good about themselves. Even though somebody else might reject them, they know in here that they are of some worth. It is very much a relationship environment that reinforces that for· people. I saw it happening in my own home last weekend and I can only hope that I can play some part in the bigger picture to extend that very simple example from my own lounge room to the parliament, that we find the key. In trying to deal with 25-plus suicides, I have found that it affects everybody in my office. In fact, I have said to my staff, 'Do not take any chances if you get a distressed phone call.' On one occasion I jumped in my car and drove 200 kilometres to be there within a few hours, and I am glad I did. It was somebody who was feeling desperate, but all they needed was somebody to take action to share this terrible burden that they had. It turned out to be caused by a government department putting them under enormous, pressure, and it was ultimately resolved. We now have a very happy family there. It will involve us all. I am very pleased to hear the comments of members in this debate. This report has been on the table now for quite a considerable time. It gives us cause to reflect and see what other members are saying. I am very pleased to support the remarks of the deputy chairman, the member for Franklin, and I am looking forward to a very positive response from the government. I urge it to consider the recommendations in the committee's report; adopt them, and proceed from there. for Mallee( Mr Forrest) so lucidly and compassionately portrayed to the House. He shares the view I have that basically, whilst many solutions may be put forward to address the issue of suicide per se-both youth suicide and suicide by older persons-people have a strong desire to feel needed, to feel that they are loved, and to feel that they have some worth and role in life. If that can be addressed by greater one-to-one counselling, of the kind that occurs in sections of my electorate of Isaacs, primarily through the work of people like Andrew Humphreys, then I am sure that we will, as the member for Franklin( Mr Quick) has said, in adopting a national approach be able to gradually address this most tragic issue that blights our modem society. In fact, not only does it blight our society but in many ways it is perhaps one of the most difficult to tackle. The member for Mallee submitted to the chamber an analysis of statistics that deals with the topic that is both alarming and confronting. From a local perspective, the figures are indeed quite shocking. They are particularly concerning in the south-eastern coastal regions of Melbourne. Let me relate to the Committee figures for the Mornington Peninsula. The rate of suicide is more than twice the state yearly average amongst men. There are some 24.9 per 100,000 male suicides in this region each year, while the average for the rest of Victoria is some 11.2 deaths per 100,000. The picture in the Frankston area is equally as bleak. The number of men taking their own lives annually is 16.6 per 100,000-again, a figure that is well above the state average for the rest of Victoria. . In Cranbourne, where my electoral office is located, as at the end of July this year, nine young people under the age of 25 had committed suicide. This figure is triple the number of",150,Representatives Main Committee
300,Mr Wilton (Isaacs) (12.05 P.m.),"I rise to paint a similar picture to that that the memberThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9163 deaths that occurred in Cranbourne in the previous three years. The city of Kingston is a municipality that covers much of the federal electorates of Hotham and Isaacs. Suicide claimed the lives of 67 young people in the-city of Kingston in 1995, which is up from 45 in the previous year, 1994. While the picture on a local perspective is quite bleak, the story is similar at an international level. When recently reading the Victorian task force report on suicide prevention, I was most unsettled to learn that it is estimated that in recent years nearly one million people on this planet take their own lives each year. Suicide has consistently remained one of the top 10 causes of death in developed countries in recent history. While I applaud every aspect of the findings of this most worthy report; I disagree to some extent with the focus on the issue of youth suicide. The biggest group of people committing suicide in society is men aged 25 to 60. Without in any way demeaning the problem of youth suicide, it is clear that, from any objective analysis of the data, the risk to young men does not really commence until they reach the age of 19. I have referred to Mr Andrew Humphreys. Andrew is a youth crisis counsellor at the Chelsea Community and Information Support Centre and has been at the forefront locally of tackling the prickly issue of the high male suicide rate. Andrew points out that, while seven per cent of suicides are teenagers-and this is not an insignificant component-the biggest proportion of deaths does, however, fall in the category of men aged 25 to 60. An interesting point that Mr Humphreys makes is that the suicide rate for boys when they leave school accelerates, because that is the last time that they enjoy any form of day-to-day social interaction and day-to-day social support from friends or peer groups on a regular basis. From the extensive research that has taken place over the last five years, as this problem has been brought out into the open, it becomes apparent that, again as succinctly submitted by the member for Mallee, men kill themselves due to an inability to cope with life events such as relationship break-ups of the kind that both he and myself have suffered, and unemployment. On the topic of marriage or relationship break-ups, Mr Pierre Baume, head of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention, is on the public record as saying that in a study of some 4,000 male suicides over 70 per cent were caused by relationship break-ups and men's subsequent inability to come to terms with the situation. Again as submitted by the member for Mallee, that is a time when men most feel alone, most feel unloved, and most feel that they have got no place in this world. Clearly, another major cause of suicide is unemployment. An Australian Institute of Criminology research paper into the causes of suicide has shown that a correlation exists between suicide rates and periods of economic turmoil. For instance, during the Great Depression Australia had extremely high male suicide rates. Another example of the effect of economic insecurity affecting the incidence of suicide was the 1987 stock market crash. In the six months after this event, suicide rates were up by 15 per cent. Other factors include separation from children, childhood trauma and learning disabilities. But as a rule, it is men who cannot talk about their problems, and there are too few services available to them-especially, as the members for Franklin and Mallee have outlined, in Australia's rural and regional areas. Men are often turned away by the all too few support agencies that are there to help, because those services are burdened with other cases. 9164 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October '1997 The discrepancy between male and female, suicide rates has increased during the last 30, yeats and; as those two members have previously indicated, this difference is greatest in rural areas; The overall ratio between males aildfemale suicides is' four to one; and the youth ratio is Jive to one. Men in particular have nowhere to go. Access to counselling services' which have a specific focuspn combating the propensity for rpale suicide-s sadly lacking, and this needs to be addressed. The way social supports have been dramatically improved over the last 20 years for battered womenprbvides a good blueprint for what needs to be done. We must tailor our community support services to tackle specific problems, rather than trying a sweeping, 'broad brush; generalised approach, which will inevitably mean that many seeking help will feel alienated. Some quite urgent changes do need lobe made if we are to cut the number of self-induced deaths in our society, especially amongst the most vulnerable in our ,society , those being males. We must extend counselling services within our community to target groups that are not being serviced, and I suggest that tharis primarily men in the 25 to 60 age bracket. As an extension of this, it is important that we up-skill social, workers in appropriate assessment and counselling techniques, which have been so sadly lacking in the past. ""There must be greater education for both doctors and health service providers within the community about the risk factors which can lead to suicide amongst older men. As theniember for Mallee has said, this does not mean ,thar we embark on huge psychoanalytical research papers as to whY these things happen' That is not needed. Doctors rieed to be trained in skilling themselves as to, why these events occur, based on people's lack of self-worth at the times at which they are most likely to take their own lives. Among the lesser known statistics about suicide in Au strali a are the high levels committed amongstolder men between the ages of 65 and 69. In 1995, there were 15.2 deaths per 100,000 people for men and 3.27 deaths per 100,000 people for 'women. It is important that, as an institution, parliament should take a closer look at the hidden' categories of suicide in Australia. The fact is that until we, as, a society, are open"" and informed about suicide in the most vulnerable of categories-again amongst older males-the pattern of death will no doubt continue unabated. A positive aspect to the debate about youth suicide is that we are probably much more capable of tackling this tragedy on, a natiomil basis, as the member for Franklin has quite rightly submitted, now that the problem is dut in the open arid that people are rightfully aware of it. Ilis to be hoped that in this country such an enlightened apprOach can now be extended to other forms of suicide which are perhaps less readily acknowledged. While it is perhaps a little too early for'extensive statistical evidence to be processed, the anecdotaL evidence that! have received froih people in my electorate is that theincreasing focus on gambling in Melbourne has led io'fim'tncial problems, in marly families. Sometimes the tragic consequences of these strains has resulted in suicide. Figures released by the coroher's office reveal that the number of gambling related suiCides has steadily increased since ,1992. It is of concern to me that,while over $1 billion is flbwing into the state government coffers in Victoria from gambling'revemie each year, only about $40 million has beeI1 spent on problems with gambling services over the last five years. If we are to tackle the incidence of suicide in society, the issue of problemganibling' must be addressed. I applaud and welcome with open arms the fine efforts of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and its summary report on aspects Thursday, 2 October .1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 9165 of youth suicide. I am hopeful that the positive work done by the committee in forma1isinthis report will act as a catalyst for more research into the various other aspects of suicide which, to date, have not been given the amount of attention that I would suggest they so rightfully deserve. While some factors which lead to suicide are quite hardto quantify, there is certainly a need for our community to work towards an environment in which people feel a sense of belonging and meaning, as the member for Mallee has hit upon so accurately. If we can achieve such a state, then the incidence of all suicides-young or old, male or female-will no doubt be reduced. Unfortunately, it is very hard to create a sense of belonging for people that transcends individual needs and material things in a society which is increasingly obsessed with individual self-advancement and the attainment of material goods. I just conclude by stating .that, if we can tackle some of the fundamental problems in society, such as the quality of education, unemployment and job security, then there will no doubt be a flow-on to reduced family breakdowns and, by extrapolation, fewer suicides. Unless we as a society can tackle the fundamental problems and causes of angst in a way that the member for Mallee has suggested, then all the programs in this world and all the heartfelt words of compassion from politicians like the member for Franklin and the member for Mallee will indeed not change a thing. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12.19 p.m.)-I rise to speak about the seminar that was held here earlier this year; which I attended representing the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge). The symptoms of depression have been recognised since antiquity. The Old Testament describes King Saul suffering from a depressive illness and Homer's Iliad gives us the story of Ajax's suicide. Hippocrates actually used the terms 'mania' and 'melancholia' to describe mental disturbances and other Roman physicians like Celsus and Galen also discovered melancholia. In fact, some of Durer's woodcuts dealt specifically with the subject of melancholia. Closer to home, in Australia, those who are familiar with Michael Leunig's excellent cartoons will have seen often that a lot of them actually depict depression. He will often have one of his characters in a small, dark room with a tiny window with justa little bit of light coming in. About five years ago, I heard Michael Leunig speak at the art gallery in South Australia. He talked then, amongst other things, about youth suicide and about how, particularly in Perth, there had been a cluster of suicides that had occurred at one of the private schools there. He described his own sufferiQg that he had had with depression and how. it had translated into his work. It has often been noted that Australia has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the world; and it is truly atragedy that suicide occurs as commonly amongst 15to 24-year-olds as does death resulting from motor vehicle accidents. Thirty years ago, no-one would have ever believed that the number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents would be almost the same as that from youth suicides. What has happened is that a very efficient public health strategythrough changing people's behaviour with the wearing of seat belts, with random breath testing anq with checking people's speeds-has led to a change in behaviour and a rapid decline in the number of 15to 24-year-olds who die in motor vehic1e accidents. Unfortunately, we have also seen a two to three times increase, since 1970, in the number of young males who are killing themselves. 9166 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 As far as suicide attempts go, there are almost equal numbers between male and female, but the attempts by young males are often more successful; something like nine times as many young males will actually successfully complete suicide as opposed to females. For every successful suicide attempt, there is something like 40 to 100 unsuccessful bids. What is particularly significant about that is that the No. 1 predictive factor-more than any other factor-of whether someone will actually commit suicide is a previous suicide attempt. Why do we lead the OECD in youth suicide rates, and why is it particularly high in rural and regional areas amongst our indigenous population? The reasons people attempt or commit suicide are unavoidably complex. While certain sociological influences and mental health background are factors, often the family and friends of the people who commit suicide just cannot recognise what the catalyst was that caused their friends to take their own life. As the speakers in the seminar highlighted, mental health problems and sociological factors can combine to induce a severe state of depression which, if undetected and untreated, may result in suicidal behaviour. One of the real tragedies of youth suicide is that this depression is completely treatable. The real tragedy is that often the depressive symptoms are not detected and not treated. The cost that that imposes on us as a society is that we are losing part of a cohort of Australia's future. Professors Cosky and Goldney, in a 1994 study, found that 90 per cent of people who actually committed suicide had evidence of psychiatric illness beforehand. One of the advances that I think we could see in public health would be people being able to recognise the symptoms of depression in their family members, and friends recognising symptoms of depression. Often it is very hard, especially amongst adolescents, to know what is normal adolescent behaviour and what is actually depressive behaviour. Amongst adolescents, depressive illness can be manifest in things like poor academic performance. It can be manifest in drug abuse, antisocial behaviour, sexual promiscuity, truancy and running away. They are all some of the symptoms of depression amongst adolescent children. A mnemonic to remember the symptoms and signs of depression which I was taught at medical school was 'in sad cages'. That was a very useful way of remembering how people manifest with depression: 'i' was for a loss of interest; 's' was for suicidal ideation; 'a' was for appetite-they often have disordered appetite or complete loss of appetite; 'd' was for depression; 'c' was for lack of concentration; 'a' was for affect-their whole mood was blunted; 'g' was for feelings of guilt; 'e' was for energy; and's' was for suicidal ideation. One of the greatest advances in the area of mental health will be when people recognise it, just as people recognise that when they have chest pain it is a good idea to get to a hospital as soon as possible or that if they are passing too much urine they may have diabetes. It would be useful if people realised that, if their appetite and sleep are disordered or if adolescents are particularly antisocial-perhaps more than normal-it may be something that is treatable without any sort of stigma. Countries with high youth suicide rates-and the member for Isaacs( Mr Wilton) touched on this-have exhibited sociological factors such as high divorce rates, high youth unemployment, excessive alcohol consumption and low religious participation levels. Perhaps all of those could categorise Australia. They also apply to New Zealand, Canada and northern Europe. What we actually need in Australia is a coordinated program which includes things like primary prevention activities. They are just activities focusing on having a healthy school Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9167 environment and on having strong families that actually encourage and nurture the individuals within them. Another area is media strategy. One of the problems with the reporting of suicides in the media is that it has been shown in research that it leads to an increase in suicide rates, especially if there are reports of, say, the hopelessness of people who commit suicide or the method used for the suicide. What is actually needed is for the media to focus on how treatable the depressive and sociological factors can be and also how these people can get help. Other programs could involve: restricting access to the methods; such as firearms, particularly common in rural areas; school based programs; targeted intervention for high risk individuals-those individuals who are already displaying symptoms of mental illness and those individuals who have already actually attempted suicide-and professional training for all health professionals, including medical practitioners, so that they are able to recognise who is at risk from suicide and who needs follow-up after an episode of self-injury or suicidal behaviour. In addition, personal events which may appear insignificant to the outside world can often have a huge impact on young people and can trigger suicidal thoughts or behaviour. Those personal factors can include: the loss or death of a family member or friend; major family upheavals such as divorce or remarriage; relationship break-ups with boyfriends or girlfriends; isolation from other people both physically-a problem in rural and remote areas-and emotionally, such as having few friends or.low social skills; excessive use of alcohol or other drugs; confusion over sexuality or rejection because of sexuality; and contagion-that is the idea of media contagion where you are surrounded by either friends who suicide or rock band heroes such as Kurt Cobain of Nirvana or media images of people who have committed suicide. It is worth noting that copycat suicide is not a new phenomenon. Two hundred years ago, Goethe wrote a book, The Sorrows of Young Werther, which was about a young German' hero who did commit suicide. That book was banned in several European countries after young men across Europe were killing themselves either dressed in the manner of Young Werther or with the page in the book open at the part where he killed himself. What is modern, however, is the concern that is shared by counsellors, youth workers and researchers alike, that suicide is becoming a more acceptable problem solving option in our society, a notion which is reinforced by media coverage and television and film dramatisation. At the seminar, Associate Professor Pierre Baume pointed out the large amount of information on the Internet on how to commit suicide. There is not much we can do about actually controlling the information which is on the Internet, but it is important that that negative information on the Internet must be also counteracted by positive information about the .early intervention or' treatment· of depression. One project which was just recently launched at Flinders University in my electorate of Boothby deals with the early identification and treatment of mental health problems in children and young people, and that project will-be jointly managed by Dr Graham Martin of Flinders University and Professor Bob Cosky of the University of Adelaide, who was one of the participants in the seminar. Funded urider both the national mental health strategy and the national youth suicide prevention strategy, AusEInet II will establish a national communications network to provide information to services, researchers and policy makers in this area. It will also develop best practice models of early intervention for the mental health of children 9168 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 and young people. Divided into three streams, AusEInet will focus on research, reorientation. and relevance. Having spoken with both Dr Martin and Professor Cosky, I am confident that a networkwill·· be established which will have national coverage to make sure that as many people as possible working in this area will have access to the information. Particularly encouraging is that the outcomes of the national youth suicide prevention strategy projects will also be disseminated through a clearing house set up under AusEInet II. Youth suicide is an ongoing tragedy in Australian society. I commend the organisers for the aspects of youth suicide seminar for addressing this problem and granting it the urgency and· importance that it deserves. . at Cessnock's John's Anglican Church for 21-year-old Jason Bambach. Jason had taken his life the Saturday night before. As is usually the case, Jason appeared to have the world at his feet and appeared happy. He was a gifted footballer who, lam advised, had been approached by the Newcastle Knights. Typically, what went wrong in Jason's mind will probably remain a mystery. My sympathy goes to Cessnock's Jack and Kay Bambach and theiffamilies. Jason Bambach is likely to be just one of more than 400 15to 21-year-olds who will commit suicide in Australia this year. Many more of course will fail in their attempt. Most of those 400 or more have been, or will be, on a proportional basis, from rural and regional Australia-just like Cessnock's Jason Bambach. There are now three times more young males committing suicide in Australia than was the case in the 1960s. For young females the number has roughly doubled. One of the great mysteries for me is why the suicide rate in Australia appears higher than compared with other developed nations. What does not surprise me is that so many suicides occur in rural and regional Australia. The Commonwealth spends more than $30 million annually on youth suicide prevention. Much of that money goes to the national youth suicide strategy, which has allocated some $6 million over three years for rural and regional youth counselling services; $6 million to Lifeline and the Kids Help Line; some $3 million for parental programs developed by the Department of Health and Family Services; some $2 million for the education and training of professionals, such as doctors and other health workers, and school teachers; and $1 million over three years for child mental health research, which is designed to at least attempt to determine the factors that lead to suicide amongst our youth. But while I commend the commitment of both sides of parliament, both the present government and the former Labor government, to the funding of these programs, in a senseand I do not say this disparagingly-all but the last of the allocations I mentioned is somewhat reactive in its nature. They are commendable, appropriate and essential, but they are somewhat reactive. We will only begin to make ground against this terrible social ill when we get on top of the larger economic issues in this nation. Chief amongst those is unemployment and economic decline in rural and regional Australia, which, in large part, indicates why youth suicide is higher in rural and regional Australia than is the case in our metropolitan areas. People in rural and regional Australia are continually told that trade liberalisation, competition policy, financial deregulation and privatisation are all good for them. If that is true, and if it is true that all of those reforms lead to higher or faster economic growth, those living in rural and regional Australia are entitled to ask: where is our dividend? Whereis the",152,Representatives Main Committee

Where are the greater transport and telecommunications links? These are communities which are dying. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that in your own area, in Coffs Harbour and surrounding areas, the unemployment rate is very high, as is the case in the lower part of my electorate. These communities are experiencing what the experts describe as dynamic decline. It is a vicious circle, usually precipitated by the withdrawal of a reasonably large industry in the town or, indeed, the withdrawal of a government department or the withdrawal of a bank. The withdrawal leads to job losses. Family incomes decline as a result. Consumer spending falls. Other businesses in tum close and further jobs go. Those who can afford to, or who have the ability to, exit the town. Those who are aged or infirm, or who do not have any job prospects in metropolitan Australia, in the cities, remain. The largest industry in the community becomes the local social security office-and even they are now going as well. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report titled Aspects of youth suicide is a good report, one that I am sure will go a long way to addressing this terrible social problem. I congratulate the committee on the establishment of the forum held in February. I enjoyed reading the report which came from it. But a comfortable society is a working society, and a greater commitment to jobs by government in this country must come now. It is now not just desirable; it is essential. Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs with a great deal of interest. Obviously the problem we have in our country with youth suicide is a very serious one indeed. This report, and the seminar which led to it, is a very worthwhile contribution to our understanding in this country of the serious nature of the problem that we face. Unfortunately, as with many of the serious problems we have in our country, it seems to me that we talk a lot about them without actually doing much about them. What we seem to do is to talk about what the problem is and then very often seek to rationalise it or put bandaids on it, rather than getting to the fundamental causes of the problem and doing something about it. I suspect-and I am not trying to be unkind,. because I really do believe this is a valuable contribution-that already we have seen a reaction to this report and to the problem that again seems to me to some extent to be not getting to the fundamental causes of the problem. We have a national youth suicide prevention program in place which will result in the expenditure of a large amount of money. It seems as though the reaction to a problem often is to spend a lot of money on it, and the more money you put into it somehow that is a greater recognition of the extent of the problem. The solution to some of these problems is money. The solution to many problems is resources, and that certainly has been the reaction to this problem, with a strategy that allocates millions of dollars to rural and regional youth counselling services, millions of dollars to Lifeline and Kids Help Line, millions of dollars to programs for parents, millions of dollars for a youth suicide prevention and education and training program and so on. I am not condemning that expenditure of money, and it may be helpful. I am sure it could be demonstrated that those things are going to be helpful, but the point is that this report very clearly identifies the causes of the problem. I think Associate Professor Baume's contribution was a very worthwhile one. I know him and I believe the work that he does in this particular",158,Representatives Main Commiitee
302,Mr Bradford (Mcpherson) (12.38 P.m.),"I read the report of the House of9170 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 area, particularly his desire to establish a national approach to the collection of data, is very worthwhile. He identifies in his contribution the causes of the problem, and these are they: a high divorce rate, high youth unemployment, high female employment-that is interesting and I will deal with each of these in turn-extremely high alcohol consumption, a high number of unwanted pregnancies and low church or religious participation. The first problem that Professor Baume identifies is a high divorce rate. I just want to note that. An article came across my desk yesterday which summarises the extent of that problem as well as any other document. The number of divorces in Australia has quadrupled over the past 20 years. Last year, Australia had the highest divorce rate since no-fault divorce laws were introduced in 1976. We have also recorded the lowest number of marriages per capita this century. Last year, Australia had the third highest divorce rate in the world, 2.9 per 1,000 people, just behind America with 4.6 and the United Kingdom with 3.0. If we acceptProfessor Baume makes the point and I think the report reinforces it-that there is a correlation between youth suicide rates and divorce rates, then part of the answer to the problem obviously is to look at the problem of divorce in Australia because it is such a big problem. When we look at what we are doing about that, one wonders whether our response to that problem is strong enough. At the moment we are talking about making some changes to the Child Support Agency. They are long overdue for those who have been dealing with that particular bureaucracy for a long time. But, again, in a sense they are not the solution to the problem. The Child Support Agency's problems are a product of the high divorce rate in Australia. Even with the wisdom of Solomon, it has become evident to those who have confronted this problem over the years that it is almost insoluble. Ironically, it was Solomon who demonstrated his wisdom, as I recall the story; in the first place by dealing with a custody problem-and his solution was to cut the child in half. Of course, that in a sense solved the problem. I will not go into the story because there is probably not the time here this morning for bible stories. But it is instructive. We have a problem with divorce, which then leads to our problem with the Child Support Agency bureaucracy. If we did not have the huge divorce problem then we would not have as many problems as we have in picking up the pieces. The problems associated with the level of divorce in Australia can be solved, and that is where our emphasis ought to be. I am not going to speak at great length about that today. It is something I have spoken about quite a bit in the past, but we have to look at the law. As I said earlier, since the no-fault divorce law was introduced in 1976, we have had this huge escalation, this quadrupling, in the amount of divorce. I am not going to argue here, and nor have I argued in the past, that we wind back the clock to pre-1976, but we have to recognise that since 1976 we have got this problem. We are dealing with that particular fact. It has occurred largely because we have made divorce too easy. I recall Archbishop Hollingworth in Brisbane being asked once what he would do about the problem, and his response, when he thought about it for a moment, was very good. He said that he would make marriage more difficult to get into and more difficult to get out of. That is part of the solution to divorce. Lest colleagues opposite, or even on my side, start getting excited, as some of them do, and particularly some of our female colleagues who are of that bent, and say, 'What you want to do is get more women chained to the kitchen sink and be subservient to their husbands', and all that sort of garbage that we hear trotted out when you make these sorts of suggestions, the Thursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9171 fact is that it is too easy for people in the current situation to simply walk away from a contract that is entered into solemnly. No other contracts can be walked away from so easily. We enter into commercial contracts that have sanctions attached, and important as they might be, they are not as important as a life contract that involves the care and nurture of children, in most cases. Despite that, people can suddenly decide today, 'I'm tired of this relationship; I want to find the new me; I want to experience new horizons', and so out the door they go. The CSA is knocking on the door the next day and, of course, it is all downhill from there. There is a connection between high divorce rates, as Professor Baume points out, and the high rate of youth suicide. When we understand that fact and look at all the counselling services, all the millions of dollars that we are expending on worthwhile things, as they might appear to be, we will come to understand that money will not solve the problem. We need to get to the core of the problem in our country and realise that marriage as an institution needs to be revitalised and that we need to re-establish the importance of it as a fundamental relationship. We need to stress the importance of families, which is something I speak about in this place quite often, as the fundamental unit in our society . We need to start supporting marriage and placing value on it and making it more difficult for people to walk away from without sanction. That is the underlying thing. You talk about a contract. This is a relationship you can walk away from without any sanctions. It is not a question of who has caused the problem. I am not arguing that we go back to the days before no-fault divorce law, but I am talking about people accepting responsibility for their actions. In this particular case there is no responsibility accepted for people's actions. There can be a lot done to reduce the rate of divorce in this country. It is often observed that we also make it very easy for people to get married. I suppose the law reinforces the view that 'We will give it a go. If it does not work, then under the law we can just walk away,' which is no way to enter into such a solemn and important and fundamental contract. That is why there is the need to make sure people understand, through the benefit of premarital counselling and other such opportunities, the importance of what they are doing. I will make a point that I have made before: just look at how much money we spend picking up the pieces after divorce. We spend billions of dollars, one way or another, picking up the pieces after a divorce, whereas we spend so little at the front end, on educating people to understand what the nature of marriage is and providing them with ongoing help and counselling. Let us get serious about fixing divorce and then we will be addressing one of the fundamental causes of youth suicide. There is no doubt that children suffer from divorce. The trendy view in recent years has been that a good divorce is better than a bad marriage, that kids are okay and that it is a bit like influenza: they will cough and splutter for a few days and then get on with their lives. But the fact is that they do not. Kids suffer from divorce. They suffer not just for a short period of time: the evidence I have seen indicates that they suffer for the rest of their lives. Their children are also likely to suffer because of the impact the divorce has had on their parents. It goes through a number of generations. Kids are hurt by divorce, and ultimately that is what will lead, in some cases, to kids becoming so desperate that they will want to end their agony by unfortunately taking their own lives. 9172 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 I thought this particular report was useful because it reinforces our understanding of the connection between divorce and youth suicide. I want to make a plea for us to get serious about fixing up the fundamental problem rather than thinking that we should spend more money on all of these other things. As worthwhile as they may appear to be, they will not solve the problem. It is interesting that we are very keen to stop people smoking because we realise smoking is a health hazard. I make the point very clearly that divorce is a health hazard for our kids. It also makes life harsher for our kids. Kids these days, I think, have a much harsher childhood than perhaps kids of my generation did. Our parents, as I recall, looking back at my own childhood, may not have got on terribly well the whole time but, in the end, they were very good parents and they stayed together till death parted them. I think we have benefited enormously from that. Kids today, faced with divorce rates of the magnitude that we are talking about, are faced with a very much harsher and more difficult childhood, and that, as we recognise, may lead to an increase in the rate of youth suicide. I recently read a book by David Blankenhorn, who visited Australia recently, called Fatherless America. While Mr Blankenhorn was here he did a number of interviews during which he talked about America and the importance of fathers to young men. Of course, divorce very often separates boys from their fathers, and we understand the reason for that happening. Mr Blankenhorn said that over 40 per cent of America's children do not live with their fathers, and I suspect that those sorts of percentages are almost being reached in Australia. Before they reach the age of 18, more than half of our nation's children will spend at least some of their childhood growing up without a father in their home. Nearly half of all children living apart from their fathers have not seen them in the previous year. More than 30 per cent of all children today are born to unmarried women. (Time expired) Corio( Mr O'Connor) of the opportunity to make a contribution I briefly want to respond to the very correct observation by the member for Isaacs( Mr Wilton). He quite rightly asked: 'Why is so much of the focus of this report on youth suicide?' The answer is that it was the first initiative of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. However, I would like to advise him, and all members, that as recently as last Friday, in this very chamber, we had a seminar on men's health. I assure the member for Isaacs that, very clearly, the overwhelming evidence collected will show that-the Hansard will be available as soon as it is approved-adult male suicide is very much a men's health problem, which was his quite correct observation. I am very pleased with the activities of the committee and we are very hopeful that shortly we will be able to present, on the table, a report in respect of that particular activity. With the environment of the competitive edge and economic pressures, males are suffering very much from this serious issue, and the member for Isaacs was quite correct to raise his concern. I assure him that it will be addressed. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (12.55 p.m.)-I congratulate the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for this initiative and for the excellent report it has produced, Aspects of youth suiCide.

303,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (12.53 P.m.),"by leave-Not wanting to cheat the member forThursday, 2 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 9173 attacked not only by state and federal governments but by the community generally. The community is aware of it and is tackling it, certainly in my electorate. Some of the statistics just staggered me, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the statistics quoted here, in 1995 there were 350 suicides by young males and 84 by young females. That is a staggering loss to this nation if that particular statistic is repeated over time. Rates of suicide per 100,000 of population show that since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicides has almost trebled, and for young males in Australia between 1979 and 1995 there has been a fivefold increase in deaths arising from hanging. They are extraordinary statistics, and the report quite correctly homes in on the fact that this problem is endemic in rural and regional areas. In my particular state we reflect the statistics that are contained in this report. Suicide rates for males have increased dramatically in Victoria, ftom 5.6 per 100,000 in 1964 to 22.9 per 100,000 in 1995. That is an appalling and staggeting increase. While deaths by suicide are most common among males; suicide attempts are most common among women. Here we must look to the causes of this situation-not only why many young people are attempting suicide, but why it is that many females attempt but do not go through with the act, while many males do it and lose their lives. I guess many in this house have had experience of suicide and youth suicide. I go back to my time before entering this parliament. When I returned to the farm on the death of my father . in 1979 I was asked by a local Catholic. school to teach part time while I was working on the farm. I spent a lot of time with young people over quite a long period, and I can vividly recall one particular example of a young man who, to all intents and purposes, as the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon) expressed in his contribution here, had the world at his feet. He was a runner and a bit of a goer and I, along with some other people in the school, spent a lot of time keeping him out of the principal's office. . He was a fine young man who, I would have thought, had he been able to make it through a particular period of his life, would have gone on to be a productive member of his local community and the Australian community. He had a very supportive family and he was much loved by that family. But at the end of the day, for reasons that we will never know, that young man took his own life. That is an experience that many of us on the floor of this parliament have been intimately acquainted with and have had contact with. In a very personal sense, it rocked me to my foundations, and made me aware of the tremendous trauma that is visited not only on families but on school communities and local communities by youth suicide. Many people have canvassed the reasons, and this report does that. We can go through those. They are many and varied. The honourable member for McPherson( Mr Bradford), who preceded me, quite correctly pointed out that some are within the ambit of government and some are not. I think we have to look primarily at the economic hardship of families and unemployment. That is concentrated fairly substantially in regional areas of this country. That is a major contributing factor. Families in distress are families that are prone to have members commit suicide. Other factors, as I read the literature, have been advanced: the loss of a sense of community, homelessness, depression, sexual assault, drugs, family conflict and decline in government support services. All of these factors have been mentioned as contributing factors to suicide, particularly youth suicide, in this country. 9174 MAIN COMMTITEE Thursday, 2 October 1997 The Geelong community is aware of this problem. There was a meeting in Geelong on 5 March 1997, which was attended by around 90 people, to deal specifically with this problem. The meeting was convened by the Victorian Premier's Suicide Prevention Task ForcandI commend politicians of any political persuasion who show an active interest in this subject. The message from that meeting was not one, I think, the Victorian Premier would want to hear, because speaker after speaker, of all political persuasions,condemned governments for the massive cutbacks in services that have occurred in rural areas particularly. They sheeted that home as a contributing factor to suicide in rural areas. I do not think we can just narrow that factor down. The honourable member who preceded me in this debate said that we are perhaps treating this matter after the fact. He made the point that money was not the solution to the problem and he quoted the financial contributions of the previous government and this government jn . addressing this problem. Maybe it is not so much in the $19 million that this government has allocated, or the $13 million that the previous government allocated, to address this problem but, in a broader sense, the responsibility of government to resource services in rural and regional areas t-at is able to play a role in combating this insidious disease. I want to very briefly comment on the Victoria task force report. When it delivered its report it identified the Barwon adolescent task force-BAT force-in my electorate as one of two bodies in the state which was providing a coordinated response to youth problems and addressing this issue. In my electorate in the Barwon region, the number of youth suicides is well below the Victorian state average. I congratulate BAT force, its committee of management and its network of concerned officers and agencies for their untiring work on behalf of youth in my electorate. It is the BAT force network which has delivered the real support to our youth, which has directly contributed to the situation which was acknowledged in the Victorian government's report. What was the solution? Why has this organisation been so effective? The chair, Ms Armstrong Rowe, had this to say: BAT force has built up strong community networks, good communications between agencies and it has well resourced the youth programs that are provided. I suggest to honourable members that if we are looking to part of the solution to this problem, it includes all the ones that have been mentioned in the report and by honourable members previously. Part of the solution is correctly resourcing in a financial sense these sorts of organisations that are able to deliver to youth the network of support services that can address some of the real and fundamental problems that youth face before youth go to the point of taking their own lives. I commend this report to all members of parliament and I congratulate those members who have participated in its preparation. Debate (on motion by Mr Vaile) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.06 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 2130) able member's question is as follows: Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Yes.
