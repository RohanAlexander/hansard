The following year Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Roumania and Russia adopted the turn-over tax, and in 1923 it was adopted by Austria and Poland. In 1925, Turkey also imposed this tax. The methods employed in the various countries differed considerably in detail, but of that, the tax was increased to 3 per I do not propose to enlarge on them beyond saying that in the main they were turn-over taxes-that is, they were applicable to all transactions. In many instances they included services, commercial and professional.

10,Mr Scullin,"I have not thethat during a critical period the turnover tax was the most trustworthy tax of all. When, under the auspices of the League of Nations, the financial reconstruction of Austria was being carried on, the turnover tax proved to be a valuable device for furnishing a dependable revenue at a time when other important taxes were falling behind because they were not adapted to the existing conditions. That statement is made in the l l t h report of the CommissionerGeneral of the League of Nations for Austria. I have a number of quotations from authoritative sources, and if honourable members desire to study a comprehensive review of general sales and turnover taxes, I commend to them a splendid v work on the subject that has been published by the National Industrial Conference Board of the United States of America. That work contains contributions by a large number of persons, who are representative of commercial, manufacturing and other interests in the United States of America. lished? drafting of this legislation, the Government found that the constitutional problem was a serious one, and obtained the advice of outside counsel. Mr E. M . Mitchell, K . C , advised that, in view of the High Court's interpretation of section -55, and of possible future interpretations, the safest course was to have an assessment act and a rates act for each subject of taxation. Thus it is necessary to introthe value of the sale. Any sale that is -duce nine separate assessment bills and nine separate rates bill to do precisely what, in Canada, can be done with one assessment act and one rates act. The sales tax that is to be imposed by these measures will apply to what will be -called "" sale value"" in connection with -6ales, and transactions which are in the -nature of dispositions of goods in the -ordinary course of trade, that take place -on and after the 1st August next. The term ""sale value"" is employed instead of the term ""sale price,"" for many reasons. There are numerous transactions that are not actually sales; for -example, goods may be leased in return for a rental or a royalty. In such a -case, the ownership does not change, but the perpetual use of the goods does. In effect, it is a sale, although legally it cannot be so termed. The sale value in those circumstances will be determined by the Commissioner. Further, so as to preserve the protective incidence of the tariff, the tax will be payable on imported as well as locally-manufactured goods. The retailer who imports goods will pay the tax at the time of their entry, and consequently a sale value must be fixed. That value will be the dutypaid value of tbe goods. It will be upon that value that the retailer who imports will pay the tax. In cases where a manufacturer or a wholesale merchant is also a retailer the tax will apply to the price for which his goods are sold to the consumer. able gentleman say that in cases where a retailer imports goods, he pays the tax upon their arrival in Australia? ported and sold by the importer, he pays the tax; but where the importer sells to a wholesale merchant, who will be registered, no tax will be paid on that saleI n the it will not be paid until the goods are sold to a retailer. In every case, the tax will be paid on the last transaction, no matter how many hands the goods may pass through. A check will be imposed by the registration of manufacturers and wholesale merchants. the last price? made to a registered person will not be taxed; but when that registered person sells to an unregistered person the sale will be taxed. in suspense against a registered person. taxes in other countries, to which I have referred, are usually multiple taxes that are applicable to all transactions. In such cases, a low rate becomes a high rate, the original 2 per cent, increasing to as much as 10 per cent. Tbat accounts for some of the early criticism of this proposal. Those who have argued that this tax will amount to as much as 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, have evidently had in mind what has happened in connection.",18,Refobt Of The Commissioner General Of The League Of Nations Fob Austria

18,Mr Scullin,"No. The turnoverwith multiple taxes iu other countries. That does not occur where the tax operates on only one transaction. This proposal is that the tax shall be charged only once. Manufacturers and wholesale merchants will be registered, but retailers will not be. Sales to registered persons for re-sale will not be taxed. Goods and raw materials purchased for use in manufactures will not be taxed at the time they are purchased. The question of contracts has been raised, and I have received a considerable amount of correspondence regarding it. If a contract for the delivery of goods over a number of months was entered into on or before the 9 th July, those deliveries will be exempt from this taxation. If , however, a contract was entered into after the 9th July, any deliveries made after the 1st August will be taxable as sales. The reason for that is obvious. For example, if , before the notification in the the royalty is to be taken into considerabudget speech on the 9th July that it was proposed to impose a sales tax, a firm entered into a contract at a fixed price to operate over a period of six or twelve months, it would have to deliver at that price, and, consequently, it would be unreasonable to expect it to pay this tax. But any contract that was entered into after that announcement is in quite a different category. The various transactions, acts, or operations that will be covered by the general scope of the sales tax may be summarized as follows:In the case of goods manufactured in Australia: Goods that are sold by tbe manufacturer to an unregistered person will be taxed, the tax being payable by the manufacturer. When goods have been purchased from the manufacturer by a registered person, and then sold by the latter to an unregistered person, the tax will be paid by the registered person who has purchased from the manufacturer. When goods are sold to an unregistered person by a registered person, who is neither a manufacturer nor a purchaser from a manufacturer, the tax will be payable by the registered person. In the case of imported goods: When goods are imported by an unregistered person, the tax will be payable by the importer at the time of the entry of the goods for home consumption. When goods are imported by a registered person and sold by him to an unregistered person, tax is payable by the registered person on the sale price of the goods. When imported goods are sold to an unregistered person by any person in Australia other than the importer, tax is payable by the vendor who sells to the unregistered person. When goods are purchased from local manufacturers or imported: When goods are purchased by a registered person and applied by him to his own use, tax is payable by the registered person on the fair market value at which the goods would have been sold by him in the ordinary course of trade if so sold. When goods are sold or transferred by the owner to another person subject to payment of a royalty, Avhether that payment is or is not associated with any other kind of payment in respect of the goods, tion in ascertaining the sale value for the purpose of the tax. As to goods which are the subject of a lease granted by the owner, the terms of the lease are to be taken into account in ascertaining the sale value for the purpose of the tax. In respect of goods produced or manufactured in Australia the exemptions areBacon and iiaras. Bags and sacks used in marketing primary products described below. (This exemption also applies to imported goods of this kind.) Beer (because it is the subject of the special revenue duty of excise). Bread. Boxes, cases, and crates, and wood in shooks for the manufacture of boxes, cases, and crates used in marketing any goods specified in this schedule when the Commissioner is satisfied that the boxes, cases, and crates have been or will be so used .within such time as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances. Butter, including margarine and similar substitutes for butter. Cheese. Cigarettes. Cream. Dried fruits. Electricity. Fertilizers and raw materials for use in the manufacture of fertilizers. (This exemption also applies to imported goods of this kind.) Flour, including bran, pollard, and semolina. Foods for poultry, birds and live-stock. Gas illuminating or heating, from coal. Meat, raw. Metals as recovered from ores. Milk products, viz., casein, milk powder, milk, condensed or concentrated. Newspapers. Pastry, but not including cakes or biscuits. Petrol. Sugar. Water, supplied by public authorities. Wool packs. (This exemption also applies to imported wool packs.) Goods (imported or Australian) sold for export by the purchaser. Goods (imported or Australian) exported by the owner whether or not they are for subsequent sale. Primary products derived directly from operations carried on in Australia in(a) Mining; (6) cultivation of land; (c) maintenance of animals, poultry, and bees; (d) fisheries; (e) timber-getting, and which have not been subject to any process or treatment resulting in an alteration of the form, nature, or condipert from the Sales Tax Department. He tion of the goods. Goods sold by or to a government or government authority in so far as they are the subject of a sale by or to that government speaks in the highest terms of his qualior authority. The foregoing exemptions are expressed in the schedules to the respective assessment bills to the extent required by the scope of each bill. As the bills relate to different subjects of taxation, there is necessarily some variation in the extent to which exemptions are specified in each schedule. For example, the bills dealing with goods manufactured in Australia which are the subject of ordinary sales, contain the full list of exemptions of Australian manufactured goods. In the case of imported goods, a shorter list is shown in the schedule, according to requirements. In respect of all imported goods except those which are subject to the special revenue duties of Customs, the sale value will be taxable. The exempt goods which are subject to the special revenue duties of customs are-Petrol, tobacco, cigarettes, cigars, films, newsprint, and wireless valves. If any person who has imported goods without having been liable to pay sales tax in respect of them at the time of their entry at the customs for home consumption, exports those goods or sells them to a purchaser for export by him, no sales tax will be payable on the sale value in respect of either the act of exportation or the sale for export legislation? Sir. Scullin. One of the features of a salestax is the simplicity of its administration. The experience of other countries is that it is administered much more simply than the income tax or the land tax; it is certainly much easier to collect than a war-time profits tax. Vendors who are liable to pay tax will be required to render monthly returns of their sales not later than seven days after the close of each calendar month. The return will be accompanied by a remittance of the amount of tax payable in respect of the taxable sales. We hope that we are avoiding many of the mistakes and difficulties which attended the introduction of this taxation in other countries. Starting later than they, we are benefiting by their experience, and we are indebted to the Government of Canada for the loan of the services of Mr G. W. Jones, an exhas shown himself a very capable officer, and the Commissioner of Taxation fications and the assistance he has given to the department. I take this opportunity to thank the Government of Canada for its prompt compliance with my request that it should make an officer available to give us the benefit of the Dominion's experience in this class of taxation. The machinery of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been adapted to the sales tax for the recovery of taxes. Machinery similar to that established by existing legislation is provided in regard to objections and appeals. The taxpayer will have the right to refer a matter in dispute to a board of review, and a question of law may be taken to the High Court. quired each year? be renewed annually. The Assessment Act will come up for revision only when amendments are found necessary. I regret that I was not able to submit the bills to the House earlier; the delay is due to the difficulties of drafting, caused almost entirely by section 55 of the Constitution.",19,Refobt Of The Commissioner General Of The League Of Nations Fob Austria

21,Mr Fbancis,"I s this temporaryduced because of the state of the Commonwealth finances. How long it will operate I cannot say. I do not assert that it is temporary or emergency legislation. We have to face the fact that we cannot continue to depend upon revenues derived from imports artificially stimulated by borrowing abroad. We have not been conducting our affairs on sound lines. It is sounder to impose indirect taxation of this kind on goods sold in the country, than to depend on customs duties upon imports artificially swollen by placing our country in debt to the foreign money-lenders. The Government hopes that in the course oftime the rates may be reduced and the exemptions increased. That has been the experience of other countries, particularly Canada. I quite expect that honourable members will present mauy requests for additions to the list of exemptions. I remind them that the list is already extensive. The Statistician has calculated that the wholesale value of sales in Australia is approximately £500,000,000 per annum, and this tax will apply to only half that amount. Whilst honourable members may be able to make out a good case for the exemption of particular articles, we must consider the revenue, and because £250,000,000 worth of sales is already exempt we have had to impose a rate of 2\ per cent, on the balance. The calculation of £500,000,000 was made after allowing for depressed prices and reduced values of output brought about by the existing depression. member expect to collect £7,000,000 from this tax this 'year? expect to collect £6,250,000.

Geneva, which, unfortunately, met with little success, concluded, the relations betribution to the common good, I feel sure that tween the United States of America, Japan and Great Britain were somewhat strained, and it was therefore considered necessary to make some further move in the direction of reducing armaments. In 1929; many conversations took place in Great Britain between the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Right lionorable Ramsay MacDonald, and the Ambassador of the United States of America, the Honourable C. Dawes. Subsequently, Mr Ramsay MacDonald visited the United States of America, and negotiations took place between him and the President of that nation. It was decided to call the London Naval Conference.

We all rejoice that the Anglo-Saxon peoples are to-day more in concert than they have been previously, and for that position, we, regardless of our political colour, should be deeply thankful. The London Conference was held on the 21st January and I attended it as a representative of Australia. It met in an historic chamber known as the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords. The conference was opened by His Majesty the King, who welcomed the delegates.

The Right Honourable Ramsay Conference. Sir Maurice Hankey was elected secretary-general, and Mr W. A. Alexander, First Lord of the Admiralty, was elected chairman of the first committee. Not only those gentlemen, but also the public servants and officers who assisted at the conference, rendered the most admirable service, and they were congratulated by the delegates of the various nations, who expressed their indebtedness to the officials for the assistance that they had received at their hands. Mr MacDonald. who made a fine chairman, and Sir Maurice Hankey, who is one of the most valued public servants in Great Britain, greatly assisted us with tbeir advice, and so also did the many naval and other experts who were present.

I do not desire to draw into this debate any matters which will be the subject of important discussions at the forthcoming Imperial Conference, but I believe that steps will be taken at that gathering to formulate a definite, and perhaps more constitutional, method in regard to dominion status. But the decisions of the 1926 Imperial Conference were loyally adhered to at the naval conference. I emphasize particularly that tbe overseas representatives were consulted in respect to every decision that was made, and shared all the work of the various committees. The leaders of. the various British Empire delegations were present at all conferences which were restricted to the principals of the various countries. It is true that when the six representatives of the varipus British overseas dominions, and the three or four representatives of the British Government, were called upon to make a response at the opening of the conference on behalf of their different countries, some of the foreign representatives looked a little askance at us. Perhaps they feared that they would be outvoted on any matter' that came before the conference. But the conference did not reach its decisions by voting in the ordinary way. ""When the momentcame for the making of a decision,. the chairman of the conference would look to the representatives on one side of him and say, ""Do you agree?"" and then to the representatives on tbe other side of him and repeat his question, and if there was no dissent, the proposal was agreed to unanimously. One subject which received very careful and lengthy consideration was the method of recording the naval tonnage of the various countries. The French delegation desired that naval tonnage should be considered as what is known as global tonnage; that is to say, that a Mr Fenton. nation' should be called upon to indicate detailed tonnage and class of the ships which constituted its navy. The British -delegation, on the other hand, desired that the tonnage should be reported in categories; that is to say, that a schedule should be submitted showing the number of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and so on; and the tonnage of each ship. The Italian delegation agreed partially with the French view. There seems to be an impression abroad that the conference was not in a position to consider such details, because it had not at hand expert naval advice. But every nation had its naval experts present for consultative purposes. In some cases these experts participated in the discussions. The delegates of the TJnited States of America, for instance, had the assistance of Admiral Pratt; the French, Italian, and Japanese and other , delegations had the assistance of experts from their naval departments; and the British delegation was fortified by the advice of Sir Charles Madden, First Sea Lord, who was present throughout, practically the whole of the conference, and rendered invaluable advice. He,. and other , experts, were' sitting immediately .behind the British, delegation in the plenary, sessions. Mr .MAXWELL -Wer e all. the discussions in English? conference were English and French, but all languages spoken were interpreted. Sir William Fisher, a very able assistant to the First Sea Lord, was also in attendance to assist the British Empire Delegation. . It will -be seen} therefore, that the various delegations had at their command the advice of the most expert naval officers, who could be assembled. sittings of the conference secret, or was the principle of open diplomacy adopted ? sion was held in public. At its first meeting 'the plenary session appointed 1 certain committees.

I know, of course, that this is what some people would call a scrap of paper, but the treaty has been signed by those nations which took part in the conference, and it now bears the signatures of nearly 60 other nations as well. It is a plain and simple statement, and, as I pointed out to the French representatives, it furnishes them with f u l l guarantees.

The Brisbane and the Adelaide were laid down before the 1st January, 1920, and sixteen years only from date of completion in 1916 and 19542, respectively, must elapse before they are deemed over age and capable of replacement. It will therefore be noted that the Brisbane is the first on our list of replacements. The seaplane carrier Albatross, of 5,000 tons, is included in the list of vessels given in annex III of part II . of the treaty. This vessel may be retained, and its tonnage is not taken into account in determining the tonnage subject to limitation. If , however, it is desired later on of the TJnited States of America, who exto replace this vessel, then the tonnage necessary for that purpose will be charged agaiust the tonnage of the nearest appropriate combatant category. For the purposes of negotiation with the other Powers, it was agreed between the dominions and the British Government that the navies of the British Commonwealth should be taken as one unit. The domestic questions of the distribution amongst the various dominions of the total tonnage allotted to the British Commonwealth under the treaty, and the consequent allotment of responsibility for the maintenance and replacement of vessels, remain to be determined. It was agreed that these matters could be more appropriately discussed at an imperial gathering, and undoubtedly they will be brought under notice by the British Government at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. Other nations have nothing to do with other naval men who may have earned arrangements regarding the disposition marvellous reputations, but may toof the British Navy among the component day be somewhat out of touch with parts of the Empire. We have four modern movements. cruisers, an aircraft carrier, a sloop, some particularly well served by this treaty, destroyers, submarines, and minor craft, inasmuch as it ends, until 1935 at least, with which other nations have nothing all competition in all classes of naval whatever to do.

General Dawes, the American Ambassador to London, stated when he returned to his own country that opposition to the treaty had developed in each of the signatory countries. Certain persons in Japan opposed it, saying that it was inimical to the best interests of Japan. Similarly, it was opposed by certain sections in Great Britain, and by others in the United States of America. States of America seems perfectly satisfied with it now. Senate vote on the treaty I should say that they are. Generally speaking, I think the people of Great Britain are also satisfied with the treaty.

58,Mr Fenton,"Judging by theto a three-power treaty. prefer that it had been a five-power treaty. Every endeavour was made to obtain such a treaty, but the claims of certain nationalities were of such a character that we could not agree to them, and on those points they for the time being were excluded. I may mention, however, that this treaty was signed by the five powers in regard to certain points. An important point gained is that there will be a holiday in battleship construction until 1936. In 1935, another uaval conference of the various nations will be held. The whole situation will then be reviewed again, and I hope that still further reduction will be agreed to. The reduction in battleship construction and of construction in certain other lines will represent a saving of between £52,000,000 and £70,000,000 to Great Britain during the next five years. President Hoover has estimated that the total saving to the people concerned in the next five or six years will be something like £500,000,000. Surely that must be a wonderful relief to the overburdened taxpayers who would have been called upon to contribute immense sums for this naval construction. The treaty that has been signed by the British Commonwealth of Nations, the TJnited States of America, and Japan, was signed on behalf of 650,000,000 people; and there are favourably affected by that signing, over 1,000,000,000 people. The signing of the Five-Power Pact affects two-thirds of the people of the world. Surely, then, the conference was worthwhile! I believe that the world is hungry for peace. It may be asked, what can the mere handful of 6,500,000 people in Australia do in regard to the peace of the world? There might have been some justification for that question before the great war; but records speak foT themselves, and having contributed what we did on that occasion, surely we can do something to bring about peace! We ought to do all that lies within our power in that direction. We should not only think, but pray for peace. A great deal yet. remains to be done. The world was left broken by the last war; and it is still suffering, and will continue to suffer for many years, from the cumulative effects of it . ifr. Fenton. I would BeforeI left Australia. I had given to me figures that showed that war and the preparations for war by the principal nations of the world between 1905 and 1925 involved an expenditure of no less a sum than £61,000,000,000. During the war 20,000,000 men were under arms, and I believe that it is safe to say that 10,000,000 were killed, wounded, died, or were otherwise seriously affected in some way. I hold the view that all war is hell, the last to a greater extent than any that preceded it. If one can believe what one reads, and what one hears from those who ought to know, if there is to be another world war-and God forbid that there should be-it will be 1,000 times more hell than the last. With that fact staring us in the face, can any intelligent man or woman view with equanimity the possibility of another world war? All our efforts, therefore, should be directed towards ensuring the peace of the world. This conference may not have achieved a great deal; it certainly did not come up to my expectations, or the expectations of those who desired a much bigger reduction of armaments; but a step in the right direction has been taken. My prayer and my trust is, that further steps will be taken towards that end, until the peoples of the world arrive at the conclusion that, from whatever aspect it is considered, war is nothing more or less than harmful and wasteful. If we wish our civilization to disappear, we have only to look for another war. I believe that the public conscience has been developed, and that if it is stirred a little more the people of the world will decide, not in favour of, but against war. I had one of my most impressive experiences overseas when four women, representing Britain, the TJnited States of America, France, and Japan, presented to the conference petitions containing millions of signatures of the women of their respective countries. Those women delivered magnificent speeches. I believe that they not only spoke from their own hearts, but also interpreted the feelings of the women of the world. I hope the day will soon come when in this and every other country the people will have their backs to the black night of war, and their face? turned to the bright morning of a lasting world's peace. They will then be able to sing with heart and voiceKing out the thousand wars of old, Ring in a thousand years of peace. adjourned.

The intention of this provision is that the new liability to tax on dividends shall relate for the first time to income of the kind described, which is derived by a company on and after the 1st July, 1929, and distributed in dividends. It is not intended that dividends paid out of extraAustralian income which has been derived by the company prior to the 1st July, 1929, shall be taxable, notwithstanding that it may be distributed after that date. This intention, however, has not been fully expressed in the bill, and the amendment is designed to make the position clear. Amendment agreed to. observe ""that, by paragraph /, this clause introduces a provision for the taxation as income of the consideration received for the assignment or transfer of a lease, or for goodwill, or a licence in respect of a business carried on on the leased property, or for surrendering a lease, goodwill, or licence. I can understand the object that is sought to be attained. I am familiar with the methods that have been adopted in connection with the transfer of certain properties, to diminish the amount payable as rent by assigning an amount to goodwill or a licence. One can also understand the theory which underlies the idea that the payment of consideration for the transfer or assignment of a lease shall be regarded as income. There is some doubt as to whether such receipts are income or capital. Section 55 of the Constitution prevents more than one tax being included in a bill.

When an effort was made to deal with this matter in 1924 the Government proposed to introduce special legislation to tax these The proposed particular receipts. ter and Treasurer) [4.37] I assure the Leader of the Opposition that the Commissioner of Taxation has been in consultation with the Crown Law Department in regard to this clause, and they artsatisfied that these receipts are commuted rent and not an accretion of capital.

It appears, therefore, that our income tax legislation is to be used as a means of limiting insurance business to a particular class of company. That principle could be extended indefinitely. It would be possible, for instance, to disallow deductions of amounts paid to any person of whom Parliament disapproves. If the Government desires to encourage the . . . . i placing of insurance business with Australian companies, or companies with registered offices in Australia, it should do so by means of an amendment of our insurance legislation. This Parliament has full power to legislate on the subject of insurance. Our income tax legislation should not be used for such a purpose. It may be desirable to assist Australian insurance companies to meet the additional liability which is being imposed upon them by certain other provisions in this bill; but it should not be done in this way. This is not the way to give a monopoly of insurance business to one class of company. To allow income tax deductions because it is desired to pursue a policy of that kind, is an entirely new departure.",33,Income Tax Assessment Bill

My objection to this provision is that it is an attempt to enforce a general policy which, however desirable, should not bo enforced by means of income tax legislation. I associate myself with the protest of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) against this amendment. Broadly, the proposal is that Australian insurance companies, or overseas companies registered here, shall be given the monopoly of our insurance business. If the Government desires to pursue that policy, it should do so in the right way. A bill should be introduced which would reveal the policy in all its nakedness. But, in my opinion, it is not wise, on other grounds, to accept this amendment in an income tax bill; for it might create a bad impression in insurance offices in Loiidou which do a certain amount of business with Australia. Many British companies which have no office in Australia subscribe largely to Australian loans floated in Loudonsome of them are among our biggest bondholders. Certain of these companies have adopted the policy of investing all the profits derived from tbeir Australian business in Australian stocks. A matter of this moment should not be dealt with in this casual, off-hand manner. I hope that the Government will withdraw the amendment and if it wishes to deal with the matter will deal with it by itself. In support of the amendment, I point out that iusurance companies registered in Australia must pay certain taxes in the shape of stamp duties and other charges in connection with their registration which are not paid by the absentee companies that would be affected by the amendment. posal, therefore, appears to be calculated to equalize the conditions of competition. As the benefited companies are loaded with these flotation costs, if not with other expense, it is only fair that these should be off-set by a provision of this kind, particularly as it will be open for the absentee companies to register in Australia, and so secure the benefit of the exemption which the local companies enjoy. Viewed in this light, the objection that has been raised to the amendment is not forcible. too, protest against the amendment. 1 think that the Government should withdraw it. There might have been some justification for this provision before a means had been devised of taxing insurance companies as they will be taxed after this bill becomes law. It does not seem to me to be fair that some persons should be allowed to regard as a deductible amount payments which other persons will have to regard as income. Furthermore, the subject of reinsurance will be affected by this provision. Some Australian companies reinsure with big Britisli companies. rather approve of the amendment, Avhich does not give any special protection to Australian companies, but provides, in effect, that, all other things being equal, they shall be given a preference. I should like the Treasurer to go a little further. J. point out to him that a considerable amount of money goes out of Australia in treaty insurances with foreign companies which have no offices here. I should like to know whether he is prepared to provide in the bill that such payments shall not be deducted. If the premiums paid by companies on business which they unload on foreign companies were not deductible, more consideration might be given to tbe advisableness of reinsuring with Australian companies, which would mean that the money would be kept in Australia. ringah) [5.15] I submit that this amendment imports foreign matter into our income tax legislation, in that the object of it is to give a preference to Australian insurance This procompanies. Such a preference should not be given by this means. As the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has pointed out, many iusurance companies which have no offices in Australia subscribe large amounts to Australian loans floated in London.

That distinction is altogether different from that drawn in respect of life insurance premiums, where it is laid down that premiums may be deducted if the insurance is effected within Australia, even though it may be made with one of the companies subject to the proviso in the clause now before the committee.

Why should not the same words be used in respect of fire and other insurance premiums as are used in premiums, namely, ""effected outside Australia""?

When I pointed out thatsimilar provisions are already in the act, his only objection was that we were proposing to do in seven lines what had preuuder another name. viously been done in three words. The law says that no deduction is allowable in respect of premiums on life insurance effected outside Australia. In the clause now under consideration we say that no deduction will be allowed if the insurance company does not carry on insurance business in Australia, either in a principal office, or by means of a branch, or through a representative empowered to receive or deal with premiums under contract on behalf of the insurer. That really means that deductions are not. allowed in respect of insurances effected outside Australia. fire insurance are entirely different from life insurance.

If there is reason for excluding the one, there is equal reason for excluding the other. In New South Wales, Queensland, and probably other States, a super tax of 3d. in the £1 is imposed on incomes, and is payable in the form of an income tax. I submit that it is reasonable to ask that such payments shall be allowable as a deduction.

But that is not a reason for withholding this relief. If my proposal is reasonable and fair, I ask that it be supported on that ground. The statutory exemption in some of the States is so low that practically everybody is compelled to pay income tax. In South Australia, even domestic servants do not escape New South Wales. Still, the exemption in New South Wales to-day is only £300; and I think it will be admitted that that catches a very large number of people. If it is right to allow State income taxation to be deducted, it is equally right to allow payments that are made on a similar basis. taxation will be paid on money that is contributed to the revenue in the form of a tax. I do not think it is intended that citizens should pay income tax on taxation. These contributions to the revenue have to be made either in the conduct of business, or in the private life of an individual. and Treasurer [5.40] I cannot accept the amendment. It is not based upon any very sound reason, and it would exempt from taxation taxable income amounting to probably £1,000,000. If this exemption were allowed, the rate of tax would have to be increased to make up the deficiency. The meaning of the term "" tax on incomes"" may be open to a good deal of argument; but the term ""income tax"" is very well understood. Nearly all taxes are taxes on income. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) has argued that it was never intended to impose an income tax on taxation. If that is so, we ought to exempt municipal taxes. exempt in many cases. entirely. premises are exempt. private houses. Take, for example, an unemployment tax. It is imposed for the purpose of raising a sum of money for the performance of a certain social work. It may be an emergency tax, but it is levied in equal ratio on everybody. Under the amendment of the honourable member for Warringah, the man who is in the taxable field would be allowed to deduct a certain amount from his taxable income, while tbe man who -is not would derive no advantage. That would be an affirmation of a principle the very opposite of that under which unemployment taxation true of is imposed. At an earlier stage the mind of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) was working along other lines. He circulated an amendment that was designed to secure the exemption of motor taxation. The only reason for the exemption of income' tax paid to the States is that that tax was in operation when the Federal income taxwas first imposed. If we allowed everyOtherwise, new item of taxation to be deducted, we, should make confusion worse confounded. I ask the committee to reject the amendment While we can all appreciate the argument of the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), who has spoken from the point of view of the, requirements of the revenue, there are, other matters that demand consideration, in connection with this amendment. The notes that have been circulated among ) honourable members show that the object, of the amendment is to prevent the de-^ duction of customs duties by persons who* privately import goods. A man in busi-'. ness who imports goods and sells them,.' takes into account the payments that have been made by way of customs duties, in the same way that he takes into account the price of the goods; and he makes up his profit for the year by comparing his outgoings, including customs duties, with his receipts.

128,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [5.43]',"or upon some other article that he has imported. The form of the deduction provision is as follows:All rates and taxes for which the taxpayer Prime Minister has given as to what is It personally liable, including State and Federal land tax and income tax actually paid deduction ofin Australia. Obviously, a private individual ought not, during the relevant year, to be allowed to deduct customs duty in such a case. The ordinary duty stamp that is attached to a receipt is a normal outgoing of a business; it is an expense that is incurred in carrying on the business, and in earning the income. I should say there is no doubt that, in the past, every business man has deducted from his income the cost of those stamps. Under the law as it stands at present, that is clearly authorized. But in future he will no longer be able to do that, because there will be a specific provision limiting the deductible taxes and rates to those which are payable annually. I do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to levy income tax Avithout allowing such a deduction as receipt stamps. It appears to me that that is going rather far. deductible under section 23(l)a of this act. they are exempt under section 23(1)& which plainly authorizes the deduction of the taxation that is paid to the States by way of the ordinary duty stamp. It is now proposed to alter sub-section 16 in -uch a way as to exclude that deduction, while authorizing the deduction of certain other State rates and taxes. The question whether the deduction will still be permissible under sub-section l a may be arguable; but having regard to the specific provision of sub-section l b , which pertax. The Prime Minister has said that mits the deduction of certain annually payable State taxation, it will be difficult to make out a strong case in favour of the deduction of State taxation that is not annually payable. duct. I shall look carefully at the wording in order to make sure that the intention will be realized. Apparently, since the bill and its accompanying papers were circulated, the Government has enlarged its ideas on this clause. It is worthwhile comparing the departmental explanation of the amendments with the explanation which the intended. The act now provides for the All rates and taxes for which the taxpayer is personally liable (including State and Federal land taxes and State income tax) actually paid in Australia by the taxpayer during the year in which the income was derived, but not including any tax paid under this act or any wartime profits tax. Evidently the department was willing to continue that, and the amendment was proposed for quite another purpose. The explanatory notes accompanying the bill sayQuite recently the department has received claims that the present wording of paragraph (6) of section 23 (1) allows a deduction of customs duties paid upon privately imported goods, stamp duties of all kinds (even when not connected with business transactions producing assessable income) succession duties, and, in the case of a trustee, probate and Commonwealth estate duties. There is room for doubt regarding the scope of the present provision in the law. The intention of that provision was to base the Commonwealth income tax assessment upon the net amount of income of the taxpayer after the ordinary municipal and State annual taxes had been paid. It was never intended to apply to such taxes as those specified above which are not in any way connected with ordinary operations of trading for profit. Nor was it ever intended that the concession should embrace death and succession duties. The remedy lies principally in the omission of the words ""and tax "" which follow the word "" rates "". There is also the necessity slightly to re-arrange the wording so that the intention may be made quite clear. Tlie amendment as drafted will attain the desired end. The present flat rate tax of 3d. in the £1 for the relief of unemployment in New South Wales is in the nature of income to allow this payment to be deducted would be to create a certain amount of inequity, because the taxation of the Commonwealth is on a graduated scale. In practically every State the rates of income tax advance in a series of steps; incomes of from £200 to £500 pay a certain amount; those from £500 to £1,000 a higher amount; and so on. Therefore, the deduction of State income tax from the income assessable for Commonwealth purposes leads to inequities at every stage.

Tlie appeal should be dismissed with costs. His Honour, Mr Justice Starke, saidThe question is really one of fact. The money was paid to secure to the taxpayer's business the benefits which flowed from membership of the association. It was from his business that his assessable income was derived, and the contribution was made to protect his interests in and his income from this business, and for no other purpose. Those four High Court judges are all clear that, on the facts, tbe payment was made for the purpose of making and extending income. Accordingly, I suggest that the matter is not SQ clear from one aspect as the Prime Minister would have us believe. ringah) [6.7] I notice that the income tax form relating to income earned during the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1930, contains this item: "" No. 47. Sums paid to any industrial union of employers or employees, trade or profession, association or agricultural society, not exceeding £50 each; state the name of the union, &c, and the amount."" I understand that the act is now being amended to delete that item. It has little application to the trade unions, because the individual unionist, although union to which he belongs for the performance of its duties in the Arbitration assume that any sum spent in obtaining awards before the Arbitration Court by the Graziers Association, or any other employers' association, is just as much an expenditure in earning the income as is the amount contributed by the unionist to his union for the purpose of gaining from the Arbitration Court special advantages such as increased wage3. It has frequently been argued that, because unionists spend large sums in prosecuting their cases before the Arbitraticipate in any benefits conferred by its awards. With that argument I do not agree. But I contend that the employer, or any member of an employers' association, who contributes money to it for the purpose of protecting his income and his rights in respect of his earnings, should So soon as a taxpayer gains a victory in the courts with regard to his income tax assessment, no matter how trivial an amount may be involved, legislation is introduced in order that the department may not lose revenue. In this case an injustice is being done. This section might just as well remain unaltered, because its amendment in the direction indicated would make no material difference to the revenue derived from taxation. The exemption should apply to the employer as well as to the employee. I admit that there would be no ground for exemption if the contributions were for political purposes.",40,Income Tax Assessment Bill

If this provision is agreed to, organizations with a small membership and fairly heavy fees will be seriously handicapped. Personally, I agree that just as strong a case could be made out for the deduction of subscriptions by members of trade unions as for the making of them by graziers, doctors and others. That implication from the decision of the High Court is, in my opinion, sound. But the Treasurer has also said that following upon that decision members of all sorts of recreaThe honourable to deduct from their taxable income the amount they pay in subscriptions to such bodies; but if any attempt were made to do that, the law could then be altered to counteract it.

I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker), that any deductions from taxable income of amounts paid in subscriptions and fees to recreational and health clubs should be disallowed; but that is not the case which we are considering at the moment. In the circumstances I hope the Treasurer will withdraw this proposal. Apart altogether from the legal aspect of this subject, every one who has a knowledge of the work of the various graziers' associations will agree that the money spent in subscriptions to them is devoted to the specific purpose of increaspurposes, but not for Federal purposes. ing business returns. The persons who join these associations, do so because they follows:believe that they will thereby increase their income. I was a district secretary of the Graziers Association of Queensland for a considerable time, and know that that association made it possible for its members to save hundreds of pounds in legal and other expenses. Instead of the members of the association having to spend money individually in legal fees, they paid their subscriptions to the association, which obtained such legal advice as they required in regard to awards, agreements with shearers, and the like. If this money were used for the support of political parties it would be improper to allow it to be deducted from the taxable income of the individual, but the Queensland Graziers Association paid no political levies whatever. In the other States political levies imposed by the Graziers Associations are kept entirely separate from ordinary income, and a return could be obtained from them at any time to ascertain how much money had been received in political levies and how much in ordinary subscriptions. The deduction of these subscriptions does not mean much to a man who owns only a few sheep, and subscribes to the associathrough the payment of these subscription in proportion to the number of sheep he owns, but it means a big thing to a man who owns many thousands of sheep. These subscriptions are a legitimate deduction, because they tend to increase the taxable income of the taxpayer. I sincerely trust that the Treasurer will tion or cause whatever, though it be only agree to the withdrawal of this amendment. It has evidently been the practice in the past to regard amounts paid in such subscriptions as legitimate deductions. On page 2 of tbe joint Federal and State income tax form for New South Wales for this year I read the following line under the heading "" Deductions "":46. Expenses incurred in relation to the obtaining of an award or agreement under any act of the Commonwealth or the State relating to employees engaged in the taxpayers' business. Opposite that line there is a shaded area in the column headed ""Federal"", and a blank space in the column headed "" State"", which indicates that such expenses are allowable deductions for State But the next line on the form reads as 47. Sums paid to any industrial union of employers or employees, trade or professional association or agricultural society (not exceeding £00 each. State name of union, &c., and amount). Opposite that line there is a blank space in both the Federal and State columns, showing that expenses of this nature are deductible in both cases. It appear. 1 also from the words in the bill that sucb expenses may be deducted. The proviso to proposed new paragraph ea of section 25 reads as follows:Provided that in a case to which this subparagraph applies the person shall be entitled to a deduction of only so much of his subscription as bears to the whole of the subscription the same proportion as the losses or outgoings so incurred by the association in carrying out that activity bear to the total losses and outgoings (not being in the nature of losses and outgoings of capital) of the association for that year. It is therefore recognized in the bill and the income tax form alike, that these expenses are legitimate deductions. If the Commissioner of Taxation is obliged to investigate the exact amount of work done for the purpose of producing income for the individual members of organizations tions, he will need to employ an army of clerks. As the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) has said, all the money subscribed to these associations is spent for the purpose of producing income.

The relevant declarations in the case were made, not by the Abrahams brothers, but by an attorney under power-who , in fact, was prosecuted. The Commonwealth law did not provide that a false declaration should be punishable as wilful and corrupt perjury.

All the papers in the case were sent to the State authorities in Victoria. The Victorian law includes a provision making a false declaration as to income tax punishable as perjury. Those papers recorded the results of the investigations that had been made by skilled and earnest officers of the Commonwealth. But although governments of various political complexions have been in power in Victoria in the intervening period, no proceedings have been taken by the Government of that State.

This is a necessary power to deal with cases similar to that which the honourable gentleman has just been discussing. think that the Prime Minister misunderstood what I said last night, probably because I did not make my meaning sufficiently clear. I objected to what, in very clear language, it is now proposed sliall be done. The amendment provides that, if there has been any default by a company or by the public officer of a company who, as the registered person, is made responsible for the performance of its obligations under the Income Tax Act, any director, secretary, officer, attorney or agent of tbe company, may, if the Commissioner thinks fit, be served with the proceedings, and shall be liable in the same manner as he would be if be were the defaulter. Let us take the case of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, or any other large company that has agents all over the Commonwealth. It is unlikely, of course, that there would be any difficulty in serving such a company, or its public officer, with the proceedings. But surely it is unreasonable that any agent of a company whom the Commonwealth authorities are able to discover should be liable for the default of its public officer! I am unaware that any difficulty has arisen in the enforcement of the obligations of a company. Section 38 of the act sets out the manner in which these matters shall be handled. That section provides that every company that carries on business in Australia shall, at all times, be represented by a person residing in Australia, duly appointed by the company or by its duly authorized agent or attorney. Paragraph c of that section readsIf the company fails or neglects to duly appoint a public officer when and as often as such appointment becomes necessary, it shall be guilty of an offence. The penalty is £50 for every day during which the failure or neglect continues. Accordingly, there is full provision for the appointment of a public officer; and service upon him is sufficient to enable proceedings to be taken against the company. The section further provides that the public officer shall be answerable for the doing of all such things as are required to be done by the company under this act or the regulations by a taxpayer, and in case of default shall be liable to the same penalties. Paragraph g readsIn any proceedings under this act taken against the public officer of the company, the proceedings shall be deemed to have been taken against the company, and the company shall be liable for any penalty imposed upon the public oflicer. It is now proposed that the Commissioner may, if he thinks fit-not if there is any difficulty in finding the public officer-by serving with the proceedings any director of a company, its secretary, or any other officer, or any agent, make that individual liable in the same way that tbe public officer is liable. ment of the tax ? which the company is liable under this act. 1 suggest that, as the law is so complete in the direction of compelling a company to appoint a public officer, there can be no justification for making every director and every servant of the company liable for what the company is bound to do. is prosecuted be able to indemnify himself against the company? to that effect. There are provisions of a general kind which provide that, where he pays income tax on behalf of his principal, he can recover tbe amount from the principal.

Two former Attorney-Generals of the Commonwealth, a former Attorney-General for New South Wales, and the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch), who also is a lawyer, disagree as to the meaning of the provision now before the committee. When lawyers differ, how is a layman to decide? Apparently, I have no alternative but to vote with the Government, and let it bear the responsibility. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that if the company is found guilty the Commissioner may exact penalties against an innocent man, who may have had no association with the offence. If that interpretation can be sustained, the Government is taking a serious responsibility. The Prime Minister said that the Abrahams brothers put forward a man of straw. That practice is not new; unscrupulous companies that are sailing close io the wind resort to that expedient, for obvious reasons. To enable the Commissioner to catch the man who, he thinks, is really liable, whether technically or not, this amendment is proposed ; but, apparently, it goes very much He is not likely to safeguard the innocent? We may assume that the Commissioner will exercise his tremendous power justly, and with the utmost care, but it seems to me that a great wrong may be done, for which there will be no remedy. The provision might be improved by compelling the Commissioner to establish a connection between the offence and the person charged. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has pointed out that the Commissioner may, in the unwarrantable exercise of his discretion and in the absence of any evidence connecting an officer or director with an offence, saddle him with liability.

237,Mr Scullin (Yarra,"Prime MinisThe purpose of this amendment is to do an act of justice to co-operative societies. Previously provision was made that cooperative societies should have certain exemptions from income taxation, but it was found that the wording of the section did not fulfil the intention of Parliament. A co-operative society in South Australia carrying on the business of selling to some of its shareholders and buying from others of its shareholders does not, according to the wording of the section, share in the exemption, although it was the clear intention of Pailiament that it should do so. The clause as it stands amends the section to apply to a co-operative society of that, description. But the amendment that I am now moving will give this section' a retrospective effect. This involves a refund of £2,500. This Government, as was the previous Government, is prepared, where it is found that the intention of the act is clear, to patch up the flaw in its provisions and to make them retrospective even to the extent of depleting Commonwealth revenue. It is a poor law that will not operate both ways. In this case justice is being done to at least one co-operative company. £2,500 be refunded to one co-operative society ? I commend the action of the Government in regard to this retrospective concession. The previous Government approved of exemptions in the case of co-operative societies. At the same time. I protest against the retrospective application of the first part of clause 24. I consider that to be uncalled for and unnecessary. should like to ask the Prime Minister why new sub-clause 2B should be retrospective only to the commencement of the Income Tax Assessment Act 192S. Is that on account of tbe original provision having been introduced then? the operation of the provision. of making these particular concessions retrospective; but I think that a distincact is repealed and the following section tion should be drawn between such legisinsertedS3 in (1.)its stead:lation as this and any legislation which attempts to impose a retrospective liability. Por that reason these new subclauses are to be distinguished from other sub-clauses appearing in the original clause. I am opposed to some of those provisions, for reasons that I have already given. I have been informed by a genuine trading co-operative society in South Australia that it has been unable to take advantage of the exemptions provided in the act, because seven-twenty-fifths of its business is done with non-members. Will this amendment meet such a case? and Treasurer) [9.16] -This amendment does not deal with that aspect of the question. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. and Treasurer) [9.17] I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" 12A. Section twenty-five A of the principal act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:25A.

"" The object of this amendment is to prevent double deductions being made, principally by land-dealers. It has been brought under the notice of the department since the introduction of this bill, that certain land-dealers are, in particular cases, able to make deductions in respect of wire and wire netting used in the construction of fences, and that they are also able to make another deduction in respect of the same transaction.

Although £22,000 of this increase is accounted for by the fact that the activities of the Development and Migration Commission have been taken over by the Prime Minister's Department, there still remains an increase of between. £2,000 and £3,000 concerning which I sbould be glad to have an explanation from the Prime Minister. and Treasurer) [9.31] -The expenditure for 1929-30 was £5S,426; the estimate for 1930-31 is £S2,040.

Those circulars coutain material which is very useful indeed, and, generally speaking, I take no' exception to them. Here and there, however, one finds matter of a distinctly propagandist character, and I suggest that this should be carefully guarded against. The publication of this matter for with public money, and while it is quite proper that the public, and members of Parliament who are responsible to the public, should be fully informed of Government activities, and what is going on in the various departments of the Administration a distinction should be drawn between tion Commission. This still leaves a genuine information intended to be propagandist or persuasive. I refer particularly to material making comparisons with the administration of a previous government. Such comparisons may be made apparently in the way of providing information, and yet may, in fact, be of a propagandist ' character. There have been, from time to time, small slips of this kind. I do not suggest that, on the whole, the material has been propagandist; it has not; but it is evident that the matter has sometimes been prepared in the interests of the Government of the day. The publications also contain occasional statements as to the policy of the Government, and its views upon particular matters. The Government has abundant opportunities, in this House and elsewhere, of stating its views on matters of policy, and publications paid for with the money of the people ought not to be used for this purpose. I hope that this condition will be stringently observed in the future. and Treasurer) [9.39] I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be no shadow of political propaganda in the publications issued from the Prime Minister's Department, and the instructions given to the publishing officer are to that effect. The information made public is gathered from the various departments, is edited, and sent out. It may be that propagandist material gets in occasionally, but it is not the intention of tbe Government that it should. I shall make a note of the point raised by the honourable member. understood tbe Prime Minister to say that the actual cost of running his department had been reduced, as compared with the previous twelve months, but that the grand total of expenditure was swollen by the expenses connected with taking over the activities of the Development is paid and Migration Commission. Under the heading of "" Administrative Costs"" the expenditure for last year is shown at £26,008; for this year it is £46,965. There is a footnote to the effect that this sum includes £16,181 for the development branch, previously provided under Division No. 16A-Developmen t and Migraand material margin of about £4,000 over the actual expenditure for last year. It may be that this extra expenditure is balanced by savings elsewhere, but an increase of £4,000 on salaries, allowances, &c, for administrative officers seems fairly substantial. Under tbe heading of "" Congencies "", there is also an increase from £18,574' last year to £26,850 for 1930-31.

This leaves an actual increase of about £2,500. In respect of some of the items tbe increases are substantial. instance, for office requisites, exclusive of writing paper and envelopes, the expenditure has been increased from £229 to £550. must realize that in respect of all these items provision has to be made for the extra expenses entailed by taking over the activities of the Development and Migration Commission. shown on practically all the items, such as travelling expenses, postage and telegrams, printing and distribution of Commonwealth statutes to State Governments and others, &c. The increase in respect of the last item is over £1,000. expenses are also accounted for by the activities of the development branch. When I was Treasurer we found that expenditure was curtailed by keeping the contingencies votes and estimate as near as possible to what it stood at the previous year. minimum amount of money is available has a useful effect in keeping down expenses. I urge that, even though that course has not been followed this time, the Government should not cease to press for the curtailment of contingency expenses. there was instituted a system .of control by economy committees and departmental committees that tended to cut down departmental expenditure very materially. That, of course, has been reflected in tbe total sum expended, which in the last seven or eight years has not increased appreciably, notwithstanding the fact that many new activities have been undertaken. Here is a field in contingencies votes in which, without doing injury to the conditions or the salaries of public servants, a very substantial saving can be effected. During the year ft will probably be found that the total amount for contincoming more settled and satisfied. If the gencies in the various departments will run into several hundreds of thousands of pounds. This year it is proposed to spend paper and envelopes, £500, compared with an expenditure last year of £229. A saving may be possible in that direction. For Similarly, the cost of writing paper and envelopes, including the cost of printing and embossing thereon, may be reduced from the £500 provided. The expenditure on that item last year was £399. Other printing is expected to cost £1,300, although last year the expenditure was only £223. These items should be subject to a continuous scrutiny by the departmental heads, under a definite direction from the Government that it expects expenditure to be reduced to a minimum during the year. If that be done, considerable savings will be effected throughout the departments. to draw attention to the special Canberra allowance, which, in the Prime Minister's Department, amounts to something like £5,000. In addition to that allowance, various sums are provided for the purpose of paying other cost of living allowances. For some time. I have felt very strongly that an endeavour should be made to improve the conditions of the public servants who were transferred to Canberra. It is The fact that the well known that the cost of housing in Canberra is extraordinarily high. The Government will have to face this issue sooner or later. It is necessary to write off a portion of the cost of the Canberra houses, so as to relieve public servants of the burden of About three years ago high rents, and thereby obviate the payment of this special allowance annually. People who come to Canberra from other States find fault with the expense to which they are put during their stay here. At the hotels they are charged anything up to 25s. a day, and in the business houses they find that their purchases cost them more than they would have to pay in other places. The result is that many people are giving the Federal Capital a wide berth. I am concerned not so much about the hotels as about the public servants who are compelled to live here. Many of them have been keenly discontented, but are now beGovernment were to effect an improvement of their conditions in connection with the cost of their homes, it would' go",53,Prime Minister S Department

264,Mr Mackay (Lilley) [9.48],"I risea long way towards making them contented, and at the same time save the country a great deal of expense. It is too much to expect Australia to continue the payment of this allowance for all time. The Government should meet the position by writing off a certain percentage of the cost of the houses. draw attention to the allowances that are paid to officers who perform duties of a higher class than that in which they are ordinarily employed. In these days we should do all that we can to economize. During the year 1929-30 only £40 was spent upon this item, but this year the Government expects to spend £400. The report of the Public Service Board for 1929 deals with the matter of higher duties allowances as follows:Arbitration determinations provide for the granting of such allowances where officers are required temporarily to perform the duties of liigher positions during the absence of tlie peran amount of £500 for a liaison officer manent occupants on sick leave or for other reasons. The payment of these allowances is open to abuse, it being well known that the value of services temporarily rendered in higher positions does not in many cases justify the payment of additional remuneration, where the temporary occupant is merely carrying on, awaiting the return of the regular officer, who will take up any problems left over by his locum tcnens. The fact that officers who have time and again drawn higher duties allowances have failed to secure promotion, upon the position in which they have relieved becoming vacant, is a clear indication as to the departmental view of their efficiency for the particular work. Much of the expenditure on higher duties allowances is unjustified. The practice has gradually been extended until the nnancial effect is serious. I ask the Prime Minister to investigate the working of his department, so as to ascertain whether additional payments are made to officers who temporarily perform the duties of others who are in a higher grade, while the latter are on leave. In this way, the Government can be committed to a considerable expenditure. There is room for improvement, and every avenue should be explored with a view to effecting economy. An amount of £5,000 is provided for the travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers. It is admitted that those gentlemen are obliged to travel to a greater extent than private members. I contend, however, that travelling by motor car should be reduced to a minimum. All members have passes on therailways, and no Minister should be allowed to travel by motor car when he can use the railways. Inquiries should be made to ascertain whether there are cases of Ministers having travelled by motor car between Melbourne and Canberra. The amount spent by the last Government on this item was £500 less than the sum which is now provided. 1 do not suggest that there have been grave abuses; but I submit that travelling by motor car should be reduced to a minimum.

The other evening the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) endeavoured to confound me, and to give the impression that the influx into Australia of Southern Europeans under this Government had been as great as it was under the last Administration. When I dilated upon the abnormal influx that occurred during the regime of that Government, my statements were challenged. I stated that a greater number of Europeans were brought to Australia during that period than during any other period up to the 1921 census. It is useless for honourable members to squirm when facts are placed before them. The Leader of the Opposition questioned whether I was giving the facts; and the honourable member for Oxley said that I was speaking out of the fullness of my ignorance. during the first six months of 1930 as during the first six months of 1929.",54,Prime Minister S Department

268,Mr Gullett,"As many came hereit does not affect my argument in regard to what happened during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government. The honourable member may try to confuse the issue, but I propose to state the facts from official documents. Up to the 1921 census there were in Australia 2,817 Greeks, 4,003 Italians, 609 Jugo-Slavs, and 1,078 otlier Europeans. The"" other Europeans"" do not include Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss, and Turkish. It will thus be seen that Italian Greeks Jugo Slavs Maltese Other European Races 3,747 In 1921 the Maltese in Australia were so few that they were not separately classified in the census, but were grouped with "" other Europeans "". Honourable members will note that the influx declined in 1928 when the influence of the public began to be felt. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to say that these people were not brought to Australia by the Bruce-Page Government. It may be true that their passages were not paid by the Government, but they certainly were induced to come to Australia by organizations that supported the Nationalist and Country parties. first without my book, the figures I have quoted support every statement. I then made.

The figures that I shall now give will show that what I previously stated in regard to the Bruce-Page Administration was correct, and that, until the public outcry was so great that it was compelled to take action, thai Administration did not take any steps to prevent the influx of Southern Europeans, who to a certain extent have been responsible for the position in which we find ourselves to-day.

The reply of the honourable member will be widely separated from tlie statement of the honourable member for Adelaide. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I am sorry that I did not discover earlier that the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide were out of order at this stage. The honourable member for Oxley may speak on migration only by leave of the committee. [Leave granted.] orable member for Adelaide by interjection I said that the percentage of The large influx of Southern foreigners entering Australia is greater under the present regime than under the Bruce-Page Government. I supported that statement by statistics. The honourable member has now quoted figures relating to migration since 1921. I agree that the influx of Southern Europeans increased considerably after that year, and the reason is obvious. In 1921 the American Immigration Act was altered to provide that the migration of different nationals should be restricted to 3 per cent, of the number of such nationals resident in the United States of",55,Honourable Members Hear Hear

272,Although I Spoke At Mr Bayley,"Replying to the honAmerica at the time of the 1910 census. In other words, for every 100 Albanians in the TJnited States of America in 1910, three additional Albanians would be admitted each year. Discovering that still too many Southern Europeans and Slavs were arriving, the quota was altered in 1924 to 2 per cent, on the basis of the census of 1890, when 'the majority of the people in America were or belonged to the Teutonic or Nordic races. These people were regarded as desirable citizens, and America was anxious to continue their preponderance in its population. From 1921 Southern Europeans have had the gates of America almost closed to them, and not being content to remain in their own countries, they looted for other migration fields, and any other Commonwealth Government to many of them chose Australia. The effect of the quota system in the United States of America will be understood from the fact that whereas in 1921 no fewer than 222,496 Italians entered the United States of America, in 1926, when the 1921 act and the amending act of 1924 were fully operative, the number of Italians admitted was only 9,374. The first big flow of migrants to America was about the year 1851, shortly after the potato famine in Ireland. The Irish people crossed the Atlantic in shiploads, and before long two and a half million Irish were resident in America. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Does the honourable member consider that these facts have any bearing on Australian migration? second big influxion was from Germany in 1871. Disgusted with the FrancoPrussian war and the religious persecutions, many Germans turned to America, the new land of freedom, and invaded that country at a very rapid rate At one time more Germans were living in Chicago than in any city of the world, with the exception of Berlin. To-day there are more Jews honourable members opposite have claimed resident in New York than in the whole that the expenditure for this financial of Palestine. Later other tides of people year is capable of being reduced to the flowed from Europe to America. When extent of £4,000,000, I expected them, that tide was dammed at Ellis Island and particularly the honourable member and elsewhere, Southern Europeans transfor Oxley( Mr Bayley), to make some ferred their attention to Australia, and we were powerless to prevent them from ooming here unless they were of an undesirable type to whom we could apply the dictation test, and deny them admission. The Bruce-Page Government realized that Australia was not obtaining a desirable class of migrant, so it applied the quota system with respect to Jugoslavs, Albanians and Greeks under an agreement entered into between the Auseither of British descent tralian Government and the Governments of those nationals. The quota was limited to 100 a month. We could not enter into a similar agreement with Italy, so a gentleman's agreement .was arrived at under which the Government of that country promised to select with care the type of person to come to Australia. The Bruce-Page Government did more than maintain the purity of our race. My interjection when the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) was speaking was that the purity of our race was better maintained under the Bruce-Page Government than under this Government. I quoted figures showing that the percentage of foreign migrants as against British migrants had greatly increased during six months that this Government had been in ofiice. The actual figures appear in Hansard, and honourable members, if they so desire, may peruse them. I admit, as the honourable member, for Adelaide stated, that the influx of Southern Europeans into this country increased greatly during the years from 1922 to 1928; but, as I have explained, that was because of the passage by the United States of America Congress of an immigration act which restricted the numThe ber of foreigners who could enter that country. Migrants were consequently forced to look for fresh fields, and Australia appealed to them more than any other country. I stress the fact that the Bruce-Page Government did maintain in Australia the standard of 98 per cent, of British stock.",56,Honourable Members Hear Hear

274,Mr C. Riley (Cook) [10.18],"Sinc epractical suggestions for exercising economy in the Prime Minister's Department. Instead of that, they have indulged in a discussion on alien migration. of suggestions before the Estimates are passed. generalities, as did honourable members opposite, I propose to make a specific suggestion. I regret that the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) is not present, because I have already put my suggestion before him. I refer to the contingency votes under the Prime Minister's Department. In this time of financial stress, we should do all in our power to effect economies. I , therefore, invite the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Scullin) to page 29 of the Estimates. Under the heading of Contingencies appear a number of items, such as office requisites, exclusive of writing paper and envelopes; writing paper and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon; account, record, and other books, including cost of material, binding and printing; and other printing. Those items represent a comparatively, small expenditure, ranging from £50 to £250. I suggest that they should be grouped as one item. That would have the effect of making substantial savings, not only in the clerical work, but also in checking, printing, auditing, and the various processes that operate in respect of contingencies. Eaoh of those items involves separate ledger accounts, not only in the Prime Minister's Department or the department concerned, but also in the Treasury. A similar position exists in respect of several items, under the heading of contingencies, appearing on page 38 of the Estimates. They cover writing-paper and envelopes, aecount, record, and other books; other printing, printing of bulletins; and printing of journals. Those items range from £80 to £1,000, and I can see no reason why they should be separated. If they were combined as ono item there would be a considerable saving of expenditure. It is this sort of thing that is contributing towards the ever increasing cost of the Public Serviee. Economies effected in this direction would enable some of the officers who are now engaged on this work to be occupied elsewhere, and this to some extent would reduce the cost of the Public Service. I trust that the Treasurer will give consideration to my suggestion as its adoption will substantially reduce the cost of preparing and printing the Estimates and also reduce the amount of labour and forms now necessary. If it cannot be adopted this financial year, it certainly should be adopted when the Estimates for the next .financial year are being prepared. There are two or three items appearing under certain divisions of the Prime Minister's Department, concerning which more information should be given to the committee. I shall refer first to the Audit Department. This department, above all others, should maintain its activities in a period of depression in order to insure that no money is wastefully expended. I observe, in respect of the central staff that nothing is shown in the expenditure column for last year; that the proposed vote for this year is only a little more than half the amount voted for last year; and that the number of officers has been reduced from sixteen to nine. I should like an explanation of this. It appears also that the cost of office requisites for the Audit Department this year will be more than double what it was last year. I come now to the proposed expenditure under division 11, "" Office of Public Service Board"". An amount of £2,575 is being provided for the holding of examinations, "" including advertising "", although only £1,858 was spent last year. The advertising mentioned must mean advertising incurred in connection with the examinations, because the next line of the Estimates reads, "" Other advertising, £300."" Does the Public Service Board intend to hold examinations ad libitum, and to make numerous new appointments to the Public Service? tends to see that examinations are held for all positions that become vacant. The previous Government filled many positions hy selection. that is not lite real explanation. It it",57,Honourable Members Hear Hear

279,Mr Hawker,"I am informed thatinteresting to note that, whereas the expenditure last year in payments under the Public Service Act and Eegulations to officers on retirement and to dependants of deceased officials, amounted to £2,525, only £250 is being provided for that purpose this year. This reduction, however, is not due to administrative care, but is more or less accidental. An amount of £8,000 is being provided also for the payment of municipal and other taxes in connection with the High Commissioner's office, and £12,500 is being provided for the upkeep of Australia House, London. Last year less money was spent in respect of both these items than sum that was then actually voted. J should like to know, therefore, why an increase is being allowed for this year. I wish to know, also, whether the expense being incurred in connection with the inquiry of the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Coleman) into the affairs of Australia House is to be met out of the vote for the Public Accounts Committee, or the vote for the Prime Minister's Department, so that we may be able to discuss that surprising item of expenditure when the appropriate time arrives.
