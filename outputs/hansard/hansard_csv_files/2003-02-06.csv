House adjourned at 6.00 p.m. Thursday, 6 February 2003 ----Bushfires FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (9.40 a.m.)-I want to place on record my appreciation and thanks to the thousands of volunteer firefighters who have performed so superbly in recent bushfires. I also want to place on record my appreciation of the Australian Defence Force involvement in the bushfires. Australian Defence Force personnel again demonstrated strength of character and versatility as they worked shoulder to shoulder with on-the-ground firefighters over the holidays against some of the most fearsome bushfires we have seen in this country. Faced with an enemy of a different kind, defence personnel were quick to respond to the call from emergency service workers to strengthen the lines of defence against raging firestorms in north-east Victoria, Canberra and New South Wales. In the great spirit of the ANZACs, hundreds of personnel postponed regular duties to lend a mate a hand, providing invaluable backup and support personnel to weary firefighters who in some cases had been working at clearing firebreaks for several weeks. As well as supplying much-needed manpower, Australian Defence Force support included the provision of: bulldozers, water tankers, fuel tankers, buses and drivers, heavy vehicles and utilities, generators, accommodation, bedding and rations, graders, chainsaw operators and a fire truck, as well as defence planners and transport and logistics operations staff. The ADF also provided six helicopters: two fitted with water buckets, two for fire spotting and two for transporting firefighters. Also, 100 Army personnel were deployed in north-east Victoria to help contain bushfires in the rugged high country, hand clearing massive firebreaks around communities already suffering and counting the cost of peak tourism season minus the tourists. As we have come to expect, defence personnel acted with the utmost professionalism, stamina and courage to support the efforts of the volunteer firefighters and emergency service workers, pitching in to defend our rural communities against the peril of the firestorms. It has become an all too familiar sight-those men and women, who pledge to protect the security of our nation and uphold our global obligations, taking up tools of another sort to protect and care for so many of our communities: in cams, fighting fires alongside the CFA; or combining air and sea rescue; or, as they did just recently, using heavy vehicles to clear a path through bush to enable paramedics to access accident scenes. We have seen those vivid pictures, and I want to place on record my thanks and say what a great privilege it is to have those wonderful men and women of our Australian Defence Force there to come to the rescue. Bushfires the grip of a bushfire crisis. In my home state of Victoria, as in other parts of the country, the fires have been particularly fearsome and extensive. It was with some concern that I rose this morning to news that fires had broken out in the Otway Ranges and could threaten many townships in that area. Although this area is in the seat of Corangamite, which is represented by Mr Stewart McArthur, it is an area I know very well having grown up in the western district of Victoria. Today in the brief time available to me I would like to pay particular tribute to firefighters from Geelong and the surrounding region, who to date have made an enormous contribution to fighting fires in not only Victoria but also other states of the Commonwealth. I echo the sentiments that have been expressed here this morning by the member for McEwen.",106,Unhcr And Wait For Refugees To Turn Up On And The Prime Minister Has Explained At

154,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (9.43 A.m.),"As the House will know, Australia is inThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11177 We in Geelong have a deep respect for that contribution because we experienced tragedy first-hand when we lost a crew of volunteer firefighters in the Linton fire in 1998. Five of our finest perished in that blaze. I note that this week we mourn the tragedy in the United States when astronauts died during the re-entry of the space shuttle. In 1998, in a fire tanker in Linton, Victoria, five of Geelong’s finest perished, so we understand the sense of tragedy that nations feel in these sorts of circumstances. I am informed that well over 400 firefighters from the region have participated in firefighting activities in Victoria and interstate. That is a magnificent effort. One can only imagine the trepidation of the families of our local firefighters as their loved ones head out to do their job-a trepidation born out of our own harsh experience. On behalf of the Geelong community, I thank those firefighters and their families for their efforts and contributions to the state of Victoria and to the nation. I give particular thanks to the employers of the volunteer firefighters in the Geelong community. Many of these employers have small businesses, but they quite willingly allow their employees to participate in these community activities. In many respects, they too are the unsung heroes of this battle that we have been waging over the summer in protecting our communities from the ravages of fire. Lindsay Electorate: Infrastructure Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.46 a.m.)-The Penrith region is one in which families are increasingly choosing to live. Thirtytwo per cent of dwellings in this area are fully owned and, more importantly, 35 per cent are in the process of being purchased. The ABS is yet to release further statistics, but it is a fairly safe bet to say that the majority of people purchasing these dwellings are young families. Thirty-nine per cent of the people in the electorate are married, and 23 per cent are children under the age of 15. Put simply, Penrith is a place where people like to bring up their children. Too many people in this electorate travel for four hours to and from work each day. Some say goodbye to their children before 6 a.m. as they hurry off to the train station and do not see them again until after 7 p.m. Others drive to work, to either the city or Parramatta-some even drive to Chatswood or Wollongong. Each day they pay money to use a road that, for much of the morning, is a car park. Such a lifestyle places an intolerable burden on the families that live in my electorate. The quality of life of so many families in this area would be improved if both mothers and fathers could work close to home. In Sydney’s outer metropolitan ring alone, the state government plans to build 31,330 dwellings. My concern is that Carr’s efforts at urban planning will fill suburbs like Penrith with these houses without the provision of infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and schools. If you think the M4 is bad now, just wait five years. The Property Council of Australia has warned the state government that it has focused on residential housing at the expense of employment land. Carr’s government has ignored necessary economic accessories and infrastructure and jobs to support an ever growing population. The Penrith CBD needs to employ 20,000 people by 2011 just to maintain 25 per cent employment in the local area. The other 75 per cent commute on an obsolete, overcrowded train system or use a chronically congested M4. This brings me to the North Penrith army land site. The Department of Defence owns a considerable amount of surplus defence land in this area. The land is surplus to requirements, and the Commonwealth has undertaken to sell the land. That is where the Commonwealth involvement ends. The planning and the nature of the development on that site is the responsibility of the state government and the Penrith City Council. The Penrith City Council has drawn up plans for the development of the site. The plan is based around several key planning 11178 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 principles. The first is to promote development in accordance with the state government’s metropolitan strategy initiatives for high-density dwellings adjacent to town centres and transport infrastructure. This means mass townhouses and flats next to a railway line. The plan is to place a large amount of housing right in the heart of the Penrith CBD. People already avoid driving down High Street due to congestion. Parking is limited, as commuters desperate for a parking space at 7 a.m. have taken all the available parking. Penrith train station is already congested, as there are many people at peak hour waiting more than 50 minutes to pick someone up from a late train. The plan has no long-term vision for Penrith. It ignores the Property Council of Australia’s recommendation to place an emphasis on employment zones. The result of this plan will be to turn Penrith into a dormitory suburb for the city. Furthermore, it lacks a coordinated provision of infrastructure, like schools and hospitals. Planning such as this will see Sydney turn into a sea of houses from the Blue Mountains to the ocean, with employment centred around the city, North Sydney and Parramatta. I am pursuing an alternative plan for the development of North Penrith army land, which places an emphasis on parking and commercial and high-tech industrial sites, similar to Norwest Business Park. The goal here is to provide quality employment in the Penrith region so families can live and work in the same area. (Time expired) Nuclear Waste: Storage the location of one nuclear waste dump for Australia in Woomera, South Australia. The plans and intention to do so by the federal government through its Minister for Science are reckless, foolhardy and short-sighted. That the 14 federal South Australian politicians from the government have been rendered silent on this issue is illuminating indeed and shamefully so. That a final decision could rest with the environment minister is like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop. It is a given that responsibility for the consolidated location of low-level nuclear waste should be the federal government’s. It is also a given that, whatever decisions are made, controversy will prevail. But that does not mean that common sense and responsible policy are not possible. Responsible decision making will locate low-level nuclear waste in each of the states that create the waste and benefit from the material. The current dump site at Woomera known as 52A is not only unsuitable but also unsafe and potentially dangerous. Site 52A is located next to a missile, rocket and weapons testing range in the Commonwealth controlled Woomera prohibited area. It is a bit like building houses next to pine forests or chemical plants; disaster is certain at some time in the future. The federal minister assesses the risk as low and within acceptable operational parameters. His assertion is irresponsible and wrong. A direct hit into a nuclear waste facility would be disastrous. Could it happen? Of course it could. Last year a burning Japanese booster rocket crashed just a few kilometres from the site. My constituents in Port Adelaide who have spoken to me on this matter have a consensus view. The location of any nuclear waste dump next to a missile, rocket and weapons facility is simply unacceptable. Having all risk in one location is not acceptable. Creating the need to transport nuclear waste thousands of kilometres on Australian highways is an accident waiting to happen. Once one site is decided as a low-level site, there is no confidence or trust in this government that it will resist the revenue temptation to create a high-level waste facility as well. My constituents accept that low-level nuclear waste ought to be consolidated in repositories, but without exception they state that the risk should be shared by the states creating the waste and benefiting from the nuclear materials.",110,Statements By Members

Who are those significant others? They are none other than the Department of Defence and BAE Systems, which runs the commercial operations in Woomera. But the environmental impact statement released in Adelaide last month by the minister made no mention of the concerns of the Department of Defence. What is the minister hiding? Will he come into this chamber and deny those Department of Defence concerns? I bet he does not. I bet the fudge is well and truly on. Where in all of this are the silent Liberal colleagues in South Australia, representing their own state? Where indeed! One site. One state. No way. (Time expired) Wharton, Mr Claude Alfred welled Claude Alfred Wharton at St Matthew’s Anglican Church. The congregation ranged from the humblest citizen to the acting Queensland premier. Claude Wharton, a stalwart of the Bjelke-Petersen parliamentary and ministry teams, died at 88. He held the seat of Burnett from its inception in 1960 to his voluntary retirement in 1986. There was no silver spoon existence for Claude Wharton. He drew a block at Barambah Creek, cleared it himself the hard, backbreaking way, lived on possum and kangaroo stew and rowed his milk cans upstream to his father’s property for collection. He was one of that rare breed of determined, hard working Australians who literally carved out their future from wilderness. Anything he turned his hand to he made a success of: dairyman, citrus and pork producer, grazier, droughtmaster stud cattle breeder, co-op director, peak body councillor and churchwarden. It was not surprising that the Country Party endorsed him for the new seat of Burnett. He served as Aboriginal and Islander Advancement Minister from 1975 to 1977 but shone as the Queensland Works and Housing Minister for nine years until 1986, in which year he was awarded the CMG. The embodiment of an era where service to community was paramount, Claude Wharton was the perfect grassroots politician. No request, no matter how small, escaped his attention. Courteous and approachable, his door was open in and out of office hours. He always had time for the bloke in the street. Unlike many ex-politicians who slip into benign statesmanship, on his retirement he threw himself back into his Gayndah community as one of the boys-devoted to his lodge and his Rotary Club, and a regular communicant of his Anglican Church. I salute this friend and mentor, a loving family man and a person of boundless capacity, compassion and common sense. My sympathies go out to his wife, Pearl; his children, Max, Sheryl and Gary; his six grandchildren; and his sister, Beryl. Quick, Mrs Louisa Sarah three-minute time frame. I want to pay tribute to my mum, Louisa Sarah Quick. I buried her last Friday in Nhill in the Victorian mallee. Mum had a long and distinguished life. She celebrated her 86th birthday last July. Her life was distinguished because she dedicated herself to serving others. This service began over 60 years ago through mum’s involvement in the Presbyterian church in Hampton in Melbourne. It was complemented when she met and married dad. As a family, we all moved to Ballarat to care for dad’s parents. Dad was a lay preacher in Sebastopol, and he and mum set about establishing a new church in the outer suburbs. Mum’s dedication to the young mothers and their children saw this small church blossom and grow to the stage where the church was full to overflowing twice on",112,Representatives Main Committee

157,Mr Quick (Franklin) (9.55 A.m.),"This morning I want to do something unusual in this11180 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 Sundays and where hundreds of children attended Sunday school. Much to the initial annoyance of us children, mum supported dad’s decision to give up his well-paying job as a butcher and take on the role as a lowly paid home missioner for the Presbyterian church. Their first appointment was to be Port Augusta. Port Augusta was followed by Rainbow and Jeparit in Victoria, Glenorchy in Tasmania, East Melbourne, Port Augusta again, and finally Kaniva and Nhill. In each of these places, as a partner with dad, she immersed herself in the life of the town through the RSL Women’s Auxiliary, the CWA, the Red Cross, the mothers’ club, the local hospital auxiliary and the Presbyterian Women’s Missionary Union, to name but a few. A very 1950s mum, she bottled all sorts of fruit in her Vacola jars. She wasted nothing and could cook great meals on a low budget. She sewed and knitted anything and everything. She could not do without her bank passbook, feared plastic cards and never used an ATM. She was utterly devoted to my late father, Vern. She was devastated when he died in 1984. To her credit, she continued her work in the church in his memory. She loved to replay dad’s sermons when she felt down, and just remembering their good times together helped to keep her going so much longer. Mum was the keeper of the birth dates, phone numbers and up-to-date addresses of all her extended family. She was also a fanatical Melbourne football supporter from her teenage years. Her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are scattered across the globe. Some reside in the UK, others in the USA and the remainder throughout the states of Australia. Mum spent her final years in the wonderful town of Nhill. I place on record my thanks to the many people there who made mum’s life so special. To Dr Anderson and the amazing medical staff at Avonlea and the hospital who nursed her through her last few difficult years, I can never thank you enough for your dedicated and loving care of mum. Finally, my thanks go to my special mate John Forrest, who took it upon himself to visit and to minister to my mum almost every time he went to Nhill. John saw more of my mum than I did. She really looked forward to catching up with him for a cuppa and a yarn. John took time out from his busy schedule to be with my family at the service and the grave site. Mum has departed this earthly life, but her memory will linger long with us all. 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 December, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 introduces reforms to the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. These reforms are designed to streamline and improve the operation of the scheme created by Labor way back in 1991. Farm chemicals assist Australian farmers, graziers and orchardists to produce quality products for domestic and international markets. Most farmers do, of course, seek to minimise the use of chemicals in their production and they do this for both economic and environmental reasons. It is equally true that the safe use of chemicals makes an important contribution to the productive capacity of our lands-in particular, in Tasmania’s beautiful north-west coastal region in my electorate of Braddon, in the south in my colleague Harry Quick’s electorate of Frank-",113,Representatives Main Committee

In addition, these chemicals help Australian primary producers earn valuable export income through commodity and processed food exports. This government’s appalling record on trade invests every export dollar earned by our farmers and food processors with even greater value. Australia’s most recent trade deficit was the worse in our nation’s history-$3 billion worth, the 13th monthly deficit figure in a row and the worse ever. I noticed the Treasurer scurry in to question time yesterday. In between barrages, he got up and tried to defend this worse ever trade deficit in our history in a pathetic way and then he snuck away. Unfortunately, that does not augur well for our economy. It was interesting to see the Treasurer without his normal aggressive aplomb in the House. As a former college teacher, I have seen some pretty poor report cards, but this report on the government’s performance makes all others pale into insignificance. Despite the relatively poor quality of its ministers, this government has been fortunate in many ways. It is fortunate that Labor did the hard work in government to reform and modernise the economy and fortunate that Labor remodelled Australia’s relationship with the region and the world and created strong and enduring trade ties in the Asia-Pacific region. It is fortunate also that Labor worked with the states on issues of national significance and introduced national standards such as those that underpin the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. On the matter of cooperation, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s boast about his ‘administrative partnership’ with the states in his second reading speech is a bit rich. This minister has adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the states-shared, I must say, by many of his other cabinet colleagues. It is an attitude that has hindered rather than assisted national cooperation on matters of national significance. There is no better example of that than the minister’s failure to progress reform of the exceptional circumstances program. It is a failure that has cost many farmers on the mainland dearly and one that rural and regional Australia will not quickly forget. The matter of assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural chemicals is one that Labor primary industries ministers addressed seriously. Under Labor, cooperation with the states was not damaged by the sort of campaign we have seen from this minister in relation to the drought, for example. This minister has been fortunate indeed that Labor’s legacy included a functioning, effective national chemical registration scheme. The proper assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals does, of course, provide an important safeguard for the health and safety of Australian consumers and the natural environment. Dependent on this system are no less important matters than the prosperity of Australia’s rural industries, the maintenance of our export markets and the health of rural workers, animals and the environment. My electorate of Braddon is home to industries including beef cattle production, poppies, vegetables and food processing. These industries, Minister, benefit immeasurably from the proper use of chemicals and rely on good and sensible regulation to maintain market and commodity confidence in the produce they create. The National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals was, as I mentioned, first agreed between federal Labor and the states in 1991. Between 1992 and 1995 the scheme took shape, with the Commonwealth gaining responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of certain chemical products and their clearance for registration. Since 1995 the National Registration Authority has had responsibility for the evaluation, registration and review of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their control up to the point of retail sale. 11182 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 The states and territories have retained responsibility, on the other hand, for control of use activities. The bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994. In his second reading speech, the minister told the House the amendments are designed to facilitate a more efficient and effective scheme for registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The minister then outlined the amendments in five very short sentences. The opposition recognises the minister’s disdain for detail, but five short sentences is not an adequate explanation for the changes wrought by this bill, Minister. The bill extends-as you know, I hope-to 88 pages and amends three separate acts. The explanatory memorandum tabled by the minister extends to 87 pages. The amendments concern an important national regulatory scheme, and we are told by the minister that the bill reflects an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. But it is my view that the minister should extend this parliament the courtesy of explaining the detail and impact of the legislation he brings before it. In fact, if we in the opposition had any confidence in the minister, we might well insist he do so before we agree to the passage of the legislation here and in the other place. Regrettably, we lack that confidence. The key amendments contained in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 include a new low regulatory regime for certain agricultural and veterinary chemicals, which constitutes the response to a recommendation of the national competition policy review of agricultural and veterinary legislation, and expansion of the deemed permits mechanism to ensure stockpiles of chemicals that lose registration can be utilised safely. This utilisation, including disposal, must be consistent with the instructions contained in the deemed permit issued by the National Registration Authority. The amendments also include a new requirement that labels contain instructions for use and that there be greater consistency in the use of language relating to these instructions; an increased capacity for the National Registration Authority to vary conditions of approval, registration and labelling; a new capacity for the National Registration Authority to seek public comment as part of any reconsideration process; increased penalty provisions; and the standardisation of some definitions. The opposition supports these changes to the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. In our judgment, the bill will contribute to the efficiency of the scheme by reducing the administrative burden on business. Importantly, the bill will maintain appropriate standards that continue to protect public health, environmental safety and our trade credentials. Labor is pleased, therefore, to lend its support to the passage of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. thank the member for Braddon for his contribution to the debate. It was a rather interesting contribution, I thought, because usually opposition members complain that ministers’ speeches are too long. It was rather different to hear him complain that the speech was too short-although I would have thought that having 87 pages of explanatory memoranda was enough, even for the opposition. But he also chose to make a rather brief contribution, and I welcome the opposition’s support for these changes to the legislation. Since 1995, the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals has been established to ensure the safe use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in terms of the health and safety of the community, the environment and our overseas trading relationships.

160,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.08 a.m.)-IThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11183 more confident in the scheme, they have proposed reforms to facilitate a more efficient, effective and responsive regime for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. These reforms will hopefully make some contribution to reducing unnecessary red tape, promoting innovation and providing access to safe chemicals for those that need them. The amendments should reduce business and regulatory costs and generally reduce the administrative burden without compromising the health and safety standards we expect from a national registration scheme. With the implementation of these reforms, Australia’s traditionally rigorous and scientifically credible processes and standards will continue to be maintained. All state and territory governments have provided their agreement to this package of reforms. The reforms make good public health and safety sense. They make good sense for the environment and for the small and large businesses that need to access the scheme. I commend the legislation to the Main Committee and thank the opposition for its smooth passage. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 5 February, on motion by Dr Stone: That the House take note of the paper. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (10.11 a.m.)-Prior to the adjournment of the Main Committee yesterday, I was speaking of the hardships faced by the people of Flinders Island, in my electorate. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services will soon be conducting hearings on Flinders Island to receive submissions about the problems that restrict transport services, at present on a daily basis. The people of Flinders Island, like everyone in Australia, are entitled to protection from the threat of bushfires. Tasmanian life was given a severe jolt by the fires of 1967. On that occasion more than 110 origins were identified in the main fire area, which was just within a 56-kilometre radius of Hobart. Ninety of these fires had started prior to 7 February, and all but 20 were freely burning that morning. It appears that little suppressive activity had been attempted. Seasonal conditions had not helped. September and October rainfall had been well above average and pasture and undergrowth prevailed as a result. But the following months were drier than normal and, by 6 February, grasslands in the southern half of the state were in their most inflammable state. Combined with their density after the spring rains, that was the cocktail mix for the disaster that followed. But it was not simply nature that contributed. Eighty per cent of the fires were found to have been deliberately lit-many for grazing purposes, to bring on new growth before winter; others for malicious reasons. The really sad thing was that many of those who lit the fires had definite land management objectives in mind and did so in reasonably good faith, according to Macarthur’s report, with little or no thought that the fires so lit could cause damage and even loss of life. It is fair to say that we have come a long way in terms of fire risk management and prevention strategies since then. But more is needed. Australia needs a national bushfire strategy. History has shown-and I think it has been dramatically demonstrated by Canberra’s experience in 2003-that there is no one area of this country that feels the annual brunt of fire. It is a natural disaster that affects almost every corner of the country over time but, of course, without a timetable. It makes sense to have a national approach to fighting fires so that our combined resources can be directed efficiently and effectively to where they are most needed. 11184 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 Of course, we do that now-the cross-jurisdictional commitment to fighting fires or to supporting any other disaster relief effort goes on without question-but no single state or territory, or even the federal government, can provide the expenditure for sufficient resources to cover every eventuality within its own jurisdiction. I urge all parties in every Australian parliament to work towards a truly national bushfire strategy for this country. Now is not the appropriate time for finger pointing-and those who have done so have caused great pain in our community-but there is no better time to start on a considered program of bushfire safety review. want to place on record my concern about the bushfires and, in particular, the tragic events that happened in Canberra. I think most people know that I spent my early formative days in Canberra. My first two children were born in Canberra, before I moved to Queensland. In 1997-98, I served as Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government and had ministerial responsibility for Canberra, so I have a special affinity with Canberra, its people and the life that they live here. The member for Bass mentioned natural disasters; Australia is indeed the great ‘wide, brown land’. We have a great range and variety of conditions here. In 1974 I was at home on Christmas Day when I was called in to the natural disaster headquarters as Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin. I thought that I would hold the fort there for about two or three hours, but I finished up going home three days later. That gives an indication of the types of disasters that hit different places in this country. Then, when I was minister for territories, we had the Katherine floods, which were a one-in-a-hundred-years event. On 13 January a young chap called Duncan Patrick, who is a helicopter pilot-his parents come from Noosa in my electorate-had a tragic crash in a helicopter up in the Brindabellas, outside of Canberra, while fighting the bushfires. I think the whole nation read about the gallant and brave way that Jon Stanhope, the Chief Minister here in Canberra, took part in that rescue. He stripped off his clothes and swam in and rescued Duncan Patrick. Duncan Patrick’s family and I commend Jon Stanhope and the others involved in that rescue for their brave efforts. On the night of 18 January, because it was my birthday, we gathered to have a family party. That was the night of the big fires in Canberra. All of us are news junkies and we catch every news bulletin that we can, but that was the one night I had not caught up with the news bulletin, so I did not hear about the tragedy that had occurred in Canberra until the next morning. I was totally shocked. At that stage, they estimated that 400-odd homes had been lost. To me, as a person who had lived here and who knows the city well, I found it absolutely inconceivable that that could have happened in the year 2003. When I got down here on Monday, I took a car and very quietly had a look at Duffy, Holder and Chapman. My late brother’s wife lives on Gleneagles Estate in Kambah, and we visited her. We saw how close the fires had got and heard about the tremendous bravery and courage of people who were involved in that natural disaster. I join the Prime Minister and every other member of this House in commending the people who fought these fires and the property owners who stayed with their houses, foolishly or not. I believe the government should help in any way possible to restore Canberra to its pristine condition. It will be very difficult. There will be many things to consider. Naturally, the first thing you think about is whether these people were insured, whether they were covered for this and whether they can replace their houses. One person I was speaking to about the fires said, ‘Look, we weren’t insured. I had to make a decision whether to insure or to feed the kids.’ So not having insurance in some cases",116,Representatives Main Committee
161,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (10.14 A.m.),"I will only speak for a short while on this issue. IThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11185 is not a case of negligence but a case of necessity. We have to be very cognisant of the fact that there are people who cannot afford insurance. The member for Bass also said that this is not a time for recriminations, and it is not. It is not a time to blame people. The federal government does not have constitutional responsibility for a bushfire strategy; it has to be worked through in cooperation with the state governments. I will lend every resource available to me to encourage the government to work closely with the state governments to formulate a national bushfire strategy, but it cannot be done by the federal government alone. I do not want to see the state governments and the federal government finger pointing at one another. I think this has to be approached in a spirit of cooperation for the future. I commend the motion to the House. which is before the House. I join with Labor leader Simon Crean and other members from this side of the House in offering our condolences to the people who lost family members during this bushfire season, not only in the ACT but in other states of Australia. We express our support to those who lost their houses and property in one of the worse fire seasons on record. As the shadow minister for regional services, territories and local government, with responsibility on this side of the House for bushfire policy, I have had the opportunity to view first-hand the devastation caused in many communities throughout Australia by bushfires this season. On 20 January, I visited fire-ravaged suburbs on Canberra’s south side with the local member, Annette Ellis. I could not believe the devastation the Canberra fires had caused. Row on row of houses burnt to the ground, trees uprooted, burnt out cars and piles of ash and debris were all evidence of the sheer ferocity of the blaze that swept into the national capital. Barely one month earlier, with Simon Crean, in another part of the ACT, I launched Labor’s national bushfire policy in an area that had been burnt out by the blaze that occurred over the 2001-02 Christmas period. Little did we know that four weeks later the national capital would be besieged on several fronts by fires that were both ferocious and devastating. The experience in the ACT has been replicated all over the nation, with community after community placed under threat by bushfires. As we speak, in my home state of Victoria there is news of new fire threats in the Western District and in other areas of the state. I know that the honourable member for McMillan, who will be speaking in this debate, has also experienced first hand the devastation that has been caused by bushfire in his community and the stress that it places on those communities, not just in anticipation of the fire but in coming to grips with its aftermath. So far this summer, six Australians have died, over 600 homes have been destroyed and 1.7 million hectares have been burnt out. It has been one of the worse fire seasons on record and we are certainly not out of the woods yet. As we debate this motion in the House, firefighters in my home state of Victoria are preparing again to defend communities from bushfires. I pay particular tribute to the personnel in the emergency services, who have the onerous task of defending life and property from fire. I refer to volunteer firefighters, members of the police force, ambulance drivers, defence personnel who were called in to assist, welfare agencies, government bodies at all levels and businesses. They have all done a magnificent job in responding to the threat and in coming to terms with the aftermath. They are genuine Australian heroes. Their commitment, skill, professionalism and sense of self-sacrifice and compassion deserve the highest commendation and praise. It is in the frontline when the bush is burning, or in the aftermath when lives and property have to be restored, that we see their great courage and compassion. It should be appreciated, admired and honoured, as we are doing in this debate on the floor of the House today.",118,Representatives Main Committee
162,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (10.20 A.m.),"I rise to support the motion on bushfires11186 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 May I, as I did earlier in this House, pay tribute to the firefighters of the Geelong region. On Australia Day, I left a function to go to CFA headquarters, where firefighters from the region were once again being dispatched to fight fires in other parts of the state. My mind travelled back to 1998, when a Geelong fire crew got aboard a vehicle in Geelong and travelled to the tiny town of Linton in the seat of Ballarat. Those firefighters never came home. I expressed the view in a debate earlier today that we do mourn the loss of the crew of the US space shuttle as it came back to earth-a crew that was manned not only by Americans but by people from other nationalities. It is right that we mourn those people who died in public service. But I would like to reflect today on a volunteer fire crew who in 1998 set out from Geelong to do their duty and protect their community and who never came home. There were five of them lost; a heavy blow to the Geelong community. I refer to the sense of trepidation of volunteers’ families today: when the call is made, it is with a very real degree of uncertainty that they watch their loved ones go to fight these bushfires. As I said, they are the genuine Australian heroes, and we honour them in this debate in the House today. Bushfires are a part of the Australian environment. In the history of Western settlement there have been occasions when the devastation caused by fire was profound: 1939, Ash Wednesday and of course this fire season are examples of that. It raises the question as to what ought to be an appropriate community response when these fires occur and when we seek to restore communities in the wake of those fires. There has been much debate about a national bushfire strategy. That debate was given impetus, in the wake of the 2001 fires, by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the now minister for regional services, who has responsibility in the government for coordinating the federal response to bushfires across the nation. We had particularly bad fires in the 2001-02 season. On 11 January 2002, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, called for a federal-state summit to coordinate services in the event of another fire disaster. I mention this because we did have the example-and it has already been alluded to in this debate-of the minister for regional services coming to Canberra in the context of those devastating fires, seeking to lay blame to score political points off the back of the devastation that had occurred. It was an inappropriate response which was roundly condemned-I think by all members of the Canberra community as well as the national community. It was not a time to be seeking to score political points or to be laying blame when sensitivities were at their highest. I refer to the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister on 11 January 2002 simply because the federal government has called no summit. There has been no summit to discuss the issues that arose out of the 2001 experience. On2 April 2002 the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government announced in a press release that the government was developing a national firefighting strategy in partnership with state and territory governments. No national firefighting strategy has been put to state governments or to the Australian people. The minister cannot walk away from the statements that have been made. I caution the minister and the government in the wake of these terrible events that they ought not to be making commitments that they do not intend delivering upon. Providing a contribution to the leasing costs of large aerial firefighting equipment is not a national strategy. The government has put in place elements of a national strategy, but it has not called a summit and it has not produced what it said it would produce. I was particularly disappointed with the performance of the minister and the Prime Minister in the wake of the Canberra bushfires. The Prime Minister did tour the devastated areas offering comfort to those directly affected by the devastation. That is a right and proper thing for a Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11187 prime minister to do and I commend him for coming off his holidays and doing that. But he described the bushfires as a strike against the national capital by the ‘summer terror’. We are not stupid; the Australian community are not stupid. It was a deliberate attempt by the Prime Minister to link his war on terror to the tragedies that were occurring. That attempted manipulation of the situation did not go unnoticed by members of this community. It is right and fitting for a prime minister to be at the scene of a tragedy such as this and to offer the comfort that he did. It is not appropriate for him to seek to manipulate that situation for another political agenda. We have announced a national bushfire policy, in which there are several elements. We commend it to the government. It is in the process of ongoing development. We have pledged to increase aerial firefighting resources in line with what Australia’s fire chiefs recommended to the government in advance of this fire season in the report that was handed down to the government in August last year, which has yet to be made public. We have proposed an Australasian interagency fire coordination committee modelled on the Canadian experience. I had dinner with the Canadian High Commissioner last night, where the issue of aerial firefighting resources was discussed. The Canadians have particular experience that I think we can learn from. In our policy we have supported a CRC and bushfire research, and we commend the government for making that commitment. We made it in 2002, immediately after the bushfires. The government made the financial commitment in December, and we commend them for it. We also included in that policy the protection of volunteers, because as we know there have been instances where volunteers have left their employment to fight fires and have suffered as a result of that. In conclusion, may I offer this suggestion to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, because there is a direct link between the impact of fires on communities and the tourism trade that goes on in those communities. In the last budget, the government provided $8 million over four years for the Regional Tourism Program and another $8 million for the See Australia program. I suggest to the tourism minister that the guidelines for these programs be reprioritised to give the regions hit by bushfires access to these funds. I also suggest to the minister that funding the redevelopment of tourist attractions be considered as a matter of priority. This would be something constructive which the government could do. I am sure those sorts of options are under active consideration, and they will receive my support. It has been a difficult season, and we are not out of the woods yet. Full marks to those in the front-line fighting the fires. the worse affected areas in far-east Gippsland on Monday and saw first-hand the extent of the devastation of the bushfires. Gippsland has been fighting them for several weeks now, and they have hit with a ferocity that few could have imagined. I did not want to get into it straight away, as I would much rather paint a picture of the loss of people’s livelihoods and the trauma of communities, but the danger is ever present as, at the moment, to be frank, you cannot put this fire out. The firefighting experts, the agencies in control, advised me that it may well go all the way to the coast and not be put out until it hits the ocean. It is likely, as best as can be predicted, to go towards Orbost and Marlo. A large number of small communities are still under threat as we try to protect life and property. It will be a long campaign. People are now calling for inquiries and discussions about its causes. It is undeniable, if you talk to people who have lived in the area and worked the properties, that the build-up of fuel over many years is a primary cause. It is not the only onefreakish weather conditions and the long dry spell, which in Gippsland started in 1995 and has",119,Representatives Main Committee

I do not think it is realistic to think that weeks can go by without community outrage over governments not addressing some of the root problems. I tell you what: greenies had better not go to east Gippsland unless they are there to fight fires. People suffering the loss and hurt of fighting fires and putting themselves at risk-and incredible people from all over Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, New Zealand and America have flocked to east Gippsland to help to contain the fire; you cannot suppress it-are deeply resentful and they blame the greenies. Where are the greenies? I must admit that, for the first time, Senator Bob Brown is lost for words. When he is under questioning on this issue, he clams up. tremist conservationists for bringing us to this point. It is simplistic to say that the failure of state authorities to reduce hazard over the years is the only cause, but it is just as ridiculous to say that it is not a major cause. The other thing that worries those in east Gippsland, as I found for myself, is that lessons are not going to be learned. Already the media caravan is moving on, and many parts of east Gippsland, where the worse devastation has occurred, are too far away from the media. They are not sending TV crews or radio journalists; only local newspapers are sending photographers or reporters. So they feel somewhat overlooked and they think-and it is not that they want this attention-that the corollary will be that the problems will not be addressed. They have never been addressed in the past. Every time there is a major fire-and the last one to compare this one with occurred around Wulgulmerang and Gelantipy in 1965-they say that no lessons are learnt. There was talk in the heat of the moment that there would be remedial action and that proper burning off programs would be done in consultation with the local community, and of course that did not occur. I think that is what is driving a lot of these calls for an inquiry now. If it is not done now, people are so cynical that, without media pressure and interest, state government authorities will be more interested in just covering up the lack of action in the past. I agree that we have to start the inquiry process now. I have come to this conclusion with careful thought, and it is only now, this week, that I think it will not be an insult to or a reflection on the firefighting authorities and the great men and women out in the field still fighting the fire if we have an inquiry. If we do not do it now, I think we will be letting them down, because we are all going to fall into the same trap as previously: a problem out of sight is a problem not addressed. On MondayI toured Gelantipy, Wulgulmerang and Black Mountain and then drove across to Omeo, Benambra and Swifts Creek. When looking at the fire damage in Wulgulmerang, I saw hundreds of trees lying flat on the ground. They were sucked up by the ferocity of the fire. And let me put it plainly: the stomachs of cows were littered everywhere-because the cows had exploded; they have been buried but nobody is going to clean up the entire messand native animals were spread as far as the eye could see. With regard to the farmers, a large number of their paddocks had gone, their fences had gone and their haystacks had gone. Most were able to save their houses, but some of them are deeply traumatised. I know a large number of them. In fact, I was shown around the area by Paul Sykes. I met people like Peter and Sally Moon and Dave Woodburn, most of whom have suffered severe loss. It is incredibly difficult for them. When I went across to Omeo and Benambra, large numbers of stock losses were suffered and thousands of hectares were burnt out. It is incredible that the town of Omeo is being threatened for the third time. It has really been attacked, and you see that it is surrounded by",121,Representatives Main Committee

If the winds come back, Omeo and the small township of Benambra will again be at risk. I was in Omeo before the first burn on Australia Day, and I thought that once the bush surrounding these towns was burnt they would be right, that the paddocks on the southern and south-western sides would be okay. But, no, this fire took on a life of its own and spread like liquid across paddocks where there was no grass. It skipped from piece of straw to piece of straw, and so you see these thousands of hectares of burnt paddocks which were in dry or drought conditions. It is extraordinary. There is no such thing as a firebreak with this fire. It skips rivers and paddocks-hundreds of metres where there is next to nothing. It is like liquid being poured across bare dirt. We are at the mercy of the wind. At the moment, luck is favouring us and the fire is contained. It just burns away in the mountains. Once the wind whips up, it will threaten to descend onto communities. The towns currently under threat-and they are small towns or a collection of houses and farms making up a community-include Bendoc, Bonang, Buchan, Dargo, Goongerah, Swifts Creek and Tubbut. In a worse-case scenario, large towns like Orbost, with 3,000 people, and Bairnsdale, with 15,000 people, will be under threat. No-one in East Gippsland is insulated from the threat of this massive fire, the likes of which we have not seen for decades. They are once in a lifetime weather conditions, sure, but the fuel store is greatly adding to the extent and fierceness of the fires. In those areas in my electorate that have already experienced fire-Anglers Rest, Benambra, Bunbar, Cobungra, Delicknora, Gelantipy, Omeo, Seldom Seen, Tongio and Wulgulmerang-the firefighting effort is inspiring but, nonetheless, they are weary. The department of sustainable environment, the department of primary industries, national parks and the emergency services can rotate their people. They are doing a brilliant job, are incredibly dedicated and are away from their families for long periods of time. They are drawn from throughout Gippsland and from throughout the state. But, for the locals who are fighting the fires themselves, this is their fourth week and they are exhausted mentally and physically. One issue-it is not one for discussion now, but eventually we will have to discuss it-is making some payment to these self-employed small business people and farmers who receive no remuneration. The issue of paying volunteers is a very complex and very sensitive one, but I think the strongest case could be made out for those people who do not have an employer. They are community people fighting in a long campaign. We have not had a campaign of this duration in Victoria for decades. Normally, they are fires of two, three or four days, but the logistics of this are extraordinary given that close to a million hectares have been lost in Victoria to the three fires that have joined to form the Bogong complex. It stretches from Mount Buffalo in the west to the New South Wales border and to near Deddick in east Gippsland. Thousands of personnel are working on the fires: 1,900 from government agencies, a large number of local CFA, approximately 1,500 Country Fire Authority volunteers from outside the region, 120 Army, 120 South Australians, 70 Queenslanders, 35 New Zealanders and 35 from the United States. Over 30 aircraft are being employed, including a Navy Sea King helicopter and an Army Iroquois helicopter. There are over 100 bulldozers, many of them from the timber industry. The state government in Victoria is winding down the timber industry, and yet here they are at the front line, fighting these fires to protect communities. Two hundred and fifty specialised vehicles are currently active. There is a major commitment from all of Victoria-especially from Gippsland communities, including the timber communities-and from interstate. Telstra has been very good. It has provided satellite phones in a number of the areas where there has been a loss of communications. I wish to pay tribute to Peter Ward and Country11190 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 wide, based at Sale. Peter Ward is an Omeo boy, so he has got family there. He has got a deep commitment to Gippsland as a whole but, no doubt, in his heart of hearts, to the Tambo Valley especially. I thank him and his staff for what they have done. I have also seen TXU, the electricity people, crisscrossing east Gippsland in convoys of trucks. They have been brilliant. They have very quickly restored power, and they have needed to. Over 150 power poles have been replaced, 65 linesmen and six site managers have worked throughout this period and 52 trucks and other vehicles and equipment have been used. They have brought in generators for communities as a temporary measure if need be. I thank them for what they have done. They have got communications to affected communities and farmers. There is a dilemma for us because this is an incident still occurring and so all of our efforts are towards fighting the fire, but the fact is that recovery has got to take place as well. Farmers have lost heavy numbers of stock-thousands of sheep and thousands of cattlethousands of hectares of land and hundreds of kilometres of fencing. We cannot just wait for the fire to be extinguished, probably by nature, eventually; we also have to start helping these farmers. The state government is now moving to help. Thankfully, the state government has announced that $500,000 will be provided for fodder, because otherwise cattle will starve. Fencing is an issue; replacement of fencing is essential. There will have to be some counselling too. I am speaking to federal agencies about what we can do. A number of the people I met are struggling to cope with the situation. We must address that. Insurance companies and banks had better not play ducks and drakes on this. They normally do not. During the drought, I thought the banks, after a slow start, were especially good. The insurance companies have been good after floods in Gippsland in the past, but we will be dealing with them as well to ensure that their customary support for people in emergency and crisis situations is continued in this instance. There are many people whom I could mention. I came away feeling pretty proud to be an Australian. No-one complained. There were specific requests as I toured the fire areas on two occasions. But the worse occasion was last Monday. People are stoic, but they are shocked by the extent of their losses and worried about starting again. The Tambo Valley covers Ensay, Swifts Creek, Omeo, Benambra and beyond. In the last decade, there has been a collapse in wool prices and Ovine Johne’s disease has devastated the industry. They have had drought, floods and now bushfires-yet there is no whingeing. The farmers have made a constructive response to the latest losses and the emergency, and they are already looking ahead. But we cannot let them down at this time of immediate emergency. We cannot let them down in trying to minimise, as far as human hands can, the risk of bushfires in the future. motion on the bushfires. On behalf of the people of the electorate of Wills, I extend my sympathy to the victims of these tragic bushfires-the families of people who have lost their lives and also the many families who have suffered through property loss. In some cases they have lost their livelihoods. They have lost their memories, their history and their past. One of the most graphic examples of that, here in Canberra, is the famous marathon runner Robert de Castella who lost his house and property and all the memorabilia which came with it. I was astonished by his mental toughness. When confronted with loss, he said, ‘That’s just too bad; life is going to go on. I’m going to start again.’ I suppose you do not get to be a successful marathon runner without that element of mental toughness, but it was astonishing and remarkable to see. I extend my sympathies to all the victims of the fires. I also wish to praise, as other have done, the efforts of our firefighters. They show colossal courage in the face of bushfire threats. They certainly risk their own lives; there is no question about that. What they do is breathtaking. We are all very much in their debt.",122,Representatives Main Committee
166,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.51 A.m.),"I am pleased to rise in support of thisThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11191 We have had a lot of comments about the causes of the bushfires and implications for future public policy. In my view, some of those comments were inappropriate, particularly those made by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, as the fires were being fought here in Canberra. He was transparently seeking to score political points. Many people have condemned his interventions, I think rightly. Nevertheless, there needs to be a debate about the causes of the fires and we need to know what the lessons are for public policy. I certainly intend to be part of that debate. The first thing we need to recognise is that the bushfires expose the contempt held by a number of people in the Liberal Party for protecting the environment of our children through the creation of national parks. It was not only federal Minister Tuckey who engaged in these kinds of comments. Minister Macdonald and Parliamentary Secretary Entsch advocated the clearing of forests as the solution to bushfires. As soon as you scratch below the surface, their hostility to national parks comes out. Frankly, if ministers of the Howard government seriously believe that the answer to bushfires is to cut down or burn our forests then we had better hope that there is a good export market for salt. We have already seen, through excessive land clearing, massive salinity problems in this country. If you want to keep it up, you will turn Australia into one big salt mine. Transparent attempts to blame the states and territories for the bushfires have been nothing more than political opportunism, and they also fly in the face of the Prime Minister’s stated aim that there should be no finger pointing. Increasing the rate of land clearing or destroying the habitat of our unique wildlife is not the answer, nor is blaming someone else. No-one would deny that carefully implemented fuel reduction burning is important. I certainly support an inquiry into bushfire prevention-I think that is absolutely appropriate-but the real political lesson to come from the bushfires is that it is time that we got serious about climate change. We have research from the CSIRO and elsewhere showing that human induced climate change will result in more frequent and more severe bushfires. The research shows that in much of the country rainfall is predicted to decrease and evaporation rates increase, causing vegetation to dry out, increasing the fire danger in all locations and increasing the number of days of very high and extreme fire danger. The Howard government needs to factor the cost of climate disasters like drought and bushfires into its modelling of the costs and benefits of curbing our greenhouse emissions. If it did so, the benefits of being part of global action to tackle climate change would become obvious. I believe that, more than ever, it is time for the Howard government to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change, urge the United States to do likewise and intensify its efforts to curb and tackle climate change. In 2002 we experienced Australia’s hottest year on record. Unusually high temperatures, low rainfall and high evaporation combined to make this a very bad fire season-clearly the worse in at least 30 years. Our hot and dry conditions are consistent with predictions for climate change from greenhouse gases. Globally, 2002 was the second hottest year on record, and the 10 hottest years since records began-back in 1880-have occurred since 1987. This matches CSIRO predictions of an increase in Australian average temperatures by as much as six degrees by 2070 because of climate change. The CSIRO has predicted that the mean fire danger index will increase by 10 per cent if carbon dioxide concentrations double, which is what is predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In my own state of Victoria, this means twice as many very high and extreme fire danger days each year. Most fire damage, including loss of life, property, farmland, flora and fauna, occurs on those few days per year of high fire danger and in the few years per decade when 11192 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 fire danger is at its highest. The CSIRO is saying that climate change may lead to a doubling of the number of very high or extreme fire danger days. Similarly, I recently noticed Roger Stone, head of the United Nations climate applications research group, pointing out that Australian bushfires are associated with the El Nino conditions which developed six months ago. He noted the impact of the El Nino effect-of more fires caused by increased temperature, lower rainfall and stronger winds in these types of climate patterns-and noted that climate change could increase the fire risks. When the Howard government sits on George Bush’s lap, it condemns our farmers to more bushfires. We have also noted the Insurance Council saying that the cost of the homes destroyed in the ACT-and I think this is an initial estimate; we may well find the figure increasing-will be $100 million. There are issues arising here concerning fire management, and other speakers have spoken of these matters. I am certainly supportive of fuel reduction burning. That needs to occur. It is a complex issue. I note that a group of 16 Australian scientists, the spokesperson being the Dean of Science at Wollongong University, Professor Rob Whelan, is saying that we need to be careful about knee-jerk reactions. Professor Whelan said: National parks are not the reason for these fires. More extreme hazard reduction in forests will not guarantee protection from fires in severe conditions, but will threaten biodiversity. He went on to say: To suggest that these fires would not have occurred if there were fewer national parks is a ridiculous proposition. These fires have already burned vast areas of grazing, pasture, plantation and native forest land, as well as national parks. Similarly, I point out in relation to the issue of fuel reduction burning that there is no one right answer for any given area of land. Research carried out into fires that occurred prior to European settlement-and, of course, they did occur prior to European settlement-suggests that the interval between fires in dry sclerophyll forests, for example, was as short as three years. In a lot of typical eucalypt forests, it was every three years that a fire would occur. But fires in mountain ash forests on the mainland had an average fire interval of 100 years, and the average fire interval for temperate rainforests in Tasmania may have been 300 years. So there are different situations, and clearly the fuel reduction burning needs to have regard to that. I also note the comments made by the Minister for Science, Mr Peter McGauran, who talked about the fires in Gippsland taking on a life of their own, skipping across the paddocks and skipping across the grass. He said: There is no such thing as a firebreak with this fire ... We are at the mercy of the wind. It is a very interesting observation that has also been made in relation to the Canberra bushfires, where you had very serious bushfires coming out of the pine plantation at Mount Stromlo and bushfires coming out of grassed areas, with embers going from the grassed areas onto houses and indeed from houses onto other houses. So to say that the solution to this is to clear everything and that will stop the fires is simply wrong. I want to praise the government for the fact that it announced in December a new national Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, based in Melbourne, which will bring together fire researchers from across the country to investigate better ways of preventing and controlling bushfires, particularly at the urban-rural interface. That is very important work. I believe that the expertise in the CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products division needs to be brought to bear on this issue. Researchers there have developed models of firebrand behaviour to predict spotting distances from different sources of burning bark under various weather conditions, and they note that some of these things can spot up to five kilometres ahead of the main fire, for example. They have also been involved in carrying out studies of the impact of fires from Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11193 various causes. For example, a recent study in Victoria suggested that biodiversity is currently suffering from too much fire around settlements and too little fire in many forests and national parks. It is therefore a question of getting the right balance to support Australian ecosystems. It is far from simple: some species like a lot of fire and some species do not like much at all. In the Blue Mountains National Park, west of Sydney, the dry eucalyptus forests that crown the ridges and blanket escarpments are regularly singed by bushfires but, if you go deep into the gullies and the rainforests, the Wollemi pine survives in those areas only by rarely encountering fire. Optimal fire regimes need to take that into account. They do not simply involve prescriptions of fire frequency and intensity: burning should be patchy and there needs to be a balance of young and old vegetation. One of the researchers, Mr Tolhurst, studied the impact of fire on different parts of the Wombat State Forest, which is north-west of Melbourne, and he concluded that generally ecosystems recover within two years as long as they are not entirely razed. Mr Tolhurst said: A key conclusion from our study was that recovery from fire is rapid provided there are small unburnt patches left behind. Another point I want to make in this debate is that a tremendous amount of fire occurs in Northern Australia. Dick Williams, an ecologist with the CSIRO in Darwin, says that more than 30 million hectares of bush go up in flames every year in Northern Australia-much more than occurs in the south-and yet these fires do not attract the same interest from politicians as fires threatening southern cities. I want to put on record my concern about the amount of burning that occurs in the Northern Territory. It seems that the frequency and intensity of bushfires in Northern Australia have increased substantially since European settlement and this is rather different from the pattern of burning that occurred when Aboriginal people used fire to stabilise what is an incredibly flammable and unstable environment. So we have got a disturbed equilibrium up there and I think it is something that needs to be examined. In relation to fuel reduction burning, it may well be that we need bigger firebreaks and bigger buffer zones between national parks and areas of settlement. But, noting the observations I made before, it is no guarantee that we will prevent fires on private property. We need to understand that as many fires burn into national parks from outside as burn from national parks into the other areas. We need to look for science based solutions. Finally, we need to understand that we do live in a dry, bushfire prone country and we will inevitably experience fires. There are only two or three other countries or locations around the world that are as bushfire prone as ours. Certainly, we need to take all the precautions we can to minimise the damage caused by bushfires, but we also need to understand that this is the nature of the continent on which we live and that from time to time bushfires will be inevitable. example of the urban community giving advice to the bush, to people who have lived there for hundreds of years. These are generations of people who have had to manage their environment, who protect their property and who are some of the greatest environmentalists the nation has, because they are reliant on their environment for their income. They must look after that environment. The posturing of urbanites as to what is good for the bush, how fires should be managed and the sudden expertise such people have gained is just incredible. In my area, we lost 41 homes to a wild bushfire, and that was before Christmas. We regularly have bushfires in our area. Our community lives with bushfires and has a very comprehensive rural fire service.

It is a terrible thing to lose your life’s treasures and probably the largest investment most Aussies make, their home, when a fire takes hold and destroys your property. It is very sad and traumatic and it takes a long time to recover from that. The people in my district are only now, some two months later, starting to get on with their lives, to rebuild and reconstruct their homes and to look to the future. I have to say that I agree with the Minister for Science: I do not think that a delay in having a look at the causes of these fires and how we might better manage them should be delayed. I notice the Victorian government is not delaying the inquiry into the train disaster. We have lost many more homes. Two lives were lost in my area, though none were lost here. When a serious thing occurs, to delay an investigation is not a good thing. Information needs to be gathered while it is relevant and fresh in people’s minds. We have not concluded the fire season at this point, so there is a limit to the extent of an inquiry and it would be a shameful thing to pull people off the fire front in order to take part in an inquiry. However, I believe that the framework can and should be set in place while all of the occurrences are fresh in people’s minds. I refer the House to a publication of the New South Wales government, which is entitled Burning question: the rationale and the problems. This booklet commences by saying: Every year in Australia, thousands of hectares of native bushland and crops are destroyed by wild fires. Damage to property and, tragically, the loss of lives does occur. Land managers and fire authorities must therefore look to practises that minimise the impact of fire on the community. Many strategies have been considered and tested over the years to effectively reduce the number, frequency and severity of fires. To minimise the adverse impact of bush fires, land managers and fire authorities have to consider the three concepts of fire: prevention, mitigation and suppression. The problems associated with each of these concepts are explored in some detail. Each have their problems and limitations. Reliance on one of these concepts alone will not necessarily achieve the required outcome. The one strategy that has been the most effective is that of fuel reduction. This booklet then goes on to explain the processes and the reason why fuel reduction should take place. This is a publication from the New South Wales government; it has the logo of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on it. It is a government publication and this is what the New South Wales government has been saying. People like Bob Brown do not count that sort of thing as being valuable. Bob would like to stop dams being built and then complain when houses burn down because we cannot put the fires out. It is illogical. There must be a proper scientific approach to these things. It is just madness to oppose everything that, with a rush of blood, you suddenly want to oppose. Bob was opposing dams and logging and the use of timber, but now he is opposing a potential war in Iraq because that is a politically wise thing to do. I suggest that as soon as the Iraq matter is over he will find something else that he thinks it is popular to oppose. It is really quite illogical to say that these difficult issues should not be tackled by government. I think the apologists for the state governments in the Australian Labor Party would be better off in trying to come to grips with these issues. Governments have to make decisions and people in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and similar services offered by state governments need to resolve these factors and need to be up front about doing it. There is no reason why we cannot work through documents such as this one and find out why it was in New South Wales, for instance, that the legislation allowing for the management of national parks was not passed until 21 August, a time too late in the season for any preventive burning Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11195 to be done. The dereliction of duty by the state governments and their failure to focus on the tasks and on these issues must be part of the examination that takes place. It seems to me that we need to be careful, both for good management and for sensible retention of flora and fauna. From the fires in my district, the intensity of the heat and the speed with which the fires travelled, millions of trees will not recover. Usually, after a bushfire, trees will recover. Thousands and thousands of native animals were destroyed-wombats and wallabies-and bird life of all types because of the extent of the fire and the speed with which it travelled. If we can do anything to prevent that, we will be taking a common sense interest in our environment. Those are the arguments that the Australian Labor Party choose to misrepresent by saying that we want scorched earth and concrete over Australia. That is not the case. There is no better conservationist than the man on the land. In today’s Herald Sun there is a little story that captures the attitudes of many people in the bush and many people familiar with fighting fires. It is the story of cattleman John Rogers. For 20 years John Rogers has been asking public servants to do something about the build-up of fuel in the Alpine National Park next to his farm. They refused. The article says: Six years ago, Rogers decided he’d had enough. So he set fire to a bit of the park in a classic fuelreduction burn, the kind of thing some country fire brigades have demanded Parks Victoria and the Department of Sustainability and Environment do much more of. But for trying to burn himself some security, he was taken to court and made to pay almost $2000. And the park next door never did get all the fuel-reduction burns it needed. Now John Rogers, punished for trying to protect a bit of forest-and his farm-has seen that same forest go up in a terrible wildfire, just as he’d always feared. And, also as he’d feared, his farm went up with it. All he saved was his house. Four sheds, tools, miles of fencing, pasture and a dozen cattle-all gone. That is the problem we are confronting and that is one thing that we need to deal with effectively. The people in my district have expressed their appreciation in functions held at Galston last weekend and a few weekends before at a function held at Glenorie, where funds were raised in large amounts. Thousands of dollars were contributed by people to assist those who had lost their property. Included were the clubs of the district: the Glenorie RSL Club, the Galston Memorial Club, the Dural Country Club and Castle Hill RSL. I start on a dangerous course in trying to mention the organisations that have come together to assist those who have lost their property. Fundraising has gone on and fire brigades are now looking for additional equipment, some of which is to replace equipment which has been lost but also to supplement the functionality of their sheds and their units. We were most fortunate in our district to lose just 41 homes. It could have been hundreds; it could have been much worse than Canberra. Fortunately, the weather and wind conditions were such that the fire was able to be contained. It did not move south. It moved across the top strip of Sydney, burning an area of roughly 50 kilometres by 50 kilometres. There were approximately 1,500 firefighters involved in the event and probably 200 firefighting unitstrucks and equipment-supported by men and women. All sorts of support units came out for food and emergency support, including the ambulance, the police, professional fire brigades, the SES-a great volunteer organisation-and of course the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. All of these people worked together to try to prevent things getting worse. Today we are saying how much we feel for the residents of Canberra. I know my people would understand the feelings from this unexpected tragedy in the national capital. But they are saying, ‘Let’s move on and start to do something about resolving this for the future.’ They have heard for too long that they cannot do cold burns in national parks. They have heard for 11196 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 too long that sensible programs cannot be introduced. For too long they have heard, like cattleman John Rogers, that it is a crime to try to take preventive measures, but they also understand that the loss of millions of tonnes of timber and huge quantities of precious flora and fauna is not replaceable in the short term. They also understand that sensible measures that they have been practising for years, and which are now prevented by national parks and the state government, hold some of the answers that are needed in these circumstances. I pay tribute to those involved in fire prevention, fire services and emergency services in our own district. We extend our sincere good wishes and support to the people of Canberra. I know that many people have come down here to fight the fires and give support to those in the Canberra district and in the Eden-Monaro area to the south. We need to start that inquiry and we need to be fair dinkum about it. We do not need to protect state authorities, even if they are run by the Australian Labor Party. sland are experiencing substantial bushfires in the eastern part of our region, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. It has been a very tough time for the people in East Gippsland. The fires have not just lasted for a day or two; we are now into the fourth week of fires in far-eastern Gippsland. A lot of people have been involved in fighting those bushfires, and a lot of people have been affected by the impact of those bushfires. For us in Gippsland, it has been a uniting experience, although it has been a terrible experience. Few people get to experience bushfires in their lives, but the people that you speak to who have experienced bushfires will tell you just how terrifying they are. The impact of going through it lasts forever. The people in East Gippsland have fought courageously against these bushfires. They have fought courageously to protect their communities and their livelihoods. They have not fought alone; they have been joined by family members and friends from right across the Gippsland region, from right across Victoria, from right across Australia and even from overseas. The people who live in my electorate have made a substantial contribution to fighting those bushfires in far-eastern Gippsland. We consider ourselves very much a part of the same region and, when our mates in East Gippsland needed help, people from my district were only too ready to lend a hand. A lot of CFA brigades from my electorate have been involved. A few that spring to mind are: the Drouin brigade, the Drouin West brigade, the Noojee brigade, the Moe brigade, the Warragul brigade, the Nilma North brigade, the South Drouin brigade, the Westbury brigade and the Newborough brigade. Those are just a few that spring to mind; there would be many others that have contributed to the fight against the bushfires. Hundreds of people-if not more than a thousand-from my electorate have been directly involved in assisting the communities in far-eastern Gippsland deal with the bushfires. These people have contributed either through their volunteer services, through the CFA or by just going to those areas and lending a hand-being there to support the people, through the volunteer efforts of the various community groups which have been involved in helping the people who live down that way; or, in less formal ways, being a support to family members and friends who live in far-eastern Gippsland. It has been an incredible time in the Gippsland region. There has been a climate of fear that I have never seen before in my life which has been created by the very real ongoing risk of bushfire. Every hot day that we have in Gippsland is a day when people in Gippsland think about what that weather means for the people fighting the bushfires in far-eastern Gippsland. We also think of the risk of bushfires to our own towns and communities when we have that type of weather. We had a very real threat of fire in Morwell in my electorate. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Adams, I know that you are familiar with our district, having been to the La-",127,Representatives Main Committee
168,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (11.19 A.m.),"I rise to support this motion. The people of GippThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11197 trobe Valley. This particular fire took place on the Princes Highway between Morwell and Traralgon, but on the east side of Morwell. You can see the impact of that very small fire every time you drive up and down the Princes Highway. It is a very real reminder of the bushfires which are taking place in East Gippsland and also in other parts of the country. The fire took place right next to the Energy Brix Australia briquette factory. It was right next to the timberyard of the Drouin West timber facility. It was right next to the open-cut mine of the Hazelwood Power Station. I mention the location only to draw to the attention of the House the significance of what would have happened had that fire got out of hand in that location. Some people here may well remember when we had a fire in the open cut in the Latrobe Valley. The fire took a very long time to put out. It was a case of all hands on deck in the Latrobe Valley. Every able-bodied man in the Latrobe Valley stopped what he was doing and, with very rudimentary equipment in those days, battled those fires until they were put out. The risk is enormous with coal and timber. Energy Brix Australia’s briquette factory has a lot of coal powder and coal fuel, as well as flammable liquids that are used for the maintenance of the facility. We experienced a very real threat of bushfire on our doorstep in the Latrobe Valley and in other parts of my electorate. Our thoughts have been always with those people in our region who are going through enormous hardship and have showed enormous courage in dealing with the bushfires in East Gippsland. These are communities which are resilient and tough. These are people with whom we have had a long association. Many people from my electorate have family and friends who live in East Gippsland. For many of us, it is a place where we have gone for our holidays or which we have driven through as we headed up towards New South Wales and perhaps into Canberra or southern Queensland. These areas are well known to us, and the people are well known to us. They are our family members and our friends. Our thoughts have never strayed from them during these difficult times that they are experiencing. The volunteers have done a wonderful job. They have shown enormous courage and enormous grit. They have been prepared to do hard things to protect their communities and to make sure that people in other communities do not lose everything they own-everything they have worked hard for. But we must not think only of the people who went to fight the fires; we must also think of the people who stayed behind. We must never lose sight of the fact that the people who stayed to protect their communities from the risk of a fire are just as brave and made just as big a contribution to the communities and regions in which they live. It takes a lot of courage to go and fight a fire, just as it takes a lot of courage to not go and to stay to protect your own community from the risk of bushfire. That is what happened right across Victoria. I want to say to those people who stayed behind: we know just how gutsy you were to stay and fight. We know just how special your contribution was, even though right now there might not be a bushfire in your own town or community. When we talk about the volunteer firefighting effort, often the contribution of employers, in particular small business employers, is overlooked. I want to say sincerely to those businesses who let the Country Fire Association volunteers in their employ go to fight the fires: thank you so much for doing that. Thank you so much for making those people available to fight those fires because, without those people, communities would have faced up to those bushfires without the personnel they needed to fight that battle and to protect their livelihoods, their properties and the lives of their families and loved ones. I say to the employers who let go their people who are volunteers: thank you for doing that. We are lucky in Victoria: in firefighting and emergency services we have a great partnership of full-time personnel and volunteers. We are also fortunate in Victoria to have a gov11198 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 ernment which takes seriously the role of emergency services volunteers and which backs them accordingly. In Victoria, the Bracks government has contributed an additional $120 million over three years towards the CFA. I say to Steve Bracks and his team: well done. That work, that funding, that commitment and that belief in the importance of this area is so important right now. Often in political life you make a contribution and it does not get recognised. The contribution that the Bracks government has made to skilling up our people and making sure that they have the resources they need to fight these fires is very obvious-people in the community are getting a benefit from that right now. In talking about the people who have made a contribution to handling the bushfires in East Gippsland, I want to place on record my absolute admiration for the work that ABC Gippsland radio have done in their coverage of what has been a very substantial disaster in our region. The courageous reporting of Mark DeBono, who has been with the people of fareastern Gippsland at substantial personal risk to himself, in bringing news of those people to us has been incredible. The work of Kellie Wilson, who has been supporting Mark and the rest of the ABC team in bringing the news of the bushfires that are taking place in the east to the rest of Gippsland, has been fantastic. We are very lucky in the Gippsland region to have Mark DeBono, Kellie Wilson and the rest of the ABC Gippsland team. They understand that it is our family and our friends in East Gippsland going through this crisis, and we want to know how they are going and what is going on. They have made sure that we have been informed, they have made sure that they pass on all the information they have and they have played a substantial role in assisting the emergency management people over there, by providing information to people who are at risk at the fire front and by helping to coordinate that volunteer firefighting effort. SoI say a very big thank you to Kellie Wilson and Mark DeBono, from all of us in the Gippsland region. We in Gippsland owe you our sincere thanks for all your efforts and everything you have done in bringing us the news of what has been taking place in terms of the bushfires in East Gippsland. I was at the Noojee Country Music Festival and Mountain Horse Racing event over the weekend. It is a great event-many thousands of people go there. This is the fifth year that I have gone and the fifth year that I have presented the trophies to the people who win the mountain horserace. When I was up at Noojee, I spent a lot of time talking to people from that district who work in the timber industry and who are involved in local firefighting efforts. Such an enormous number of people have made a contribution to helping with the fires in East Gippsland. I felt so proud, as their local member, to represent such an amazing group of peoplepeople who are not millionaires but who give their time so freely, people who do not have a lot but who give to others. The people who work in the timber industry and the people who live in Noojee, West Gippsland, the Latrobe Valley and right across the Gippsland region are an incredible group of people. I am lucky to represent them. I know how much the people who are now fighting the fires in East Gippsland appreciate the efforts of people from my electorate and from right across the country-in particular, other parts of Victoria-to make sure that their communities are kept safe. It has been a tough time for us, but I am enormously proud of the contribution that people in Gippsland have made to keeping other parts of our region safe. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (11.35 a.m.)-I seek leave to speak on this motion without closing debate. Leave granted. Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11199 the Prime Minister in extending the sympathy of the people of the electorate of Murray in northern Victoria, to all Australians who have suffered grievous, personal losses due to the fires in recent months. The extent of the loss of life and property in the ACT was particularly tragic. On behalf of my electorate of Murray, I also want to express concern and sympathy for those in Gippsland and, in particular, our neighbours in the north-east of Victoria-where dozens of small communities have been battling fires for more than a month, in conditions that frequently demand great personal courage and stamina. As I speak here today, there are north-east communities that continue to be on full alert-watching, waiting and activating their fire plans daily. The fires continue unabated and will not be quenched, it would seem, until we have a prolonged deluge. We just pray that this will come soon. Only someone who has experienced the intensity and terror of a raging bushfire can begin to understand what the communities still suffering are going through. Our thoughts are with them. I also want to acknowledge the excellent support of Goulburn Murray ABC FM radio. They have been broadcasting daily detailed and critical fire related community information for weeks now. Their producers and presenters have ensured communication between the communities, firefighters, emergency services, Bureau of Meteorology and countless volunteers and have delivered seamless information in a way that has helped maintain morale and a sense of community. People working together to survive the worse fires on record are grateful for this support. I also want to sincerely thank all of the volunteers from the local country fire brigadesparticularly Region 22, who have gone from the Murray electorate to the north-east to lend a hand. Members from over 80 of our rural fire brigades, 16 urban brigades and 10 groups have gone from the great flat plains, where irrigation channels often protect us, into the north-east forests and hills to lend a hand. Their effort has been outstanding and, as the Prime Minister’s motion states, it truly demonstrates the strength of the Australian spirit. Environment Australia has been updating me on the status of the fires. I think it is important to put this on the record so that future generations reading back to this time will understand the extent of the current disasters that are facing us. On 29 January, fires were still burning in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. The fires in southern New South Wales, alpine Victoria and Gippsland, in particular, still pose the greatest threat to property. The impact of the current fire season on the Australian Alps national parks, which stretch from Canberra almost to Melbourne, has been very significant. The fire front has stretched more than 200 kilometres from Mount Kosciusko to Mount Hotham. An area of over 750,000 hectares had been burnt by late January: with 380,000 hectares in New South Wales, including nearly half of Kosciusko National Park; over 420,000 hectares in the Victorian alpine area; and much of the ACT, including 80 per cent in the Namadgi National Park and the Tidbinbilla nature reserve. The extent of the area burnt has exceeded that of the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983-when over 100 fires in Victoria burnt about 210,000 hectares and over 2,000 houses were lost-and so far it is half the area destroyed in the 1939 fires. From December 1938 and to January 1939, fires burnt 1½ million to two million hectares in Victoria alone. Back in 1851, fires covered a quarter of what is now rural Victoria-approximately five million hectares were burnt, we are told, and it killed over one million sheep. So we are not strangers to fires in this country, but the devastation is nonetheless very severe and involves great personal trauma. Since1 January 2003, fires started by lightning have burnt over 17,000 hectares in the Blue Mountains National Park, part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. At this",130,Representatives Main Committee
169,Dr Stone,"I rise to support the Prime Minister’s motion relating to bushfires. I join with11200 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 stage, it is impossible to quantify the cost to the nation of the assets that have been burnt. Of course, fires are a natural part of the Australian landscape. We live in a fire-prone environment, with periods of peak fire danger occurring in particular seasons in all parts of the continent and Tasmania. The sustaining of much of our unique biological megadiversity is dependent on a regular, but not too frequent or intense, burning regime. Australia’s Indigenous owners developed systems of highly effective fire management to modify and sustain the landscape in order to regenerate and increase their food supply. Fire was also used for communication and improving travel routes. Indigenous societies also knew the importance of reducing fuel loads from time to time to lessen the risk of more intense destructive wildfires that killed rather than regenerated species. We are now in the midst of a very extensive and prolonged drought. This has been accompanied by some of the highest temperatures on record, and these circumstances have combined to create this extreme fire risk and outcome. They have resulted in some of Australia’s most extensive and destructive fires. The last time we saw such devastation was in the fire disasters in New South Wales during the terrible drought of 1901. All the fires have not yet been put out, and it would seem that they could be as severe as the fires of 1926 and 1939. Contemporary fire management, particularly the use of cold burns or prescribed burning to reduce hazard and for biodiversity conservation, is complex and controversial. When the last fire is out and everyone has had time to recover, public land managers, policy makers and experts need to sit down and analyse the behaviour of the fires in areas treated differently in terms of hazard reduction and other fire management efforts. The John Howard-led government has committed $25 million to the new Commonwealth Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre. This was announced just last year. Participating agencies include the Bureau of Meteorology, state and territory land management agencies and fire authorities, the CSIRO, universities and Emergency Management Australia. Obviously, that CRC will have very important work to do. In the wake of the recent disasters, some have called for a national inquiry into bushfire prevention. Assessment of the environmental impact of the 2003 fires will require evaluation of firefighting strategies. Mechanical intervention using earthmoving equipment, backburning and the use of fire retardants play an important role in wildfire suppression, but we need to better understand the environmental impacts in the short and longer term. We also need to note where the fires began. At this time, a lot of people are focusing on national parks or state parks and their fire management regimes. Interestingly, the New South Wales fire service reports that, recently, less than 10 per cent of the fires that started in national parks moved outside them. Twenty-four per cent of fires in parks started outside them and moved into the parks. Alarmingly, 21 per cent of these wildfires were caused by lightning but the rest were caused by arson or suspected arson. Most of these fires could have been avoided, and this is a shocking statistic. It would seem that, while many Australians risk their lives to save others in fires, there are too many other Australians with criminal intent prepared to put lives, property and biodiversity at risk. Fireproofing our great country is not possible-and, besides, many ecosystems have evolved to depend on fire for regeneration-but perhaps we are moving into a new era where the new Bushfire CRC will be covering new ground with the research it will undertake. I am referring to climate change. In 2002, Australia’s Third national communication on climate change reported that the incidence of wildfire in Australia could be expected to increase with global warming. The number of days of extreme and high fire danger could be expected to increase. Insurance and finance industries are re-evaluating risks associated with insurance in Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11201 light of changing climate and projections of increased property damage through events such as fire. Possible responses by insurance companies to an increase in the frequency of such events include raising premiums, restricting coverage and withdrawing from some areas of insurance with the highest risk. Obviously, any such decisions will have significant economic and social ramifications. We also have to take serious action in terms of our public lands. The interim report of the Independent Scientific Committee on An assessment of the values of Kosciuszko National Park noted in a chapter on fire: Specific areas prone to high-intensity wildfire can be accurately predicted, so it is possible to preclude developments and investments in these lands, by using restrictions similar to those applied in areas subject to other natural hazards such as flooding and landslip ... Such measures could include: strategic fuel reduction (including prescribed burning) ... ; exclusion of residential and other asset development in fire prone lands; making assets fire resistant; ensuring that those involved in fire management have a basic understanding of fuel dynamics and fire physics ... All of this work needs to be done, and I am sure it will be. Certainly a one size fits all strategy cannot be adopted for fire in Australia. The extensive annual controlled burning for ecosystem management in Kakadu, for example, is quite different from the fire strategies which are aimed at protecting people, plants and infrastructure in the Australian National Botanic Gardens. Fuel loads and fire behaviour are influenced by many factors, including the structure of vegetation cover, weather, the terrain and the history of land management in the area. However, the interactions between type of fuel, temperature, wind speed and direction, and fire spread can mean that-despite the very best efforts of firefighters on the day, the forward planning of land managers and the fire plans of householders-a tragedy like the ACT fires can still occur. A city fringe wildfire in gale force winds, in tinder-dry drought conditions and with temperatures like the temperatures this January will inevitably be disastrous. I also wish to refer to the role of the Bureau of Meteorology as it struggled to keep up with the demands of so many fire fronts and the increasing need to do more accurate forecasting to assist in the firefighting effort. They coped with the demands in a magnificent way. I am proud to report the accuracy and the speed with which they were able to assist the firefighting effort with forecasting. In particular, the Victorian Regional Forecasting Centre has been working seven-day, round-the-clock shifts. To give you one example of the intensity of their work, on 15 January there were eight uncontrolled fires, 28 fires contained and 65 fires controlled, mostly over north-east Victoria in mountainous terrain. Forecasting was required for all of those fire fronts and in conditions where often, for example, the winds blowing in the valleys were blowing from a different direction to the winds at the top of the mountains. In addition to forecasting accurately in a timely manner for the firefighting, because of the smoke and haze, aviation forecasting has also been a particular challenge. The Bureau of Meteorology has been performing magnificently to ensure the greatest possible public safety. I want to repeat that we are in difficult times with our fires but Australians are not strangers to the devastation of fire in this country. Fire is a natural phenomenon. However, with humaninduced global warming, we can expect more fires in the future. We need to understand those fires better, understand the needs of ecosystems and also understand the human psychology that puts some individuals with a matchbox in their hands beside a flammable heap of material in the bush, with no regard for the lives of their fellow Australians. I very strongly support the motion by the Prime Minister. We are a great country with great people. This fire season effort yet again demonstrates what real Australians can do. 11202 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 devastation wreaked not only here in Canberra but throughout the continent. A couple of years ago Sydney was absolutely ringed by bushfire. Our biggest city, with the largest population, had at its very core bushfires of an intensity and immensity that could hardly be imagined. People found it very difficult to comprehend just how significant a natural force this was. Year after year, some years more than others, this has come to the fore. There have been responses to that over time. The latest response of significance was in 2002, when, after more than 100 years of this federal parliament, a specialist body was finally set up to have a look at the nature of bushfires from a federal perspective. In part, that is because responsibility for dealing with bushfires, controlling them and taking care of the environment locally has largely been put at the feet of state governments and of local council or shire bodies. What we do know is that it is fundamental that we have a Commonwealth research institute to look deeply into the very nature of the Australian landscape and how it has changed and that it come up with a better means of dealing with Australian bushfires. I think the fundamental problem we face is very simple: we do not know very much at all about Australia’s landscape and how it operates. Despite being surrounded by 600 different species of eucalypts, we do not understand their fundamental nature, we do not understand how they operate, we do not understand how to manage them and we do not understand how to live with them. And yet, at state and federal level, we have had public policy made that should be based on those fundamental understandings. Looking at the early history of Australia, population from the West-from Englandstarted here in 1788, after Cook’s discovery 18 years earlier, after previous discoveries by other Europeans. From the evidence, it used to be thought that Aboriginal migration to and population of Australia occurred between 25,000 and 40,000 years ago. That was upped to probably about 60,000 years ago. There is some evidence that it could have occurred 100,000 years or so ago but, for most of the modern period-the period of homo sapiens-the Aboriginal people have been here and have managed the land. But, since 1788, the Australia that the Europeans came to has dramatically changed. We know that there is far less forest here in Australia than when Captain Cook first sighted the shores of eastern Australia. We know that there is far less forest that is tropical rainforest based, because we know what was culled out of the northern part of New South Wales in the cedar-getting that was one of the first great industries in Australia. We also know that that has caused a dramatic change in the nature of the forests that are left, and it has in fact encouraged the takeover of those areas that were temperate or subtropical rainforest by eucalypts. We know also that, apart from the dramatic diminution in the extent of our forestation, it has probably changed. Early on, when I was a history teacher dealing with the very early depiction of Sydney and the colony of New South Wales from 1788 to about 1810, there was a view prevalent that the Australia that Cook saw and that Phillip helped to establish a colony in was just the same as the Australia of today and that the bush then was the same as in the Australia we have today, except that there was more of it. It was thought by some historians, but certainly by art historians, that what was painted of early Australia-the depictions we got first from rough sketches by people on Cook’s voyages and later in the works of Tench and others, and the very first representative pictures-emerged as being so different to what we know Australia to be because English people were doing the paintings. The central idea was that you held within your head a certain view of what the environment was like. If you were Eugene von Guerard or one of the other early painters of Australia, the",133,Representatives Main Committee
170,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (11.49 A.m.),"Once again, this summer we have seen enormousThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11203 expectation was that you would paint a parklike depiction of Australia, with afforestation that had virtually no undergrowth but very short grass. That is an indication that these artists were prisoners of their ideas of what landscapes should look like because they came from England or the Continent. There is a very strong set of reasons why you would expect that to be true. But later evidence that was advanced helped, I think, to change the possibility in terms of that picture. The best expression of that was Robert Hughes’s work-a major and monumental work on the foundation of the colony of New South Wales. That work provided the first information that there might be something more fundamental than that-that it was not just the way that Pieters saw the land. More importantly, in his work called the Future Eaters, Tim Flannery, an environmental biologist, put forward a different view not only of the operation of fire and the way in which the Australian landscape was managed and developed by the Australian Aborigines but also of the fundamental place of large marsupials in the control of that environment. In an article a week or so ago titled ‘Bushfire of our vanities’-and I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for finding this at very short notice-Flannery encapsulated the central argument that he put in the Future Eaters. He said that, instead of thinking of that environment, that parklike atmosphere of Sydney and its surrounds in 1788, as being an aberration, there is another explanation. The explanation is that, when the explorers-because it was not just the people drawing the pictures-said that they could walk through areas of Sydney that were virtual parkland, they meant it. They meant it because fire had been used to create an environment in which Aboriginals could hunt large and small marsupials through the grasslands. The dense nature of the eucalypt forest that we have around Sydney now was not the case in 1788. He makes the point in his article that Cook found a continent wreathed in fire from one end to the other. From Western Australia to the eastern seaboard, Australia was dominated by fire-probably not the raging fires that we see today but more controlled burns. It took most of our European history before we came to a fundamental understanding that we need to use Aboriginal methods of management to control the forest. Based on the foregoing, I make this fundamental point: it is not wise of the government to rush forward and belt the daylights out of people who have argued for a green perspective on forest policy. No-one knows how we should properly manage Australia’s forests. It is my inclination-I have argued it in the past-that we need to look extremely closely at this, because I do not think there is much sense in totally locking up all of our forested land and just letting it be. If we do, we would not be managing the land in the way it has been managed for millennia. That would allow a situation in which we would have the almost total devastation of our great forests and of our lands as a result of raging wildfires. The point that Flannery finally makes with regard to this is that it is not very smart not to take into account the fact that our settlements have moved directly into the path of our major bush areas. We in opposition call upon the government to support the work of the Bushfire CRC in starting the fundamental steps to understanding the true nature of Australia’s environment and the true nature of our bush. The government should not just run off in an ad hoc way and say, ‘Let’s blame people because this stuff has been locked up.’ It should look at different ways of managing our environment so that the inflammatory nature of the Australian bush and its eucalypts can be tamed to our purposes in much the same way that the Europeans tamed their environment in continental Europe itself. those families who have been affected by bushfires and to those who are still battling blazes in south-eastern New South Wales and northern Victoria.

171,Mr John Cobb (Parkes) (11.59 A.m.),"I wish to express my deepest sympathies to11204 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 time the captain of our local fire brigade in one of the worse bushfire areas in New South Wales, the Cobar Shire. When a fire really goes, it goes. I can remember in 1984-85 in the worse fires we had, three times in one day the fire went clean over the top of us. You cannot fight a fire in that situation. ‘Firefighting’ is the worse explanation of what brigades do that I have ever heard. You set up defences and when the fire dies down you try to control it. I think the crux of the issue that we are discussing is the defences and the preparations you make to control fire. In New South Wales in particular, every year we wait with bated breath to see how the fire season will play out. This has been a particularly horrendous season, and it is far from over. In some areas the fire has been stifled by the drought. A lot of grassland has been eaten out and many areas will not carry fire at all. Luckily, in those circumstances there is insufficient fuel to be a danger to humans or to wildlife. But in forested areas the drought has provided fuel for the fires. The forest fuels are abnormally dry. The natural barriers like the moist swamps, the creeks, the rivers and the shallow lakes are simply not acting as they normally do. Fuel is the most important element of a bushfire. Fuel determines the intensity, speed and heat of a bushfire. The important characteristics of a fuel that determine fire behaviour are the fineness of the fuel and the structure of the fuel bed. In actual fact, those things that lie on the forest floor or on the timbered country’s floor are the things that will determine whether or not a fire gets going. Grass is obviously the simplest form of fuel. I have seen grassfires travel faster than human beings are able to get around them and, in mallee or timbered areas, far faster than the possibility of getting around in front of them were you so foolish as to try to do so. The forest litter bed is the part which is most important in determining how fast or where a forest fire will spread. Research has found that doubling the fuel in the forest will double the rate of spread and quadruple the fire intensity. Note that I am talking about what happens in forests, not on farmland and not on privately held land. It is very easy to understand why people want to live in an idyllic forest-like area. They tend these days to want to build their homes in those areas. While I shudder when I see the danger that they put themselves in, it is easy to understand why they want to live in such areas. But it is the job of governments and authorities to protect people from that danger. For far too long, environmental correctness has been given precedence over safety, over human life and over the value of the assets that people in the community have and depend on. If the status quo continues, especially in New South Wales, we will simply see a repeat of this next year and the year after and so on. Systematically reducing ground fuel by prescribed burning-in other words, hazard reduction-is the only way to reduce the incidence and severity of bushfires. It is impossible in a country like this to reduce bushfires to the extent that they are not going to happen. We live in a dry country; we accept the dangers that come with it, but there are limits. Reduction burning can obviously be unpleasant and it causes pollution to some extent, so there is a built-in political resistance to it-especially among those in the metropolitan areas. But simply standing around preserving aesthetic values comes at one heck of a cost. When the bushfires hit and homes in the outer regions suffer from them, very little resistance can be offered. It is too late to try to deal with a fire when it is on your doorstep. The only way we can deal with it is by prevention. A senior principal research scientist with the CSIRO, Phil Cheney is one of Australia’s foremost bushfire experts. He spent 40 years trying to convince Australians of the need for hazard reduction. In the last two summers, there has been an enormous loss of assets and an enormous loss of life. In New South Wales, even in the Goobang Valley in my own electorate, Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11205 fires have led to incredible losses. They burned in the national park for a very long time and, as a result, we lost incredible amounts of farmland, stock and opportunities for people to earn their living. So many people have been affected over the last 12 months. In October 2002, a lady was killed in Ballandean in south-east Queensland; also in October, a death occurred in Abernethy, near Cessnock in New South Wales; in December 2002, a man was killed north of Sydney; in January 2003, four people were killed in the Canberra fires; and, also in January, a man was killed north of Perth in Western Australia. The estimated cost of the Canberra fires alone now stands at nearly $300 million. Five hundred and thirty-odd houses have been destroyed, and 800 have been damaged. Twelve thousand hectares of pine plantations were destroyed. I could go on and on. It is interesting to look at what has happened over the past few years-since 1997, in particular, when the Rural Fire Service legislation was introduced into New South Wales. Fire hazard laws were recently introduced by the Carr government subsequent to that, to give the New South Wales government or the Rural Fire Service greater powers to force landowners to clear their fire hazards. The only problem is that Premier Bob Carr did not introduce this until 1 August, and that is little use when the bushfire season started before that. I make the point now-and I will make it again later-that it was introduced only for landowners on private land. Bob Carr conceded that there were problems with it addressing only private land-holders but failed to recognise the extreme shortfalls posed by the timing of his legislation. Even more, he failed to admit what the real danger is. The real danger to homes and to farmland is what comes out of national parks. To simply give power over all private land but not public land defies the laws of common sense. Why do you give authorities power over those who have the most interest in safeguarding their assets, their families and loved ones and not give those authorities power to deal with those who have the least interest in the lives of others and their private assets and homes? It defies common sense and it flies in the face of what has happened since 1997 in three bushfire seasons. It is time to stop bowing to environmental correctness. Everyone wants to look after the environment and have a decent place to live, myself included. But preserving the status quo will cause more environmental destruction and actually go against what it is that Bob Carr is trying to do. What he is trying to do is preserve the vote of those in the cafe set in the metropolitan areas, who mostly do not have to deal with the issue; the rest of us do. When you think of the number of lives lost, the houses destroyed and the thousands of hectares of good farmland burnt around national parks since 1997, it defies imagination. I would like to go back to 1997 briefly, because that was when the Rural Fire Service legislation was introduced. I was involved in trying to get some sense out of the legislation, which was not designed to give the ordinary person input into what should be done. At that time, we tried to give ordinary people who live with and deal with fires an input and the ability to go to the minister to say when the processes of the ministerial advisory council were not working. But because the government and the commissioner-who is still the commissioner today-in New South Wales were terrified of anybody else having a direct link to the minister on fire procedural matters in New South Wales, they did a deal with the environment lobby in the upper house to prevent an alteration to that legislation which would have allowed those involved in the rural fire situation greater transparency and access to the minister. They did a deal with the environmental lobby, which meant that the threatened species 11206 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 legislation had to be taken into account by private land-holders, national parks and everybody who-if any law of common sense applied-would do hazard reduction burning. The result is what we have had-and what we told them we would have-since 1997: lives lost, incredible amounts of farmland lost and incredible numbers of houses lost around Sydney and Canberra. If you do not give those who are charged with looking after fire regulations or the practical aspects and processes of them-in the case of New South Wales, the Rural Fire Service-the power to control government, public or crown land as well as private land, you are not going to approach a solution to the dilemma of losing lives and property to fire. Bob Carr catered to the votes of the extreme green environmental lobby and refused to give power over national parks to those who must have it. National Parks and Wildlife Service’s job as they see it is to preserve the status quo. Not only do they block off entries; they fill in dams and do everything they possibly can to make national parks, in a sense, unattractive to humans. That obviously makes it a lot harder to go in there to travel around and find water when it has to be used. In the same way, they try to discourage animals from watering in parks but have them watering in the farmland outside. It is not conducive to public safety, nor to the assets of the rest of us. I believe that those in charge of national parks are certainly very decent human beings. But until those who understand and are charged with the fire prevention safety of the state-and other states as well-are forced to do those things that have to be done to set up barriers against future fires, there is going to be no sense in it. I have had National Parks in New South Wales say to me, ‘We simply couldn’t do fire prevention burning-it was too green.’ Any farmer in Australia could tell them how to spray and burn within a week in any situation where it is too green-it is not hard to do. We need to have the willingness, the foresight and the long-term vision to do it in order to save lives and assets. that have been made by the member for Parkes are very important. In the aftermath of what is clearly a tragedy for many areas of Australia-many parts of New South Wales, Victoria and, particularly, Canberra-it is imperative that people look at the way we are going to avert any future tragedy. We need to ensure that we manage our parks and our bush in a way which will prevent or mitigate the likelihood of such occurrences happening again. It is critical for authorities and governments at every level to determine the best way to ensure these things do not occur. I do not think it is acceptable for people to rush to judgment. It is necessary that this matter is looked at dispassionately. Indeed, that can be done if there is goodwill; and it should be done. I was not listed to speak on this matter. I rise briefly to put on the record my appreciation of the SES and CFA in Gisborne and in other areas of the electorate of Burke, who were called upon to put out what ended up being quite minor fires in my electorate. Indeed, I record my appreciation of those volunteers and professional firefighters from the region who went to other areas to ensure that there would be critical assistance for the homes and the lives of people in north-east Victoria. To those wonderful volunteers and to all those people from my electorate who involved themselves and went to fight the fires in Gisborne or beyond their own areas, I say thank you very much. fires have devastated large tracts of land, destroyed homes, caused injury and on some occasions caused loss of life. This year has been no different. Bushfires have raged through various areas of the Pearce electorate, including Bullsbrook, Swan View, Lancelin and others. Every year the volunteer firefighters work with the community to prepare for fires and work",137,Representatives Main Committee
172,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (12.14 P.m.),I start by saying that the comments,140,Representatives Main Committee
173,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (12.15 P.m.),"Every summer in my electorate of Pearce, bushThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11207 hard to train and prepare their volunteer teams. I have been involved in these planning meetings to get an idea of what actually goes on; I know the tremendous work that goes into the planning meetings, where they put forward the fire prevention plan for the season. I have also observed the tremendous dedication of these men and women, who not only make themselves available to fight fires in my electorate but attend road accidents, clear firebreaks and plan fundraising events to assist them to meet their goals as they set out to minimise fires within the region. Every year I hear stories involving acts of kindness and bravery as these people go about the job of fighting fires. One year not so long ago, I recall that local identity Harry Gratte received severe burns fighting a fire in Whiteman Park, and in fact he still bears the terrible scars after a couple of years of skin grafts. Harry is a very experienced volunteer firefighter and every year for many years he has put his life on the line, fighting fires not only in my electorate but in other areas. This year Harry was very lucky to escape with his life. The fire swept over his vehicle and it was only his long experience and quick action that saved his life. However, he was very severely burnt. On another occasion, I can recall sitting with Mr and Mrs Owston after fire swept through Wundowie and destroyed absolutely everything on their property: their home, their fences, their shed, their tools, their vehicles and their stock. Sadly, Mr Owston passed away just recently, but I shall never forget sitting with them on the back verandah, which was the only bit left standing, buckled and burnt, with a thermos of tea and Mr Owston giving an account of coming home, finding the property razed and then having to shoot 600 head of stock. These kinds of stories really bring home to you just how devastated people are when faced with these events. The loss of human life is bad enough, but people who work the land also feel it when they have to destroy their stock. Every year these tragic events are punctuated with acts of kindness and bravery, and I must say the community always responds very generously. At the beginning of this year, a fire in Lancelin claimed the life of a young volunteer firefighter from my electorate. That firefighter was Mr Craig Sandy. He was a young man with everything to live for. He was a dedicated volunteer. Sadly, he was killed when three fire appliances crashed as a huge blaze swept through Ledge Point and Lancelin, about 127 kilometres north of Perth, threatening homes and everything in its path. Mr Sandy was the captain of the Ocean Farm Volunteer Bushfire Brigade and the first summer fire victim in Western Australia. I understand he was to be married on Valentine’s Day, so my sympathy goes to his family and particularly to his fiancee. His death is a stark reminder of the risk that firefighters take in the voluntary work they do for the benefit of their communities. The Lancelin fire was a particularly bad fire. There were 100 firefighters working to contain the blaze, and it swept through a large area and threatened homes. People had to be evacuated, and some homes were lost. Alan and Nola Armstrong, from Wanneroo, were at Seaview in their holiday house when they noticed the fire. They started to hose the fire down, but eventually they had to evacuate as the flames drew closer. Mrs Armstrong said that a volunteer firefighter gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder and said, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll look after your house.’ She said that they did and that it was really a fantastic effort. All the houses in Seaview were saved, and the firefighters not only threw all their energy into fighting this fire but used all the resources they possibly could to try to contain the fire. Their efforts were hampered when an emergency services communication tower was lost to the flames. They had a particularly difficult time. I congratulate them for the tremendous effort they put in. 11208 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 With these tragic events happening every summer in Western Australia, particularly in the electorate of Pearce, we all watched with dismay as bushfires swept through other parts of the country, claiming the lives of other Australians. In Australia this year I understand that about 1.7 million hectares have been affected by fire and that about 550 homes were lost just here in the ACT. But, above all, it is the loss of people’s lives that is irreplaceable. We can always rebuild, but the real tragedy is the lives that have been lost in these fires and the suffering and pain that that has caused so many families and members of the community. The events in the ACT were particularly distressing. I know that constituents in my electorate of Pearce would want me to extend their deepest sympathy to those families affected by this tragedy, and that sympathy comes with a real understanding of the devastation of fire. I support the Prime Minister’s motion to the House which he made on Tuesday. It extends sympathy to all who have suffered throughout Australia personal loss through bushfires and acknowledges the tireless efforts of many individuals, including the rural and metro fire brigades. In my electorate, we have countless small communities, each of which has its own bushfire brigade which is run on a voluntary basis. As I said, these people do not just go out and fight fires; they do lots of other emergency work. They attend country road accidents. They do a lot of work each summer, knowing the history and that bushfires occur every year, with the community in trying to minimise the risk to members of the community from bushfires. On top of that, they raise funds to help to keep their units going. In his motion, the Prime Minister also thanked all of the emergency and rescue services and the ambulance service. In my electorate, which is made up of many small communities and country towns, this work is frequently done by volunteers. In fact, in the Pearce Australia Day awards, which I gave out, there were volunteer ambulance drivers and volunteer firefighters nominated by the community to receive awards. The Prime Minister also thanked Defence, the police, welfare groups, government agencies, councils and business. I want to pause just for a moment to say, again, businesses in the electorate of Pearce are extremely generous not only in providing equipment and donations but also in releasing their staff members to go and perform this voluntary work. That is a real contribution to the community and it sometimes goes unacknowledged. I would also like to add the property owners to my list of thanks. I know that in my electorate and certainly in the ACT there were people who not only stayed to fight the fires in their community, trying to prevent their own homes from being burnt down, but when they had done that job, often having lost the battle and lost their own homes, then turned their attention to helping their neighbours save their homes and to trying to save community facilities such as schools and other community buildings. I think these people also need to be acknowledged. There would be nothing more devastating than to be there trying to fight a fire on your own property with your own home threatened, watching it burn down and then having to focus your attention on helping to save your neighbour’s property or other community property. I would like to thank the many Australian people who made offers of assistance, sympathy, goods, accommodation and moral support, which is really very important for the people who were affected by these fires. During the fires, because obviously most of us who travel to Canberra to serve in this parliament know many people who live in Canberra, I made a few calls to people I knew to find out whether they were safe. I was told by the people I rang that they had never seen a community pull together in the way that people did here in the ACT over the days following the fire. Friends told me that many families went to the supermarket and filled up the shopping trolley with the object of delivering those goods to people who had lost everything in the fire. This was quite a common situation. Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11209 There were countless stories of bravery, generosity and great kindnesses in the days following the fire. This is just part of the true Australian spirit. We can all feel very proud to live in a community where that community spirit is so evident and be enormously grateful for the kind hearts and warm personalities that I certainly encounter every day. We tend to be bombarded with all the bad things that are happening and all the negative accounts of what is going on in the community-robberies, old ladies being attacked and having their handbags stolen and houses being broken into-but we do not hear often enough about the tremendous acts of kindness and generosity and the unselfish actions carried out on behalf of so many in the community. To all those who have lent a hand and who have helped the community in some way and particularly to the volunteer firefighters in my electorate, who have been absolutely tremendous, I say thank you. Once again, on behalf of the Pearce electorate, I extend my sincere sympathies to those in the ACT who have lost friends and family in the fire and to those of other states who have been similarly devastated. Debate (on motion by Mr Murphy) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Environment: Global Warming berra but large areas of regional and urban Australia, while the unending drought brings ruin even to the best parts of our country. Once again, climatologists and CSIRO scientists are warning the government that the intensity and frequency of extreme weather conditions that provide opportunities for large-scale bushfires are directly linked to global warming, which is itself driven by greenhouse gas emissions. The evidence that the Prime Minister claims to have for the existence of Saddam Hussein’s arsenal is far more tenuous than the evidence linking the drought and bushfires to global warming. And yet, despite a lack of any substantial evidence, the government is willing to spend billions of dollars to send troops to Iraq while at the same time it claims that Australia cannot afford to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If the government can argue that spending large sums of money on a war in Iraq is justified because of the possibility of the existence of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, why can it not find the same amount of money for the protection of Australia from the ravages of greenhouse gas induced climate change? There is no doubt that a significant number of the frail, the sick and the elderly will have died as a result of the extreme temperatures of recent times. This does not include those tragically killed in recent bushfires around Australia. While the government cannot be blamed for these deaths, there is no doubt that they will bear a growing responsibility for future disasters if they continue to do nothing to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The evidence for the damaging effects of global warming continues to mount. The New Scientist of 18 January this year reports on new research that has uncovered a previously mysterious circulation pattern in the Pacific Ocean. Francisco Chavez from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has shown that the El Nino phenomenon follows a roughly 25-year cycle. The cycle alternates between many years with warm Pacific waters and strong El Ninos and many years with cooler waters and weaker El Ninos. In the years with stronger El Ninos, Australia experiences more severe droughts. Australia is presently in the grip of an unprecedented severe drought.",140,Representatives Main Committee

This tells us that a severe drought is not meant to be occurring at this time. Reviewing this new data, Frank Schwing of the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory in Pacific Grove, California, has speculated that global warming could spark a perpetual regime of severe El Ninos or ‘something even less welcome’. How much worse could things get? In answer to my question on notice No. 1202 to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage regarding the cost of implementing the Kyoto protocol, the minister replied: ... the annual costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol range from a low of 0 to a high of 0.4 per cent of GNP at 2012. The minister’s own figures show that it would not significantly harm our economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These figures no doubt ignore the many savings that could be achieved if the analysis were not affected by the constraints imposed by the minister. An underlying, if unstated, principle that is often used to justify government defence spending is that no matter how small the threat there should be no constraints on the money spent to meet that threat. Why is this government so inconsistent? Why does the government maintain a head-in-the-sand approach to our environment? For how much longer will this government ignore the very large threat posed to Australia by global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions? Dickson Electorate: Australia Day Awards would like today to pay tribute to the special group of people who were recently presented with Australia Day awards in Dickson. All the people I am about to speak about have given much of their time and energy to the Pine River Shire, to their local community groups and to those around them. Their achievements are in areas that range from sport and music to culture and voluntaryrism. At a ceremony of over 500 people, with 119 new Australians receiving their citizenship, it was wonderful for these great Australians to be honoured in front of those who had just decided to make this country their permanent home. The spirit of voluntaryrism is well and truly alive in Australia today, and I am proud that so many of my constituents in Dickson are willing participants in a variety of voluntary organisations, sporting clubs and community services. The first person I would like to mention today is Mr Doug Dohle, the 2003 Pine Rivers Citizen of the Year. Doug is the current president of the Pine Rivers Pony Club. As his wife and daughter will both tell you, Doug devotes much of his time to maintaining the grounds and facilities at the pony club and has done so for many years. Incidentally, Doug would also tell you that his wife and daughter provide great assistance not only to him but to the club and the general community. Doug Dohle is a most deserving winner of this award and is truly representative of the community spirit that he has encouraged through the massive amount of time and energy he has devoted to his local community. As with most people who are warded in such a way for their outstanding service, Doug would never have expected, let alone thought he was deserving of, such an award. But Doug is now the Pine Rivers Citizen of the Year and he is a most worthy recipient. He truly deserves this recognition and I congratulate him on his dedication to not only the Pine Rivers Pony Club but to the district in general. Like all award winners on Australia Day, Doug has a loving family who have always encouraged him and given him the opportunity to fulfil his desire of giving to others.",143,Representatives Main Committee

As an instrumental music teacher, Timo has continued to make the orchestras of Pine Rivers some of the best in the country. The children all love Timo as much as Timo loves teaching music. I congratulate Timo on his superb contribution to the musical community and wish him all the best for a great year ahead. As everybody in this parliament would be only too aware, sport plays a major role in our communities and is enjoyed by almost every Australian at some time in their life. This year, the Pine Rivers senior sportsperson of the year award was given to someone very special, someone who has overcome great obstacles to achieve in her chosen field: Mrs Mary Albrow. Mary, who is a transplant recipient, nearly drowned as a child but learnt to swim last year and in fact was placed in the swim events at the Transplant Games. I believe that Mary is a great example of what can be achieved at any age and that, if you really want to do something, anything can be achieved. Every person, regardless of their age, can take inspiration from Mary’s achievements and dedication. I congratulate Mary and thank her for inspiring our community. Swimming is quite obviously a very popular sport in Australia, as the Pine Rivers junior sportsperson of the year is also a swimmer. Jessicah Schipper, a 16-year-old from Murrumba Downs, in the northern part of the Dickson electorate, recently became only the third Australian woman to swim a 100-metre butterfly race in under one minute-an absolutely marvellous achievement. Jessicah has a huge future in front of her in the swimming pool, and I look forward to seeing her win gold for Australia at the Commonwealth and Olympic Games in the coming years. While it all looks too easy for some sports men and women, there are countless people who are not usually recognised for their contribution because they have not played in the winning team or, for that matter, in any team. They are the people who organise the fixtures, promote the sign-on days and run the clubs. In 2003, a very deserving Bruce Boland was named the Pine Rivers sports administrator of the year, for his contribution as vice-president at the Albany Creek Cricket Club. Bruce puts enormous amounts of time into the club through his administration, and is a great asset to the game. Without people like Bruce, our children could not be given the opportunity to participate in and play the sports they do. Every sporting and voluntary club in Australia needs a Bruce Boland to keep it moving. Some clubs will have someone like Bruce; some will not. I congratulate Bruce on this award and look forward to seeing many more great results from the Albany Creek Cricket Club next summer. This year the community event of the year award was given to a fabulous event in my community-the Albany Fair. I congratulate every person who helped with the organisation of that event for their time and effort, and I look forward to another great fair this coming year. I congratulate again all of the Australia Day award recipients. I thank them for contributing to and inspiring our community in Dickson, and I wish them all the very best for this year.

While many of these people are strangers to each other, they have one overwhelming quality in common: they volunteer their time selflessly to the Lilley community. That is the essential criterion of the Lilley Australia Day Awards. These people donate their time and care to the community and ask for nothing in return. They see others needing help and they help them. They ask nothing more for themselves than the sheer pleasure of helping others. Our nation’s volunteers perform an incredible amount of work in the community. At this moment there are volunteers around the country in the Rural Fire Service ready to fight bushfires. Over the past few months state emergency services in practically every state have had to deal with the aftermath of the incredible devastation caused by fire. We saw it here only a few weeks ago. In my electorate there are volunteers like Charlie’s Angels at the Prince Charles Hospital in Chermside, who work tirelessly to cheer up the sick and free up valuable staff. Many volunteers in Lilley give their time to our schools. They work in the tuckshops, raise money with raffles and fetes, and help out with junior sports teams and parents’ associations so our children can get the best education we can provide them with. Countless numbers of Lilley’s senior citizens depend on the Meals on Wheels service from centres like Sandgate, Burnie Brae, Banyo, Chermside, Geebung and Crosby Park. Many in the veterans’ community likewise depend on the assistance that volunteers provide through RSL subbranches and organisations like the War Widows Guild which advocate on their behalf. They depend on people like Jack Mundy from the Geebung-Zillmere-Aspley-Bald Hills subbranch, who clocked up 50 years of service with the RSL this year. In Lilley we also have people like Jennifer Singfield, who has been involved in the Sea Scouts and the Keep Sandgate Beautiful project and has worked to clean up Cabbage Tree Creek; Sandra Clark, who has volunteered for Meals on Wheels for 20 years; Reg Cosgrove, who has given tireless assistance to young people; and Marlene Hatton, who has spent 25 years raising funds to assist World Vision. In my view, this is the type of person local communities want recognised on Australia Day. Our nation’s volunteers are the most important contributors to our nation’s well-being. They are the glue that holds the fabric of any community together. They are the glue that makes this country strong. They deserve recognition for their unpaid gift to our community. Therefore, it is disappointing to see so few of those who make the Australia Day honours list nominated for unpaid work. Indeed, when I searched the official 2003 Australia Day list on the Internet, I found only eight of 812 recipients cited with the words ‘volunteer’ or ‘voluntary’. In no way do I want to reflect on any of this year’s awardees. I am sure they are all very deserving. However, we should remember that the highest awards in the Australian honours system are regularly filled by those who are awarded for work they have been paid to dojudges, senior officials, doctors, lawyers, academics, sports people and politicians. They have all been paid to do this work. So legitimate questions ought to be asked, such as: how many of these people give something back to the community for nothing during their lives or after they conclude their well paid careers? Not too many. There should be more who do. I wonder about this. This year’s Lilley Australia Day Awards recognised my predecessor in this House, Mrs Elizabeth Grace. She has been recognised because, in the years since she left parliament, she has been serving the community in a senior citizens’ centre-the Golden Years at Nundah. I think she deserves the highest respect for this. The point is that I wish the high-flyers in our community and others who have been well paid and honoured would do the same. They ought Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11213 to put something back into the community after they have been in well paid jobs and honoured for that. No doubt this year our Australian of the Year, Dr Fiona Stanley, has done that. Not only has she been paid over the years; she has also been a volunteer. We need more people in this category honoured in our national awards. We need more people like these quiet achievers, who are not being paid for their work, that we have honoured in the Lilley Australia Day Awards. The system needs a dramatic shake-up, and there needs to be a much bigger emphasis on voluntary efforts. (Time expired) Makin Electorate: Automobile Industry the member for Lilley has just said in this chamber. I thank him for his acknowledgment of former member Mrs Elizabeth Grace. TodayI would like to talk about the automobile industry. It is the largest manufacturing industry in South Australia, directly employing more than 13,000 people in my home state. Of the more than 350,000 cars made in Australia each year, around half are manufactured in South Australia at the Holden and Mitsubishi plants. In addition, more than 40 component manufacturers supply the car industry with tyres, steel and alloy wheels, engine components, rear view mirrors, seats, suspension modules, mouldings and exhaust systems. On Saturday, 25 January, I had the honour of representing the federal government at the announcement by Holden of its intention to employ a further 1,000 people at its Elizabeth plant. The announcement by Holden of a third shift confirms how important the Elizabeth plant is to Holden and to the Australian industry. The plant is the heart of the Holden enterprise. It employs more than 4,000 local people in assembling 28 locally produced models. Of great importance to the South Australian economy, it is of particular importance to the economic and social well-being of the people of the northern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, many of whom live within my electorate of Makin. The massive expansion program will enable Holden to pursue new export opportunities and increase the number of models produced at the Elizabeth plant from 28 to 35. Last year, Holden confirmed its position as the leading car manufacturer in Australia-it achieved an all-time record with sales of more than 178,000 vehicles, including more than 88,000 Commodores. That represents almost 22 per cent of the new vehicle market. Holden’s success in the domestic market is being matched by its growing presence in international markets. In 2001, Holden sold almost $1.2 billion worth of exports. One of the most exciting breakthroughs last year was the announcement that Holden would begin selling its award winning Monaro to the United States, re-badged as the legendary Pontiac GTO. American car industry leaders saw in Holden a company that could provide new, exciting models in an otherwise stale US market. The creation of 1,000 new jobs at Holden’s Elizabeth plant will be a tremendous injection into the local economy. The Howard government has been, and will continue to be, a strong partner in the success of Holden and our other Australian car manufacturers. In 1997, the Howard government announced a tariff freeze and a five-year $2.8 billion program of assistance to support the car industry to become more competitive. Only a few weeks before the Holden announcement, the Howard government announced the next stage in its long-term plans for the car industry. This second stage boosts industry assistance to an unprecedented $4.2 billion and will see the industry through to 2015. When that program ends, the Howard government will have given the industry 15 years of certainty and $7 billion in support. No-",145,Representatives Main Committee
178,Mrs Draper (Makin) (12.44 P.m.),"On this occasion I could not agree more with what11214 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 one could credibly argue that this government is not doing enough to support the automobile industry in Australia. The results of this policy speak for themselves. Australian cars are being produced in greater numbers than eight years ago. Our exports of automotive products have tripled since 1996 and are worth almost $5 billion-and the industry is predicting it will achieve $10 billion in exports by 2010. Last year was a record year for the industry as a whole, with almost 825,000 new vehicles sold. The quality of Australian cars has vastly improved and, perhaps for the first time, is genuinely world class. The success of our exports in more than 30 countries worldwide confirms that our industry is a world beater. I know that the workers at the Elizabeth plant, many of whom are my constituents, take pride in their work. They should know that they are contributing to the success of one of the most important industries in Australia. As their federal representative, I was pleased to have had the opportunity to welcome Holden’s latest expansion at its Elizabeth plant. The confidence expressed by Holden in the future of the industry in South Australia is a great boost to the local community and a sure sign that the policies of the Howard government are bringing great benefits to the people of Makin. Trade: Free Trade Agreement been causing me concern for some time-that is, the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement, or FTA. I would like to place on the record that I am not against free trade. The liberalisation of trade barriers over last two decades has greatly expanded the Australian economy and has, I believe, contributed to wealth generation in Australia. I do have concerns with a number of issues regarding this FTA. Firstly, I am concerned about the secretive approach to the progress of negotiations, creating suspicions in the community as to the trade-offs that are now being negotiated. Secondly, I am concerned about the effects that this agreement may have on a number of our industries, particularly those in the services sector. Thirdly, I am concerned that our strong trade relationships with our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region could be unduly affected by an FTA between Australia and the US. I was disturbed to hear earlier last month that the government has been involved in secretand I emphasise the word ‘secret’-discussions and has refused to open up public debate on this issue. I would have thought that this proposed FTA was of such economic importance to the country that the Australian public should have the ability to make worthwhile contributions to the debate. The US has had no such difficulties with opening the FTA negotiations to public debate in their country. The US Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, has provided a briefing to the Congress and submissions have opened, with various interest groups raising their concerns about a number of issues. Notably, the most vocal of these people were those involved in the agricultural sector. US farmers involved in the beef, sugar, dairy and grain industries have all demanded that Australian imports in those industries be subject to significant barriers to entry. It is no secret that our agricultural sector is the most efficient in the world, and American farmers fear that our lower cost and better quality products entering the US market may prove to be more competitive in the marketplace. The US dairy industry went as far as to say, ‘Opening the US market to Australian dairy farmers could endanger US security.’ The US agricultural sector has a very strong political influence and has been influential in the election of the Bush administration in 2000 and the success of the Republican Party in the recent Congressional elections. This sector has won significant concessions from the Bush",147,Representatives Main Committee
179,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (12.49 P.m.),"I would like to speak today on an issue that hasThursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11215 administration and, with growing political support from farmers, I doubt that the administration would concede much to Australian farmers. Reportedly, the US has made some demands of its own that would impact significantly on a number of our most important industries. Issues for the US include the winding back of the single desk for Australian wheat and Australia’s strong quarantine laws, greater access to our broadcasting services, government services and the health and education sectors. Robert Zoellick has been placing significant pressure on the Canadians to abolish their single desk arrangements and has stated on the public record that the US wants the abolition of all monopoly powers held by state enterprises. The National Farmers Federation is rightly concerned about this threat. The huge US companies that dominate the global pharmaceutical industry have also placed significant pressure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS. Industry lobbyist Joe Damond told public hearings into the FTA that the PBS prohibited the freedom of pharmaceutical companies to charge higher prices for new products on the market and they were concerned about the subsidies of a number of popular products that, in their minds, should be more profitable. The PBS is an important part of the Australian public policy framework, and has been for half a century. It has made medicines affordable for people who would otherwise have to suffer just because they are poor. We cannot and must not allow this to be traded off. The US also would like the Foreign Investment Review Board to be abolished. Our education sector is also on the agenda so that rich American kids can easily obtain a quality Australian education. The truth is that Australia will not obtain the same concessions from the US. How can we? The Australian economy is only one twenty-fifth of the size of the American economy. California has a larger economy that Australia has. Our negotiating power is limited, and we have to be careful about the motives of the companies that are strongly supporting this. These companies include General Motors, Citigroup, and Proctor and Gamble. All of this is occurring at a time when we are suffering a fall in exports to our most important trading region, East Asia. In the last 12 months, merchandise exports to that region have fallen by 3.7 per cent, and this is at a time when there has been economic growth in the region of five per cent. The argument that this is due to the drought does not stack up, and the argument that it is due to an international recession does not either. The truth is that this government has decided to let fade away the diversification programs of the previous Labor government. Labor developed a program that would see Australia able to export with strength even in times of drought. The international markets could view Australia as more than an agricultural and commodity based economy. The reason our dollar has been so low is that we are again viewed as a farm and a quarry. (Time expired) Bushfires Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.54 p.m.)-I wish to speak today about the fires that have ravaged parts of my electorate of Farrer. The Snowy Mountains townships of Talbingo, Khancoban and especially the tiny town of Cabramurra, Australia’s highest town, were under threat. Thousands of acres of pine plantations, including many trees that are 30 years old, could have gone up in smoke. The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority sustained considerable damage to its communications systems and roads network, with some direct damage to power stations but thankfully nowhere near as much as there could have been. The Khancoban water catchment has been burnt out and the town of Tumbarumba was threatened. Tumbarumba is on emergency water supplies. Fires that might have negatively impacted upon the regional economy are now well and truly under control. But of course only a really brave soul would say that it is all over, because storms are forecast for later this week 11216 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 February 2003 and we are still well and truly in the grip of the fire season. We now have to concentrate on the task of recovery and we have to thank members of the community for what they have done for the forests, the towns and for each other, whether it was in an official or unofficial capacity. There will be long-term effects that we cannot yet determine on our forestry and forest products industries which harvest from the area between Tumut, Tumbarumba and Canberra-not forgetting that the whole of the Victorian high country is burning. Kosciusko National Park, an Australian icon, has been burnt beyond recognition. As much as three-quarters of the total park, part of which is in my electorate and part of which is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, is gone. Flying over the forests on the way up to Canberra, the desolation is striking. The heat of the fires has obviously been extraordinarily intense in some parts, so much so that the trees are just ashen sticks. Even from 9,000 feet high you can see clearly the ground between them, black and wasted and such wide expanses of it. Never has our native bush seemed so fragile or so vulnerable and the point is that it is all lost; it is just not there any more. To say that it has been burnt could imply that it has been damaged but it will recover. It has not been damaged; it has been lost. It was quite apparent that there was nothing moving and nothing alive down there, nor would there be for a very long time. People may be used to the rapid regeneration that we experienced after the Sydney bushfires, but it will not be the case here. This country is colder. The terrain is steep, rugged and inhospitable. The subsoil will wash away along with rocks and sticks and will damage our waterways. My immediate response, perhaps not quite logical, was that I felt that as custodians of our natural environment we have visited a terrible destruction on it and we have done very wrong, and I just felt very sorry. The community as a whole has much to learn from these fires. We need a renewed appreciation of the power of the natural world in which we live and we need to recognise that the human race has no choice but to adapt our world and ourselves to strike a balance which serves the interests of both. I believe the balance has tipped too far towards not interfering with nature and towards allowing extremes of untouched wilderness to prevail. We know that wilderness is precious, but we should know that it is unnatural for it not to burn. Areas of the park exploded from treetop to treetop, within areas normally too wet to burn. This was an exceptional fire: fuel reduction and grazing on high country leases would not have prevented it, but they would have improved our chances of fighting it. A slow, cool burn allows animals to escape, usually high in the trees as it moves through the undergrowth. Perhaps the procedure the park management needs to undergo to conduct hazard reduction burns needs to be looked at. I understand the approval process takes weeks and I have no doubt this reflects community hesitation over regular widespread controlled burning but in a temperate rainforest like Kosciusko, the window of opportunity is small and the local management needs to be able to act decisively and swiftly. The equivalent of many years of forestry logging allocation in New South Wales has been destroyed by these bushfires. In New South Wales there are 516 parks and reserves. Two hundred and thirty-seven of these need fire management plans, but to date only 10 of these plans have been made public. New South Wales does not have a management plan for the Brindabella National Park and, on the New South Wales parks and wildlife web site, under the fire management section for Kosciusko, it states that at present the service has insufficient resources to undertake the full range of fire management responsibilities. Three hundred and thirty thousand hectares of the park have been burnt. But I understand the plan is under review and that fire management will be considered a priority. I know that those who conduct such reviews are people who have the best interests of the park at heart. If there are lessons to Thursday, 6 February 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 11217 be learned, I am sure they will be. This is not a criticism of the people who work within the organisation. We all labour under excessive rules and regulations. I encourage the New South Wales government to allocate more resources in this vital area and to listen to the wise views of local people. Taxation the House of Representatives Notice Paper, directed to the Treasurer. That question, No. 43, states: What percentage of barristers and solicitors pay the top marginal rate of income tax? Despite a number of speeches and requests to the Speaker over the last 12 months, Treasurer Costello refuses to answer this question. I am aware that in his possession at the moment is a report, following the laudable revelations by Paul Barry in the Sydney Morning Herald about the abuse visited on the taxation system by barristers, and that the Assistant Treasurer and the Attorney-General know that 80 per cent of barristers do not pay the top marginal rate of tax. Something has got to be done about it. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.",148,Representatives Main Committee

Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 1273) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Is the Minister aware of allegations that the contractor responsible for the drainage works at the immigration detention facility at Baxter removed a number of trees on and around the site. (2) Has this site been subject to re-afforestation efforts, with assistance from Greening Australia, in recent years. (3) Was the contractor required to rethink its approach to the drainage. (4) What was the additional cost caused by the contractor having to re-do the drainage arrangements. (1) The drainage contractor removed a handful of small trees and shrubs from the area where the accommodation compounds were to be located and a number of salt-bush shrubs for the construction of a sewage evaporation pond. The location of services and buildings was planned to minimise the removal of trees and shrubs. A small number of trees and several shrubs were required to be removed as part of installation of the physical security arrangements. This work was undertaken by a separate contractor. Under an agreement with the Department of Defence initiated by my department, each tree and shrub removed is to be replaced at a ratio of 2 to 1. (2) The Department of Defence has advised that there have been no re-afforestation efforts at the site in recent years. (3) The contractor was not required to rethink or redo the drainage. (4) Not applicable see (3) above. Immigration: Brisbane Facility (Question No. 1276) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: Further to the 2002 Budget reference to the as-yet-unconstructed Brisbane facility whose costings are marked “Not for publication”, has the Government abandoned its plans to build this facility; if not, why are its costs marked “Not for publication”. The Government has not abandoned its plans to build a facility in South East Queensland with consultations continuing. Funding for the acquisition of land for a facility in South East Queensland was included in the 2002 Budget on a not for publication basis to avoid any potential prejudice to acquisition of a site within the budget provision.",152,Haberfield
