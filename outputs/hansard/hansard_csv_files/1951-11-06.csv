I have no personal knowledge of the facts relating to the dismissals, but I should not be at all astonished to be told what the honourable member has just indicated. The Premier of Victoria keeps repeating that the Comblack market prices instead of to the monwealth, has, so to speak, "" done him down"" over his loan allocation. The truth is that the amount made available to Victoria for loan purposes was in accordance with a decision of the Loan Council that was concurred in by the Premier of Victoria. Indeed, such a decision could not have been arrived at without the support of two or three State Queensland Government and the Potato Premiers. Mr CT.YDE CAMEEON -Of two State Premiers. Victoria was one of those who supported the cut in the loan programmes. It is also interesting to note that, when the Premier of Victoria left Canberra at the conclusion of the meeting of the Loan Council, he said to me and to some State Premiers that he was going away happy and that he thought he had been very well treated. Since then he has chosen to foment the complete falsehood that in some way he had been forced to cut down vital works because of something that the Commonwealth had done. The whole point is that this year he has substantially more loan money than the State of Victoria has ever before had in one year, and that the order in which he cares to cut down his works programme is a matter for him and not for us. If he chooses to decide that labour cuts shall be applied first to the electricity undertakings and that such undertakings should be given a high order of priority in dismissals, that is a matter for him and not for us to decide. I strongly suspect that a great many of the dismissals that we have been told have been made had a purely political origin. the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to what has been reported as an armed threat by a potato-grower in the Lockyer district of Queensland against representatives of the Potato Marketing Board and government officials to prevent them from entering his property, except at the risk of their lives, in order to prohibit the sale of Queensland potatoes to the southern States at Queensland public ? Can the right honourable gentleman explain the difference, if any, between the action of the Minister acting for the Minister of Commerce and Agriculture in preventing rice-growers from exporting rice from Australia while rice is in short supply to the consuming public, and the action taken by the Marketing Board in endeavouring to ensure that the consumers of Queensland shall have an ample supply of potatoes? Further, does not the Prime Minister consider that a potatogrower or other person who makes an armed threat against the constitutional government of Queensland or any other legally constituted authority in Australia is liable to prosecution under the provisions of the Crimes Act? As the people of Queensland consider that this is a seriovis matter, will the Prime Minister take immediate steps to place the facts of the case before the Australian Security Intelligence Organization with a view to taking the necessary action under the Crimes Act? not been directed to the report referred to by the honourable member. ter for Health a question that arises from the fact that some time ago I submitted for consideration a recommendation that drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease be included in the list of free life-saving drugs provided under the national health scheme.

Health inform the House what progress he has made with the preparation of a report on the investigations that he made into the health facilities that exist in the United States? If the report has been prepared when does the right honourable gentleman expect to lay it on the table of the House? Has the Minister observed that some life-saving drugs have lost most of their effectiveness? If so, has he any plan for putting more life back into them ? doubt that the use of life-saving drugs indiscriminately tends to cause them to lose their effects in very bad cases. That is the reason why the Government has been so careful in the restrictions that it has been placing upon their use in certain ways. The life-saving drugs themselves are still very efficient in very bad cases, for which they should be reserved. As I have stated previously, I shall deal with the other matter at the appropriate time. shall direct to the Minister for Health relates to free drugs for pensioners. Is the Minister aware that in many instances pensioners who take doctors' prescriptions to chemists to be dispensed are informed hy the chemists that, as the drugs that have been prescribed are not on the free list, they will have to pay for them? The Minister has stated many times in this House that all pensioners aro entitled to drugs without payment. Will he issue instructions to all chemists to that effect, so that pensioners will receive the full benefit of the scheme, and will not be subject to the disappointment of being refused drugs by chemists? -cannot accept the honourable member's months' supply of insulin. However, it .50] statement that pensioners are refused free drugs. I have a record in my possession which shows that in September, 128,000 prescriptions were dispensed free for pensioners. During that month attendances numbered about 70,000. Therefore, it is obvious that the great bulk of the prescriptions has been dispensed. It is true that sometimes patent medicines are prescribed. Of course they are excluded from the free list. Indeed, they are excluded from the free list of every other health scheme in the world. ter for Health consider the provision of free ambulance services to pensioners under the Government's free medical service ? vision in any Commonwealth legislation under which such a service could be provided. In addition, I do not know whether there is e.en constitutional power to enable it to be done. Minister for Health say whether it is a fact that existing regulations prevent doctors from prescribing more than two weeks supply of drugs to pensioners on each prescription? If so, will he consider granting to doctors discretionary power to prescribe a larger quantity in individual instances in which a doctor believes that inconvenience or hardship, would be imposed upon a pensioner by reason of the pensioner having to visit a chemist with unnecessary frequency in order to draw his, or her, supply of drugs? I know of a pensioner who is suffering from acute arthritis and is obliged to hire a taxi cab in order to collect her supply of drugs whereas if she were enabled to collect a larger quantity on each occasion she would be saved considerable inconvenience and expense. been made to meet the requirements of chronic cases which need free life-saving drugs, and of pensioners who obtain prescriptions from medical practitioners, because many of those persons have been under treatment for a long period.

During the last few days I have received representations from various reputable professional sources about the dangers that will arise if the present liberal arrangement for the supply of drugs is continued. ""We have told doctors that, if they will inform us of special cases, concessions will be made to meet them. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh will give me information about the specific case to which he has referred, I shall ascertain whether anything can be done in that matter. the fact that the Minister for Health has intimated that the list of free medicines contains all the drugs that are necessary for the treatment of all ailments, and also to the fact that pensioners are obliged to pay for prescriptions which contain drugs that are not included in the free medicine list, will the Minister instruct doctors to prescribe only drugs that are included in that list? medicines available to pensioners contains all the medicines that are listed in the British Pharmacopoeia which is acknowledged to be one of the most comprehensive lists. In addition, the doctors partimissed ostensibly in accordance witli cipating in the scheme have drawn up what is called a prescriber's list which includes the more common compounds that are in general use, particularly in hospitals throughout the world, but includes some drugs that are not included in the British Pharmacopoeia. Additional items include life-saving drugs which are made available free of charge to all patients. From my knowledge of general medical practice, the free medicines available provide sufficiently wide scope to enable any complaint to be effectively treated. It will be found that 99£ per cent, of prescriptions come within that category. Labour and National Service whether, in view of the fact that many trade unionists consider that the "" C "" series index, which contains the list of items upon which the basic wage is calculated, is outdated, and that many items now in general use are not included in it, the Government will appoint a committee to investigate the possibilitiy of revising the list in order that a more accurate assessment of the basic wage may be made? honourable member's suggestion and consider what should be done in relation to it. for Territories say whether all members of the recently formed Papua and New Guinea Legislative Council will be required to take the oath of allegiance prior to taking office? legiance will be administered to all members of the Papua and New Guinea Legislative Council at the inauguration ceremony on the 26th November. General say whether it is a fact that a number of female employees of the Postal Department, who were receiving 90 per cent, or 100 per cent, of the male rate of pay, have been disthe Government's plan to sack 10,000 public servants? Is it also a fact that a number of those females have been offered re-employment in the department at 75 per cent, of the male rate of pay? If that is so, is it not a breach of the agreement entered into by the Public Service Board and thc Public Service unions in connection with the continuity of employment at 90 per cent, or 100 per cent, of the male rate of females who had been employed by the Postal Department for a certain period ? sonal knowledge of the matter to which the honourable member has referred but I shall endeavour to secure the information that he seeks. tion which I asked last week the Postmaster-General stated that the shortage of material was the main reason for the dismissals which had been effected from",17,Healthand Medical Services

This officer of the union has statedTlic matter of tlie lack of equipment is incorrect. There is such an abundance of telephone equipment available that nobody knows what to do with it. In view of this statement, does the Postmaster-General still maintain that the dismissals which were made in Tasmania were due to a. shortage of material? If he does not, will he endeavour to ensure that the technicians and linemen who were so summarily dismissed will be put back on duty? materials in the Postmaster-General's Department is Australia wide. Certain materials may not be held in one part of Australia although they may be held in another. If , fortuitously, some particular depot has a supply of the materials which it needs, that does not necessarily imply that the services of the men at that depot should be retained and others dismissed elsewhere. The available material must be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the Commonwealth. Neither the Postal Workers Union nor any other union can have full knowledge of the exact equipment possessed by the Postmaster General's Department. The only persons who have that information and who are qualified to decide where it should be used are the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs and his officers. Mr W. M .

Minister for the Army whether he will be kind enough to re-examine the possibility that his department might provide some accommodation for the Australian Light Horse Band at Goulburn. I realize that this matter has been considered before at my request, but the result has not been satisfactory. Will the honourable gentleman again take into account the 70 years of history of this band, its appointment as the official recruiting band for the southern districts, its readiness to assist at all Army functions, and the fact that ever since the Goulburn drill hall was built the band has been permitted to use it for the storage of instruments and for rehearsals ? and careful consideration to the frequent representations that have been made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro on this subject. When national service trainees are assigned to Citizen Military Force units after they conclude their training this week, it will be possible to accommodate only military units at the Goulburn drill hall. I should be glad to comply with the honourable member's request if it were possible to do so, but the drill hall is not even adequate for the requirements of the military forces. I wish to make it clear also that the unit which calls itself the 10th Light Horse Band is in no way associated with our military forces. It is not a military organization.

Opposition members have my sympathy if they are obliged to sit on the type of cushion that I have at present. of the cushions in this chamber has. engaged my attention for some time past.

As to the rest of the House, I should not like to give a guarantee. for the Army for what purpose Mount Martha House, Mornington, was purchased for the Department of the Army? Will the Minister state the purchase price of the property? Is it not a fact that this SO-roomed residence is now occupied by no more than twelve persons? Is ifc not also a fact that since the Government purchased the property it has beenalmost completely neglected and is now in a state of acute deterioration? Will the Minister makean urgent inspection of the property to observe personally the degree of Government neglect? that the honourable member has asked this question, because he has given me an opportunity to put before the House the facts about this matter. The property Department of the Army for the purpose of relieving an accumulated shortage of accommodation for married members of Mount Martha there are to-day four or five very large units of the Army, the members of which are receiving special instructions. One of the units is an apprentices' school, in which there are 450 apprentices. There is also a signals training school and an army survey school. Attached to these schoolsare a great number of instructors, many of whom had to be brought from other States. They have been living for a long time apart from their families. Because of the difficulty in obtaining supplies of materials and man-power for the erection of married quarters, the property at Mount Martha was purchased. It had been on the market for a considerable time. To-day there are eight families living there. purchased ? thp open market. The reports published in the press about this property being in bad repair are completely incorrect. When it was purchased a considerable amount of overhaul and renovation work was done to it and its surroundings. Annually or bi-annually the grass is cut, and the place is kept in good order and repair. To-day the building and the grounds are in better order than they were when we took them over.

I say definitely that the allegations that have appeared in the press are entirely incorrect. As soon as the Department of Works and Housing is able to do what is required to the building, we shall be able to place therein many more families, the members of which have been separated for a very long time.

NEW SERVICE RIFLE. tion of the Minister for the Army to recent statements that have been made to the effect that Australia will adopt the new British .2S0 rifle. Is it a fact that the North Atlantic Powers appointed an expert sub-committee to investigate the value of this rifle, and that that committee rejected it on the ground that it lacked hitting power, and recommended the adoption of the American .30 rifle? Has America developed a new version of the .30 rifle which is lighter and cheaper than previous models but which has the same hitting power? If this latter rifle were to be adopted by the North Atlantic Powers would Australia, in this respect, be left outside the standardized weapons arrangement of the Western Powers? most interested in the new .2S0 rifle with which the United Kingdom has been experimenting. Recently, in Britain, our Minister for Defence and the Chief of the General Staff were present when the rifle was being tested, and the results are said to have been remarkable. All that I am able to say at the moment is that no decision has yet been macle on whether Australia will adopt it. Concerning the other questions asked by the honourable gentleman, I have not yet received an official report of the tests to which the weapon was subjected. cause an inquiry to be made into the operations of soap manufacturers and others who expend large sums of money on radio advertising, which although totally unnecessary, substantially increases the price of soap and other products to the general public? Will the right honourable gentleman also cause inquiries to be made concerning the amount that is being expended on advertising by such manufacturers, whether it is justified, and whether it should be restricted by curtailing the tax deduction that is allowed in respect of advertising? 1 point out that the cost of advertising of that kind is handed on to the general public in the form of increased charges complicated matter referred to by the honourable member was discussed at the recent Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. However, I shall have a reply prepared and furnish him with it. to the allegations that were made by the Minister for the Army, when he answered a question this afternoon, regarding the serious and apparently deliberate misrepresentation concerning army activities in the Mount Martha area. Will the right honourable gentleman explain to the House why the Government recently granted a substantial increase of dollar allocations in order to permit the importation of newsprint from dollar areas without making an investigation of the uses to which sueh newsprint would be put? proposition that the provision of dollars for newsprint should be accompanied by provision for the censorship of the newspapers that are to be produced from such newsprint.

Does the Government approve, or would it allow, such direct action to be taken by employers outside the arbitration system? of a statement on the lines indicated hy the honourable member. I do not feel competent to comment on an alleged statement of a conciliation commissioner. I should need on opportunity to examine thoroughly such a statement before I would comment on it. the Minister for the Army. I point out that during a recent investigation of the national service training camp at Wacol, near Brisbane, it carne to my notice that married members of the Australian Regular Army were being boarded in prefabricated houses situated on the Outskirts of the camp and were being charged a rental of £3 a week for such houses. Is there any possibility within the near future of that amount being reduced as it seems to be a considerable rental for houses of such a standard? That rental is much in excess of rentals that are charged for similar civilian accommodation ? bouses being built for married army personnel throughout Australia and the amount of rental to be paid for them are at present being investigated by a special committee. As the prefabricated houses at tlie Wacol camp are still under construction and have not yet been occupied no rental has yet been charged in respect of them. The question that the honourable member has raised has not been lost sight of. For some time, the special committee to which I have referred has been examining the possibility of adopting a new basis of calculating the rental of such houses. asked the Minister for Immigration a series of questions regarding Commonwealth Hostels Limited, the organization that has been established to control hostels formerly under the control of the Department of Immigration, and he promised to furnish me with an early reply.

WhilstI recognize that newspapers have the right to make suggestions from time to time on various matters, I consider that some of the suggestions that have been made about the. sale of Trans-Australia Airlines are most unwarranted. In those circumstances, the Governnient should have announced its policy regarding Trans-Australia Airlines. Because of its silence, Opposition members and. Government supporters alike have no knowledge of its intentions. Any action which will interfere with such a highly successful airline will be detrimental to Australia. Therefore, the Government should have made its position clear at the earliest possible moment. Every member of the Opposition has observed with anxiety the evidence of a well organized agitation the objective of which is the abolition of this completely successful government enterprise. It is recognized that the strength of public opposition may prevent the sale of Trans-Australia Airlines and, so, there is other (Hon.

When action of that kind can be taken without one of the directors having the slightest inkling of what was about to take place, as has been admitted by a member of this House, who was a director of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited since its inception, the anxiety and suspicion of the public is fully justified. Silently and swiftly the Government accomplished its purpose, and the lesson learned from that experience is that the full light of public discussion shouid be turned on to the Government's proposals, so that all may know what it intends to do with this highly valued institution. The people have not forgotten, and are not likely to forget, that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) said that Mr Coles and Mr Wilson would have to go. That was reported in the press during the 1949 election campaign, and I was asked about it on a number of occasions. stand the applause of the honorablo member for Henty( Mr Gullett) because, had Mr Coles stood again for Parliament, the honourable member for Henty would not have been here. At any rate, Mr Mr Walsh, has never hesitated to use all Coles has gone from Trans-Australia Airlines, a fact for which I and thousands of publicly circulated annual reports of people throughout Australia feel very sorry. He has a most capable mind, and was well fitted to develop an organization such as Trans-Australia Airlines. That he did so with great credit to himself and to the other members of the board no reasonable person would attempt to deny. We all regretted his resignation. It is no reflection on his very competent successor to say that Mr Coles's resignation was viewed with disappointment by his many admirers and supporters. He and his board started from scratch, or even from behind scratch, and competed successfully with already well established private airlines that had received generous America, the home of private enterprise. assistance in the form of mail subsidies. It was not a matter of a powerful governtrol Australian National Airways Proment organization competing against small privately owned enterprises as I shall make quite clear. to give some information about tbe shareholding in Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. It is owned by five great shipping companies, which possess huge resources that they do not hesitate to use in their endeavours to damage a government airline. They are continuously on the job, and have usef: the press in their campaign against Trans-Australia Airlines. That they have not succeeded in damaging the reputation of Trans-Australia Airlines is due to the splendid service that this organization has rendered to the publie. The principal shareholdings are listed as follows:£ Huddart Parker Limited .. 74,999 Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited .. .. 74,999 Holyman Brothers Proprietary Limited .. .. 74,999 Adelaide Steamship Company Limited .. .. .. 75,000 Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited .. .. 74,998 Airlines of Australia Limited .. 23,708 The total shareholding is £39S,70S. I cannot say whether there has been any alteration since that list was published because Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, being a proprietary company, does not publish balance-sheets. However, the acting general manager, the figures that are available in the Trans-Australia Airlines in order to try to prove that that organization has received favoured treatment. The Australian National Airlines Commission has always disclosed the real position in relation to the conduct of the affairs of the organization. Mr Walsh's statements have been completely unfounded, and I shall have more to say about them at a later stage. At this point I emphasize the fact that almost all of the shares in Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are owned by shipping companies, a state of affairs that is not tolerated even in the United States of Why do these shipping companies conprietary Limited? The answer is that theh* object is to make airline services I propose subsidiary, if necessary, to the interests of the shipping services.

95,Mr Drakeford,"I can well underone dollar twenty cents a mile for operating a service to Australia in opposition to British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, which was merely carrying mail on a poundage basis. That fact was disclosed when an inquiry was made into an application by the Matson Navigation Company for permission to conduct an air service to Honolulu. The application was rejected because American shipping companies are not permitted to conduct airline services. We ought to consider whether shipping lines or other transport organizations in Australia should be allowed to own airlines and to try to dominate transport services. I do not know what the Government intends to do about Trans-Australia Airlines and T shall not make accusations against it, but I say that it is dangerous to allow big outside interests to control our airlines, which provide the life-blood for a vital artery of our communications system. Ansett Airways Limited recently announced that it would reduce fares. Such reductions may appear to be commendable, but the important fact is that the company provides a lower class of service than is provided by other airlines. The service is definitely second-class, because the company's D.C.3 aircraft have 28 seats for passengers, compared witli a maximum of 24 in similar aircraft operated by other companies. announcement of the intention to reduce fares was made by the general manager of the company, whose statement, according to a report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, included the following interesting explanation:Mr R. D. Collins, general manager of Ansett Airways, said tlie cuts were possible the floor if any attempt were made by the because of economies through efficient use of aircraft and co-ordination of road, air, and hotel activities. T emphasize the fact that the company.

Such the government of the day tried to prestatements reflect as well on the Auditorvent passenger charges from being General, who is bound to see that the lowered unduly because price-cutting accounts are properly presented and that campaigns of that sort throw a serious responsibility on the experts of the Department of Civil Aviation. Those experts are required to ensure that airline companies shall not reduce their standards below the safety margin. Safety must be the first consideration in air transport. Nothing that is liable to mar the splendid record of our airlines should be tolerated. A question that was recently asked in this House elicited the fact that 109 persons had been killed as passengers of private airline companies and that only nine or ten had been killed as passengers of government airlines since their initiation. I am not foolish enough to believe that an accident could not alter those figures quickly, but I do say that it is practically impossible to get a higher standard of care and maintenance than that attained by Trans-Australia Airlines. Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited has a good record, but if honourable members travel in Ansett planes they will find that the service is second class by modern standards. prietary Limited has a good record. the point of view of safety surely? of passenger carriage. The honourable member seems to be irritated by the fact that Trans-Australia Airlines is so good, but nobody can point a finger of scorn at it with justice, although many have tried to do so.

98,The Mr Drakeford,"I am speakingnothing is hidden. It is his duty also to ensure that the report is presented in terms whioh can be understood readily by the public. The report is audited and certified by the Auditor-General, and suggestions that the balance-sheet does not give a true picture of the financial position are nonsense and apparently are being made in the interests of the competitors of Trans-Australia The critics who adopt this line seem to have forgotten that in the period of seven years from 1939, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited received more than £2,500,000 in mail payments. Apparently that fact has been concealed from the critics so that a good case could be made against Trans-Australia Airlines. The carriage of ordinary mail is a part of the obligation of a government airline. {Extension of time granted.'] In 1950-51 Trans-Australia Airlines carried 2,542 tons or 5,694,080 lb. of mail throughout That was an increase of 27 per cent, over the volume carried in. the previous year. For that service Trans-Australia Airlines received a lump sum of £540,000. Have honourable members any idea of the amount National Airways Proprietary Limited received for carrying a much smaller quantity when that company was practically the only air-mail carrier in the CommonAvealth? The sum of £540,000 is small in comparison with the amount paid for the carriage of air mail in 1943-44. National Airways Proprietary Limited was paid £7S3,725 for carrying 3,368,164 lb. over a network very much smaller than that of Trans-Australia Moreover, at that time wages were much lower and petrol was cheaper. These facts should be known widely so that the public may understand the true nature of the allegations that favoured treatment is given to Trans-Australia Airlines. Airways Proprietary Limited nor Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited has paid a penny piece in fees for air-route charges. No token payment has been made to indicate any liability. Australia Airlines has paid £682,472 in respect of air-route charges, which, added to its profit of £420,617, makes a total of Mr Drakeford. £1,103,089. The fact is that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited organization have paid nothing in respect of these charges, although between them they have been asked for more than £750,000, but Trans-Australia Airlines has paid the ful l sum for which it has been asked and, since becoming Airlines. firmly established, has made a substantial profit. If the Government believes that air-route charges cannot legally be collected from the companies which, for various reasons, are refusing to pay them, it should relieve Trans-Australia Airlines of the burden of paying the charges and should refund the money that the organization has paid in respect of them. If such a refund were made, Trans-Australia Airlines would be placed upon the same basis as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Ansott Airways Proprietary Limited Australia. and its profit would be £1,103,0S9. The Minister said recently, in reply to a question that I directed to him, that the report upon the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines-for which I thank him-woul d enable a comparison of Australian Trans-Australia Airlines and other airlines to be made, but, as I have pointed out, it does not in fact enable that to be done because we cannot ascertain what Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is doing. I do not. believe that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is losing In that year Australian money, nor do I believe that there is any justification for merging it with Trans-Australia Airlines. As I have said previously. Trans-Australia Airlines is an Airlines. institution in this country. Although the report is a good one, it does not enable us to compare Trans-Australia Airlines with other airlines, the reports of which, especially in the case of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, are remarkable for what they Neither Australian National refuse to disclose. We know from answers to questions that the percentage passenger loading of Trans-Australia Airlines is much higher than is that ol any other airline in this country. That Transdemonstrates clearly that Trans-Australia Airlines is much more popular than are the other airlines. But the percentage passenger loading conveys no information about freight carriage. It is well known that Australian National monopoly Airways Proprietary Limited bas tliree those who were anti-T.A.A. in the first years Bristol freighters and that it carries a of its service.

Therefore, assumed office, one of its earlier actions was to try to ascertain those facts and circumstances.

118,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Postall State governments, under which the same price is assured for all wheat sold for domestic use in Australia. The current wheat stabilization plan covers the period to the end of the 1952-53 wheat season, and negotiations are in progress, with the States and with wheat-growers' organizations, for an extension of the plan. In accordance with its understanding with the industry, the Government does not wish to hold in trust amounts which appear to be in excess of the requiremcrta of the stabilization plan. At the present time the amount held in the fund is £35,000,000, which is made up from the joint tax proceeds of No. 12 pool, No. 13 pool and part of No. 14 pool. The operations of No. 14 pool, which covers the 1950-51 crop, are still by no means complete. With the repayment of tax on exports from the 1948-49 crop, the stabilization fund will hold less than two seasons' contributions, but this is regarded as a reasonable situation. A succession of good crops in Australia has coincided with higli prices for wheat exported. As a result the stabilization fund has been buoyant, and funds have previously been approved by Parliament in respect of earlier pools. No. 12 pool is now the oldest contributing pool to the fund, and it is intended to repay the whole of the amount received from the 1948-49 crop, rather than to make a pro rata, refund to all contributing pools. This principle of first in, first out, is endorsed by growers' organizations as the most satisfactory way of arranging refunds to the industry. Notwithstanding the fact that two later pools have actually contributed to the fund, I wish to make it clear that in repaying these moneys to the oldest pool the Government will be acting in accordance with the wishes of the growers in relation to the method of repayment. It is wheat growers' money, and the industry has indicated that it regards this method as the fairest, as well as the easiest, to operate. Many growers drop out of the industry each year, and are replaced by new growers, and it is only reasonable that the fund should be built up by those who will get the actual benefit from it in the event of a fall of prices in the future. Eeferenee has been made to the negotiations that are in progress for an extension of the plan. Naturally, the financial provisions necessary for an extended plan must be considered fully, especially in view of some uncertainty about the future. However, the payment of the refund of tax on the 194S-49 wheat crop is justified, since it represents an amount that is no longer needed in the fund. The bill is evidence of the Government's policy not to ask wheat-growers to make any more than a fair contribution to a fund to ensure the stability of their industry in future years. It is presented with confidence that it will meet with the general approval of all sections of the community. I commend the measure to the consideration of honourable members. adjourned. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1951. Debate resinned from the l l t h October (vide page 539), on motion by Sir That the bill be now read a second time. Opposition supports this measure, the purpose of which, as the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) pointed out in his second-reading speech, is to obviate work that produces little return to the Treasury. The principal act provides that if a shareholder's interest in the unimproved value of land owned by a company does not exceed £100, or if the aggregate of his interests in a number of companies does not exceed £500 he need not lodge a land tax return. This amending legislation doubles those sums. That is the only aspect of the land tax to which the Opposition gave specific consideration and on which it arrived at any decision. My personal view, however, is that the Government should not have varied the existing practice in connection with land valuations. The Treasurer said in his budget speechThe land tax for the financial year 1951-52, based on the land owned at the 30th June, 1951, will be based ujion thc actual unimproved values as at that date in contrast to the",30,Charge Bill 1951

121,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [5.8].,"on the same hasis as individual holders. I understand that that has, in fact, happened. Shareholders are not primary taxpayers hut secondary taxpayers. Yet the involved procedure prescribed by the act has to be undertaken in order to ascertain the liability of the company. I suggest that it is duobtful whether what was intended under the original Land Tax Act has been accomplished. Our line of thought about the land tax may need some recasting. An honourable member suggested recently that the entire taxation structure should be altered with reference to the basis of assessment of land tax. The original exemption of land worth less than £5,000 has been retained although an unimproved value of £5,000 was very difierent in 1910 from what it is in 1951. Unfortunately, very little opportunity has been given to the Parliament properly to assess the social effects of taxation. The information that honourable members have at their disposal is usually two or three years old. In the case of the land tax, statistics have not been published for approximately nine years so that it is very difficult for honorwhether an alteration should be effected. able members to ascertain its effects. Those who have to pay this tax know that because their land is valued at a certain amount they w ill have to pay land tax. They regard that fact as a nuisance but In addressing myself to this subject do not view it from any social aspect. shortly, I shall not cover the ground that Such pay £100 as land tax, or £1,000 able member for Melbourne Ports( Mr. as land t a x "" and treats that as a for m Crean). I suggest seriously that the of outgoing or expenditure. When land Government should abandon this field of is about to be sold, prospective buyers taxation altogether.

Parliament should examine the fundaand now regard this as their principal mentals of the system of taxation in source of revenue. vogue in order to ascertain whether it is achieving the social result that it is intended to achieve. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) has stated, the Opposition does not oppose this measure. It merely criticizes, at least indirectly, the failure of the land tax to achieve what it was introduced to achieve, namely, the breaking up of big estates, in order to encourage small holders, which is necessary if we are to increase or primary production. I consider that we should alter the incidence of the tax by increasing it progressively according to the value of the land, or, as the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) suggested recently, we should abolish it altogether. Apartf r o m an occasional airing of the subject in this House, very little is done about it . I consider it to be primaril y the duty of the Parliament, not a committee on taxation or any other outside body, to attend to this matter. Honourable members should evaluate the information that is placed before them in order to decide I suggest that consideration should be given to an alteration of the wliole structure"" of land taxation in Australia. a man says, "" I have to has already been covered by the honorThat may other taxes. There is, therefore, conB u t certainly the their revenue from the taxation of land,",32,Arthur Fadden
122,Mr Cbameb. (Bennelong) [5.19],"I believe all honourable members will agree that local governing bodies are now in a very tight corner financially. Indeed, I cannot see how those bodies will be able to continue to carry out their present functions, particularly in the social field, unless they can obtain additional revenue from other than taxes paid by property owners. If local government taxation were increased the burden on property owners would become intolerable. If the Commonwealth were to vacate the field of land taxation altogether, a considerable saving of overhead charges would be effected. In addition to valuers employed by the States, the Commonwealth employs a number of officers, some very highly paid, to make valuations for the purpose of land taxation. That is one field in which there is duplication. Of course, there are many different systems of valuing. Wales, the Valuer-General's Department makes valuations. In other States there is a somewhat similar system, but a valuation of a different type is made for the purpose of taxation by local governing bodies, and for other purposes. One could speak at length on the duplication of Commonwealth and State jurisdiction though the revenue that is derived by the Commonwealth from the land tax is not great, this measure will increase considerably the number of people who will be required to pay that tax. The value of land in this country has risen by between 100 per cent, and 300 per cent., according to its location. As the honourable meinber for Melbourne Ports rightly said, originally this tax was intended to achieve the breaking up of large rural holdings. I do not know to what degree it has been successful in that respect. However, as a result of this measure there will be scarcely any land in the cities of this country not subject to land tax. As a matter of fact one can apply that, observation also to country holdings. Under this measure the principles of the tax can be applied to areas that are not big enough to be subdivided, that is to holdings that are only big enough for one person to work. The value of land has increased tremendously during the last few years, and in consequence of this proposal land tax will be levied on a Mr Cramer. much greater number of persons than previously paid it. I doubt whether the advisers of the Treasurer are in a position to say how many additional taxpayers will be involved. The revenue raised from this particular source may exceed the estimate of £7,500,000. In New South Wales and other States a vicious system of rent pegging still operates. Perhaps its introduction was necessary. The effect of it is that rents are pegged at the level that existed on the 31st August, 1939. This system is completely unfair, and denies any form of justice to the owners of property. me that the honourable member is now speaking of a matter that is outside the scope of this bill. In New South say is relevant to the matter of taxation, because in the States in which rent pegging still exists the fair rents tribunals, when fixing rents, do not take into consideration the federal taxation imposed on land. Land tax has been specifically excluded from the assessment of the fair rents of properties. Some organizations, because of their ramificaand administration. Altions, have to hold properties in practically all the cities of Australia. In such cases, and in others where big city properties are involved, it can be shown that because of the imposition of land tax and other taxes, the net revenue is completely extinguished so far as the property-owner is concerned. That is a very serious matter. Surely it is unfair that a property-owner, who must abide by the government fixation of his rent, should be denied the right to have taken into consideration the amount that he is obliged to pay as land tax under Commonwealth legislation. The Treasurer should consider that matter. On this occasion the value of land exempt from the tax should have heen raised above £5,000 in order to meet modern conditions. We should have either done that, or reduced the tax on a graduated scale according to the area of land held by any person. Moreover, some concession might be given by way of obliteration of the excess amount chargeable over a certain sum.

I seriously submit into fewer and fewer hands as the years that suggestion to the Treasurer, who, go by. The Treasurer might ascertain although perhaps not able to act in such the degree to which the land tax could be a way at present, may be able to give used to break up existing big estates so serious consideration to it when preparing that there should be more food-producing his next budget. If this were done it areas and fewer areas for grazing bullocks. would save administrative costs to the Commonwealth and would release certain food. officers for more urgent work with State instrumentalities. Such a change would be beneficial and would prevent the duplication of certain functions which exists plots of land is more valuable to Austhroughout Australia. The honourable member for Bennelong believe that administrative costs should ( Mr Cramer) has made a tantalizing be reduced and methods evolved whereby speech.

128,Sir Arthur Fadden,"The salariesaction of the Treasurer can he seen in a different light. The Opposition does not oppose the passage of the bill. However, I could not miss the opportunity to put the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) on the right track, even though that track does not lead in the direction of the Sydney harbour bridge. this bill deals with that section of the taxation power of the Commonwealth which is responsible for raising the least amount of revenue, it involves a number of important principles. Commissioner of Land Tax disclosed that the revenue derived from land tax in the Commonwealth was only 1.1 per cent, of the total taxation revenue, and that that figure had not increased to any -appreciable degree since 1945. That disclosure lends a great deal of weight to the argument that the Government should use land tax for the purpose for which it was originally designed. In other words, land tax should be imposed with the object of breaking up large estates or .of applying a kind of .social compulsion. A great deal of the cost of land tax collections is covered by the cost of collection of of Australian agricultural history, which -income taxes, because in many instances the officers concerned work side by side. If the Government is not prepared to use land tax for .the object that I have stated, it would be better advised to forget land tax and collect the amount .of .tax (through ordinary income fax .channels. However, I myself do not approve of that method. I believe that land tax should be imposed not to raise .revenue but to improve the produetion of food. As the Treasurer { Sir Arthur Eadden) follow.

Undoubtedly the dairy-farmer and the meat producer are obliged to-day to sell their products under fixed contracts and at prices which the members of the Australian Country party suggest are not payable prices. They are therefore in a much less favorable position than are the wool-growers, who are the only primary producers in the community who are able to sell their products at world parity prices. I suggest to the Treasurer that in future deliberations in regard to The last report of the taxation measures of this kind, a distinction should be drawn between the man who uses his land to grow a product which may be sold on the world markets at greatly enhanced profits to' himself, and the man who is obliged to sell his products, under contract, to the United Kingdom. It would seem that, until such a distinction is drawn, many producers will be committed to the sale of their products at prices which are less than the cost of production. This legislation also deals with companies that own land. From my reading perhaps is not so extensive as is that of some honourable members opposite, the operations of such companies are not what they might be. It is only necessary to consider the position of the Northern Territory to-day in order to see what happens to the Australian countryside when large tracts of land are owned by companies, the shareholders of which never even see the properties concerned. In many instances, decline of the properties inevitably results from such ownership.

It would be interesting to know whetlier the honourable member has done anything to accelerate the subdivision of big estates in order to increase rural productivity, which the Fisher Government claimed was its objective in instituting the land tax. When the honourable member said that land tax was impeding production of foodstuffs, he overlooked the fact that the tax is levied only in respect of properties whose value exceeds .£5,000. He ignored the fact that an overwhelming proportion of foodstuffs is produced on leasehold land which is exempt from land tax. In the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day, this tax is. an indispensable source of revenue.

Amendment (by Sir agreed toThat clause 2 be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following clause:"" 2. This Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the first day of July, oui thousand nine hundred aud fifty-one."". Clauses3 and 4 agreed to. New clause 2A. Treasurer) [5.54J I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" 2A. Section live of thc Principal Act is amended by omitting sub-section (5.) and inserting in its stead the following subsection :' (5.) There is payable to the Commissioner a salary at the rate of Four thousand pounds a year and to the Assistant Commissioner a salary at the rute of Three thousand pounds a year, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.'."". The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the salary of the Commissioner of Land Tax shall be £4,000 per annum in lieu of £3,500 per annum as at present, and that that of the Assistant Commissioner of Land Tax shall be £3,000 instead of £2,750 per annum. The change is being made in recognition of the heavy increase of the duties and responsibilities of those officials in recent years. Honourable members are doubtless aware that the officers who are appointed Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, respectively, under the Land Tax Assessment Act are statutorily appointed by the relevant acts to be the Commissioner and the Second Commissioner of Taxation, respectively, for the purposes of the income tax and social services contribution, sales tax, pay-roll tax, entertainments tax and a number of other direct taxes of lesser importance. The commissioners are required to carry heavy independent responsibilities in the administration and interpretation of the comacts. Those responsibilities must be exercised by them in an individual capacity. The interpretations that are given are subject to critical examination and contest by skilled accountants and lawyers, and must also stand the test both of boards of review and of the High Court of Australia. In addition to the tasks that arise out of the interpretation of the taxing laws, the duty of collecting and protecting the revenue of the Commonwealth. For this purpose, since the advent of uniform taxation, there has come under the per1 sonal management of the commissioners a large Australia-wide organization with twelve branch offices, in which between 7,000 and 8,000 persons are employed, compared with fewer than 1,000 in 1925 and 1,100 in 1939, when there were only seven branch offices. The extent of the increase of the responsibilities of the commissioners, primarily in consequence of uniform taxation, is strikingly demonstrated by some comparative statistics. In 1925, they administered only four acts, received 220,000 income tax returns and collected £16,000,000 in revenue. By 1939, they were administering six acts, receiving 400,000 returns and collecting £28,400,000. This year they administer eleven acts, and receive no fewer than 3.500,000 income tax returns, and it is estimated that a total of £756,000,000 will be collected in revenue in the current financial year. The nation's expanding economy since the termination of World War II . has added greatly to the magnitude and importance of the posts occupied by the Commissioner and the Second Commissioner of Taxation. The higher prevailing rates of tax have also increased their responsibilities, because there is a greater tendency on the part of taxpayers to evolve means of lessening their liability and, in consequence, there is a greater degree of challenge to the commissioners' interpretations. One result of that development is that, whereas in past .years one hoard of review dealt comfortably with appeals from decisions on objections, at present three boards are heavily engaged with cases. Another result is that the legislative programme",37,Arthur Fadden
140,Sir Arthur Fadden (Mcpherson,,38,Aethu B Eadden There Devolves Upon The Commissioners
141,(By Sir Abthub Eadden) Plicated Provisions Of The Various Taxing,"that is necessary to circumvent means of avoiding tax has become much heavier. The initial work of this programme must, of necessity, devolve upon the -commissioners. Therefore it will be appreciated that it is both appropriate and necessary that the remuneration of the commissioners shall be commensurate with the responsibilities that they are called upon to shoulder. When I mention that the annual salary of the Taxation Officer of one of the large puhlic companies of Australia, whose responsibilities do not extend beyond the taxation affairs of the company, receives a salary equal to that at present given to the Commissioner of Taxation, honourable members will realize that there is every justification for the proposed increases. Accordingly I commend this amendment to the committee. The Opposition has not discussed this new clause, and, therefore, any remarks that 1 make upon it will express my personal opinion. I endorse the statement of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) that the Commissioner of Taxation and the Second Commissioner occupy two of the most responsible and onerous positions in the community, and I agree with the principle that such men should he paid salaries to which they are justly entitled. The Commonwealth, in order to obtain the services of first-class men for those high positions, must offer attractive salaries. I believe that, in the present Commissioner of Taxation and the Second Commissioner, we have the best men, and I consider that their salaries should be commensurate with the importance of their offices.

On bebalf of tbe Opposition, I protest vigorously and vehemently against this outrageous attempt to curtail discussion of the .Estimates. It is still a long time until Christmas, and there should be plenty of opportunity to discuss proposals for the appropriation of £1,014,000,000, which is the estimated expenditure for the present financial year. The Government proposes that honourable members should have only fourteen ancl a half hours in which to discuss the expenditure of this huge amount. It proposes to dispose of public money at the rate of about £70,000,000 an hour, or more tban £1,000,000 a minute, and yet members of the Government call themselves democrats. able member must confine his remarks to the length of time which it is proposed J.

The present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) protested when the Chifley Government allotted a much greater period of time for the consideration of the departmental estimates than is now contemplated. We have 36 departments and a number of ancillary instrumentalities whose needs must all be considered. The work of each department should be discussed intelligently and properly in order to protect the interests of the taxpayers. But this Government considers that fourteen and a quarter hours will be sufficient, for that purpose! Twenty-eight hours, or even a month, which was approximately the period devoted to the general budget debate, would not be too much time for the consideration of the proposed expenditure of such a vast sum of money as is involved in the Estimates.

The largest amount that the Parliament ever appropriated under the Chifley Government in the post-war period was £526,000,000. We are now being asked to appropriate £1,014,500,000, a super record amount. And all this has to be dealt with in fourteen and a quarter hours! The Government, by its action, is showing its complete contempt for democracy. There is very little to distinguish it from Hitler's show. able member's time has expired. Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [8.11] -The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has tried very hard to whip himself into a frenzy of indignation over this matter. The House is now considering whether the time proposed to be allotted for the consideration of the Estimates is reasonable having regard to all circumstances. For that purpose, I suggest, we must look not merely at the recent past and the time that has been available during the current sitting period for discussion of important issues but also to the time that will be available to us in the future for the discussion of the wide variety of measures on which honourable members may unburden their souls for the edification of their .electors. When we consider the opportunities that were available to us earlier in this sessional period, we are reminded that a record number of speeches for this Parliament was made during the course of the general budget debate. That is traditionally an occasion on which any subject on which any honorahle member wishes to talk may be freely discussed, and 104 members of this Parliament took full advantage of their priviscarcely complain with justice now that lege in order to discuss matters that were close to their hearts and to the hearts of their electors. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), I remind the House, was given unlimited time in which to speak during the budget debate so that he could state the point of view of his supporters on every issue that he cared to discuss. Now, as honourable members will find if they study the notice-paper, twelve bills that relate to a variety of matters are already listed for debate. I assure them that that is by no means a complete list of the legislation that will be brought forward for debate before the House terminates the present series of t sittings. Therefore, quite apart from the considerable period of time that the Government proposes to allot for the consideration of departmental estimates, there will be a host of opportimities for discussion of various important subjects. Those opportunities will arise not only during the consideration of bills but also during debates on special motions for the adjournment of the House and on the daily motion for the adjournment. There is an alternative method by which the problem of dealing with the details of the Estimates could be solved. We have had all-night sittings in the past, but I do not think that any honourable member opposite who has had experience of such sittings will argue that the Parliament was able to give better consideration to its problems on such occasions, when about 75 per cent, of its members were in a state of semi-coma or completely asleep, than we shall be able to give to them during the period of fourteen hours of concentrated attention that the Government proposes. Only last week, Mr Speaker, I gathered that you found it necessary, in view of the apparent lack of interest by honourable members opposite in matters that were before the House, to suggest do with the proposed time-table. with the time-table. If honourable members opposite were not sufficiently interested to participate in debates on a variety of matters that came before the House during recent weeks, they can they are not being given adequate opportunities to discuss the same matters.

Can there be any wonder at the paucity of the attendance after about 100 speeches had been delivered during the budget debate when successive speakers merely repeated in more or less difierent terms what other honourable members had already said ? Apparently we are not to be allowed to express our views on important matters during the consideration of the Estimates. Only a few honourable members can hope to say what they want to say, if they are fortunate enough to catch the Chairman's eye when they rise to speak.

One would imagine, from the speeches that have been delivered by honourable members opposite, that they are being denied an opportunity to ventilate their views on various matters of national importance. In fact, as every honourable member knows, they were free, under the rules of debate as applied to the budget, to discuss such matters at length for over a month after the budget was presented on the 2nd October last. Every member of the Opposition who particularly wished to discuss any matter was at liberty to speak for 30 minutes on that subject during the budget debate. Therefore, the Opposition is attempting to mislead the Parliament and the people outside. mind about the public outside. members do mind about the public because all this discussion is designed to mislead the public into believing that the Opposition has not had adequate opportunity to state its case. The truth is that the budget was introduced on the second day of October and this is the sixth day of November and honourable members still have not disposed of it. Some of them continue to insist that they want to go on talking. Whether the Pari: a merit has to discuss the expenditure of £100,000,000 or £1,000,000,000 is immaterial. The budget has to be debated by the Parliament and if honourable members insist on division after division when they know that that is a time-consuniing procedure, they can blame only themselves if time runs out before other matters which they want to discuss can be brought before them. There has been ample time for every honourable member on both sides of the committee to discuss the budget. The Government did not apply the guillotine to the budget debate and honourable members could have wandered from Peru to Mexico in their speeches. This action of the Opposition is a stunt and it will convince nobody. peace and war, it was the policy of the Chifley and Curtin Governments to keep the Parliament in session almost constantly. I remind honourable members that during the major portion of that period the Parliament comprised only 75 mernbers. Now when there are 123 members, the Government proposes to limit severely the time available to honourable members although when it went to the country in 1949 and again in 1951 its supporters were very voluble in respect to the application by the Chifley Government of the gag and the "" guillotine"" although such actions were limited. No one will deny that the record of the Parliament that was in session during that difficult and dangerous war-time period is unparalleled in the history of federation. This Government, with ample time available, proposes to force the Parliament into recess and thus deprive memNever bers of their democratic rights. The Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) has stated that honourable members have had ample time to deal with the budget. Honourable members have had half an hour each and in that time no one could steer what the Minister referred to as a course from Peru to Mexico, as he suggested could be done. Consequently honourable members have been limited to expressing their views on broad problems. The Estimates contain details of the proposed expenditure of the numerous Commonwealth public departments. Honourable members can be critical, constructive or destructive in dealing with those details, but individual members are specialists in some items and they should be afforded a much more ample opportunity to discuss them. As a former member of a State Parliament and a member of this Parliament I know that it has been the poficy of Labour governments always to allow honourable members to exercise their democratic rights even if the Parliament had to sit all nigbt and continuously until Christmas eve.

The newspapers of 50 years ago were very dull; they contained many thousands of words and were read by only a small section of the community. To-day, people have hecome accustomed to shorter, crisper and brighter reports. They can no longer he expected to read tbe very long and detailed reports that are contained in Hansard. I know there are some people who are Hansard enthusiasts and who never miss reading one word of any speech. But they are few and far between. I am not astonished at that, because Hansard is a very difficult publication to read. When one receives it, wrapped as it comes through the mail und tries to open it, it is most discouraging. I suggest that attention be given in such a manner as still to present to the to the form that Hansard takes. If it people as a whole a clear picture of the is considered necessary to continue the proceedings of the Parliament from day present verbatim Hansard, consideration to day. Probably every member of the might be given to the publication at the Parliament would feel that his speech had same time of a summarized version.

I believe it to be consideration. very important that that should be done. It is true that at the turn of the am glad to see the Prime Minister( Mr century, when the existing form of Menzies) in the chamber to-night, reHansard was modern in comparison with covered from his illness to some degree. the form of the newspapers of that day, I suggest to the right honourable gentlethe press reported the proceedings of man that it would be wise, in reorganizParliament very fully.

I think that the only If we wish large reads a newspaper, but the form of newspapers has so changed that they no longer attempt to present to the people a clear and proportioned picture of happenings in the Parliament or of the serious and important happenings in the nation generally. It would be quite true to say that the proceedings of Parliament are no longer adequately reported in the press of this country, and that the press as a whole I except from this statement only one or two newspapers-choose s to report only the titbits of parliamentary happenings, the sensational events, the scenes and the amusing moments, and makes no attempt, to give from day to day a serious and proportioned report of bills discussed and speeches made.

173,Mr Bland (Warringah) [8.40],"Itwo that ought to be under the control of the department are the Audit Office and the Public Service Board, because the integrity of public finance is one of the main cares of a Prime Minister and the integrity of the Public Service is also a matter that concerns him very much. I think that a case could be made out for placing the officers employed in the other branches under the control of other departments. Office of Education, but also, and only in passing, to the Commonwealth should be under the control of the Department of the Treasury. Office of Education is one of the legacies which the Prime Minister inherited from a previous government. In my opinion there is no room for a Commonwealth Office of Education. imagined that at most we would need only a very small staff to advise on matters pertaining to education, its control and the encouragement of experiments in research into education on lines somewhat similar to those adopted in the United States of America. Here we have an illustration of a Commonwealth activity that has reached out in a manner, typical of all Commonwealth bodies over the years, for functions that are being adequately performed by the States. Here is an example of the relentless pursuit of a policy of centralization. It seems to me that education has no place in the centralized system of Canberra. If honourable members will examine page 9 of the Estimates they will find that it covers the proposed vote for the Office of Education. The details which are set out on page 12 suggest that the total proposed vote is £209,000. If , however, honourable members turn to page 81 of the Estimates they will find under Division No. 181 another proposed vote for the Office of Education of £2,215,000, which includes £1,496,000 for Commonwealth grants to universities and £709,200 for the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. University scholarships have been awarded year in and yeaiout by the universities themselves since universities were first established in Australia. There is no point in having a Commonwealth Office of Education to decide the conditions under which scholarships awarded by the Commonwealth shall if r . Bland. be held. The money made available for that purpose might well be paid direct to the universities or to the State governments. The universities are capable of deciding who should receive university training and the conditions under which they should receive it. The same remarks apply to most of the Commonwealth grants to the universities. This year £1,496,000 has been provided for that I refer mainly to the purpose. I do not suggest that the universities do not need that money or that the Commonwealth should not make it Grants Commission, which available. ""WhatI am concerned about is the manner in which the grants are The heing made available and the necessity for establishing a very large branch of the Prime Minister's Department to administer them. I should have imagined that ample advice could have been given to the I should have Prime Minister and the Treasurer by their existing staffs, to enable them to decide what grants should be made. Some aspects at least of the work of the Office of Education, which are under the care of the Prime Minister, are at present going through a scheme of re-organization by the Public Service Board, the principles of which might well be spread over other sections of the office. For instance, matters dealing with Unesco and South East Asia might be placed under the Administration of the Department of External Affairs. The proposed votes covering universitv training, which are set out on page 92 of the Estimates, total £818,000 are under the control of the Prime Minister's Department. It is interesting to note that other proposed votes covering war service land settlement, and the technical and rural training schemes for ex-servicemen are under the control of other departments. Thus, a veritable medley of departments deal with various aspects of the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. These, in my opinion, should all be dealt with by the Repatriation Department. I have no desire to belittle the importance of the education programme. In making these comments my sole desire is to stress the need for relieving the Prime Minister of many functions about which he should not have to worry. Next year, when we are considering the redistribution of governmental powers and functions, we should divest the Commonwealth of many functions that it has usurped from the States and restore them to the States which can carry them out more effectively and more economically. support the remarks made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Organization ancl other highly successful Allan Eraser) concerning Hansard. I propose to touch briefly upon certain points that I am sure the honourable member would have dealt with if he had been given more time to devote to the subject. From the utilitarian aspect we realize the advantage of the present format of that publication, but there is no reason why its make-up, if not its content, should not be improved. The Government might well consider the issue of separate editions containing the debates of each House of the Parliament. If that course were followed it would be more easy for members of the Parliament to analyse the speeches of the past. The only suggestion I offer for the improvement of the make-up of Hansard is that the record of speeches should contain more paragraphs. At one stage of his speech an honourable member may fulminate against the Government and then drop down to a lower key. At present there is no break in the continuity of the record by the commencement of a new paragraph to denote the change to a lower key. That, however, is but a trifling fault which might easily be rectified. I propose now to deal with the Office of Education, to which reference was made by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland). I do not share the honourable member's sorrow-hi s words were too softly spoken to be regarded as anger-a t the fact that the Comanonwealth has projected itself into the field of education. Within their limited constitutional powers both the previous Government and the present Government have clone a remarkably good job in that field. WhatI regret-is the fact that the proposed votes for education are being reduced and that some splendid features of the Commonwealth's participation in education are being eliminated. Having regard to the importance of Unesco as a special agency of the United Nations for releasing the tension of war, giving to the people opportunities for study and bringing to a sensible outcome the battle against illiteracy, it is pleasing to note that the Governnient has widely increased the amount of the grant to that body. I hope that the Government will increase it still further. That organization, together with the Food and Agriculture agencies of the United Nations, should be encouraged. I observe that on the local scene the grant for the Office of Education has been substantially reduced. Some of the activities of that instrumentality might well have been left undisturbed. I refer, for example, to the decision to abandon the issue of the Current Affairs Bulletin and the graphs that were issued with that publication. The fact that during the regime of the Chifley Government some spirited arguments took place in this chamber on whether the officers who prepared the graphs were following a particular political line, does not detract from their value as a great factor in assisting the progress of adult education. That was particularly so in country centres, where people had formed small community groups that studied various subjects. Some, of the Current Affairs Bulletins were extremely instructive documents of a very high standard and were of great assistance to such ""-roups. Some of the bulletins dealt with such subjects as soil erosion, immigration, the problem of China, wheat, wool and the great primary industries. Such bulletins should be available to people in this country at a fairly reasonable cost. They were splendidly produced, well coloured and attractive and were of great benefit to people who were doing extra-curricular work, particularly in adult education groups. The honourable meniber for Warringah will agree with me that they were extremely useful educational booklets. I shall be sorry if it has been found necessary to curtail this particular activity. Although an activity may be carried out in the right spirit it may nevertheless, and unfortunately, become a subject of criticism. In years past some of those bulletins were considered to evidence a bias towards communism. That was sheer nonsense. The subjects with which they dealt were factually and splendidly",45,Departme Nt Of The Treasury

If that is not to be the case I shall not continue my remarks on it. munication with the Government of New South Wales and the University of Sydney to see whether we can make some alternative arrangements for the publication of the bulletin, and I am hopeful that some arrangement may be arrived at. [8.53] -Every one who has listened to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) will admit that he has made a very useful and valuable contribution to the debate. I shall confine my remarks to his reference to the Commonwealth Office of Education and the part that it has played in assisting the educational systems of the States so that something approaching a general high standard of education can operate throughout the Commonwealth. At the same time, I consider that there is a dangerous tendency, which should not be encouraged, towards centralization of education in Australia. I can conceive of nothing worse that could befall this country than a completely regimented system of education. I am not worrying about "" isms "" at the present moment. I am speaking about education as such. Just as life varies from time to time, so must education be constantly moving and changing to meet the needs of a great democracy according to the different conceptions and requirements of different times. In certain educational circles there is now a tendency to try to force the Commonwealth towards complete regimentation of education. I have the greatest possible admiration for the State education systems that have been developed in this country, but no worse evil could befall Australia than that State schools should become our one and only source of education. It would be still worse to force upon the Commonwealth a nation-wide standardized system of education. It was my good fortune to investigate education in the United States of Anu-rica in 1936, and I subsequently made a report on the matter. I found that the American GoI apologize if I have vernment had a commissioner of education and 100 experts at Washington, at a time when America's population was about 130,000,000 people. It was their responsibility to distribute the grants that were provided by the federal authorities for the establishment of standards which State and local government bodies in control of education could follow. I take up the theme of the honourable member for Warringah that there has been a tendency to let the Office of Education grow at the expense of the States. The point that requires to be taken very seriously is that the growth of federal educational activities should perhaps be reviewed generally and not only in relation to this particular office, for the purpose of discovering whether we can return to the States work that they are exceptionally fitted to carry out. At the same time there is nobody who wishes less than I do for the disappearance of the Office of Education the continued existence of which is an absolute essential for the correlation of all the educational activities in Australia, particularly in relation to universities, to ensure that the smaller States shall have standards that approximate at least to the standards of the larger States. It is also essential that, at the seat of government of this Commonwealth, we should have a number of advisers who, as a result of their personal knowledge of educational problems, would be capable of advising the education authorities of the States and of assisting in the development of education. I speak with feeling on this matter because I am a former New South Wales Minister of Education. In my dealings",47,Departme Nt Of The Treasury

178,Mr Drummond (New England),"with the Commonwealth in the years before the last war I found that the greatest problem confronting us in the achievement of harmony in our various educational systems was a lack of unity both in the ministerial and administrative circles of the Commonwealth about the educational problems that confront the Commonwealth as a whole. WhilstI support the general contentions of the honourable member for Warringah [ should greatly regret to see any serious diminution of the leadership that can be given by the Commonwealth in the sphere of education. I should be loth to see the disappearance of the experienced advice and leadership that can be given to the States by men who understand education and its problems and who know what action should be taken to remove existing inequalities in relation to educational facilities in the Commonwealth. In general I support the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) in his view that some of the items that appear in the Estimates under the Prime Minister's Department should not be under the Prime Minister's administration. My reason for holding that opinion is that, as is generally admitted here, leading members of the Government are sadly overworked. I cannot support the honourable member's views on the Commonwealth Office of Education, hecause I consider that they are retrogressive in effect. The Commonwealth Office of Education is the natural bridge by means of which we can span the gap between the weight of the educational responsibilities that lie on the States on the one side, and the Commonwealth's control of the major purse-strings of the nation on the other side. I very much regret that the only item in the proposed vote for the Prime Minister's Department that has been subject to reduction is that of the Office of Education. That seems to me to be a very unfortunate state of affairs. The Commonwealth Office of Education has done a very good job. I am glad to know that publication of the Current Affairs Bulletin may be continued. I understand that its circulation reached about 50,000, although I am not certain of the figure, which I received from the Department [51] of Education in Western Australia. It has been a most important publication for the members of the public who have been making use of it, and I hope that the Government will ensure its continued publication. The details of the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department show the strange circumstance that although the number of persons employed at the Commonwealth Office of Education has risen to 130 this year compared with 126 last year the estimated expenditure on salaries is considerably below actual expenditure last year. In 1950-51, £117,982 was expended under this heading, but the estimate for the current year is only £105,000, although apparently the staff of the office has been increased by at least four employees. I should like to have an explanation of this reduction. Even the ordinary incidental expenses of the office are, apparently, being sadly reduced. For instance, the estimate for "" postage, telegrams and telephone services"" is £4,700, compared with an actual expenditure of £10,212 last year. It is unfortunate that the work of what is left of this valuable department is to be crippled by this reduction of ordinary expenditure. While it is true that this year's estimate of £8,S00 under the heading ""United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization-Expenses"" is considerably more than the actual expenditure last year, it is £2,600 less than the estimate for 1950-51. Estimated expenditure on "" General educational and cultural activities "" is £5,000, compared with last year's estimate of £13,000, and actual expenditure of £5,833. Here again, higher salaries and increased administrative costs surely should warrant a substantially greater vote for this important work. Expenditure on ""Research projects "" is being reduced to considerably less than last year's estimate, and the estimate for "" teaching aids ""' is £3,000 compared with £4,400 in 1950-51. It seems to me that the Government is moving in quite the wrong direction. When the Office of Education was established most honourable members, I am sure, felt that a move would be made to place education in this country on a sounder basis than it had been up to that",48,Departme Nt Of The Treasury
179,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [8.58],"time. Most people hoped for a decentralized administration, and for more liberal Commonwealth financial assistance to the States. It is regrettable that the Government is scaling down the activities of this organization which is engaged on most important work. [9.2 j included in the vote for the Department of External Affairs, is the sum of £149,000 for Antarctic exploration. I have also noted with pleasure the proposal that Captain P. G. Taylor, one of our most distinguished airmen, should make a t r ip to the Antarctic in a flying-boat. We hold a good but not indefeasible title to the major portion of the Antarctic continent. It is important that we should improve that title and that, as soon as possible, we should undertake permanent occupation of our Antarctic territory. We may be asked, "" Is not the whole of the Antarctic quite valueless?"" It may be, but it is only 300 years or so since the Dutch who knew Australia, ; wrote it off as entirely valueless; it is only 100 years since Russia sold for a nominal sum its rights in Alaska to the United States of America, and since the statesmen who made the purchase were criticized for having added that arctic "" icebox "" to their country. It is only a little more than 50 years since there was a tendency to write off New Guinea as being entirely without value. Only through the energetic action of an Australian was even a portion of that island preserved for us. Therefore I do not think that we should adopt the view that the Antarctic is necessarily valueless. What are its potential values? At present they are mainly speculative, but they are certainly worth investigating. Whalers are already taking many millions of pounds out of the Antarctic Ocean. That enterprise, in which Australia has no share, it is not merely speculative. It s value has been proved beyond doubt, although it may be argued that occupation of the Antarctic continent would not help us much in that connection. I point out to the committee what the whales have long known that the seas around Antarctica are the richest source of animal lif e in the entire globe. It is probable that those seas are the greatest sources of animal protein in the world. Their wealth cannot be exploited at present, but it is worth investigation. The existence of animal life in those waters is due to convection currents which bring up sediment from the floor of the Antarctic ocean and to the long hours of summer sunlight in those regions. I notice with pleasure that, Occupation of a permanent station in Antarctica would, I believe, help long range weather forecasting materially. It is probable that our climate is determined by the position of the line where the warm waters of the northern oceans go over the top of the colder waters of the Antarctic Ocean. The position of that distinct line of demarcation sometimes changes by as much as 300 or 400 miles. Those shifts may, in some measure, determine the upward and downward movement of the rain systems on the Australian continent. It is indisputable also that although geological exploration of this ice-capped continent would be difficult, it contains mineral deposits worthy of investigation. Perhaps, too, with the development of our atomic research, we shall need experimental or production areas, remote from population centres, where the various processes can be carried out without undue danger of radiological contamination. Eor that purpose, the Antarctic continent may well be ideal. There are other points too. The use of Antarctic territory for airline bases may be a remote possibility because of the geography of the southern hemisphere. The area may have some attraction for tourists although, because of the severe winds, that does not seem likely. However, quite apart from those things, there are various avenues of purely scientific research that may be followed. Such research, in addition to being of considerable value in itself, has a secondary value in that it can be of great assistance in. meteorological and otber observations to which I have referred. There is also a need for a ring of seismic stations all over the world in order that we may understand the movements of the earth's crust. A t present the Antarctic continent is the main gap in that ring. The study of cosmic rays and solar discharges is obviously something that should be pursued near to the magnetic poles where there are opportunities not elsewhere available to observe such pheno-",49,Departme Nt Of The Treasury
180,Mr Wentwoeth (Mackellar),"niena. The phenomena of terrestial magnetism are in some aspects best studied close to the magnetic poles. GeologyI have mentioned. In connection with geodesy, the determination of the exact figure of the earth will be incomplete until we have better observations on the Antarctic continent. Lastly, the study of glaciation and the advance and recession of the ice over the earth-of long range importance, but nevertheless it is important-require s ice-cap observations on the Antarctic continent to supplement observations in other parts of the world. Therefore, both for reasons of economic value, which are speculative but cannot be dismissed out of hand, and for reasons of scientific value, which are not speculative and which cannot be dismissed at all, the Government should be actively engaged in setting up permanent stations in the Antarctic. There are also military considerations which may be real or unreal but which are worth considering. The establishment of a proper, permanent station will require some 750 tons of stores with perhaps 200 tons a year to maintain the station. I think it is possible to take these in by air but it may be that to use an airlift of the necessary magnitude, except as a military exercise, would be beyond economic possibilities. Therefore, the Government should consider using a vessel to penetrate the ice pack and land the initial equipment and stores, and then the station could be serviced and the personnel changed by air. As honourable members are probably aware, the ice pack around the Antarctic usually moves out during the summer leaving a lane of clear water between the ice pack outside and the ice barrier inside, an area where a sea-plane could readily land. It is with much pleasure that I support the proposal to send Captain Taylor to the Antarctic because I believe that not only will he find a way of establishing a permanent base but also that he will find a way of servicing it once it has been established. AlthoughI believe that the Government should press on with the acquisition of at least one vessel capable of penetrating the ice pack in the summer, I think it is fantastic to ( Mr Bland). He belongs to an older consider the building of such a vessel generation and is exceedingly jealous of in Australia. That is a specialized job. It can be done overseas by shipyards which are contemplating building a number of these vessels for operation in the northern hemisphere including the area to the north of Siberia. The building of such a vessel in Australia might involve an unwarranted diversion of resources and would certainly cause delay. But American or Canadian shipyards could build such a vessel as part of the mass production programme that they have already envisaged. Therefore, I consider that the Government should abandon any proposal to build an Antarctic vessel in Australia and with the least possible delay, obtain an overseas ship. regret to see that of all the items published in the Estimates under the heading of the Prime Minister's Department the only one that it is proposed should suffer a reduction in expenditure i ^ the Oflice of Education. This is a strange state of affairs. This is a growing nation and there is a need for a coordination and correlation of State educational facilities. There is a need for a compilation of information to be made available to other peoples of the world who are interested in educational research. One can only conclude that the proposed cut in expenditure must be made at the expense of the welfare of the great bulk of the people of Australianot only the younger generation but the adults to whom the Office of Education has rendered a very valuable service. Its publications and its works generally are of a very high standard. State educational authorities, State school teachers, registered school teachers, technical teachers and secondary school teachers have expressed a very high appreciation of the work of this authority. I have never met an officer in any field of State education who has shown any resentment at the scope of the work of the Office of Education. I can quite understand the attitude of the honourable member for Warringah State educational functions. While the",50,Departme Nt Of The Treasury
181,Mr Pollakd (Lalor) [9.15],"IConstitution continues to permit a division of autliority in respect of various matters between tbe States and the Commonwealth, I consider that tliere should be no actual duplication of activities, but that some body should knit up the loose ends and correlate the information that may be available from State authorities in regard to such matters as education, agriculture and re-afforestation. I understand that the Prime Minister( Mr the right honourable gentleman apologize Menzies) himself has been an educationalist and it is regrettable that he, through his Treasurer, should bs responsible for a reduction of no less than £66,000 in the vote for the Office of Education. Last year £117,9S2 was expended on salaries and allowances for permanent officers, but this year the vote is only £105,000. It would appear that there has been a diminution in the permanent staff or in the general expenses of the permanent staff. It is also proposed that expenditure on Minister) [9.21] I shall take only temporary and casual employees shall be reduced from £106,31 S to £64,.000. The dismissal of the temporary and casual staff of the Office of Education can result only in the effectiveness of the permanent staff being seriously affected. I regret that this is the case. I understand that some of the steps taken, from sheer necessity, by the Office of Education in order to save nioney, have been of a very questionable character. I believe that certain casual employees were told that they had been dismissed in accordance with the policy of the Commonwealth Government but that if they applied for re-engagement they would be re-employed at a reduced salary. regard that as a parsimonious, mean and contemptible state of affairs. Tha Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) may laugh, but if he were told that, as part ancl parcel of the attempt of the Government to cure inflation, he would be sacked and re-engaged at half his salary he would be very cross. That is what the Government has clone to the weaker section of the community. If the right honourable gentleman wants particulars of what is happening I shall provide them.

It is regrettable that this reduction has taken place in respect of such an important matter as education. I hope, even at this late hour, that something will be done to continue the full scope of the work of this very valuable Commonwealth instrumentality. enough time to correct a few errors of the honourable meinber for Lalor( Mr Pollard). The debate about the Office of Education was begun by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) saying that the proposed vote for this year ought to be less; but now it looks as if it ought to be more. The honourable member for Lalor, walking in somewhat unaccustomed paths, has said that if tliere is one thing that matters in this country it is that the Office of Education should be built up, and built np, and built up I Because the proposed vote is less than was the expenditure in. 1950-51, he is now asking the people of Australia to I believe that this Government has no interest in education, that it is the enemy of the improvement of public instruction. The answer to that contention is very simple indeed. The proposed vote is less than was expenditure during the previous financial years because the Government believes that certain activities ought no longer to overlap. The number of employees of the Office of Education referred to in the Estimates is a little extravagant; it is the number that were actually employed when the Estimates were prepared.

We came to the conclusion that the Commonwealth ought not to be doing what the States could do. Of course, if some honourable mcmbers opposite want us to duplicate what the States arc doing, they should say so. If that is their idea of efficient administration, let them say so. But, as I have previously indicated to the committee, we decided that where ever there were overlapping functions we would endeavour to secure some removal of the overlapping. The whole burden of what the honourable meinber for Lalor had to say was that we were cutting down on the Commonwealtli facilities for education. In point of fact, this Government is providing the greatest sum of money that has ever been provided for education in the history of the Commonwealth. It is doing that because it believes in educarespect of whom the Commonwealth contion; it does not believe just in talking about it, but in doing things about it. Under Division No. 181-Commonwealth grants to universities-thi s Government is providing, for the first time in the history of Australia, for a Commonwealth grant to the State universities. The proposed vote for that purpose is £1,496,000. opposite are arguing about the Government cutting the overlapping in scholarship administration by varying the employment of some of the employees of the Office of Education. They say nothing about the fact that this Government-the first government in the history of Australia to do it-intends , in this financial year, to grant almost £1,500,000 to the universities of the States. They say nothing whatever about the fact that, in addition, the Government intends, during this financial year, to provide £709,200 to implement the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. Until a few years ago the Commonwealth did not make any contribution to education. that this Government inherited from the former Labour Government. gation, and expenditure has now reached a colossal sum. me to agree, I agree at once that the former Labour Government introduced the scholarship system. But we have had the privilege of providing £709,200 to put it into operation. If he wants to discuss it on that low level, let me tell him that the former Government, of which he was a supporter, never for a moment thought of subsidizing the State universities. We have not only thought of it, but, in this year, will grant them almost £1,500,000. If honourable members opposite put up these red herrings, they must be prepared to have them caught and dealt with. They apparently have in mind that, as a part of the post-war arrangements, the former Labour Government provided moneys to the universities in respect of national service reconstruction trainees. That is perfectly true. But that was a payment for persons in sidered that it had a specific obligation. The total cost was a mere fraction of the cost of what we have done, which is not related to particular persons in respect of whom the Commonwealth has obligations. Our scheme is designed to put every Australian university in a position of solvency. This will be the most dramatic contribution that has ever been Yet honourable members made by the Commonwealtli in my lifetime to public education in Australia. is down! men opposite will tell us, now that they have been thoroughly warmed up and reminded of one or two things, that they started the Australian National University.

207,Mr Keon,"I intend to do that, Mrbeen a member of the Parliament I have tried to ascertain how, when, where and why the decisions are made which relate to the sterling bloc and the financial policy of this country. Asf a r as I can gather there is a nebulous body called tbe Sterling Area Statistics Conimittee, which was set up in Londoni n 1947. Associated with that organization is a Commonwealth liaison committee. It is impossible to discover any body in which Australia has a clear-cut representation and a definite say in all decisions. Today, fundamental decisions which affect every aspect of our economy are being made overseas by informal statistical committees and consultative committees upon which Australia is not officially represented. matter of whether or not we should be attached our whole future depends on financial decisions which w ill be made in London during the next few months. The last Labour Government leaned a little towards the British Labour Government, which of course was faced with tremendous problems, but it is always desirable to have a Labour government in Great Britain because previous Australian tory governments have not paid particular attention to Australia's interests when there was a tory government in Conservative party has assumed office in Great Brita in I am afraid that Australia's interests will not receive the consideration to which they are entitled in the general moulding of financial policy and other matters with which our future is bound up with that of Great Britain. Everybody knows that the British currency was devalued in the absence of adequate consultation with Australia. Sir by a British Labour government. doubtedly it is to the advantage of the British Government, irrespective of its political complexion, to be able to make such financial decisions without consultation w it h Australia. The honourable member is out of order in making his present remarks. He must deal with the departments being considered by the committee. about which I am speaking has some relationship with the Prime Minister's Department and the Department of the Treasury. In order that our interests may be f u l l y considered, such far-reaching financial decisions should not be made without adequate consultation with Australia. I realize, of course, that irrespective of the cost to us we must help to keep Great Britain stable. Even if we do not want to do it, from sheer necessity we must do it . Buti t must be done in a manner that will not disrupt the Australian economy. Two eminent economists have recently propounded their views on this matter. One is Sir Douglas Copland, with whom I do This is not a not always agree, and the other is the brilliant Queensland Government econoto the sterling bloc; mist, Mr Colin Clark. They both have indicated that Australia w ill have to sell its goods in the dollar market sooner or later and that it may as well do it befora our economy is ruined. They both have put forward cogent facts in support of their arguments. Our primary economy is at present in the position where one product is sold at the very highest price on dollar markets and the rest are sold in the sterling area under long-term contracts. This situation is forcing labour, materials and land into one channel, and Great Britain. Now that the it would be better for Australia, having in mind the necessity to increase the production of our agricultural products, to make a free g if t of a large sum of money to Great Brita in rather than to continue as we are.

The position to-day is that Great Britain has an adverse trade balance of more than £800,000,000. In other words, the banker of the sterling bloc is not in a position to honour cheques that might be presented to it. I suggest that instead of concluding firm contracts and tying the Australian economy to such contracts it would be far better for Australia openly to acknowledge its debt to Great Britain and, if necessary, to pay it by means of a free gift, in order to assist that country to maintain its position. Because contracts are made with the United Kingdom Government, Australian products, which might be soid on the dollar markets at greatly enhanced prices, must he sold to the United Kingdom at prices which are frequently far too low. has been a change of Government in the United Kingdom, the honourable gentleman wishes to cut the painter. the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has become since Mr Churchill resumed office. I trust that the right honourable gentleman will consider the matters that I have mentioned, because the United Kingdom will not be assisted if Australian primary production continues to decline at the present rate. honourable gentleman should leave remarks such as those to discussion of the proposed vote of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. Minister should take steps to ensure that the financial policy of this Government will be made the subject of a full report to the Parliament, so that it may be adequately debated. Somehow or other, the rural interests of Australia are usually forgotten when contracts are made with the United Kingdom. country which is expected to make all of the sacrifices. Instead of the nebulous, unofficial discussions which take place concerning our currency and our attachment to the sterling bloc, I suggest that there should be a properly constituted body to which formal delegations might be sent. Those delegations should be backed by the decisions of the Australian Parliament, reached after full debate, concerning the financial policy .which the Government desires to pursue. I shall listen intently during the next few months to the members of the Australian Country party as they discuss the long-term contracts with the United Kingdom and the prices that Australian primary producers are to receive for their meat, butter and other products. I hope to have an opportunity to discuss that matter when the proposed vote for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is being considered. I wish to make it clear that I consider that Australian interests should be fully and adequately represented at international conferences, whether their purpose is to deal with the allocation of raw materials, financial and currency problems, or any other matter. I trust that this Government will not permit the country's interests to be neglected when such vital problems ai-e being discussed overseas. not support the arguments of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), who spoke for about a quarter of an hour of an hoar.

220,Mr Ryan,"It seemed like a quarteroperations of the Australian Loan Council. However, there are one or two matters which are worrying many people in this country to-day. Unfortunately, a certain lack of confidence in Commonwealth loans has developed, both as to the security provided and the return offered. It is a remarkable fact that only a negative rata of interest is paid by Commonwealth loans to-day. A loan investment accumulates at the present interest rate of £3 los. a year, although its purchasing power is decreasing each year by more than that amount because of rising prices. To-day it pays people to borrow at fixed interest rates, if they can find persons who are willing to lend, because it certainly does not pay to lend money. Such a state of affairs is both irrational and inflationary. Unless something is done to halt the developing lack of confidence in Commonwealth loans it will continue to develop at an even more rapid rate. 1 suggest to the Treasurer that when loans are floated at higher interest rates than those that previously obtained, either investments in previous loans should bear the higher rate of interest or the investors in previous loans should he permitted to subscribe stock or cash to the new loans. I put that proposal to the right honourable gentleman some time ago. and I received a reply which indicated that it is impossible to increase rates of interest payable on Australian securities to bring them into the line with recent rates. He explained that if that were done the increased loan burden of the country would be approximately £10,000,000 a year. I suggest, however, that that burden may have to be borne. Although our loan indebtedness has more than doubled since World War II . began, the interest burden has decreased from 5.5 per cent, of our national income, as it was in 1940, to 3.8 per cent, of the national income in 1950. In the United Kingdom at the beginning of World War [., subscribers to previous loans were given the privilege of subscribing cash or stock to new loans which carried a higher rate of interest. The following course may, perhaps, be of more interest to the Treasurer. I suggest that an issue should be made of short-dated bonds that would be non-interest bearing but redeemable at par plus adjustments in accordance with fluctuations in the cost of living. Under such a plan the capital value of investments would be safeguarded, regardless of changing circumstances. Thus, the savings of investors would be secured in these uncertain times. I believe that such a plan would be successful. If the bonds were issued in small denominations they would be attractive to the small man for whom no small savings media that offer an opportunity to hedge against rising prices are now available. Sucb a plan would encourage saving and thus be deflationary in character. It has been tried in other countries. there was a fall in the cost of living? receive any payment by way of interest. for his investment if he did not receive interest? investment would be secured, and that would be of advantage particularly to the small man whose savings otherwise would depreciate. the result under such a plan in respect of an investment of £100 during the last two years? but possibly the investment would now be worth £120. represent a phenomenal rate of interest. paid to investors, but their capital would be conserved. That form of loan bas already been , issued in Canada and in other countries and it has proved successful in attracting investments because it safeguards the capital of investors. The third possible course that I have in mind has been partly tried in the past. It is that interest up to an amount of, say, £50 on investments in new loans should be exempt from income tax. That plan would attract the savings of the small man which is the money that the Government should wish to attract. It would be helpful to investors and to the country as a whole.

The Prime Minister( Mr. Menzies) may seek to take credit for th.i fact that more than £SOO,000 has been earmarked for expenditure on prices control in 1951-52; but the Government, in asking the Parliament to vote that sum, is not consistent, because it regards prices control as wastef u l and futile.

Yet State Ministers who last week, complained that this Government would not assist them in their most difficult task, even by appointing a Minister to sit in conference with them. may not be aware of it , they are sovereign States, which have great responsibilities and heavy commitments. object of my interjection was to ascertain this Government is clearly to write down the importance of the States.

Prices control is definitely a Commonwealth responsibility, hut this Government will not accept it. The terms of the motion that was carried by the State Ministers last week were as follows:That the Federal Government be onee again approached to assume the responsibility for prices control. Yet this Government calmly washes its hands of the whole matter. trifling matter as checking rising prices is not, worthy of its consideration. But this Government is so lacking in responsibility to the people, and so careless of the expenditure of public money, that it has made available more than £800,000 to continue the system of prices control during the current financial year. The Opposition believes that prices control, as it exists at the present time, is a burden that the States cannot bear alone. They must receive from the Commonwealth a considerable measure assistance. The minimum requirement is the appointment of a Commonwealth Minister to attend their meetings in order to gain an appreciation of the difficulties with which the States are confronted in administering prices control, and which are daily complicating their task. But the Government says, "" We shall not appoint a Minister for that purpose. The control of prices is not a Commonwealth responsibility. referendum in 1948, declined to vest prices control in the Of course, Ministers do not point out that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party refused to support that referendum three years ago, when the Labour party urged that prices could be controlled more effectively authority than by six authorities. Labour and Liberal Premiers alike are now disillusioned about prices control. This Government alone refuses to accept the fact that the States are unable to control rapidly rising prices. For some time, the States asked tbe Commonwealth for assistance in that matter. Now, they demand it. The Government, which has budgeted for a surplus of £114,500,000, replies, "" We shall dole out to you an Mr Tom Burke. amount of £S19,000 for the purposes of prices control, and we propose to expend £20,000 on the same matter; but we do not believe in prices control, and shall not help you in any way. In our opinion, prices control is farcical"". The Government is recreant to its trust, but eventually it will be forced to act. Eapidly increasing prices are disorganizing State government finance, university finances, and industrial operations. The people of Australia are demanding that this Government accept its proper responsibility. It should say to the State governments: Such a "" We realize that inflation is getting out of hand. Therefore, we shall take over prices control if you will refer to us thp necessary power "". not refer fhe power to us. tives announced only a few days ago that they would be prepared to refer the necessary power to the Commonwealth. Not long ago, a Gallup poll indicated that SO per cent, of the people of Australia of active were in favour of Commonwealth control of prices. Therefore, the Government no longer has an excuse for failing to act. ports are flowing into Australia at an alarming and ever-increasing rate, and our adverse trade balance overseas is becoming greater and greater. We are bringing to Australia a large number of people from other countries. We are also bringing here from overseas large quanThe people, at a tities of goods that could be very well manufactured here. Some people soCommonwealth''. little understand the problem of inflation that they believe that the cure for inflation and high prices is to allow goods from overseas to enter Australia almost unimpeded. It is against the interest? of Australian manufacturers and of their by one employees to allow our adverse trade balance to continue to grow. One reason for the present situation is that the Tariff Board and the Department of Trade and Customs do not act promptly enough to protect Australian industry. In my electorate, there is a factory which manufactures furniture drapings,. and which used to employ about 100 persons under excellent conditions. Eecently, because of the competition of imported fabrics from Italy, Belgium and Japan, the",59,Department Of Health

Even if it were prepared to dispense with profit altogether, it vvould still not be able to compete successfully against the overseas manufacturers. T do not say that the tariff should be used to protect exploiters, but it should be used to protect legitimate Australian industries against competition from countries where employees work more hours a day for less pay than.do our Australian workers. agencies in Australia have been making immense profit, ranging from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent., some people believe that goods should be admitted freely from overseas in order to keep down prices. Tf that were permitted, many Australian industries, both new and old, would be destroyed, and it would not be an easy matter to re-establish them in a time of national emergency. Because our population is increasing so rapidly, it is important that we should manufacture in Australia as large a proportion as possible of the goods we need. Australia should be something more than merely a primary producing country. Primary production cannot support a large population. Therefore, it is essential that we foster our secondary industries, and protect them against unfair competition from overseas. WhilstI favour adequate tariff protection, I believe that we should have in conjunction with it a system of prices control in order to protect the consumers from exploitation. The textile firm to which I previously referred applied to the Tariff Board for increased protection, and the board, after hearing evidence, reserved its decision. No decision has yet been announced, and in the meantime overseas competition has become so severe that the firm has had to dismiss about half its staff. If the board is not satisfied with the way in which the firm is conducting its business, it should say so. It should not hold up its repor.t indefinitely. In my opinion, the industry should be given increased protection. It is urgently necessary that our Australian industries shall be protected from rapidly growing and unfair competition from other countries. .for Health) [10.20] -The honourable are not being neglected, and 3,000 member for Burke( Mr Peters) should remember that it was a Labour government that made Australia a member of the International Trade Organization and ratified the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is pre-"""" ""ting 1 this Government from increasing its tariff charges in order to protect Australian industries. However, if he will state the case on behalf of the industry that he has mentioned, to t.he Minister for Trade ancl Customs (Senator O'Sullivan), Because some distributing I am sure that he will be granted a very sympathetic hearing. withdraw from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradei f it wanted to do so. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) did not vote on the bill to authorize the ratification of the agreement. He ran away from the issue when it was raised by the Labour Government, and he does not know very much about it now. My main purpose in speaking at this stage is to describe the progress that has been made with the health scheme that has been in operation for the last eighteen months and to correct some of the misstatements that have been made about it. During the last general election campaign, Senator McKenna went round the country telling the people that at that time not a pint of milk had been paid for by the Government. That was absolutely false. Five States are co-operating with the Government at present in the supply of milk to school children. Three hundred thousand children in New South Wales, where the scheme has been in operation since early in this year, and 150,000 children in Victoria, are receiving milk daily. In South Australia, 3S,000 children are already benefiting, even though the scheme began to operate there only on the ISth September because of the necessity to wait for the increased milk yield during the winter season. In Western Australia, where distribution began on the 30th July, 40,000 children are receiving milk. In Tasmania, which entered the scheme on the l l t h September, 33,000 children are supplied with milk. Children in Commonwealth Territories",60,Department Of Health

255,Mr Wakd,This Government could,61,Department Of Health
256,Sir Eaele Page,"That is not so.children in the Australian Capital Territory are being supplied with milk. Arrangements have been made to provide milk under the scheme in the Northern Territory wherever supplies can be obtained. The only State that has remained aloof from the scheme is Queensland. It is a dairying State, and one can scarcely understand the reluctance of its Government to co-operate in this remarkable project to help the nutrition of children. Sir John Boyd Orr proved very conclusively in the United Kingdom that the distribution of milk to children is of great value. Notwithstanding the fact that housing conditions generally were of a very low standard in England during World War II . as a result of bombing, children of from ten to twelve years of age at the end of the war were 2 inches taller and 2 or 3 lb. heavier than children of similar ages had been prior to the war. That proved the great value of a regular supply of milk to young children. This Government is emulating the British experiment because it wants to develop healthy, well-fed children, who will grow to adulthood with a minimum of sickness. Great progress has been made with the plan for the free supply of life-saving drugs. In June, 1951, a total of 465,000 prescriptions for such drugs were made available to the people of Australia. That represented a rate of approximately 5,000,000 prescription a year, out of between SfiOOfiOO and 9,000,000 prescriptions issued annually for all purposes. About half the total number of prescriptions dispensed in Australia to-day are for when a Labour government made use of free life-saving drugs. Those prescriptions are much more costly than ordinary prescriptions. The average cost is about 18s., whereas ordinary medicines cost from 4s. to 5s. for each prescription. Thus, although the number of prescriptions for free drugs represents about half the total number of prescriptions dispensed, the relief to the people of Australia represents about 10s. a year for every man, woman and child. effect respects has already been very pronounced. These drugs have such a beneficial effect in the treatment of serious illnesses that the average length of time spent in hospitals by patients has been considerably shortened. The reduction of Sir Earle Page. the duration of sicknesses and of the medical attention required has had a very marked effect upon the costs to which patients are subjected. I venture to say that the overall value of the scheme has been about four times the value of the free drugs that have been dispensed. Much suffering has been prevented and many lives have been saved. I am glad to take advantage of this opportunity to refer to the provision of free medical treatment and free medicines for pensioners in some other way than in the form of answers to questions, which, as a rule, deal only with specific cases. This service has been very valuable. Chairman. As you know, the period allotted for the consideration of the Estimates is severely limited. The Minister is entitled to answer criticism, but nobody has criticized the schemes to which he is referring. Therefore, I suggest that he is out of order. I point out also that the usages of the Parliament would be better served if the right honourable gentleman were to make a statement on this subject by leave of thp House to-morrow. honorahle member knows that there is no point of order.

However, they were dealt with at the general election when the people clearly demonstrated their approval of this Government's policy. About 600,000 pensioners and their dependants benefit from the scheme under which they can obtain free medical attention and free medicine and it is their right to be informed, by means of the parliamentary broadcasts and newspaper reports, of the nature of this scheme. A complete statement on the subject is much more important than would be any imaginary grievance that the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) might wish to voice on a single issue. This mattei' affects between 600,000 and 700,000 members of our community. The entire population, of course, is interested in free medicine. The people are entitled to a statement on the subject. ing for a long time to hear such a statement. the honourable member is hearing it , he keeps on raising points of order. Since the free medical service for pensioners began in February of this year, no less than 6S8,000 services have been provided by the doctors of Australia. An attempt has been made to convey the i m pression that the doctors w ill not operate one service has been given to each pensioner in Australia and as there is not more than 10 per cent, of any class sick at any time, it is obvious that an enormous service has been rendered. Three-quarI t is interesting ters of the general practitioners of Australia have volunteered to give these concessional services to the old-age pensioners. Since free medicine has been available in September, 128,000 prescriptions have been dispensed free. That is at the rate I tried to make of 1,250,000 a year. The total number of prescriptions dispensed in Australia is roughly 9,000,000. That is to say, 700,000 pensioners and their dependants, who at present represent from one-twelth N b t on the subject of to one-thirteenth of the population, are being provided with practically one-sixth of the total number of prescriptions dispensed throughout Australia. That does not indicate a lack of desire by the medical profession, by chemists or by the pensioners themselves to avail themselves ol this service. This is the appropriate time, when I am making a. considered statement, to put these facts before the public of Australia. The Government is trying to stamp oui tuberculosis. The previous Government brought down a measure which I supported because I regarded it as comprehensive, but that Government went out of office before it could implement its proposals. Since this Government has been in office I have tried to .aret the utmost value from this measure. Not much could be done until I had brought, down the tuberculosis allowance, the rate of which has been increased by £1 los. for a man and wife in the budget for this year. Minister's predecessor. Sir EARLEPAGE It was not. If the honourable member reads the files he w ill learn that the Labour party offered less than half the amount the recipients are getting at the present time. The Labour party's offer to tubercular pensioners was so miserable that I would not accept it , but insisteci on making certain that the pension given and the amount that could be earned would together be well above the basic wage. This was to ensure that any person who was infectiously affected with tuberculosis should get enough money to remove from his this system. More than family all economic worries and enable him to leave his work. As a result, many concealed cases who had remained ai work, offered themselves for examination.

The total reimbursements, including capital expenditure, total approximately £2,000,000. Every request made by the States for capital expenditure for housing tuberculosis patients has been met promptly. Every request for maintenance has been met also. Only to-day I was able to savt the Princess Juliana Hospital in North Sydney for the treatment of tuberculosis in association with the Royal North Shore Hospital, which I hope to see made a chest hospital with a thoracic surgery centre that will be available to the whole of Australia and not solely to New South ""Wales. These are the things which honourable members opposite do not want to see done. They break their hearts politically. They say, "" Do not say a word about it. Keep mum ahout these things. We will make insinuations in the Parliament itself, but we do not want, a definite statement made "". Honourable members have asked me repeatedly to make a statement on my visit overseas at the first opportunity and istration expenses, honourable members 1 shall make some reference to it now. In the United States of America, and in Canada the responsible authorities have maintained a voluntary system of contrioutions and have developed a big system of voluntary insurance such as we have in thc contributions fund that was started in New South Wales and has spread throughout Australia. Over 90 per cent, of the total cost of running hospitals in the United States of America was met from income derived from patients and more than half of that amount was from insurance. On the Atlantic seaboard, over SO 'per cent, of the income came from voluntary insurance and in Detroit, a great industrial city, 75 per cent, was derived from that source. If a system of that kind could be developed in Australia, we should not only bc able to give an assurance to the hospitals that they fiir Earle rage. would have the revenue they needed, but also would have a great deal more money at our disposal with which to provide the extra hospital beds that are so badly required in Australia. Nothing has been trouble. Shortage of materials is the problem, is it not? materials are scarce. Funds are required not only for immediate needs but also to carry on in the future. Some security is necessary because that will improve the status and conditions of nurses as well as the general treatment in the hospitals. LaterI shall make a full statement regarding the position in America. An honourable member laughs. He does not care about the health of this country. He is thinking only of the party political advantage he may get by talking. If honourable members opposite care for the people, why did they not do something about finance while in officcand provide an allowance for sufferers from tuberculosis? The Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) lives under the influence of a spirit of complacency regarding the benefits which, according to him, flow from his health services. If an expenditure of £864,000 is involved, of which over £700,000 is for health services and adminhave the duty of ensuring that some degree of efficiency accompany that expenditure. The Minister for Health has told us again and again that approximately three-quarters of the medical practitioners in this country are participating in the pensioners' health scheme. That is a very broad statement. There are approximately 30 doctors in Ballarat, but only two of them are willing to treat pensioners under the scheme. There are doctors practising in centres such as Meredith, Clunes, Creswick and other small towns in the vicinity of Ballarat, that are particularly suitable for old people to spend their last days in, but none of them is participating in the scheme. Therefore, pensioners who live in those places have to make a long -journey to Ballarat to consult the two doctors there wbo are participating",63,Department Of Health

271,Mr Joshua (Ballarat) [10.39],"in the. scheme. I do not believe that the pensioners' health scheme is working efficiently. It needs to be investigated thoroughly. If a huge sum of money is to be expended upon it , more is required from the Ministerf or Health than assurances that it is working wonderfully well. The Minister has told us that the scheme under which life-saving drugs are provided free of charge is of great benent to the community. Probablyi t is of some benefit. The Opposition would not object to the expenditure of this huge sum, or even a larger sum, upon the health scheme if it could be sure that the money would be expended for the benefit of the people. upon that achievement. The Australian The Government parties have decried form-filling and they would have nothing to do with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme that was prepared by a previous government because, they said, it would involve much form-filling. I ask the Minister to examine the present pharmaceutical benefits scheme, not on the surface, as he has been content to do in the past, but in consultation with the pharmacists. He has told us that, under the scheme, probably more than 1,250,000 prescriptions will be dispensed each year. The task of assessing those prescriptions will f a l l upon the pharmacists of this country. The chemist in charge of a busy pharmacy told me some time ago that he had to employ a pharmacist at a wage of £12 12s. a week-it is probably more than that now-to assess prescriptions. In order to supply the people with free drugs under a scheme that the Minister has told us is very successful, he has to hear that expense. There are some methods that could be adopted for the provision of drugs free of charge that would work quite well and would avoid pharmacists being involved in considerable expense. Those methods might involve some form-filling, but I remind the Minister that one cannot send a telegram without filling in a form . There is nothing wrong with form-filling. Indeed, it has been resorted to under this scheme to a considerable degree. If the Ministry of Health used more energy and imagination, the scheme would be considerably more efficient than it is now. for Health) [10.44] -Apparentl y the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr. Joshua) knows nothing about this subject. The present arrangements for the dispensing of medicines and the payment of chemists were agreed to by the chemists in consultation with the Chief Pharmacist. The arrangements are working so smoothly that within a fortnight of the end of each month chemists have in their hands cheques in payment for what they have done under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. They regard that as a most wonderful achievement. The Australasian Guild of Pharmacists, at a meeting in Brisbane last May that it had asked me to address, laid great stress pharmacists told their New Zealand colleagues that the scheme, because of its simplicity and the smoothness of its operation, was the most wonderful of its kind in the world. W it h regard to pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners, the pharmacists, in conjunction with the doctors, prepared a prescribers' list of drugs, which, together with the list of life-saving drugs that can be supplied free of charge, covers approximately 95 per cent, of the prescriptions that are dispensed. The chemists are being paid also within two or three weeks of the end of each month for the medicines and drugs they supply to pensioners. Every day 1 receive letters from chemists throughout Australia congratulating me upon the manner in which this scheme has been handled. The chemists say that it has exceeded their expectations. When the Labour party was.in office there was in operation a scheme under which medicine* were supplied free of charge to person' who were entitled to the benefits of the repatriation legislation. TJnder that scheme, six or seven months elapsed before chemists were paid for prescriptions that they had dispensed. The chemists were afraid that something of that kind would happen under the present scheme, but they have been most pleasantly undeceived. I assure the honourable member for Ballarat that if a chemist can afford to pay £12 12s. a week to a pharmacist to do the work that he has described, that chemist must be doing well out of the scheme.",64,Department Of Health

Although the factory labour force in Australia now numbers SS9,000 persons, or an increase of 347,000 compared with the force available in 193S-39, Mr Colin Clark, the director of the Queensland Bureau of Industry, has said that having regard to the average production per man-hour of those engaged in manufacturing industries, it is doubtful whether its effectiveness has increased over the 193S-39 level which, in turn, was approximately the same as the level of 1.928-29. what item of the Estimates the honourable member is addressing the committee. the subject of prices, which was referred to by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke). the only item in the Estimates upon which the honourable member may base a speech in relation to prices control is the proposed vote for the Department of Trade ancl Customs, which administers prices control in the Australian Capital Territory. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) is well aware that he has not raised a point of order. problem of inflation lies solely in in creased production, yet not one member of the Opposition has dealt with that aspect of the problem during the debate on the Estimates.

Mr Curtin thereupon withdrew from the chamber. That the ruling be dissented from. The ruling to which I take objection is, that the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) was guilty of gross disorder. Acting on that assumption, the Chairman exercised the power contained in Standing Order 303 and ordered the honourable member to withdraw from the chamber. adopted during the last Parliament. It empowers the Speaker to order the withdrawal of an honourable member summarily if and when he has been guilty honourable member may not debate this matter. says that a motion of dissent from a ruling of the Chair shall be put, but it does not say that it shall be put without discussion. Order 279 reads as follows:If any objection is taken to a ruling of the Chairman of Committees, such objection shall be stated at once in writing, and shall be forthwith decided by thc committee; and the proceedings shall then be resumed where they were interrupted. the words "" forthwith decided"" mean that no other business shall be conducted until that motion has been disposed of. No other interpretation can reasonably be put on their meaning. Standing Order 303 empowers Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees to order the withdrawal of an honourable member for gross disorder. That is the second means that is provided by whicli an honourable member who has been disorderly can be dealt with. Standing Order 301 provides that an honourable member may be removed from the chamber by a vote of the House if he has been guilty of disobedience of the Chair, or for any othsr sufficient reason. That standing order was designed to deal with conduct which The amounts to .disorder, or disobedience of the Chair in general. Standing Order 303, however, goes further and provides as follows:The Speaker or the Chairman shall order a Member whose conduct is grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the House during the remainder of that day's sitting : Those two standing orders deal with different kinds of disorder. The first is a less serious kind of disorder which can arise in a number of ways, whilst the second is grossly disorderly conduct, which is, naturally, an exaggerated form of disorder. It is not merely an act of disorder which is punishable by the Standing Order 303 was normal means in the power of the House. Such disorder is extreme. It is, in fact, gros3 disorder and is far greater than the less serious disorderly conduct for which the House may vote to suspend an honourable member. This The matter has been defined in May's Parliamentary Practice, which cites specific cases in which a member was ordered by the Speaker to be removed, immediately from the chamber. May, in fact, cites two specific instances. It says that a member who, after asking a question Geueral may not take a point of order on a point of order.

The matter now being discussed is not a motion, but a ruling by the Chair. The point made by the honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) is quite correct.
