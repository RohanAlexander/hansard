If , however, some persons are unable to see it in that light, I am prepared to look into the matter. come to a decision as to what action can be taken in regard to the Queensland Government's embargo on the removal of stock from that State? upon the advice of the Attorney-General, that the Inter-State movement of stock, being intimately related to export, is a matter coming within the ambit of the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, and it is therefore proposed to legislate either directly, or by regulation under the War Precautions Acts, in such a way as will prevent the State of Queensland from taking action having for its object the prohibition of the movement of stock from that State to another.

16,Mr Pigott,"Will the Prime MinBoard,.as, I understand, he has been requested to do, by practically all the farmers of Australia? the Central Wheat Board is not a matter wholly for this Parliament. It is a body extraneous to the Constitution, and arises out of an agreement between the wheat producing States and the Commonwealth. On the Board each State has a representative of its own, who is a Minister of the State, while the Commonwealth is represented by the Prime Minister or his appointee. The question of appointing a direct farmers' representative has been brought before the Board by myself. I have stated publicly that I am in favour of that representation ; but, unless, and 4 u n t i l , the constitution of the Board is altered, no such' representation can be made. It is therefore clearly a matter for the Governments of the various wheat producing States to consider. I shall take an early opportunity of bringing the question before the Wheat Board, but can hold out no hope whatever of a reversal of their decision unless the respective State Governments change their views. ter apparently finds it impossible to appoint a farmers' representative on the Central Wheat Board, can he assure the House that such a representative w ill be appointed on the Advisory Board, which advises respecting the sales, handling, and financing of the crop? tatives of the various farmers' associations asked for at the Conference was representation on the Central Board, and that was the matter considered.

It is the Wheat Board that decides matters, and I take it that it is on that Board the farmers desire representation. makes recommendations to the Central Board. mendations, but it does not make recommendations as to price. make recommendations, but what I mean is that it has absolutely no power; its functions are purely advisory. I have said, the Advisory Board consists purely of experts, and I am very sure that representation on that body would not satisfy the farmer.

I cannot give such an assurance The whole forces of a great nation are arrayed against us for the purpose of destroying the commerce of the Empire; and with the formidable massed legions of Tuscany arrayed against me, I am asked to give a guarantee that we will carry safely through this cordon vessels conveying Australian soldiers to the front . When President Wilson, the leader of a great nation of 100,000,000 people, is unable to wrest from the foe anything like such a guarantee, I cannot give it . tion put by the honourable member for South Sydney, I would ask the Prime -Minister whether, in the case of transr ports bearing Australian troops to the W h a t the represenfront, our enemies have not in the past been ever ready ana willing to sink them without notice, and if the fact that they have succeeded so little in the ,past is not The Advisory the best comfort. that friends and relatives of Australian soldiers can have?

In regard! to repatriation other than land settlement, the Commonwealth has assumed the whole responsibility for the welfare of returned soldiers, has undertaken to find them employment, to teach them, where necessary, useful trades and callings, to assist them in setting up small businesses, and to help them directly during periods in which their labour must be unremunerative, and in cases of invalidity. The scheme, as outlined, was considered by the Repatriation Trustees and approved. The repatriation scheme is to be carried out under Commonwealth authority. The Repatriation Trustees accept the view that the work to be done is so vast, complex, and difficult as to demand the whole attention of the most capable man whose services can be obtained, and it has been decided to appoint a Commissioner and, possibly, two Assistant Commissioners, to About £60,000 has take charge of it . The precise relations between the Repatriation Trustees and the Commissioner have not been finally determined, but it is thought that they should be analogous to those of company directors and their manager.

We are now considering what shall be the precise relations between the Repatriation Trustees and the proposed Commissioner or Commissioners and the appointments necessary to launch the scheme. The Treasurer informs me that in the meantime the War Councils are being supplied with all the money for which they ask, the Government thinking that it is better to make ten mistakes than to treat one soldier unjustly.

The Minister does not give us much information regarding the doings of the Commission. A number of university professors, acting on theoretical lines, are not likely to do much. The Minister for Defence, when acting for the Prime Minister some six months ago, told a deputation he recognised that a body of tliis kind could not do much to stimulate industry, and that something more was needed, but nothing has yet been done. It is time that we awoke to our responsibilities in this matter. Parliament should be in session continuously, until there has been placed on the statute-book the legislation that is needed. Committee then? would then be a Works Committee. I agree with much that was said by the honourable member for Capricornia concerning the proposed sending of a delegate to the Imperial Conference. In November, 1910, the Prime Minister, who was then acting for Mr Fisher, in his absence in South Africa, disclosed to the House the proposals that were to. be brought before the Imperial Conference of 1911. Conference now in view w ill be somewhat different from an ordinary Imperial Conference, and may have to discuss certain matters in regard to which the world at' large cannot be informed; but the Prime Minister should let us know the proposals that are to be discussed, so f a r as they can be communicated to us; and before any delegate is committed to leave Australia it should be made plain, by a resolution, of this House, or in some other way, that he could not commit Australia to anything without consulting the Parliament and people of this country, otherwise we may be misrepresented, and bound by agreements inimical to the best interests of the country.

This Parliament should lose no time in dealing with the question of repatriation, war pensions, unemployment, and other matters which have to do with the war and post-war times.

Sir JOH N FORREST (Swan) [5.30]. I desire to refer to the action of the Commonwealth Wool Board, which has under its control the appraising and shipping of wool from Australia to the Old Country. I have brought under the notice of that Board the position of the wool-growers on the north-west coast of Australia, but have received very little consideration from it . I regret to have to make such a statement, since 1 always desire to recognise the responsibilities of persons-in authority. I should not have complained if I could have found another way of securing reasonable consideration of my representations. It is very seldom that I bring a grievance before the Committee, but I cannot avoid doing so now, siice I am unable in any other way to obtain satisfaction. Western Australia is a wool-growing State, and a great deal of its last wool clip was shipped to England before .the Wool Board came into existence. Wool from the north-west is usually shipped to England -viA Singapore,' by vessels of 'the Holt line, which run from Fremantle to Singapore, where they tranship the wool, and on the return voyage bring goods and stock down the coast, to Fremantle. This is a regular trading concern, and arrangements are made by the wool growers on the north-west coast to ship their wool by that line whichoffers the most economical, convenient, and speedy means of getting it to England. The Wool Board, however, has refused to allow the continuance of this practice, which has been going on ever since the north-west produced wool. They insist that the wool shall be brought to Fremantle to he appraised. That would not be so bad if there were any ships to bring it down; but, while there are ships going to Singapore, which could take wool for transhipment at Singapore to London, there are no vessels to bring the wool down to Fremantle, since .those steamers come back laden with stock and merchandise. The wool-growers, therefore, have their wool lying in sheds or on the jetties awaiting shipment. They are promised 1 ships some time in March, but that is not what they want. Their desire is to got their wool to market. They want their bills of lading and their money. When the Wool Board came into existence a great deal of the wool of the north-west coast, and of Western Australia generally, was en route to England, and it had to be appraised in London. Some of it has hardly yet reached there; and I have argued that what could be done in respect of wool which was en route to England when this Board came into existence could",25,Temporary Chairman Done

242,Mr Sharpe.(Oxley) [5.44],"To-da ymonwealth. The then Government agreed to 'pay pensions of 2s. per week to all old persons in those institutions who, in receipt of a pension. opinion that Parliament w ill readily assent to giving effect to this proposal. am assured that the increased expenditure under this heading would not exceed £8,000. paying now. would cost one and a-half times as much, I am still of opinion that these pensions should be paid to these old persons. Many of the inmates of our charitable institutions have done the spade work in connection with our industries, and particularly does that remark apply to the pastoral industry. Many of them hail from country districts. vernment is scarcely treating these people in a satisfactory manner, seeing that recently they disallowed the issue of tea to them. The small pension for which I ask would, enable them to purchase little commodities of that description. An they give them to drink? tea in the middle of the day. The State authorities are endeavouring to compel the Commonwealth to take over these in stitutions. They are refusing to admit to them persons who have not been granted pensions or who have not made a great -effort to secure them. matter because it was the intention of the late Treasurer to give consideration to it , and I am under the impression that in the near future he would have granted my request. But the present Treasurer has not given me any such assurance, 'despite the fact that I have spoken to him about it on several occasions. will agree to it , I am satisfied that the -assent of Parliament w ill be readily obtained. When the pension was ""10s. per week, the Commonwealth Government was paying to the States 8s. weekly for -every pensioner who entered a benevolent institution, and the difference between the 8s. and the 10s. is being paid to the pensioner. Those old persons who now -enter these institutions should, I contend, 'be placed in an exactly similar position. member wish the Commonwealth to pay Ss. per week to the"" institution and 2s. to -the individual? to pay to the whole of the inmates who are entitled to a pension the prior to entering them, were 2s. per week, irrespective of whether or I am of not they enjoyed the pension prior to entering the institution. I am aware I that this concession will necessitate an amendment of the Act ; b u t it w ill be merely a slight amendment, and I hope that before Parliament adjourns for a n y considerable period we shall have something practicable from the Treasurer in connection with these pensions. Another matter to which I desire to direct his attion is the desirableness of paying the f u l l pension to the blind people of the Commonwealth. A t the present time-, many of them are receiving a pension, b u t on account of the Queensland Government having established a standard wage in the blind institutions of that State, proThe Queensland Gobably some of those who were previously in receipt of the pension will have it taken away from them. The Queensland Government has fixed a standard wage of 30s. per week for blind workers. That is all that they are able to earn. Many of them are married men, and are that they have to employ an attendant. I mention this matter for the purpose of showing what a meagre opportunity these people have of earning a decent living. As the Government are now paying a pension to half the blind people of the Commonwealth, the additional expenditure involved in paying a pension to all the blind I refer to this folks would not be very heavy. there are over 3,500 blind people in the Commonwealth. The total number receiving pensions is only 500. are living in destitute circumstances beI f he cause of tbeir inability to earn a livelihood. The honourable members for Yarra and Fawkner w ill confirm my statement that a deputation was being arranged to wait upon the ex-'l'reasurer to bring under his notice the"" importance of i m mediately providing a pension for the blind. I know that the present Treasurer does not think the blind people are entitled to pensions. Institutions are established throughout the Commonwealth into which they may go and learn basket the honourable and mat making, but as the majority of the inmates of such institutions are paid by piecework, they unfortunately do not earn very much money.

It is possible that such delegate or delegates w ill be away from Australia for a long time, unless the war ends quickly. If , on the other hand, the war is about to end, they will be called upon to consider the question of ,peace terms, and I A t present, there would like to hear their views on this subject. I would like to know what, in their opinion, the terms should be. W ill they include, .for example, a demand that the They are r u n at considerable Kaiser shall be elected by adult suffrage? To some people this may appear to be a very extreme proposal, but, in my opinion, if the Allies made such a demand, or if they demanded that the Kaiser should be deposed altogether, it would make a very great difference in the consideration of the question.

No one can challenge the courage of the sons of the aristocracy of a country when war come®. They are courageous because it is bad form among aristocrats to lack courage. Yet, notwithstanding the fact that the aristocracy makes a fair contribution of its sons, and loses a large number when a war breaks out, it is the people at large' who suffer most, and have to bear the cost of war. When a people becomes educated, it realizes that warfare does not benefit it . We should see that the whom we send to the Peace Conference possess advanced views, if we desire that this war shall be the last. If , for exThe ample, we enter into any arrangement with our Allies and any other countries after the war, we ought to have some understanding with regard to trade. Honourable members have heard me speak of the virtues of Protection-of a Customs Tariff designed to protect our manufacturers against cheap-labour manufacturers abroad. But I am prepared to take a broad view, and say that if we can so arrange with any country we should have a preferential Tariffi n favour of the products of that country which are manufactured by f a i r employers at a standard rate of wages. We have at the present time a Eveni n the United preferential Tarifff o r the UnitedK in gdom. That Tariff was designed for the purpose of assisting manufacturers and encouraging trade between ourselves and the United Kingdom. But what is the effect of that 10 per cent, preference? 5 per cent. ference is 5 per cent., but there is a very large number of items which come in under the 10 per cent, rate, as the. honorI t is the educated able member w ill recollect. We are givi n g a 10 per cent, preference to anybody whose goods are mainly manufactured in the Old Country. What happens under that Tariff? Those men who, before the war, were forming an organization w it h £50,000,000 to crush trade unionism can get their goods into this country at the same rate of preference as a fair emplover, who wishes to do his duty by himself as a man, and by his employees, both male and female, I am satisfied that the people of the future w ill demand, if there is to be any preference at all anywhere, that the goods coming into the country shall bear a certificate that they were manufactured at a standard trade-union rate, and that if any goods do not bear that certificate, they shall pay the f u l l rate. Are the delegates to the Imperial Conference going to advocate views of this kind ? Becausei f they are, they w i 1 1 not truly represent Australia. AndI submit to you, sir, with all respect, that the views I am enunciating this evening are the views held by a very large major it y of the people of this continent, and delegates should find expression at the Conference when the peace terms are being discussed.

As honourable members will know from their reading, there was a time when the peace of the community was left to'private individuals to look after; but as civilization progressed, the State decided to employ police, regularly paid, to put an end to physical combats.

The Labour GovernmentsFederal and Queensland State-have , through their administration, killed the progress of, if not the sugar industry itI self, in Queensland, and are leaving millions of acres of most fertile agricultural land lying idle in the tropics simply because in the first instance our honourable friends will not assist in coming to some arrangement by which tropical products",33,Moloney H E Probably
291,Mr Corser (Wide Fay) [8.0],"I can be grown in competition with Javagrown by almost solely black labour. We shall not be allowed to hold this continent as a White Australia unless we settle people on the rich' lands that we possess in the north. People can tinker with mere trivial things, and discuss questions which are not of vital importance, but wheu it comes to the point of trying to assist an industry like the sugar industry of Queensland, it is to be allowed to sink, and with it the prospect of holding the northern count r y free from coloured attempt has been made by tlie late Government to protect the industry. I know of hundreds of men in the sugar industry, some of whom have devoted thirty-seven years of their lives to it , who to-day are practically ruined. B i it not a hand is held o""t to save them. If we are to retain this part of the country as a White Australia, those who represent the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference must endeavour to arrive at an arrangement under which it would be possible to find a market for Australian sugar in other parts of the Empire, and, instead of Great Britain being, as in the past, a dumping ground for the surplus sugar produced by Germany and Austria, she should obtain her supplies from within the Empire. taken up most energetically by our representatives at the Imperial Conference. A definite understanding should be arrived at as between the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments that what we produce in the tropical and semi-tropical parts of Australia shall find a sale within the Empire, and. shall be granted a substantial preference over the produce of foreign countries. should be put to the policy under which Great Britain has been the dumping ground for the surplus products of our enemies. ber does not think that sort of thing is going to occur after the war ? the war may happen again when the war is over unless an agreement such as I have suggested is made. Another point which our representatives at the Imperial Conference should emphasize is that no enemy nation shall be allowed to occupy islands adjacent to the Australian coast taken by us during the war, and that when we have beaten the enemy he shall be called upon to pay such an indemnity asw i ll compensate Australia for what she has suffered in consequence of Germany's violation of Belgium. But for Germany's action in .that regard we should never have been drawn into this bloody war, and thousands of our men who have lost their lives in fighting for the Empire-me n who have cheerfully laid down their lives rather than that we should be accused of disloyalty-woul d have been with us today. In these circumstances, therefore, labour. No the enemy should becalled upon to pay us such an indemnity as will assist us in compensating, as f a r as we can, the dependants of those brave soldiers of Australia who have lost their lives at the front . The loss should not f a l l upon us. I do not suggest that we should not subscribe, to the last penny, if necessary, to the relief of the dependants of those men. My point is that we should see that the enemy is compelled to compensate us for the losses we have sustained. A t the earliest opportunity provision should also be made for a large influx of population. That larger population is impossible, however, unless we have a more equitable Tariff. I hope the day is not far distant when Australia will have granted by tliis Parliament such a This question should be meed of Protection as will enable people to come here from all parts of the British Empire to engage in industry, and to assist in converting our raw material into manufactured products,' which we can export, instead of the raw material itself being sent abroad to be made up.

Two honourable members who have preceded me have referred at length to our representation at the Imperial Conference. I , for one, am not too keen about our being represented there at a l l . I personally believe that Australia can do its own work at home, and do it effectively, in the in terests of the Commonwealth. .From my point of view, the less we are involved in Imperial complications the better.",34,Moloney H E Probably

294,Mr Yates (Adelaide) [8.12],"Iber satisfied with what our representatives are being called upon to discuss ? ber will tell me what they are to discuss, I shall express an opinion on the subject. It is because we do not know what questions are to be discussed that I am rather anxious as to the representation of Australia at the Conference. questions which ought to be discussed first of all is the right of the belligerents who are fighting for the Empire to manage the countries in which they live. There should be adult suffrage in all countries, so that the people, and not the autocrats, may control the world. If the people of other nations had had the same measure of political freedom that we in Australia enjoy, there would have been no war. Working people do not want war; they have always opposed it . The ideal of those'who created our p a r t y was not the destruction of human life, but that tlie whole world should be made a better place to live in . Our ideals have been based on the good old prayer which so many say, but which so few understand "" Thy kingdom come; Thy w ill be done on earth."" prayer men will go f o the Imperial Conference and cackle, as they have cackled before, as to the necessity of secret diplomacy ruling the lives of the people. I am speaking on behalf of the workers who had no say in the shedding of blood which is going on to-day at the call of the autocracy of Europe. I did not intend to speak in this way, as I have a recruiting meeting to address to-night, but when I hear people prattling about what they are going to do at the Imperial Conference, I want to know, what they propose to say on behalf of the rank and file of the community. An honourable member has talked about the development of Australian industries to give employment to the'people, but he forgets that it was the Labour party who wrung the neck of the black labour business in his State. We know who it is that is crippling Australia to-day, and we know darned well that it is the autocracy of Australia that we must strangle before we can secure justice for the working men of Australia. absolutely wrong. It was not the Labour party but the Democratic party who settled the black labour question in Queensland. not have settled the question in the sense that it was they who passed the legislaI f the honourable memtion that brought the settlement about, but honourable members should not forget that the Labour party always carried a good punch in both hands, and if the Liberals did not do what they desired, that was the end of them as a dominant One of the party. Of late years Liberal parties in Australia have held office only so long as they have been prepared to do what has been best in the interests of the general community. Though the flotsam and jetsam that are in power in the Commonwealth to-day may for a littl e while be able to work their sweet w ill , when the good sense of the electors returns, Australia will soon get rid of them, and the Labour party of to-day w ill stand just where it stood before tlie dictatorship of Australia came into being. The object of true Australians is to develop Australia and not talk about it , and to bring people to Australia, and not talk about it at Imperial Conferences. It is to keep Australia white, and make it safe. We do not wish to bring people here in shiploads to send But after uttering that them on to the streets to sell newspapers. Our purpose is to make the wages, hours, and conditions of life in Australia such that this will be a country to which people will gladly come, and to which there w ill be no need to drag them. I know that we have a hard row to hoe, and I know the people against whom we have to contend ; but time and education are always on the side of the Labour party. Wheni t comes to talking war, do not let anybody say that the members of the Labour party talk war. No one should say that we ever desired to destroy any one. It is said that we want to level down. No fear; no one ever heard the Labour party contending for lower wages and longer hours of employment. No one ever heard a Labour member say anything which would prevent kiddies being properly 1 educated. The idea of the Labour .party is that there are in their ranks brains fit for the universities, and they want a university education to be open to their children. No one ever heard a working man say that his wife should not have a satin dress if he could get it for her. She would look just as well in it as would the wife of a member of any other party.

We are at a time of change now, and whether the result is to be an up or a down the events Of the next few months will prove. I think that the good sense of Australians will give the few who are now taking advantage of circumstances a bad bump. I am reminded of the advertisement for Buchanan's whisky, and I say that there w ill be a good big drop lef t for them, and they will realize it when they get to the bottom. The honourable member for Hindmarsh laughs, and I am reminded by the fact that Mr Paris Nesbi t t , one of the leading lawyers of South Australia, when irritated by a like circumstance in Court on one occasion, said that it was the loud. guffaw that proclaimed the vacant mind. Knowing the honourable member for Hindmarsh as well as I do, I should not like to say that of him, although it might be applicable. Today, I asked the Prime Minister a question with respect to the prosecution in South Australia of two persons who belonged to the Anti-conscription League, and the right lionorable gentleman said he had no knowledge of the matter. If my memory serves me correctly, when we permitted the War Precautions Act to pass, and some honourable members were fearfu l of the powers vested in the Government, we secured the assurance of the Prime Minister that no action of a tyrannous character could take place under that legislation without his knowledge of it as Attorney-General. Y e t today the right honourable gentleman said that he did not recognise' the name of Mclntyre, that MrE . H . Coombe, the member for Barossai n the South Australian Parliament, was unknown to him, that he had no knowledge of the prosecutions I refer to, and that they did not exist.. they did not exist. they did not exist so far as he had any knowledge of them. of the facts. . may, if they please, give the righ t honourable member's own words, but the point after all is that he had no knowledge of the prosecutions, although he was Attorney-General, and he could not recollect the name of Mclntyre coining up. were not submitted to him. his hands than he could handle, and some . one else was running that part of the show. That would not be a unique experience for the present Government. I find that the Adelaide Register of last Monday published the following paragraphProfound interest was caused in Adelaide by the announcement on Saturday that Messrs. Coombe, M.P., and F. Mclntyre, who were two prominent leaders in the anti-conscription campaign during October, had received .summonses under the War Precautions Act. When seen at his residence on Saturday morning in regard to the matter, Mr Coombe said he preferred not to make a. statement, and Mr Mclntyre, who is assistant secretary of the South Australian branch of the Federated Carters' and Drivers' Union, was also uncommunicative. He said the incident arose in connection with a meeting at Tanunda on 26th October, and that the case was set down for liearing in that town on 12th February. The words contained in the information issued to him, he admitted, were : "" ' The Germans were being treated very unfairly, and they were as loyal as anybody else, and I would be pleased to shake them, by the hand,' or words to that effect."" ' "" The proclamation calling upon the men to enroll was invalid. We have had. that opinion from three of the leading lawyers of Melbourne, or words to that effect."" There was. a drag-net phrase which enabled the prosecution to say that if he did not say what was attributed to h i m he did say something to that effect. The Prime Minister says that he has no knowledge of this matter, but at least two of his Ministers must know of it , because there is very special reason at, the present time why they should very caref u l l y peruse the Adelaide newspapers. Who is using the Acti n this manner? Here we have two prominent men in South Australia, one a politician and another belonging to the union, who have been summoned under a special Act ; and if it is not the Prime Minister who is doing this, W h a t I mean is that it is a scheme on the part of those who are fighting for their political lives in South Australia, because they have been excommunicated honourable members w ill see that I can use the word. I am endeavouring to show that even so f a r as the Federal arena is concerned there is more in this than meets the eye-that the Federal party is in collusion w i th the State party to do all that is possible to wreck the little band who fought conscription so successfully in our State.

Three months, elapse before these men are prosecuted. Why was there not a ' prosecution at the time of the alleged offence, so as to give these men an opportunity to defend themselves? I do not see what good can be done to South Australia by the adoption of this attitude towards men who were told that criticism would be as free as air. Mclntyre may have been speaking of Germans who were interned; and if the proclamation was wrong, why were not the lawyers, who advised on the subject, proceeded against? All the circumstances show the weakness of the position taken up by the Federal authorities; and yet we are told that by the action of these men recruiting is prejudiced.

I got leave only to the first of the month, and did not get any further word until the 5th January as to whether I had leave or not. I had the committee called together at the earliest opportunity, but found that nothing could be done until 1st February, or, as it turned out, until the 6th, to enable the Governor to be present. The next week the committee met in the different sections, and to-night I am going to a meeting at North Melbourne, and have made all my arrangements accordingly. What has the Treasurer or any member of the Government done ? What are they going to do? They are going to make a fiasco of the campaign, and then thought that when the scheme was set forth it would mean that Liberals and Labour men would work together with great zest-that the same zest would be shown that we saw when an effort was made to foist conscription on the people. all on the last occasion. out., and I said so in the HouseI said I had not done anything to assist recruiting.

As I understand it , the Australian sentiment is that the Empire shall be held together by the slenderest ties of fellowship and kinship -which , after all, are the strongest-and -not by' any agreement of a more formal and binding nature. I believe that if there is any attempt at the Conference to make Australia part of a great I m perial Federation, with a supreme I m perial Parliament, the Commonwealth believe that a f a ir response will find itself confronted by a serious from the volunmenace to its democratic ideals.

In my opinion, the most effective scheme to develop the Empire, and bring about its It w ill prove that the greater unity, strength, and consolidation, will be one based entirely upon considerations of race and sentiment.

If our Government, instead of buying the rotten-bottomed old things that were bought a few suddenly months ago, had adopted the policy of That is a suicidal policy for building merchant vessels of. 9,000 or We took two essen10,000 tons at Cockatoo, they would have turned them out like hot cakes. would be pretty cold by the time they Australia's safety ' turned them out at Cockatoo IslandIn built on the one pattern, and it is all clean work.

If we are the men whose duty it is to rule the destinies of Australia, we ought to be right up to our necks in the work of providing the means of carrying on the commerce of the country at the conclusion of the war. I make these remarks, not in a party spirit, but as one actuated by the sole desire to benefit Australia. If we do things that harm Australia, we harm ourselves.

In dealing with the Tariffi n this House, we have always had to take into serious consideration the cost of production in Australia as compared w i th the cost of production in Great Britain, and fairly high duties have been imposed for the purpose of trying to equalize local costs with the costs in Great Britaini n order that those controlling our local industries might have a reasonable opportunity of competing with manufacturers in the Old Country.

Thc following reply has been received from the secretary'to the Prime Minister:-"" I am directed to inform you that it is the policy of the Government that preference of employment is accorded to returned soldiers, irrespective of whether they are members of unions or not.

I take it, therefore, that the bulk of the people who have shown their confidence in the Labour party will be represented in any such deliberations. If any of the countries concerned are allowed to have two or three representatives, why should not the Bame representation bo conceded to the Commonwealth? No one can deny that the honourable member for Yarra and the party behind him represent the great majority of the people of Australia. I maintain that the Official Labour party has behind it a majority of 62,000 of the electors. of the elections I and I submit that if any party has the right to representation at an Imperial Conference, it is the party now sitting in the Opposition corner.

With the honourable member for Dalley, I am inclined to say that our great public works, especially shipbuilding, are not being pushed ahead as thoy ought to he. We have a large plant at Cockatoo, with the best machinery and the most highly skilled men available; but these men have been scattered, and the plant is not fully employed. If any branch of our industries requires stimulation, it is the iron industry, including shipbuilding. We cannot afford to.leave_ our country unprotected by submarines"" aud destroyers; and ,1 hope the policy of the Government will be to add to our naval strength. Money spent hi this direction is money well spent, if only as insurance; and it will certainly help to maintain the confidence of the people. I hope that the Government, when, after some slight changes, it is properly constituted, will see that this branch of industry is kept going. I regret that the Postmaster-General has'seen fit to put a brand on the arm of our postmen.. I cannot see the necessity for the official brand being placed on the arm as well as on the neck, and, in any case, this is not a way in which money can be saved. 1 can only regard the new regulation as a mistake, for it certainly does not add to the dignity of any man. I trust that after this Supply Bill is. possed, we shall not see any more of these announcements about the movements arid meetings of the Leader of the Liberal party and the Prime Minister, and so forth.

[ desire to say a few words in regard to he representative of Australia who will ittend the Imperial War Conference, If bisHouse adjourns for a week, we have no assurance that before it reassembles he may not have left our shores. Before he goes to that Conference, I submit that he should take the members of this Parliament into his confidence by telling us upon some of the most important matters which will claim its attention. A t a time like this-the most strenuous time in the -history of the world-it is almost impossible to debate things in a calm manner. Anything that one may say is apt to be misconstrued by his .political opponents. Only a few weeks ago I asked a question in regard to the peace proposals of the Central Powers. I asked the Prime Ministeri f he would request the Imperial Government to state the -terms upon which they were prepared to make peace. In question' to Von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German Chancellor. Yet within a few weeks of that question being put in this chamber the Imperial Government actually outlined the terms upon which The they were prepared to make peace, and despatched them to President Wilson. I protest against the way in which my question was treated hy the Prime Minister. I claim that it is due to the members of this Parliament that a Prime {Minister, who is about to visit England to represent Australia ait the forthcoming War Conference, should disclose to them the views which he holds upon matters of Fancy vital importance. In regard to the convery few indeed who will say that it should be handed back to Germany. We to us again, and, consequently, the Prime Minister might well speak on behalf of Australia upon' that 'question. If he adopted an Australian Monroe doctrine, he would probably be voicing the national opinion. Buti t is incumbent upon him to tell us something of what is in his honourable gentleman a question in reference to the resolutions adopted by the Paris Conference,' and in reply he said, "" The honourable member is under a misapprehension.

429,Mr Hampson (Bendigo) [10.19],"would be of great advantage to India. If the resolutions of the Paris Conference involved the whole of our Allies, they involved Australia just as much as India or any other part of the British Dominions. But tliere seems to be a sort of Indian understanding as to why the Tariff is not dealt with at the present time. Those resolutions involve placing some of our Allieson a different footing to America, and it iB feared that that is not the true Australian sentiment. If we take up that attitude, and say that we are afraid to deal with these matters at the present time, we shall be neither courageous nor honest. These problems must be faced some time, and they may as well be faced now. Everybody knows that our objection to the importation of goods from foreign countries is not on account of race or colour, but on account of economic conditions, and this issue will be raised when the Tariff is under discussion. That is the reason why the settlement of these problems is being deferred. Some members of the Liberal party say to us, "" Your party was in power for two years; why did you not deal with this matter ? ' ' They should remember that the bulk of the effort put forward by Australia in raising 300,000 men, equipping them, and sending them 12,000 miles overseas, a feat which no other nation in the world has performed, is now finished. work of recruiting men and supplying them with equipment is done. Australia's duty at the present time is to'fill the gaps that are made in the ranks of the men who have already gone. If that attitude were adopted to-day, we should not ' obtaining recruits. for reinforcements. are accepting the opinion of the Army is too much pretence and secrecy.

General has used thosefigures',the Prime Minister stated them in' this House, and he quoted them again last night at the Town Hall.* It is not for reinforcements that the Army Council asked us to send 16,500 men per month. For the last twelve months the average wastage has been only 5,000 per month. If , instead of saying to the Australian people, ""Drop party politics"" while they are forming another party, instead of invading the constituencies of men who are in khaki and doing their service to the Empire-if , instead of indulging in that mockery, the Government were to tell the Australian people what has been the actual wastage amongst our troops, and ask them to keep up the necessary reinforcements, there would be no difficulty in getting the number of men required. Let all parties unite in asking the young manhood of Australia to supply those reinforcements, and there would be no need to talk about conscription, or to apply the' pressure of economic conscription. That is the clear line of duty for Australia to follow. I wish to say a word or two with reference to the future defence of Australia. Until my visit to EnglandI was one of those who held that we in Australia were utterly helpless without the protection of the British Fleet. But, after seeing Sir David Beatty's cruiser squadron practically locked up in the harbour at Rossyth, and Sir John Jellicoe's Grand Fleet practically locked up in the harbour ih the North of Scotland the fleets are. humbugging?

A blockade under modern conditions is vastly different from what it was in the time of Nelson. Our ships cannot ride outside the Kiel Canal. If we are able to bottle up*the German Fleet, the Germans also are able to bottle up our ships with their submarines in a very marked manner. We have not got that control of the North Sea and the waters around Britain which we had prior to the submarines attaining their present efficiency. Developments have proved that our defence in future will be under, rather than above, the water. Whilst we construct our fast cruisers and arm them with big guns, and utilize all our ingenuity to protect them against the attacks of submarines, it is clear to those who are watching events to-day that the under-water craft will be Australia's best defence in future. aeroplanes. matter very much in Australia. The .British Fleet relies on its air craft, and small boat scouts for information as to the doings of the German Fleet. If the scouts report that the German Fleet is leaving its base, and the British Fleet has a chance to dash out and tackle the enemy, it does so. Canada is doing vastly more for the Empire than Australia in ' relation to the war in the manufacture of munitions, and what are called submarine chasers, and the repairing of battleships. Our attention should be directed to mak-, ing Australia self-contained so far as defence is concerned. We ought to be thinking and going in that direction now. The war, of course, has to be won before we begin even to talk of peace terms, and we ought to be thinking about building our own submarines and air craft. every Conservative I have ever heard. juncture ? be thinking in that direction, but as soon as any one points out what Australia should do there is always a sneer or jeer to the effect that we cannot do it . The Free Traders would buy their battleships ' fro m Germany to-morrow if they were ' cheaper. That has always been their policy. I want to put the Australian point of view. If we are to be represented at an Imperial Conference there ought to be no promises or entanglements in the direction of what is called closer organic union. Australia undoubtedly desires to be consulted with regard to the terms of peace and war, but the Australian people are not ready at the present time to be brought into closer relationship with other parts of the Empire that have an altogether different ideal from Australia. It -is the duty of our representative to come to Parliament and take honourable members' into his confidence, giving them some general outline of what he thinks he ought to say on behalf of Australia at any Conference of the kind suggested. [10.37] I do not intend to follow the example of those honourable members who have turned the motion for Supply into hear! And a grievance-day debate. We , are told that the Government desire to adjourn to-night u n t i l next Wednesday. I hope I will be forgiven for saying that I am not too sure that we will meet next Wednesday once the Government get Supply. The present conference of three members of the so-called Opposition, and three members of the Government side, may not be able to settle their differences by next Wednesday, and the PrimeM in ister, exercising his power as the only man in Australia, may not call Parliament together u n t i l it suits h i m to do so, and we have no means of making him do it unti l the Government want further Supply. I do not say that is the intention, but it has been done before, and can be done again.

We are told by the Conservative press, who are supporting the .Government, and also the proposed Fusion, that it is the intention of the Government to have an election in May next for the Senate only. In that matter the Government are playing a game of "" Heads we win, tails you lose."" They are playing two-up with us with double-headedpennies. It is necessary, we are told, to. have an election for the Senatei n May, because eighteen senators retire on the 30th June. The Government evidently have a strong hope that if they come back with a majority in the Senate there w ill be no. need for an election for the'House of Representatives at a l l , because if they and the Liberals combine they will have a majority, and the people of Australia can go hang so far as they are' concerned, , the idea being, to extend the life of Parliament for three years, with the help of the British Government. We were told in one newspaper that that was the inr tention. Membersi n ' this corner will be recreant'to their trust if they do not use all their powers in this and another place to prevent the Government doing such a thing, and to send both Houses to the' people in May, in view of the chaotic state we are in . I am not very much enamoured of elections, but we are in this position as a party, that at the last election the Labour party came back with an „overwhelming majority in both Houses against the Conservative section of the community. . The mandate of the people was that the Labour party should rule Australia t ill the next election. . of people like the Postmaster-General, who, when they can say nothing else, talk of their patriotic fervour. No man in this House is a greater patriot than I am, but I am also an Australian representative, and cannot forget that this Parliament has been legislating for some time for the Empire, careless whether Australia is made a scapegoat or not. It is our duty to consider Australia as well as the rest of the Empire, especially when the other portions of the Empire have not considered Australia. This is the only portion of the British Empire that to-day has thousands of men. out of work. Why1 Because we are so f a r removed from the seat of war. Millions of pounds are being spent in. producing commodities for the purpose of carrying on the war to a successful issue in every portion of the Empire except Australia, while all the talk here is to send men and spend money. There is not one man in Europe able to work who is out of work to-day, but thousands of Australians cannot get work. Therefore, it behoves the representatives of the people of Australia to see that Australia gets a fair share of the production of the commodities that are necessary for the carrying on of the war, and that it is not made to stand a greater proportion of the brunt and trouble than any other section of the Empire has to bear. We are not turning out the commodities that we should be manufacturing, and which Canada and other portions of the Empire are producing; we have never had the opportunity of doing so. We have thousands of men not fitted to go to the f r o n t who are out of work ; but even if they are fit to go to the front, we have no right to p u t in force in Australia the method'of coercing men to go to the f r o n t by putting them out of work.. I do not say that this is the intention of the Government, but it is the desire of a great section of the community. One might not enter into any great controversy over the matter if young men only were affected; but the position is that right throughout Australia thousands of men who would not be taken to the front , and who have 'large families, are unemployed, and those who are howling "" win the w a r "" most are utterly careless in regard to their position. So long as the great centre of the Empire is saved, and the British Empire preserved in its entirety, they do not war. care about the position of Australia. I I meet, a number can understand their anxiety on behalf of the Empire; but, at the same time, I object to Australia being made the scapegoat for the rest of the Empire by reason of its being separated 12,000 miles from the seat of war. No doubt it is the duty of our Government to see that Australia does its share in preserving the liberties of the British people, but it also has the . duty of seeing that the people of this country get a fair deal from the rest of the'Empire, so far as-economic conditions are concerned. ing all of our products. pounds' worth of wheat rotting in my",53,Foster I Believe He Blame Honourable Members On This Side I

They cannot pay for the whole of it until they get it. the people of Australia should concentrate all their thoughts and efforts on winning the war. Have the British Government done so ? Have they considered all the elements that have brought about a successful issue, so far as the war has already progressed, and at the same time dealt fairly witli the whole of the Empire? On many occasions I have shown where they have failed to do so. I do not care to repeat it, and I only do so because I realize that the majority of members of this Parliament are careless of the interests of the people of Australia, and have in view only one ideal, the light that the Prime Minister has seen. There is not one honourable member of this House who has not in his constituency men who are suffering and out of work. honourable members that men cannot be secured to do work in country districts. It may.be true; but can we expect a man in my electorate to go to the country and earn a living there for his family when he already owes the butcher and the baker for two or three weeks' meat and bread, and probably owes the landlord two or three weeks' rent? It is preposterous to expect him to go into the country and work for a pittance, and at the same time keep his family in the city. Has any honourable member tried to live on 48s. a week and keep two homes going ? No one understands the position of . the wage-earning section of the community better than I do. The Governments in power to-day in Australia are careless as to the condition of these people, and yet we are asked to hand over to the present Commonwealth Government another month's Supply in order to enable them to get into March, when we shall have a request for more Supply, and if we refuse to give it the onus of not paying the Government servants will be thrown upon us. In my opinion, our party can better look after the interests of Government servants by insisting that this Government shall not hoodwink us so far as the next election is concerned. Once they gain power, there are many methods by which they can stop the Labour section of the community from wresting it from their hands again. The Prime Minister and the honourable member for Flinders will stop at nothing to secure political power, and we are asked to hand it over to them, because they hope against hope that, in March, after holding an election for the Senate, they will come back with a majority in another place. It is nothing but gerrymandering. that?

488,Mr Finlayson,"In the countrymatters, but also matters such as tbe distribution of population throughout the Empire, are to be dealt with outside Australia, there will be trouble here. I am the last man to desire the disturbance of our relations with the Imperial authorities. The events of the last two years or more have shown that the thread of kinship is strong enough to hold the Empire together, and there is no danger of disruption while tlie independence of the governments of Dominions is preserved. But any limitation of their local governing powers would cause trouble. If there is to be an Imperial Oouncil composed of representatives of the Dominions acting with British representatives, and it so manages or controls the affairs, of the Empire as to restrict the freedom and to interfere with the government of any of , the Dominions, irritation and disturbance will be caused. reading into those proposals something which really is not there? Mr FrSTLAYSON"" -Judging by common talk in . the newspapers, that is what the Imperial Oouncil is meant to develop into. that it_ is intended to interfere in any way with our rights of self-government or to curtail them. Council has to determine anything in regard to Australian affairs, it must neces-sarily limit our power to deal with them. posals have to come before this Parliament 1 Surely you do not think that our representatives wouldcommit us absolutely? . MrF r NXAYSOK I cannot imagine that the Imperial Council is going to come to some decisions, and that those . decisions are to be valueless until they are ratified by the Dominions, because the mere fact that one Dominion failed to ratify the decisions would make them -futile. I am anxious to retain our connection with the British Empire. I am anxious to develop the British Empire so much that it will be the one power in every part of the world which will be a guarantee for liberty and freedom. It is because I dread the possibility of disruption and disintegration that I do not want anything to be introduced which might be a fruitful cause of trouble. There is only one thing more that I desire to say, and I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not here. Isi t not about time that the stupid press censorship in Australia was stopped? Is it not about time that instead of the words about freedom in Australia flowing so glibly from the lips of the Prime Minister he allowed us to get back to the first qualification in regard to freedom, and that is a free speech and a free press? There is no other country in the world to-day-and I make no exception-wher e there is a greater limitation on speeph and on the press than in Australia. Yet the archpriest of the whole thing is the man who most glibly talks about freedom and liberty. I want to protest most vigor ously against the continuation of this press censorship, which is stupid, which is foolish, which is only breeding trouble. not One of these days the system will burst, and the Government that is responsible for the system, and particularly the Minister who is responsible for its existence, will have to answer to an outraged public for the limitation which he imposed on the press and the people at a time when we should have free, frank, and ful l discussion. If anything that ought to be said is stopped by a stupid press cen, sorship, you may be certain that the more you dam the current of people's thoughts, you are only hastening for yourselves the time when the dam will burst, and a flood will overwhelm you. This stoppage of free speech in Australia, this locking up of men because they dare to express an opinion which, in the. mind of some biased military officer, is prejudicial to recruiting, is an outrage on decency. It v is foolish in the extreme, and, if for nothing else than their stupid, actions in this respect, the present Government ought to be hurled from the Treasury bench at the very first moment. Before we adjourned last year, the Prime Minister promised that the restriction on the press would be withdrawn. He gave a most solemn .assurance that there would be no restriction on the press or on the platform, yet day after day returned soldiers are afraid to speak. I have a letter from a returned soldier, in which he says, "" One of these days I will be able to tell you some things, and they will be of use to you, but I dare not speak now.""

I am not going to make an appeal to the Prime Minister to withdraw ""the restriction on the press and on free speech. I only make the statement that it is a disgrace to Australia, and that some day the people will reward the Prime Minister for his outrageous conduct. [11.21] -When I was called to order. I was referring to the fact that it is the intention of the Government to have only an election for the Senate. asked, "" What are you afraid of?

Equal representation in the Senate was a bait to bring the smaller States into Federation. There could be an overwhelming majority in three States against the present Government, and the Senate election would not express the opinion of the people of Australia as to whether they preferred to have the present Government or a Coalition. That is why there ought to be an appeal to the Democracy of Australia, and not. to the States, so that they could rectify some of the muddle we are in to-day. The Ministers are tryirig to preserve their political skins, and it is "" up to us "" to stop their game. They could come back with a catch vote of the States and alter the constitution, of the Senate or the constitution of the House of Representatives. liked. their heart's content, and the people of Australia would be left to their mercy for another period of three years. Everybody can understand that if the Government were to get a majority in the Senate they could do what they liked. In a Fusion with the supporters of the right honourable member for Parramatta, the Government would have a majority here now. If they should come back under our hybrid system with a majority in the Senate, will the combination tell us in black and white that they will not bring in conscription by proclamation in spite of the vote of the people on that question ? you could get that promise from them ?

My opinion is that they would dp, anything once they had a ""majority in the Senate. I am not a very bloodthirsty individual. I believe that, with a majority in the Senate, the Fusion in this House would do just as they liked; but they will have to deal ultimately with the 'people of Australia. A Prime Minister in Europe has been shot for closing down Parliament and governing against the wishes of the people, and I believe that the same thing would take place here. But we are, after all, a people who believe in constitutional methods. We do -not want any Industrial Workers of the World methods; but even the sabotage of the Industrial Workers pf the World is not a bit more extreme, nor more to be deplored, than would be the action of the Government, backed up by the Opposition, in carrying on the administration of the .aff airs of the country against the wish They could do anything they of the people. Since we get no answer They could gerrymander to to our questions on the subject, we can only surmise what is going to take place.
