Probably what they would say, if I made the suggestion put forward by the honourable member, is that since we have plenty of meat here, we might send some of our surplus commodity direct to the starving peoples overseas. asked the Prime Minister to table reports from the State Premiers concerning unemployment in Australia. The right honourable gentleman said that it was impossible for him to accede to my request until he obtained the permission of the Premiers of the States to do .so.

81,Sir Joseph Cook,"Hav e you also me. M t . CHARLTON -Yes; I congratulatethe Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) uponsuffer a disadvantage by not being in a the very clear way in which he has presented his Budget. He afforded honourable 'members every facility to follow hirii ""very easily. It is pleasing to note the very hopeful view the right honourable gentleman takes in regard to our primary products. The future welfare pf, the country depends largely upon the' nature of the seasons we enjoy. For-' tunately, during the last few years these have been very good, and there is everyappearance of the incoming season being' equally good. The only doubt is whether or not the prices we obtain for our sur-. plus products in the overseas markets will be nearly up to those recently received, for upon this our future prosperity depends, entirely. I shall not devote much time to this matter now, because in the course of my speech I intend to deal with one or two. matters at considerable-length, but I think that the Government should take some steps towards the establishment of a Wheat Pool. There are difficulties in the way, I admit, principally owing to the fact that the States control the land and railways; but as the farmers throughout Australia have, in no uncertaiu man-, ner, expressed a desire for a Pool, I think the best interests of Ithe country would be served by the Government doing something in this direction. I trust that the Commonwealth Government will endeavour to meet the representatives of the States and carry into eflect the wishes of the farmers. Ifno Pool is established I am afraid the returns from the sales of our produce overseas will not be as good as. we might expect to receive through the operation of a Pool. The adoption of various policies in the different States, for the. disposal of wheat will not work out to the benefit of the producers. . Honourable, members on this side of-the Chamber are particularly anxious that the wheat-grower shall get a fair return for his labour and that the consumer also, shall get his wheat' at a fair price. We believe that this can be brought about by a Wheat Pool properly managed by a Board comprising representatives of the consumers as well as ithe producers. A t any rate, if nothing is done in this direction the Government ought not to lose sight of the fact that during the war, in response to their request, to the. farmer to raise wheat, additional areas were put under cultivation, and that if the farmer is now permitted to position to;get a fair return for his. labours, the effect upon Australia asi a whole must be detrimental.. We are depending upon the money we obtain from; the sale of our. primary produce overseas^ to help us through the trying times ahead.; The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), pointed out that we have been obtaining, the. cheapest sugar in the world, and that, may be true, because during the early stages of the war we were getting supplies; at lower rates than were ruling in other; countries. . In 1916, sugar was being re--, tailed at 3£d. per lb -the average for sitf years was 4d. per lb -and since 25thi March, 1920, the price has been 6d.< per lb. . The last-mentioned price is' considerably above the world's parity,' because sugar is now being soldi elsewhere at a lower price than ib. is being retailed here. Provision has been made whereby jam makers can obtain supplies at the world's parity when,, bhe. sugar is to be. used in the manufacture) of jam; but we' are anxious to know how: long it will be before the consumers throughout Australia will be able to pur-i chase sugar at a lower price. This is ar matter of vital concern to the people of the Gommonwealth. The production of canein 1919-20 was 1,350,000 tons, and for 1921-22 we expect to produce 2,160,000"" tons. With that quantity available, the price to consumers should be considerably, reduced. Surely there js no reason why; the present high rate should continue. Notwithstanding thecriticism appearing in the press from time to time, and the statements made' in this House that capital is"" being driven out of the country, it was very pleasing to hear the Treasurer"" state that ho less than 2,032 companies were registered in Australia during1920, in which capital amounting to. £148,270,614 was invested, and that for six. month's of 1921, 737 .companies had been registered in which-£89,989,292, Had been invested. When we' are informed that capital is beiiig driven out bf the country, and that industries are being retarded', owing to the action of industrialists, we need only refer to the Trea-i surer's statement to find the answer. More companies are being registered, and a larger-amount of capital is being invested, than has been the case before: -;; ..., The Treasurer also referred to the question of shipbuilding, and pointed out that -penditure from revenue is decreasing,, and provision had been made on the Estimates that it will be much less this year than 'for £3,000,000for .defraying the cost of it was during the last financial year; but, 'ships built in Great Britain. nexion with our shipbuilding policy, the expenditure, we must be careful not to -time has arrived when we should build do an injustice to those who went over-in the Commonwealth.

83,. Mr Charlton,"Principall y be the expense of the men who are partiallythe Australian Note Act... ""Let me ask honourable members what legislation was responsible for this country successfully prosecuting the recent war? Was it not legislation passed by the Labour Government ? .l venture to say there is only one, answer, and that is "" Yes."" party was it brought about the creation of the Commonwealth Bank? Was it not the Labour party? And was it not in this connection, with the note issue, that the Commonwealth found the necessary money to finance us during the great ordeal?' There is other legislation to the credit of the Labour party, such as the land tax, and so forth. The programme carried out by the Labour party when in power stands out in comparison with the legislation passed by any other party during the existence of this Parliament. There is another matter to which I desire briefly to call attention. The Treasurer in his Budget speech told -us that the arrears of the various direct taxes are estimated to amount to the huge sum of £7,500,000. He has stated since that it was nearly £8,900;000, but that something like £3,000,000 had been collected. The sum seems a large one to be outstanding. payments. does not make that clear in his Budget speech, by which we have to be guided. It is stated in black and white that this represents arrears of direct taxation. I do not know, who the people are who owe this large amount; but, if it is necessary to prosecute the poor man in order to enforce the payment of his income tax of 10s. or 15s., it is equally necessary to prosecute others who owe larger sums to the Commonwealth. There may, of course, be good reasons why this. is not done. bunal, and numbers of cases have not been settled.: so by the Treasurer, who simply said that there is this large amount outstanding. there are reasons why it is outstanding. the accumulated surplus at the 30th June, 1921,-was £6,618,327, and the Treasurer says-' ' This means that, not only was the surplus at the beginning , of last year, viz., £5,724,806, kept intact, but I was able to add to it to the extent of £893,521. Which Of course, it is a good thing to have a surplus, but when it is at the expense of the aged poor of this country it is a bad thing. There is not a shadow of a doubt but that we ought to have increased old-age pensions during the life of this Parliament Notwithstanding the high increase in the cost of living, we find that the aged and infirm are asked to subsist on 15s. per week. This surplus is placed in a Trust Fund for the purpose of paying old-age pensions, and re-. Gently we have decided that it shall also pay war pensions. If we had devoted part,of this money to paying an extra 5s. per week to the aged poor, it would, with 140,396 pensioners, have entailed an expenditure of only £1,825,148. Are the old people entitled to this increase? If they are, why should we begrudge them it? Why not amend the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act in order that we may pay it? The great point is that this extra payment would not involve additional taxation, seeing there is over £6,000,000 in the Trust Fund. From time to time honourable members on this side have asked the Treasurer to increase the invalid, and old-age pensions, but he * has always informed us that he had no money, and that any increase would mean additional taxation; yet, we find that there is a surplus available of not less than £6,000,000. While it is necessary to economize we should not economize at the expense of the aged poor. I wonder how these poor people live, in' view of the high cost of all commodities. Some of these people have to pay house rent out of their pension, and they ought to be provided for, even if it should mean additional taxation. ""There is now sufficient money in the Trust Fund to pay an extija 5s. per week for three years, and I hope, ' therefore, that the Treasurer will give some consideration to this matter. The estimated revenue for the year 1921-22 is £61,787,350 ; and the expenditure, £64,604,158; showing a deficiency ou the year's transactions of £2,817,108.

Speaking from memory, I think we are asked to expend about £1,300,000 extra on that Department, and if the Estimates are to be reduced that expenditure must share in the reduction. Every man and woman in Australia knows that postal facilities have been lagging behind for several years, in consequence of the war and the inability of the Government to obtain the necessary material"" for carrying on works. In the interests of the development of Australia we cannot legitimately cut down expenditure which affords employment to so many-afford s more employment, perhaps, than a similar amount would afford if expended for defence purposes. The money expended on the Postal Department would not only give much employment, but would open up the country in a way that is absolutely necessary if we are to settle more people on tbe land, and inwere written. crease our population. We, on this side, do not want a deficit, but if the accounts are Members of this House have been placed to be squared, it must not be at the expense at a great' disadvantage owing to the' abof the man in the country or the man in the city. The man in the city requires expenditure on the provision of telephonic, telegraphic, and other facilities, just as does the man in the country, but such services have been starved for years. We do not desire to interfere with what may be termed the utilities of public service, but would rather see reductions in expenditure directed to the increase of means for the injuring of mankind by bloodshed: I see from the Budget speech -that the expenditure from war loans is decreasing, and that is very satisfactory., ['now desire to turnto the comparison. of total expenditure. We are told in the Budget speech that the total actual, expenditure for 1920-21 was £92,87.^314,' -while the estimated expenditure for 1921-22 is £81,397,632. There is' an increase, of £1,495,448 out of .Works loan, anda decrease in the expenditure out of revenue of £19,629, while the decrease of expenditure out of war loan is £12,952,501, making the net decrease £11,476,682. I desire to draw the attention 'of the Treasurer to these figures. This Budget' deals with millions of pounds more than was the case . a . few years ago. It has gone up by leaps and bounds. I have been thinking of what happened in the 1910-13 Parliament, when the Labour party was sitting on the Government benches. It was then that we tprovided for all those works which have been the backbone of this country .during Tecent years, although we' were, at the time, held up to ridicule and condemned, .The right honourable the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) himself wrote a work called The Financial Carnival. In it he stated thatYet another reason for keen scrutiny remains. A new order of tilings with respect to auditing has been inaugurated by the present Treasurer. The balance-sheet of any private firm or company is uBually signed by the auditor. 'In.the case of the Commonwealth transactions there is no such report or signature by the Auditor General. I want to remind the right honourable gentleman that those remarks are as' applicable to-day as they were when' they Where is the Auditor General's report on the present Budget? sence of that report. The Auditor-General's report is valuable for the purpose of indicating to members whether certain items in the Estimates should' be permitted, and whether there is anything irregular about them. It is impossible to get that information from the statement presented to the House by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). Evidently Parliament is in no better position to-day than when the Treasurer wrote that pamphlet, for we still have the Budget before us without having the Auditor-General's report",29,Budget 1921 22

The following passage also occurs in The Financial The. total taxation per head laBt year for all it is necessary to impose additional taxaAustralia was at least £5'5s. per head-£2 6 5s. per family. On the average, therefore, every family pays 10s.. per week in taxation. Add to this the vicious, cycle set up by our Arbitration Courts, by means of which all the awards are made eventually, to land on the shoulders of those who ask for them, and the mystery _ of the tremendous increase in the cost of living begins to clear perceptibly. We are "" paying for our whistle,"" and paying for it dearly. If we were "" p a y in g for our whistle and paying for it dearly "" when it cost £ 5 5s. per head, what can be said when it is costing us £ 1 2 18s. l i d . per head ? It does not now appear to be a "" financial carnival,"" but a financial tornado. And we are getting r i d of the money. Out of £31,000,000 goes for war services. This leaves £33,000,000 with which the right honourable the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) has to manage the affairs of Australia., outside of war services. ""When the . strictures contained in The Financial Carnival were made against the party on this side of the House, the. Government was not getting anything like that amount of revenue. I think that the total amount £20,000,000. To-day,with a revenue of £33,000,000, the Government is unable to make ends meet. I can only point these things out so that the right honourable gentleman may have his memory refreshed. » The publio debt of the country has in creased considerably, and, to-be fair, one has to admit that the war is chiefly responsible. wholly responsible. approved of entering into the war must expect a bill of this kind, but to-day the newspapers that urged Parliament. and the people to leave no stone unturned, and to spend every shilling obtainable, to prosecute the war, are condemning Parliament because of the heavy expenditure. Our debt to-day is £401,720,000, of which a sum of £69,710,993 is recoverable from the States. This leaves a net debt of £332,009.032, which is less now by £8,800,872 than it was at the end of June, 1920. Whatever attitude members take up, ithey ought to be fair, and say that Parliament was responsible for committing-the country to the war debt. That debt has to be carried, and, w h a t Carnival:^ever else happens, it must be met. If tion for the purpose of meeting it , theburden must be borne. We cannot repu-j diate the debt. shoulders. need. I believe that an expensive mistakewas made by this Government with regard to war gratuities. Members on this side of the House urged, when the last appeal to the country was made, that the money for war. gratuities should be:, borrowed, and. that the soldiers should' be paid in cash. ' In the light of what has transpired since, it is obvious that our advice was correct. The Government the £64,000,000 of revenue, could have borrowed ab that time at 5 per cent. We now pay 5^ per cent, to the lads who hold the gratuity bonds. Thei per cent, would have paid the cost, of floating a loan, and the public debt of this country would not have been in creased one shillingby the loan. On the other hand,a great deal of trouble and much expense of administration would have been saved. The cost to the coun-' try would not have been half of what it approached has actually been. The Labour party's-advice would have . saved probably ' £100,000,or more, if it had been f o i -: lowed. «Unfortunately, Parliament did''not accept the advice, and it was decided'' to cash gratuity bonds 'according to the-* circumstances of the recipient'. To-day' the branch of the Department dealing 11 with these bonds has to be kept alive, b u t 1 if the Labour party's advice had been acted upon the work would have been': is almost completed some time ago, and the staff , might have been dispensed with. In regard to sinking funds, I consider that it is a good thing that we are providing funds to liquidate our debt., This coun^-, try ought to make ample provision byputting money into sinking funds to liqui--, date that debt. We cannot continue to* carry the present burden of debt yearafter year, and the sooner we can liqui date it the better it w ill be for all. It may take a long time to meet the"" obligation, but if we make ample provision, we will be doing the right thing.

I fail to see bow they will ever discharge their obligations if property values, fall. that many of these men, after struggling for three or four years, will be unable to go on paying for their homes, and will have to leave them. The soldiers do not know what their houses will actually cost. The complaint is that the Department has agreed to provide dwellings for a certain sum, and when the soldiers have received their accounts the total cost has run into £200 or £300 more than the amount agreed upon. These are matters to which we cannot shut our eyes. While the press has been crying for economy in regard to necessary expenditure, it has only made casual comments on the administration of the War Service Homes/Why has the press not featured this subject as a reason for the displacement of the Government? It is because the press does not know who might get into power. The Government .is able to carry on its maladministration at great cost to the country, and yet remain on the Treasury' bench. For incurring one-half the loss sustained in connection with our War Service Homes, a Government in New South Wales-according to my experience of that Statewonld have been replaced within twenty four hours. We appear to have grown very indifferent during the war period. We still seem to be in the clouds, and are willing to forgive political misdeeds, irrespective of what they are costing the country. A good deal of the money expended on these homes could have been saved, and that would have represented legitimate economy. War pensions have been very much reduced. By way of a final protest, I point out that they have been reduced unjustifiably. The returned men have not had a fair deal. stances where they were entitled to a full pension, and in other cases where a proportionate payment was justified, they have been completely deprived of the pension on the ground that their disability was not due to war-like operations. Where men have served their country, it should not be necessary for them to lose a leg or an arm, or suffer similar bodily injury, to entitle them to a pension. If their earning power has been diminished through their going to the war, they, have a claim on the country. On the question of immigration, majt We can expect, therefore, I suggest that we should first put our own house in order? Lord Northcliffe, and others, may feel' constrained to plead for more population in Australia, but we should begin, by. finding employment for our own people, and making them contented. Then let us make land available for future immigrants. If we could place them on the land under a proper scheme, so soon as they reach these shores, without their coming into competition with people already working here, the Labour party would not object, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that thousands of our own citizens are unemployed to-day, and there is no prospect of immediate improvement in the position. What is taking place in other parts of the world,\as a result of the war, is being reflected in Australia, and we contend that, until we can find constant employment for our own people, no immigrants should be brought out. Quite recently, some immigrants, who could not get employment here, returned to Great Britain. houses. ' went back declaring that Australia waa not what it had been represented to theia to be. Could there be a worse advertisement for the Commonwealth than that?: The Government are now providing for a joint immigration scheme for .the States and the Commonwealth, and although' some of the States have not'expressed a willingness to participate, money is being made available for the purpose of bringing out immigrants. The first duty of Parliament is to make available land that will be most suitI n some inable for settlement. From one end of Australia to the other the best land is held by a few individuals. Advocates of immigration should begin by passing laws in the Federal and State Parliaments to compel the owners of large areas which are not being used to the best advantage to cut the land up and make it available for those who wish to come here from overseas. The best immigrant is the man who comes out to Australia of his own accord, who",33,Budget 1921 22

I have before me a report by the Acting' Administrator, dated 13th June, 1920, in which he statesAlthough two out of every three men in Darwin were unemployed on the closing of the meat works, there was no rioting or disturbance of any kind. The Territory has been remarkably free from serious crime during the whole year. This law-abiding attitude of the workers was, I believe, largely due to the Prime Minister's pledge that the people of the Northern Territory would be granted representation in the Federal Parliament, after having had the parliamentary franchise taken from them since 1911. I think the taunts that have been hurled at the workers here, by certain misinformed people, that they are variously Bolshevists, Industrial Workers of the World, and Anarchists, can be refuted by the record they hold that a larger percentage of men voluntarily enlisted for the Front than in any other part of Australia, that they subscribed more per capita to the Bed Cross Fund, that they carried the conscription referenda on every occasion, and have erected a magnificent monument in-Darwin to their fallen comrades. . There could be no better testimony to the loyalty ' of the people of the Northern. Territory Here is a further statement residents. , from the same report It is an interesting reflection that while the various States of. the Commonwealth during ' the last forty-six years have been covered with telegraph lines, even to the most remote settlements, not one mile has been built by the Government in the Territory, and yet it can be and no' other agency, for the expenditure incurred, is more stimulating to development. . . . .

The statement of the Acting Administrator proceedsFor twenty years the people of the Northern Territory, thanks to South Australia, enjoyed the fullest franchise, and could proudly claim both State and Federal representation. On the 1st January, 1911, the Commonwealth assumed the control of the Territory, and all citizenship and voting power was taken from them, and this condition has continued, up to .the present, although section 122 of the Commonwealth ' Constitution ' expressly provides that ""The Parliament may make laws for the",34,Budget 1921 22

A new era is dawning for the Territory; there is now a definite prospect of thc early introduction of legislation to give the people of the Northern Territory a representative in the Federal Parliament, and this has given general satisfaction. We have the power to give them representation in accordance with the terms of promises made; but nothing has yet been done. I desire now to call attention to some features of administration in the Mandated Territories. It is my intention to quote from reports published in the Age, wherein certain statements 'are made by persons who, obviously, possess a wide knowledge of the Mandated Islands. If these comments and charges contain any considerable proportion of truth, I can only say that the sooner action is taken by this Parliament the better it w ill be for Australia.

The officers of the Commission are drawn mostly from men who, before the change-over, were employed as clerks, or in some other minor capacity, and they have adopted a policy which has established cliques and led to many quarrels on the island. A typical instance is given, in which the manager and an Australian who ssrved for four years in the A J.F. was concerned. The Australian was at work in his oflicfc when the manager entered-and he went on working. The manager rebuked him, and ordered that he should stand up when his superior entered the room.

Not only should the exemption be increased, but it should be made uniform,' and ample allowance should be made in respect of children. I shall say nothing about the annual average proposal of the Treasurer until the Bill is before us; but I wish to say a few words on the proposal that the recipients of the rebates distributed by co-operative societies shall not Ibe taxed on these rebates if the societies have already paid taxation on the money. It must be remembered that a society formed in accordance with the Rochdale system of co-operation is quite different' from an ordinary co-operative company which seeks to make .profit. Under the Rochdale system, .working' people combine to purchase goods at wholesale prices for distribution among themselves. The societies charge for . these goods something like current prices, so that they may get sufficient capital to work on; but when their balance-sheets are made up at the end of the half-year, or at other intervals, they repay to their members any sum they may have over and above what is necessary for working expenses. These repayments are not in the nature of dividends on money invested; they are merely a return of capital. to the interest paid by Savings Banks? r",35,Budget 1921 22

During the war it was said from almost every platform that the war was a war to end war, and that the useless expenditure on armaments for the destruction of mankind would cease after we had won the war. The Labour party stood behind every movement for bringing about disarmament. The members of it supported the establishment of the League of Nations when prominent men threw cold water on it.' We saw that it would make for the salvation of the peoples if we could get them to come together for the settlement of international disputes without recourse to the arbitrament of war. But we have been met with opposition from unexpected quarters. the Assembly of the League, forty-eight countries were represented, and it was resolved, on the motion of Lord -Cecil, that there should be no further expenditure on armaments for at least two years, What the to give time for the putting into operaseveral of the big nations of the world are to be held at Washington to discuss, disarmament or the limitation of armaHughes), as I said a week or so ago, did not appear too sympathetic with the object in view, and an utterance which he made in Sydney last week supports my dentHarding had come down from the clouds, and believes that what is practicable is not disarmament, but the limitation ' of armaments, he is with him whole-heartedly.

We on this side stand for preventing war altogether if that be at all possible. We believe that there should be an understanding amongst the peqples of the world recognising that we are all brothers. Every effort should be made to prevent the expenditure of money upon weapons of destruction and to divert its expenditure to purposes of more advantage to the people of every country. That is the policy which the Opposition placed before the public from time to time during the war. We expected that after the war the leading menEstimates of the current year for that Deof all countries would bend their energies in that direction. We did not look to them to be talking about the likelihood of war in this or that part of the world, and the necessity for preparing for it, because party now iptend that that expenditure as surely as we have preparation for war, so surely will that bring about war. That has been the experience of the world. If we bend our energies in the opposite direct ment of the country?

If that course be followed we may hope that something will be done to realize the de^ sire expressed in the preaching of the Nazarene many years ago. He did not preach war. On the contrary, He looked for a time when the implements for the destruction of the human race would be beaten into ploughshares. all that we can to hasten the' advent of that time, but we cannot do so unless some effort is made to curtail expenditure on armaments. We on this side are prepared, in common with the members of the Country party, to have the Estimates referred back to the Government for the purpose of reconsideration, but we have no wish to bring about any interference with necessary works. there should be further unemployment in connection with the Small Arms Factory or any other Government institution. of which notice has been given is carried,, the Small Arms Factory will go. byrnong Factory, too.

When two or more amendments npon the same grant are at the same time tendered to the Committee, the Chairman puts first the amendment which proposes the largest reduction, and then, if that be not accepted, the lesser amendments. And so on. That is the practice followed, not only in the House of Commons, but in this Parliament, and in the Parliaments of the States. I , therefore, rule that the amendment submitted by the ton) is now open for discussion, and when that has been disposed of, the main questiou may be open to further amendment. I should like to congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the close resemblance of the terms of his amendment . to those of an amendment notice of which . I have had on the business-paper for the last fortnight. There is some slight difference in the actual terms of the two amendments, and I hope when the present amendment has been disposed of' in the manner referred to by the Chairman, to bring forward one which will appeal, nob merely to"" the members of the Opposition, but to honourable members on the Government side as well. It will be an amendment which should appeal to the whole of the members of the Committee, and will permit of this matter of finance being dealt with as it ought to be-as a non-party matter. It should do away with the folly of preventing Parliament, which is really elected to deal with the finances of the country, having no say, other than as permitted by the"" Government, in the disposal of funds raised by taxation. I may say at once that I shall oppose the amendment now before the Chair in its present form, because I do not think it is possible, in existing circumstances, to reduce the Defence Estimates by £2,817,000. be able to show that it is possible to re0 duce the Estimates, as a whole, by that amount, and, in such a wfiy as will not entail the dismal picture painted: by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr when the individual items were under Charlton) of the curtailment of the expenditure on postal services. I hope, before I sit down, to be able ,to suggest a better system than that now adopted for dealing with the postal service. The trouble relates not so much to the amount that is voted for the Department as to the time of the year at which it is placed at its disposal. The money is frequently made available in about the tenth month of the financial year, and the Department, in its effort to expend ib within the brief period at its disposal, is very like a carpet-snake that has swallowed a smalt wallaby whole, and has to sleep throughout the winter to digest it. Tne Department cannot digest the funds placed at its disposal so late in"" the year if Several honourable members interjecting, ter) I make a strong appeal to honourable members to cease these interjections. It is manifestly unfair, that an honourable member addressing the Chair should be prevented by such persistent interruption, from giving full expression to his views. that no one has fought harder than my colleagues and I have done, both inside this chamber and outside of it, for the extension of postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities. At its entrance, in^o this Parliament ° the Country party at once challenged the ' Government on its method of administering the finances and presenting its financial statement. The Government immediately beat the party drum, and by a party vote defeated our first attempt. The only result achieved was the securingof a definite promise by the Government that the Budget for the succeeding year would be presented not later than August or September, so that honourable members might have an ©pportunity to discuss the national expenditure before the money was actually spent. When the Budget was presented last year, we discussed it at length, and submitted a motion providing for a reduction of the total estimated expenditure by £1,000,000. UnI think I shall fortunately, the newer members on the Government side of the House were deluded by Ministers into the belief that they would be able to effect reductions consideration, and they declined iu the circumstances to support us in this demand for economy.

An examination of the Budget shows that, as compared with' the expenditure last year, it provides for an increase of £1,030,000 on the cost of running the ordinary services. The Country party again raises the issue of economy. It recognises the responsibility of honourable members for making some very determined effort, whether the Government wishes it or not, not only to square the ledger, so far as revenue and expenditure are concerned, but also to. put the public finances in such a position that we can give a lead both to the States and to private enterprise in making some provision to meet the tremendous commitments of the next few years. We desire again to point out the folly of regarding such action as a party matter, and the .absurdity, of making a vote on a matter of reduction of expenditure a question' of want of confidence in the Government. I say that, not because I have any reason to wish that the Government shall continue in office, but because our position is so serious that we must view this matter as we looked at some of the big national issues during the war-w e must deal with it as a united, and not as a divided, nation: party's gun is not loaded. not loaded is that from which the Deputy devastate the world.

National 'economy means something more than not spending a few pounds here and discharging a man or two there. It means more than just balancing expenditure with income.

The renewal at such a rate of the States' loans would increase the annual interest bill by, say,"" 2 per cent., or £3,000,Q00. The total annual increase in respect of the interest (bill payable by the Commonwealth and . the States will be £5,250,000 if .the present price of money is maintained. Eveni f the. market improves,, and we have to pay only half this interest, there will still Ibe an increase of £2,600,000 per annum in the expenditure under this heading alone; and as against it we shall have nothing to show. meet the present position, and to restore and improve our national credit to such an extent as to justify a conversion scheme, is to confine all borrowing to developmental purposes. To save the additional impost that borrowing in a bad market would impose, it is imperative that we should improve our credit. Mr ""WEST I said all that twenty years ago. not of .any avail when times are bad. The possession of railways, ships, land, oir soldiers' homes, especially when most are the war gratuity of showing huge losses, will not help, although the Treasurer seems to think that it will, if one may judge from his statement on page 11 of his Budget speech, because he makes no differentiation between war debts, against which we have no assets, and the £60,000,000 which he says are represented by tangible assets. Therefore, when it is asserted that the public debt is not a burden because'it is represented by tangible assets, it becomes, a misunderstanding of the nature of crea total of dit. Even granting that the States have carried out public works with the £16,750,000 loaned by the Commonwealth, there is no means of testing their saleable value, because there is no market in which they could be sold. The real 1919. 1921. security for the public-creditor is not the* assets in which his money is invested, but the character of the people to whom he. lends, and their reputation in money dealings. We have seen this demonstrated in the wool market. Banking; puthorities lend money, not against the wool, but against the man's reputation, which, after all, is the prime factor in financial transactions. to a bank and asks for an advance against his produce, the banker will inquire about his character, and not about the quantity of wheat he holds? estimate the character of a customer by the condition of his account over a stated period. On various occasions I have had dealings with respect to mortgages. It is well known that if a man makes no effort to increase his margin of security, peoplewho are accustomed to lending money against securities' will not touch him at all. And this is rapidly becoming the. position of the Government. The best method is to live within one's income, seas to reduce indebtedness, and at the same time to have the reputation of being anxious to continue to do so.

To an individual confronted with a parallel situation as Australia, there aire only two alternative courses, namely, (1) increase his income,or (2) diminish his expenditure. crease its income unduly because its revenue comes out of taxation which, as 'we see in certain cases-the Post Office and New South Wales Railways may be quoted as instances-ha s already reached its limit. Further increases in rates and charges will only lessen returns. Therefore, the only course open is to reduce expenditure.

He has not saved any money, but has simply taken the difference, viz., £1,500,000, of loan money which he has saved from Repatriation, and provided for its expenditure on other matters. This seems to be a deliberate attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public. ber, by omitting the facts, is deliberately throwing dust in the eyes of the people now. planation of these continual deficits in Australia? Surely, it is that the problem has been approached from the wrong end. The Treasurer estimates the Government expenditure, and then makes its income stretch out to cover it . L e t us adopt the usual business process of estimating our income, and then insisting upon expenditure coming within it . This policy has England. In a circular sent to all the Government Departments, by the authority of the British Cabinet, the Under Secretary to the Treasurer stated that in order to enable revenue ancl expenditure to balance in 1922-1923, there must be a drastic reduction 'of expenditure. He said there was' no hope of solving the financial problem that confronted the nation by additional borrowings or additional taxation. He directed the attention of the Government Departments to the fact that i u 1922-1923, the total amount available for the Supply services-, which now cost £602,751,000, will be £490,000,000, a reduction of approximately 20 per cent. The circular insists that each Department shall at once take steps to bring about a reduction of 20 per cent, in its expenditure by the beginning of 1922-1923, or earlier. What have we available to spend on glance at the sources of our national income will show us that prices for our principal products are approximating to those It is true the Treabefore the war. Wool is about at the pre-war level, butter is falling rapidly, hides are down, meat is almost unsaleable, sugar has dropped, jam is a drug on the market, timber mills have ceased working in many parts of the Commonwealth, mining operations generally are suspended, and wheat is falling. All primary products are in a slump which may last for years. Indeed, the index figures' previously quoted suggest that it will last for years. Even manufactures have decreased in total quantity, though soaring prices have deluded us into the idea that they are rapidly expanding. New South Wales, for example, produced, in 1920, £16,607,000 only, based' on the value of her products in 1911, as against a production in 1911 of £19,143,000a reduction of nearly 20 per cent, in quantity. Last year we had a trade balance against us of £32,000,000, our imports exceeding our exports by that amount. This year our exports, which pay practically the whole of our external interest, and a good proportion of our income tax, are less in quantity, and our imports, which must pay the whole of our Customs duties; have slumped to the extent of nearly 40 per cent. . Despite this, the Treasurer has budgeted for this revenue from the optimistic side. It is true he allowed for been adopted in a decrease of £5,750,000 from Customs and Excise, or 16 per cent, of last year's total, or 25 per cent, of the Customs total alone, but this does not cover the f a l l .",45,Budget 1921 22

As regards income tax, despite the fact that the exports were £18,000,000 less last year than in 1919-20, and despite the fact that manufactures have lessened in their total quantity, the Treasurer estimates that the income tax will yield £750,000 more than was received in the last financial year. The exports have fallen from £19,000,000 in the first two the Treasurer's months of last year to £16,000,000 in the first two months of this financial year, and every one knows that scores of taxpayers havo not the wherewithal to pay wages, let alone taxes.

191,Sir Joseph Cook,"It may interest theunsatisfactory, state of affairs. The gross. earnings for the year to June, 1919, totalled £2,294,354, while for the year 1,920 they fell to £1,180,150. Insurance and brokerage .showed at £84,377 in 1919, but declined to £50,262 in 1920. This shows that the gross earnings are £1,148,319 less than in the year 1920. Against this the gross expenditure was only reduced by ' £184,991 , while the total profits slumped from. £1,160,034 to, £137,958.' This, profit of £137,958 was; only arrived at after writing off £50,000' less under the heading ""Depreciation"" than the amount ' of the previous year. In view .of the enormous slump in freights now being faced, to assume that,the Consolidated Revenue is likely to be enhanced from the Commonwealth Shipping Line, is indeed an optimistic forecast. Sir JOSEPH member aware that this year 10 per cent, is being paid to a depreciation fund ? are charging' 8s"". per case, they ought to do so! estimated from the Australian Note Issue, shown at £1,400,000, seems excessive in the light of the fact that a profit of only £304,000 was shown for the seven months' period from December, 1920, to June, 1921. To my mind, with the very stagnant condition of trade generally and the very serious outlook with regard to markets, it would be a very simple matter for the revenue of the Commonwealth now under review to fal l short of what has been anticipated by . from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000, the lower figure alone making a total deficit of £5,800,000, which would practically. obliterate the so-called surplus and necessitate the discovery of sources of taxation hitherto untapped. The. English Chancellor of the Exchequer . anticipated £200,000,000 come, and in six months the ac-' tual drop has been £163,000,000. The Treasurer has left out of his calculations any such possible drop, and proudly.says in a-Sydney interview that he is not very, much concerned with what' England is doing, and that we are in a ; very much better' position. Y e t the day before' he had-'put' a B ill through, this House authorizing' h i m to borrow fSjOOOjOOO from ' a!country that is, in his opinion, in a desperate position. That, the Estimates of the Treasurer are not very carefully. drawn .is indicated by the slipshod manner in which the departmental revenue is prepared, as. can be_ seen by comparing the estimated and actual revenue of 1920-21. The item of . nearly £3,000,000 excess from Customs and.. Excise, a shortage of nearly £1,000,000 in estimated Post Office revenue, an excess of £750,000 in income tax, a shortage, of just ou £2,000,000 in war-time profits, tax, and a.shortage of nearly £500,000 from the detained enemy vessels, all point a very serious lesson as to the unwisdom of this Committee in relying on the Treasurer's Estimates too implicitly. To sum up, at the best our position is that the total national income, from COOK -I s t he honourable which ultimately all taxation must come,will be little more than during the pre-war period, but the revenue to be raised W h e n the robbers out of that income is about three times the pre-war revenue. ment for a responsible man to make. wealth taxation to produce the revenue expected has risen from £2 9s. in 1913 to £9 12s. per head in 1921. This taxation, it. must not be forgotten, must in the future be derived from a gross national income approximating pre-warvolume and values, out of which our hugely increased State taxation must also come. This tax on industry, which even at tbe present inflated prices seems so excessive, and which has been so extremely embarrassing to industry that many have had to pay. their taxes by borrowing, must be increasingly oppressive under the certain conditions of lower prices, because the tax must continue, seeing that national a drop _ of liabilities have accrued which did not prei n his annual ' in viously exist, and w ill be a, permanent charge on revenue, and against which .we have no reproductive or, tangible assets. Of such are the interest and sinking fund on the war debt of £300,000,000 and the £6,000,000 to £7,000,000.per year for war pensions, while .our promises to our returned soldiers are, in a large measure, still unredeemed.

242,Mr Gabb,"Does the Treasurer ( SirI intend to take another opportunity of dealing with the maladministration of the War Service Departments. The response of the Australian public to appeals for money has been most generous and spontaneous. The work done by the soldiers has been generously recognised on all sides, although the Prime Minister lakes all the credit to himself for giving them the rewards to which they are entitled. The Treasurer seeks to make war expenditure a matter that is above criticism. No one objects to the soldiers being treated generously, but a well-considered and well administered scheme is necessary to secure fair treatment for them. Why should the wretched administration of war pensions be allowed to engender definite grievances, not merely against the Government, b n t also against Australia, by a harsh and rigorous system of' administration against incapacitated men, while thousands cf pounds are wasted by physically fit men in official positions? Does the £450,000 spent on sawmills in Queensland, which have never worked, come out of revenue . or loan moneys? What provision is made for the £140,000 which has to be written off soldiers' homes not properly constructed? come out of revenue or loan funds ? What provision is made for war gratuity payments? W ill this all come out of loan funds? Commonwealth debt has been reduced during the year. consideration, the war gratuity liability? Surely, at least, some sinking f u n d should ba established for this. We are spending £739,739 less on war pensions this year than we spent last year, and the Treasurer is spending out of revenue £2,000,000 less on war services. expenditure out of revenue on war services last year was £33,286,233, and the estimate this year is £31,203,253. The expenditure from loan funds"" last year was £24,148,501, ahd this year the estimate is £11,196,000. The Treasurer has thus estimated a decrease of £15,000,000 in the expenditure, but of this decrease only £2,000,000 is deducted from revenue, while the remaining £13,000,000 is from loans The further we get from the war the less war expenditure the Treasurer pays from revenue. It is a moot point whether it is right to regard interest and sinking f u n d on debt as a war service. Such liabilities have come to stay, and the present method of treating them is misleading. [480]2 I have not time to go more deeply into the various items of the Budget. I have briefly indicated the prospects of our national income, the influence on production of the present heavy strangling taxation, and the huge commitments f alling due. I have exposed the hollowness of the Treasurer's professions of alleged economy, and pointed out the path whereby financial righteousness can be achieved and national solvency maintained. Though the straight and narrow path is always a difficult one to tread, yet it is absolutely essential that we must tread it , for in a very few years we may have to undertake helavier obligations with regard to naval defence than any yet considered. Before passing on, I would like to ask the Treasurer a few plain questions. Is the slovenliness of the Budget a reflection of the irresponsibility and general methods of the administration of the Leader of the Government ? Are the evidences of dummying I have given mere slips, or are ithey deliberately intended to deceive the public ? W h y is the revenue of the Post Oflice taken from that DepartW ill this ment and allotted to other governmental activities, and in its place loan moneys voted to the Post Office for carrying out its works? W h y is the £162,000 for The Treasurer says that the assisted passages to immigrants paid out of loans instead of out of revenue? How Does this take into can taxation ever be reduced if our in debtedness and interest bill is increased in every Budget? If the Prime Minister thinks debt is a dead weight, why not start to remove it straight way? It cannot get any deader. Is the method of manufacturing a surplus by underestiThe mating the income £2,000,000, cutting out new works £972,000, savings on old age pensions £140,000, skinning the soldiers for £500,000 war gratuity in terest, and failin g to spend £150,000 on soldiers' graves, the sole property of the Government ? "" I have indicated many places where gross extravagance and unexplained increases in administration have taken place, and a possibility of large reductions. This has been possible without any knowledge of departmental workings. It is not my duty, but the duty of the exe'cu» tive Government, to say where the most ready economy can be effected, and which services should bear the brunt of that . economy. That is a matter where inside departmental knowledge would alone 'avail. All I say is that the present Public Service is already too big in proportion to the population and production of this country, that it must not be increased without very cogent reasons, and that i m mediate economy can be effected, should be effected, and, so f a r as my colleagues and myself are concerned, must be effected. It should be effected, not by the superficial method of stopping well-earned increments ito f a it h f u l servants, b u t through the re-organization of the whole Service and tbe securing of general efficiency. That this method is the only way to do it is evidenced by the attitude taken up by the British Treasury, which in a circular places this duty on Departments themselvesIn order to enable revenue and expenditure to balance in 1922-23, there must be a drastic reduction in expenditure. There is no hope of solving the financial problem that confronts the nation by additional borrowings or additional taxation. . . . It is certain that any increase in taxation would seriously hamper the recovery of British industry and commerce, and thus ultimately intensify the difficulty of the position, and would on that account be most vehemently opposed by the House of Commons, and by public opinion in the country; indeed, what is required in order to maintain and stimulate industry and commerce-and secure full and regular employment in the country-is a reduction of taxation and of the burden of the State's indebtedness as rapidly as possible, a process which ean only be achieved by a continuous reduction of expenditure throughout the next few years, . . . It is recognised that it will be impossible to carry out the degree of economy demanded by the financial situation and still preserve all the existing services carried on by the State. Therefore the Treasury circular, with the authority of the Cabinet behind it, instructs each Department to take into consideration the abolition of some of the services under its control, even though these services represent functions imposed by Statute. Wiherei t is necessary to obtain parliamentary sanction by means of a Bill to the abolition of any existing services, the Government will do so. With this I agree, both as regards stagether a special finance committee of men tutory and ordinary appropriations, and of the experience of l o r d Inchcape. I will give any Government which faces the position from that aspect. in this Chamberu n t i l a proper CommitThe British Government has done' this. tee of Ways and Means is appointed What has our own Government done in from all parties, or even a special Comthree years to bring down the cost of mittee of Finance, consisting of represengovernment?

We will never put our house in order unless we proceed on principles of sound business and accepted common sense. Every known business firm in Australia of any standing is preparing for trouble, brought about by falling prices, by meeting every possible expense out of revenue and not calling on capital. Micawber's axiom is still true-20s . income, 20s. 6d. expenditure, and the result is misery; 20s. income, 19s. 6d. expenditure, and the result is happiness. It is not merely Happiness, but safety, that lies in the course of keeping our expenditure w it h in our means. This year Australia hopes for a good season. Picture Australia's position if we had a bad season, and the present method of finance were continued next year. I s it wise, is it safe, to juggle w it h the f u t u r e by budgeting for deficiencies w it h a revenue raised under the highest rates of taxation ever levied in Australia? Our demand to square the ledger, and establish adequate sinking funds, so as to maintain our credit is the only sane and prudent course. An y other than this is utter madness. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) says that English conditions differ from ours. Great Britain's income w ill be £100,000,000 short of the estimate. I have shown that ours may easily be short of the Treasurer's expectations.

If the same deduction had been made last year in connection with that Line as in connection with any ordinary shipping line, there would have ibeen over £300,000 profit this year.

It is the same with the Commonwealth Bank"" as with the Shipping Line. They take care that the Treasurer does not handle much party can of their profits. They try to cover up the profits in every possible way; but the profits are made. In the Commonwealth Bank the profits go to reserves, and in the Shipping Line they go to depreciation. My complaint is that I do not get hold of those profits; but, nevertheless, they are made. Last year the Commonwealth Line made nearly £500,000 profit gross.

He is silent. when I get up to speak. a good deal more to say when we get to the actual discussion of the Convention proposal, and nowhere in this House will there be greater divergence of opinion on that matter than in the Country partys express our divergence here, which is more than you are prepared to do. Sir JOSEPH COOK The n there is a divergence, and the Leader of the Country party was not correct in saying that his party was behind him in urging this Convention. where we stand.

In making such comparisons he should bave made them in regard to every other aspect of public life, as well as in respect to the Budget presented in him make the comparison in regard to every other State. The Treasurer of Tasmania, according to this morning's newspapers, states that in the last three or four years his expenditure has in creased 63 per cent. I was reading some figures recently relating to all the States, and I hope to present them to the House to-morrow.

Meantime, I repeat that I .shall give the Does he Committee one simple example of the way in which the honourable member can juggle figures. He stated that I saved £1,500,000 out of war expenditure last year. This is the way in which ho said that I had manufactured surpluses: I had saved this £1,500,000 out He was in it ; he of war expenditure and had increased the expenditure this year by £1,500,000. COOK -Of course; Now that sounds very bad. But why did the honourable member not tell the Committee of all the new expenditure which I have in the Budget for this year?

Committee of tbe £200,000 which I am called upon to pay in respect of mails carried during the war? Why did not the honourable member inform the Committee of the £200,000 more required fox. old-age pensions, and of the half-a-dozen other obligations of a somewhat similar kind ? Among these latter there is a total of practically £200,000 in connection with the per capita payments to the ""States. With these various sums alone there is furnished in this year's Budget a total of £2,500,000, which no one can escape unless he is prepared to go in for a policy of repudiation. There is a sum of nearly £3,000,000, consisting of new expenditure which is inescapable. There is no question of whether that money is being spent prudently or otherwise, but it is a simple matter of whether we are going to pay our debts or repudiate them. When considering problems of retrenchment and readjustment one must pay one's debts, whatever else one does. It would have been fairer for the Leader of theCountry party, therefore, while accusing me of extravagance, in that I have £1,000,000 more upon my revenue side of the ledger this year, if he had told the Committee of this sum of from: £3,000,000 to £4,000,000, comprising obligations which neither he nor I nor any one else dare attempt to shirk. ThereI .leave the honourable member, with his non-party speech, his bitter diatribe. had two of them to-day. Sir. JOSEPH COOK Then his Leader's speech was a bitter one after a l l ! 1 The honourable member for Franklin( Mr orable members opposite that in France,, McWilliams) should know. He is and has been a good judge. He himself has, been a party leader. Indeed, I fancy that he has had something to do with the framing of the speech delivered by his present Leader. I take his word for it that the speech of the honourable member for Cowper was a bitter one, and, if mine also was a little bitter, I am sure it will be admitted, that there was some justification. I desire to make just one more reference this evening, and that, is to the constant way in which the lead given by the Imperial Government is being, pointed out to me. I am being told that the Commonwealth should finance: as do. the -British authorities. I rather hope that we shall not. do so. As I see things in Great Britain, we are doing very much, better here. We have fewer obligations burdening our shoulders;, we are in am altogether better and more privileged position. There,, they are proposing! to borrow £100,000,0.00. to square the revenue accounts. Here, we have a large surplus. While honourable members opposite want to destroy our defence estimates-a t any r>ate, to cut them down to-the extent of three-fifths of their totalI would remind them that our modest little amount is £7,000>000, but that the sum set aside for defence by the British Treasurer is £201,000,000. They say £.7,000,000 is too much for Australia by two-fifths of its total. day are better off because' there are no armaments in Germany knows that the German workers did not disarm themselves, and that they would arm again to-morrow if they were permitted to do so. The German workers did not disarm themselves; the Allies did it for them. I would remind honourable members opposite once more that, in addition to the enormous total of £201,000,000 set aside solely for defence in Great Britain this year, that great democratic country of France, whose Government, I suppose, consists one-half of Socialists and Syndicalists, as a normal running conthink we have cern type as the Treasurer. to-day, the Budget for defence alonetotals £204,000,000. In the United Statesof America the defence vote amounts to £300,000,000, while Japan is getting well, on towards £150,000,000, in respect of the defence estimates, of that country. These are the defence budgets all about us. Here are the guns pointing all round us. Honourable members opposite say,. "" Scrap ours."" Very well! I am hound to ask whether this is the time, after all, for cutting down our defence estimates. The Disarmament Conference will shortly be held.

282,Sir Joseph Cook,"I remind honits hands, as yet, upon its defence votes. Bather, all are awaiting the outcome of the Disarmament Conference. wisdom and sanity, a test of their outlook on life. Here is a disturbed world, armed to the teeth, with sporadic fires still breaking out after the recent volcanic conflagration. And the statesmen of the world say, as prudent men, "" Let us be careful, ere we begin disarming, until we have tested the sense of the world upon the subject."" But honourable members opposite have no such qualms. They do not fear anything.. They have the most of all to lose, however; the most cherished ideals of all, the greatest liberty, the greatest privileges of all; the greatest country to develop and defend. But they say, "" No matter what other people may do-le t them arm, or disarm, as they like-w e will not arm. Bather, we will reduce our armaments, and so place ourselves more and more at the tender mercies of people with whom we have no sympathy, whose outlook on life is altogether different from ours, whose destiny is as far removed from that of the inhabitants of this country as is the east from the west."" just like Lord Northcliffe did when here. Lord Northcliffe did to"" you fellows."" 19 that I am also. A t any rate, I hope that the debate will develop in a less bitter spirit than it has opened. I sincerely trust that we shall hear no more non-party speeches of the kind delivered to-day. If the speech of the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper, was non-party in character, then, for Heaven's sake, let the party fires burn! None could burn more fiercely than the blaze which has been characterized as a mild, non-party essay. I hope the honourable member will review bis speech. look over it . so; I shall punctuate it here and there. or puncture it? Sir Members will learn to-morrow. surer move an amendment before he sits down. that that might be a good idea. One pound has been offered, ten shillings also. Those among the general public occupying the galleries to-night will probably have noted with some bitterness th© hard and ironical laughter of older and more experienced politicians present in the chamber when the suggestion was made that the discussion on Australia's finances should proceed without recourse to heated partisan feeling. My view is that no motion should be .debated, or vote taken, in this Parliament-excep t in respect of a direct motion of censure, or want of confidence-upo n strict party -lines. I have listened to the reply of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to the speech of 'the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper! .(Dr. Earle Page). I know that the Treasurer does not feel the same anxiety with respect to the finances of the Commonwealth as do the honourable member for Cowper and myself; but there is one big difference between the Treasurer and honourable members who may wish to continue in publio life. perfectly just statement to make. Every honourable member' who desires to con. tinue in active politics will be called upon to bear the responsibility, or blame, when next he goes before his constituents. But the Treasurer, we are given to understand, is shortly to retire from the inferno of political life. While giving the Treasurer Credit for the speech which he has just made in defence of the Government, I cannot forget that parliamentary responsibility will shortly slip from his shoulders, while for the rest of us it remains. On every question except a direct vote of censure or want of confidence I shall vote as my conscience and individual judgment prompt me, and I appeal to the supporters of the Government tp consider carefully the questions that have been raised. The main question is-Shall. the Commonwealth set an example to the States by living within its means?

There are men who dream that they dwell in marble halls, but I am not one of them. If we are to pour money into Canberra in tbe way proposed, I believe that it will prove to be such a sink for expenditure that once undertakings get fairly going at Canberra no taxpayer of Australia of the present generation can hope for any possible relief. If it costs £500 to cut down two bottle trees in the Northern Territory, what will it cost to build a Federal capital? The Treasurer objected to the comparison which the Leader of the Country party made between the management of the finances here and in Great Britain. He said .that we are in an infinitely better position here. If that be so, why was it necessary for us to go to Great Britain' and ask the Imperial Government to fund a debt of £90,000,000 for us and extend its repayment over a large number of years ? Let me inform honourable members that last year the Imperial Government paid off no less than £251,000,000 of debt. This year, they budgeted a surplus of £175,000,000, whilst here the Government of the Commonwealth have budgeted a deficit of something like £3,000,000. It may be said, that by economizing and living within our means we shall be increasing unemployment. I say that that is not so. In my view, it is Government waste and extravagance that is the cause of unemployment. The Governments of the States and of the Commonwealth are incurring huge losses in connection with their State enterprises, and costly failures which have been recorded in connection with them. This causes increased taxation to be imposed upon the people, which, in its turn, must necessarily restrict enterprise 'and the development of fresh industries. The restriction -of enterprise causes unemployment and that, as we know, is responsible for hardship and distress. It would be a poor country of which it could be said that -unless the Government borrowed and spent extravagantly unemployment would result as the resources of the coun. try were not good enough in themselves to keep the people employed. I think that we shall be absolutely mad if we spend a great sum! of money on bringing people out here until we have, solved our local unemployment problem. ' Every one would be glad to see peoplePersonally, I am against this coming here, especially those with a little capital, who could settle on the land and assist in the development of the country. But to send people to the Old Country with magic lanterns to induce immigrants to come to Australia, whilst there are numbers of men here, including returned soldiers, out of work, seems to me to be very bad business indeed. I wish here to protest against the miserable and cowardly cry which we find repeated in every newspaper in Australia at the present time, that we are not able to defend this country. One would imagine that, Australians were the most miserable and helpless lot of cowards in the world. I remember reading in a report by a very distinguished general who came out here that if Australia were to have any hope to defend herself against an invading army the Australian troops . would need to be in, at least, the proportion of three toi one against the invaders. I had not the honour to be one of the ^ . I . F . troops myself, and, therefore, I may be allowed to say without boasting that in the great war the Australian troops were at least as good as any others that took part in it. So far from men defending their own country requiring to be of a strength of three to one against the,. invader, judging from my experience of warfare, men defending their own country have themselves. at least a three to one advantage. I do not say these things in any spirit of boastfulness, but rather as a protest against the miserable cry to which I have referred. I am satisfied that if Australia were invaded to-morrow her people would put up a most tremendous fight and desperate struggle. I saw 70,000 Boers keep the whole of the British Empire, with sea communication uninterrupted, at bay for three years. In the last war we found that Russia, the nation possessing the greatest population of any engaged in the war, collapsed in ruin half way through the struggle; yet .the German troops in East Africa, though comparatively few in number, held out in their own country throughout the campaign. Belgium, the most densely populated country in the world, was overrun in a few weeks. I do not mean to say that I do not wish to see immigrants come to Australia. By all means let those come who can. But' I am in this matter in accord; with the views expressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) when he said that the true way to secure immigrants is to make our local conditions so good as to naturally attract them to Australia. I said that I did not appraach the consideration of the finances of the country in any party spirit, and I shall never do so. An amendment somewhat similar to that given notice of by the Leader of the Country party was moved shortly after the last general election. I did not support it. On that occasion I voted with the Government. saved the Government that time. saved them. I voted with them because they represented a party that had been returned to power with the support of fully half the members of the House of Representatives and practically the whole ' of the members of another place. In my view, the people wished them to be responsible for the government of the country, and they were entitled to a fair show. I still think that a party having the support of half the members of the House of Representatives and practically the whole of the members of another place is obviously the party that ought to conduct the government of the country. But I have not been satisfied of late that the Government have been as careful of the public finances as they ought to be. I can mention a case iii point, which I brought under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers). It was in connection with Government expenditure in the purchase of the Canungra saw-mills, which are in my own electorate. One, perhaps, looks more closely into a matter affecting his own constituency, and may be disposed to attach to it more importance than others might think it deserves. On the other hand, there is a saying that what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over; and when I see extravagance and waste by one Department L lose confidence also in the management of all the other Department®. I do not wish to enter into all the details of the matter, hear that. I know that the Assistant but I know that the Government bought the Canungra saw-mills for about £250,000. They bought it from people who knew the business from A td Z7 shrewd, careful, enterprising business men, brought up in the timber trade, and as the result of whose business acumen a thriving and splendid little community had been brought together I think it only fair to say that this purchase was carried out by the present Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen), and not while the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) was Acting Minister. I do not think that the Assistant Minister would have been so foolish as to have approved it. He is too keen a business man to have been induced to do so* and I know that he has had a difficult and. irksome task in clearing up what he found there. AfteT working the mill at Canungra for some time, the Department closed it down. I was asked to visit Canungra, as much distress existed there. I went up and received deputations from the men working in the mill, the teamsters, the carriers, the fellers, and the business men of the town. On the following morning I visited the mill before breakfast, and spent the rest of the day travelling on horseback through the timber scrub to the different dumps. I am not a timber man, although I have owned and sold pine, and have had some dealings in timber; but I am going to relate what I actually saw at Canungra. The mill was shut down, and I saw there very large quantities of sawn timber stacked in the open. We have had in Queensland about the wettest winter on record, and I found that great quantities of this timber had deteriorated. The. cutters showed me. stack after stack of timber in respect of which a certain amount would have to be allowed for depreciation. I went into the shed where the dressed timber was stacked, and found that there everything was satisfactory. In the mill yard, however, very large quantities of logs were rotting. I took from them handfuls of what-the men call fungus, and timber men know that when a pine log starts to throw off suoh things it is deteriorating. sold log on the Canungra area.

There was a rainfall of 60 inches within a short time, and all the mills in Queensland were affected by the exposure of logs and sawn timber. said that even had this mill remained in the hands of the original owners, it would have had to close down. Does the Assistant Minister maintain that? say that personally, but many saw-millers in Queensland who had never closed down before had to do so during this abnormal period. We did not close till our stocks and depots were full, and we could not carry on unless we brought the whole of the timber trade on to its knees. We could have done that. gentleman is only proving that his Department got into a very tight corner. I visited various dumps in the scrub. In one place I counted 188 logs; at another I saw ten, and at still another twelve logs. I was unable to reach many of the dumps; but every one who has been in the bush knows that when a pine log is allowed to lie in the open during the winter months, very serious deterioration takes place. further into the question of the unnecessary, hardships endured at Canungra. I merely quote this as an example of what the people of the Commonwealth are losing as the result of State enterprises. ber know that all these logs were sold at a profit? able member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) wish me to believe that among the timber men of Queensland there is a fool who was prepared to buy the logs lying in the open at Canungra and to bear the whole loss caused by deterioration? The timbermeans? previously apgetters up there showed me logs which they said were so rotten that the "" dogs "" could not be put into them. Does the honourable member say that some private individual was prepared to buy such logs and to suffer the loss caused by deterioration? this evening, that the Department suffered no loss in connection with the logs at Canungra. a keen private business man and a State enterprise I know who would lose. The worse feature of this purchase is that I have heard it the land itself was not acquired straight out by the Commonwealth, but is to revert to the original owners after a certain number of years. This must add much to the anxiety of the Minister, because the mill has shut down and there is a time limit within which the timber on the area must be got out. If it is not out out within that time the Government must bear the loss. I could speak for an hour with regard to Canungra. make an arrangement with the vendors of Canungra by means of which the Government will not lose a day, so far as concerns the expiration of the time within which the timber on the Canungra area is to be cut out. the Assistant Minister has sent up some one to report on the whole question, and I hope that the day is not far distant when this most unsatisfactory state of affairs will be ended. I have referred to Canungra only as an example of what I do not wish to go we are losing on State enterprises. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Mcwilliams), who was a member of the Commission appointed to inquire into operatipns at Cockatoo Island, will probably have something to say concerning that State enterprise. These experiences hit the people of Queensland .very hard, because hundreds of thousands of pounds are also being lost on their State enterprises. I am wholly opposed to State enterprises, and the sooner they are wiped out the better. I believe that we should live within our means.",65,Joseph Cook Honorabl E State Governments Are To Day Heavily In

I have already said that, rather than go into debt, I would help the Government, if absolutely necessary, in a proposal for further taxation, provided I had an assurance-whic h I have not a t presentthat not one single penny of Government money was going to be wasted. I do not regard this as a party matter, and I shall not vote in a party spirit. I have no particular hostility to the present Government. As a matter of fact, if my sympathies had to be shown for one side or the other, they would be overwhelmingly w it h the Government. As a Queenslander, and one who has had experience of the ""blessings"" of Labour rule, 1 would not for one minute help honourable members of the Opposition to power in this House; nor would I support any Government that was kept in power by their votes.

I believe that, so far as his heart goes, the Prime Minister is the best friend the returned soldier ever had. But I am honestly and sincerely frightened of the Prime Minister's ideas of finance and business.

It states in paragraph 17We regret that more returned soldiers have not .been given an opportunity to secure employment in the Parliamentary Service. Apparently the only positions open to them are in the lowest grade of the Service. So far as preference to returned soldiers to enter the Clerical Division is concerned, the policy is a dead letter.

I regret to say that for a man whom I have loved greatly in the past I cannot continue to have the same respect in view of his injustice to an unfortunate young man.
