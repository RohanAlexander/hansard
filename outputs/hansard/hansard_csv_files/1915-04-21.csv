The amount paid to each State monthly represents one-twelfth of the total amount to be advanced to the State. £350,000 and £100,000 included in above total were advanced to Victoria and South Australia respectively in November, 1914, but those amounts will be deducted from the instalments due to those States in a future month. 3. The nature of the securities to be given by the States will be in the form of Treasury bills. Each monthly instalment will be repayable by the State two years after the date at which such instalment was paid to the State. The rate of interest to be charged will be that which, including all charges, it costs the Commonwealth to raise money for its own purposes. The loan raised by the British Government is repayable between 1st March, 1925, and 1st March, 1928. The price of the issue was 95 per cent., and the rate of interest 3b per cent. It is estimated that the rate of interest, including amortization, to be paid by the Commonwealth will be about 4-J per cent. In the meantime the States will be charged at this rate, but. it has been agreed with them that an adjustment will be made later.

I was particularly anxious to avoid anything of the kind. I said on Friday that I had no particular individual in view, and that my proposal was intended to be of the most general character. I was therefore sorry to hear several honourable members introduce in dividuals into the discussion. I hope that, if the matter is to be further debated, we shall not deal with individuals otlier than any who may be directly concerned in the item actually dealt with. I am not at all concerned with the question as to whether or not the Clerk of the Senate is entitled to an increase of £ 1 0 0 per annum, but I am much concerned with the proposal that highly-salaried officials shall be granted increases at the present time. This is not a time when, in the interests of the people and of the finances, salaries should be increased. Salaries are not being increased outside, save'in the case of men who can prove that their wages are insufficient to meet the increased cost of living. That argument does not apply to the officials to whom my amendment extends, since I do uot propose tliat increments should be held back, save in tlie case of officers receiving salaries of over Opposition asked why I singled out those who were in receipt of £300 per annum and over, ancl said that I might prevent an officer from receiving an increase of £ 5 or £ 1 0 per annum to which he was entitled. If I made the amount £ 3 1 0 , or £510, or £ 9 0 1 per annum, the same argument would apply. A line had to be drawn somewhere, and I drew it at what I thought was a fair point, because £300 a year gives an ordinary individual a fair chance of carrying on honestly and comfortably, notwithstanding the present The Leader extraordinary price of goods.

I made no such suggestion, and no such construction can be placed on any statement that I made. It has been urged that the carrying of my amendment might lead to reprisals by the Senate-that the Senate might interfere with the Estimates for the House of Representatives. I was surprised that the Leader of the Opposition in this House -which , under the Constitution, is particularly charged with the care of the finances-should have suggested that the Senate might deal with us in that way.

The honourable member for Barrier has suggested that this Parliament should f o l low the example of the K in g in abolishing intoxicating liquors from the refreshment room, merely for the sake of the example. In the matter of salaries it is hardly necessary for the Commonwealth to set an example, because 1 am certain that no commercial house is increasing salaries at the present time, and the Government of Queensland suspended the payment of increments to the public servants of the State because of the extraordinary expenditure which had to he met this year. the States one penny. the Government of Queensland feels it necessary to reduce expenditure because of the drought and for other causes, and it wishes to throw the responsibility for what it is doing on the war. When times of stress come it is generally the men at the bottom who suffer. In my opinion it is they who should have more consideration; it is the men at the top who should make a sacrifice. The statement made by the Prime Minister that the Estimates are framed hy thc Public Service Commissioner, who determines what increments shall be paid, and that the Treasurer provides the money, hut that the next Estimates w ill be revised by him, cuts the ground fro m beneath my feet. It is a strange thing that the Public Service Commissioner has hitherto been able to demand from the Treasurer the payment of a certain sum for the remuneration of the Public Service, but if the Prime Minister next year gives effect to his promises, I think that the public interest w ill be effectively protected. the honourable member has proposed to reduce was not submitted by the Public Service Commissioner. the officers of Parliament are not under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, but"" I moved the amendment to express the wish of the Committee that no salary exceeding £300 per annum My proposal is not the reshould be increased during the continuance of the war.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. move That the item ""Clerk of the Senate, £1,000,"" be reduced by £1. ' ' ' As I said on Friday, I was not in sympathy with the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane to reduce this salary by £100 as an intimation to the Government that no salary above £300 per annum should be increased during the continuance of the war. But I am not in favour of increasing the salary of the Clerk of the Senate by £ 1 0 0 . There seems to be a principle at stake in this particular item. I understand that, during the term of office of the last Government, the President of the Senate demanded that the Clerk of the Senate should be paid exactly the same salary as that received by the Clerk of the House of Representatives. NowI am not in favour of the principle of equal pay, unless tliere is equal capacity, equal experience, and equal work-unless , of course, the principle could be made general, every person in Australia receiving exactly the same salary, and rendering to the community right to his utmost capacity the service of which he is capable. When such a state of affairs comes about, there will be a happy time in Australia, but I do not think that it will come about in our time. In the meantime, if we are not prepared to follow on those lines, we must, in fixing salaries, take into consideration a man's capacity for work, the work he has to do, and the experience he possesses. I have no desire to pit one House of Legislature against another. The people of Australia by a referendum have decided on the adoption of the bi-cameral system of legislation, though, by the way, I may say The item which that, with the honourable member for Brisbane, I hope that the time will come when we shall have only one Chamber. would you retain f tain the Houes of Representatives, b ut",13,Parliament £300 Per Annum The Leader Of The

Therefore, I hope the amendment will be defeated. [4.30] I have received several communications from persons who desire me to vote against any proposed increases to high salaries, but it is not my intention to do that. When the Victorian Parliament sat in this building, the then Clerk of Parliaments practically owned the Parliament. The authorities were constantly casting round to find 'some excuse for in creasing the Clerk's salary, but the work he did was so little, although he did it with a great amount of show, tliat, ultimately, they could find no other excuse than to pay him £100 a year for the supervision of the gardeus. Por several -years Federation the Clerk of the Senate was Clerk of Parliaments. I can remember when it was first contended that the Clerk of this House, and the Clerk of the Senate, occupying positions of equal responsibility, ought to be on an equality in every sense; aud it is not long ago that that policy was given effect to. I remember contending at the time that the Clerk of this House was entitled to just as high a salary as the Clerk of the Senate. Having taken that stand then, I am only acting consistently now in saying that the Clerk of the Senate should be in every respect on the same level as the Clerk of the House of Representatives. I hold no brief for the tall poppies; although, i u some circles, I am myself considered a tall poppy. It should be remembered that we might do an injustice.to many men by refusing increments during the present year. For instance, there are public servants who this year must retire, and if their salaries are reduced, so must their pensions be, seeing that a pension is always based on the salary received. monwealth pubhc servants are entitled to pensions ? came over from the services of the States are entitled to pensions. . In some quarters, the Clerk of the Senate is supposed to, in some way, occupy a higher position than that of the Clerk of this House: and moveI think that, at any rate, the salaries ought to be equal. It is a most peculiar be reduced by £100. fact that, quite irrespective of party, the members of another place seem to regard themselves as more "" b l u e blooded "" than we are, and, on that account, claim certain conveniences and privileges that we do not enjoy. Their seats are more comfortable than ours, being made of plush, while here we find merely leather; and tlieir supply of newspapers is more liberal, and their notepaper and envelopes of better class. vided with worse paper and envelopes than we get. be, the dear old gentlemen in another place claim every consideration, and are much better looked after than we are. Again, do honourable members believe that this proposed reduction of salary, if carafter the establishment of ried into effect, would tend to that peace and harmony which ought to prevail between the two Houses? I am afraid that if they find us robbing their Clerk of £100 we shall find them "" standing on their hind legs.""

Division 11 (Prime Minister), £19.756. a few observations to make regarding the expenditure on the historic memorials of representative men, which, I think, is developing to an absurd situation. I have a keen appreciation of art, but I do not think any of us can examine, with any degree of satisfaction the alleged portraits in the Queen's H a l l . I remember on one occasion discussing one of them with a leading member of this House, under the impression that it was a painting of a totally some are certainly recognisable, barely one of them can be described as a work of art. The best of them display a certain amount of fine brushwork; but portraiture is a class of painting that is exceedingly difficult. As a matter of fact, there are only some half-dozen portrait painters of any eminence in the world at the present time. While I have every desire to encourage youthful aspirants for fame as portrait painters in Australia, I submit that the fact that a person can depict a landscape fairly well on a piece of canvas is by no means an assurance that he or she is equal to the task of handing down to posterity the features -and the character, as shown in the features-of representative men in Australia. Nearly all of these alleged portrait paintings are, in that respect, lamentable failures. strictly business-like footing, the price in every case is excessive and absurd. We pay £250 for each of these pictures, the value of which, in several cases, consists almost entirely of the frame. There is one portrait painting of high qualitythat of the late Sir Henry Parkes. That, in my opinion, as well as in the opinion of critics, who, perhaps, know more of these matters than I do, is the only genuine piece of portrait-painting that we have in the collection. Honourable members will notice that it is not very large, but it gives us all that we require. It gives us the head, the face, and features the character of the individual portrayed. W h y should we pay about £ 1 0 0 more than we need to in order that posterity may be assured that the present Prime Minister had a pair of fairly good legs, and that they were encased in the division 10 (Miscellaneous), orthodox trousers? It is neither necessary nor desirable. A three-quarterlength portrait is £ 1 00 cheaper than a full-length one. True, it would deprive us of about eighteen inches of trousers I have in the painting; but I submit that all that is required is a picture of the head and shoulders, and that can be obtained at a much less figure, and would be far more satisfactory, than those huge expanses of canvas depicting the altogether unbecoming and inartistic habiliments of these days. We -are apparently committed to a portrait of every Prime Minister, President, Speaker, and Governor General who may happen, for however brief a period, and different individual. While in however uninteresting a way, to hold office. MrJ . H . CATTS W h e r e shall we find room for them? country will have acquired 100 years hence! The destination of many of these pictures w ill , I am afraid, be the cheap sale or the bonfire. The original understanding was that we should have historical memorials of representative men. I would not for the world insinuate that the portraits we already possess are not those of representative men, but if we continue on the lines now being followed, we shall certainly spend a considerable sum on the portraits of men who w ill be in no way representative.

As to the artistic quality of these paintings, I am not in a position to express an opinion, but I have visited on more than one occasion some of the most famous, picture galleries in the world, and I have the advantage of acquaintance those art. There are in the older countries of the world galleries whose, collections consist almost wholly of masterpieces; but, taking ordinary collections, my individual opinion is that, picture for picture, the portraits that have been referred to are equal to any that w ill be found elsewhere.

The right honourable gentleman seemed to suggest that such a man is not an Australian, and, therefore, not an inherent genius.

I do not propose to deal with the financial position set forth in these Estimates, and in the important statement read by the Treasurer on the 14th instant, but I wish to make one or two remarks concerning what was said in that statement about the Commonwealth Bank. Thei n formation given in regard to the Commonwealth Bank is very interesting, but that in this important Ministerial statement, covering the financial position of the Commonwealth, dealing w it h the assistance the Commonwealth has been able to render to the States, and that which the Imperial Government have been able to give to us, and giving information in regard to the note issue and the advances made to the States from funds connected* therewith, we should have two whole pages devoted to details of the Commonwealth Bank is something more than one would have expected, and more than was necessary. The Commonwealth Bank having been established under Statute, the Governor of the Bank has always taken the stand-and prided himself on it-that he would not give any information if he did not care to do so; but, judging by the information that he has given to the present Treasurer, he now seems to have departed from that attitude. This information is very interesting; but I wish to deal with one paragraph only, a paragraph that has no doubt been supplied to the Treasurer by the Governor, and which saysThe Savings Bank in London was established primarily for the benefit of Australians or inlaw to establish any branch of the Savtending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for Australia, and has been almost exclusively made use of in this respect. Other persons are not encouraged to deposit with the Savings Bank Department in London, and several suggestions that the bank should receive deposits from the public throughout G-reat Britain have been declined. At, the time of its°establishment the British Post Office Savings Bank was consulted in the matter, and took no exception whatever to the estabExcept lishment of this portion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank of London, and the fiiendliest reciprocal arrangements still exist with the British Post Office Savings Bank, and also with the New Zealand Post Ofiice Savings Bank throughout that Dominion. 12 (Executive Council), 1 say that the statement contained in this division 13 (Audit Office), paragraph is not accurate. I know that this is strong language to use in regard to such a matter, but from my own knowledge the statement is inaccurate, and should not have been put forward in the way in which it has been put forward. Honourable members are no doubt aware that the Savings Bank branch in London was established with a great flourish of trumpets; I am not sure that the K in g was not present; at any rate, there was a great function, 'and Sir George Reid, after a great speech, placed £ 1 0 0 of his money in the Savings Bank as its first depositor. I have not looked up the speech delivered by Sir George Reid, but my memory serves me well enough to know that there was no mention of any limitation of the activities of the Bank. It was not said that the Bank was only for the special purpose mentioned in the paragraph I have read, and that it would be made use of exclusively for that purpose, or that the Bank did not wish to receive deposits from the public of Great Britain. Already in this chamber I have protested against the Commonwealth entering into the Savings Bank business of London, trying to gethold of some of the savings of British people with small means in order to bring the money to Australia; because I maintain that Great Britain, with its great obligations and responsibilities, should be entitled to retain these funds for its own purposes, and we should not attempt to get them away from Great Britain, l t was not said at the time that it was not intended to do this. Holding the views that I do upon this point, I was altogether opposed to the Commonwealth establishing a branch of the Savings Bank in London; and when I was Treasurer, having looked into the matter, I found that there was no authority by",20,Primeminister S Department
141,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [5.19].,"ings Bank beyond Australia. TheA t torney-General, Sir William Irvine, when consulted on the point, emphatically advised that there was no power under the Statute to establish a Commonwealth Savings Bank in London, and I thereupon informed the Governor of the Bank to this effect, but that gentleman was very reluctant to give up his idea. He even sent to me a solicitor's opinion, controverting that of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, but I told him that the thing could not be done. The Governor of the Commonwealth never, though he knew my opinion upon the matter of taking away the savings of the people of Great Britain from the field in which they should be controlled, hinted to me, in all the conversations I had with him, that by Savings Banki n London he intended to deal with no business other than for the benefit of Australians, or intending Australians, and that he had no intention of doing other than obtaining as much money as he could through the Savings Bank branch in London. However, during last year the present Treasurer in troduced a Bill which gave the power to establish a branch of the Savings Bank in London, and overcame the difficulty that I had detected. There was no need to establish a Commonwealth Savings Bank in London"" primarily for the benefit of Australians or intending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for Australia,"" as the Commonwealth Bank could deal with all those matters without having any Savings Bank provisions, and even before the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank our High Commissioner aid the business. The reason advanced in this document could not, .therefore, have been the true of a Savings Bank in London. An other intention was to get money in order to carry on the business of the Commonwealth Bank, and to make money for it, is the fact that a rate of interest was given on deposits higher than the I m perial Government paid through its post offices. thing for the poor people. poor people ten times more interest would he says that he has declined to receive be good for them; but the point I make is that the idea in establishing this Savings Banki n London was the securing of funds for the Commonwealth Bank, because if the intention was only to establish it , as mentioned in the document, "" for the benefit of Australians or intending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for A u s t r a l i a "" for which purpose it has been said it has been almost exclusively made use of-wh y then should a higher rate of interest be paid than was given by the British General Post Ofiice? I mention this matter now Bank in order to reiterate what I have said all along, namely, that it was not a friendly action to take-in fact, the action of the Commonwealth Banki n entering the British arena in order to get deposits for its Savings Bank branch at a time when Australia was borrowing all its loan establishing the Commonwealth money from the Old Country, and generally was under great obligations to it , was about the meanest action I have heard of. I maintain that the Commonwealth Government had np right to enter into competition with the British Government, and offer a higher price for money than the Post Ofiice of the ""United Kingdom was paying. connected with Savings Banksi n England a little while ago, it was necessary for some one to establish something. member's views are not the same as mine. He does not think it mean and contemptible to go to the Mother Country and attempt to divert the savings of the. people from the field in which they should be applied, when Australia is still going to the British money-market, and is still under obligations to GreatB r it a in ; but, in my opinion, the offer of a higher rate of inreason for the establishment terest in order to secure this money was a most unfriendly and mean action on our matter that proves that the part. I was ashamed of the step we had taken-on e of the most ungrateful things I had ever heard of. But, now, why have we this change that has taken nlace in regard to the attitude of the Savings Banki n London as disclosed by this document before us?

That is the first I have heard of this attitude, and I bring the matter forward to-day because, from my knowledge of the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank, I know that the statement that the Savings Banki n London was established primarily for the reasons stated in this document, is inaccurate. Seeing that we had a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in London, which can do all the business the Savings Bank branch could do in the matter of assisting Australians, or in tending Australians, and seeing that the High Commissioner could do all the work even without the Commonwealth Bank, there was no need for us to establish a branch of the Savings Banki n London, and our action in doing so is not only unnecessary, b u t ungrateful and unwarranted. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the British Government came into the Australian arena and endeavoured to get use of the savings of the people here, or did some such improper act, we would be disgusted and annoyed ; honourable members opposite would be rampant with rage; they would consider the act as most improper on the part of the Old Country; but, apparently, there is when we do the same thing, and without any necessity for doing it .

Imagine the little Commonwealth Savings Banki n London, established to assist men and women of small means, many of whom are contemplating coming to this country, by enabling them to have their money transmitted without cost, and to earn interest from the day of deposit, interrupting or : endangering the financial affairs in London, whicli is the clearing centre of the world, dealing with, perhaps, billions of exchange in a year! higher rates. mon in London. I recollect that banks in London paid 6 per cent, on deposits when consols were only bringing about £ 2 18s. It is not the policy of the Government of Great Britain to prevent people who are doing business legitimately paying whatever rates of interest nothing improper or unfriendly they can afford; if such a policy had been adopted England would not be the great country it is. received millions of pounds' worth of deposits if you had paid liigher rates, and that was the intention. tion of establishing a savings bank in London' for the purpose of raising loan money, and any Treasurer who would attempt to do that would ultimately fail, because he would not obtain his money as cheaply by dribs and drabs in that I did not say that. fashion as if he borrowed it directly.

169,Mr Glynn (Angas) [5.46],"I desirewar expenditure for the financial year ending the 31st March was estimated at £362,000,000. be very easily borne, because, as the Chancellor pointed out in his financial statement of the 17th November, the approximate national income of Great Britain was £2,300,000,000. that amount there were figures, which he did not give, but upon which he probably based the statement that we could, for a period of five years, finance the war. A t any rate, it is a fact that over £200,000,000 per annum is received by capitalists from public and semi-public investments abroad, leaving out of account altogether the interest or profits derived from private investments. much higher. estimate; but I think I read those particulars in the Edinburgh Review two or three months ago. admitted later that he had underestimated. now dealing with another matter, namely, the fact that the actual interest received in England every year from public and semi-public investments abroad is over £200,000,000, and of this 95$ per cent, is unaffected by the war. Owing to the presence of our Fleet, the ocean is free to us, and this interest comes from countries that are under uo obligation of neutrality, and are not prevented by the war from sending that financial stream which sets in the direction of the TJnited Kingdom. It is also something to be proud of, when we find, from the last trade figures, that while the total external trade of the United Kingdomi n 1913 was £1,404,000,000, to George said, in November, it is very reassuring that 97 per cent, of the 20,000,000 odd tonnage of our shipping was sailing the ocean unaffected by the war at that date. Let me now come to the question of the gold reserve. I ask the Treasurer to see that he exercises that caution which is apparent in the figures of the Bank of England and of the Treasury at Home, and in the practice also of the principal Continental banks. Mr Asquith stated on the 14th November, 1914, in the House of Commons, that foreign exchanges were working perfectly satisfactorily, and that the gold reserve The burden of that can of the Bank of England on the 2nd July was £40,000,000. On the 7th August that reserve had shrunk to £27,000,000; and there was, of course, at that time a tremendous nervous slump. I remember Besides that, within a week, some of the leading stocks of the Stock Exchange shrunk in value by £600,000,000, but within a month there was a great restoration of confidence. but on the 7th August those gold reserves were £27,000,000; and at the time of Mr. Asquith's speech, on the 14th November, they had increased to £69,500,000. I am now referring, of course, to the BankI think the figure is of England reserves, and there were also the central gold reserves of the Treasury, T h a t is not an official £80,000,000, or, as Mr Asquithp u t it , about double the amount before the war. Evidently, therefore, the Imperial Treasurer, tlirough the Bank of England, was I think the Chancellor strengthening his gold reserves, and at the same time using them. I shall now show the position of the German Bank and the Bank of France, with the observation that our Imperial finance is not only strong, but the better for commerce, because the reserves are used fairly freely, as Mr Lloyd George told us in his speech about two months ago. Nevertheless, caution was necessary in view of the necessity of larger imports which might have to be faced later on. paratively, we do not seem to be. Of course, the German Reichsbank cannot be held up as an example to be followed in every particular, 'because the authorities there are not using their gold as are the British bankers. On the 31st Decemberi t had shrunk last, the total gold in the German bank only £1,223,000,000 after eight was £104,640,000. A year ago that gold was £58,498,000, and this shows that they are doing all they can to increase the reserve. The actual note issue on that date was £252,000,000, but the statutory reserve showed 59 per cent., of which 41 per -cent, was gold, the 59 per cent, being made up of gold and certain approved securities which must be held. The only change made by the war was that the number of acceptors of the securities was reduced by three to one, and a 5 per cent, tax on the issue over the gold or cash deposits of the bank was temporarily suspended. There is a 5 per cent.",24,Department Of The Treasury

As to the Bank of France, it has been stated by the Paris correspondent of the Economist, after a very exhaustive esamination of the position, that the value of the note issue, through the care of the gold reserve, has been brilliantl y maintained. In the case of the Bank of England, on the 13th January this year, the gold was £69,360,000, and the notes £35,174,000; and to those figures must be added some others. To the notes issued by the Issue Department, and, therefore, held by the public, must be added the volume of the currency notes outstanding and redeemable at the bank by an arrangement made on the 3rd or 4th August between Mr Lloyd George and some of the banking officials. This arrangement was made on the advice of experts whom Mr Lloyd George properly called to his aid the moment the war broke out, he not being a specialist in such matters. By addine these currency notes, we get a total issue by the Bank and by'the Treasury of £72,400,000. Let me push the matter further. The Banning Department held £53,000,000 of notes. I suppose that in Australia h a l f ' the issue is held by the banks, and the rest is in circulation. fair statement of the case. the £72,000,000 of notes issued by the Bank of England and the Treasury notes still in circulation, the £53,000,000 held by the Banking Department, we get a total,, for which the bank and the Government are responsible, of £125,400,000, and against that there is held £90,000,000 in gold. That is altogether a different proportion against current liabilities of the sort from that observed in connection with our note issue. We are apparently only commencing to largely increase the volume. Asi t was, some financiers at Home said that such a state of affairs was not perfectly sound financing; but I think they were rather captious. was a first-class arrangement. position at Home, and not yet of the position here. I refer to the Imperial figunss and the figures of the German banks to show that, rightly or wrongly, since the war began there has been a large increase in the gold reserves against current liabilities, principally in the shape of notes. If we deduct the amount borrowed from the banks here, we have a reserve, according to some figures whicn appeared in the press, of about 30 per cent. am referring to figures that I read in the newspapers, and they seemed to me to be fairly correct. read in this connection is the Gazette. Gazette, but it does not seem to me that the figures I saw are wrong. I assume the newspapers really took the figures from tlie Gazette. A t any rate, what I read on the 3rd March was that the issue was £25^232,000-and I do not think that is out in any way-whil e the gold held was £10,133,000. A t that time the Treasurer had borrowed, approximately, £3,500,000 from the banks to strengthen the gold reserve. but handed over by an arrangement. minology the honourable gentleman uses. I am not condemning the arrangement, but only urging caution, and pointing out that if we deduct the money obtained from the banks under this reciprocal arrangements-o r whatever we may choose to call it from the £10,133,000 held on account of the note issue, we have a net I find that, adding to basis that could not be taken from us by the banks if the war were to end to-morrow. £6,633,000, which, in relation to a note issue of about £25,000,000, represents, not 40 per cent., but a little over 30 per cent, at the best. left a wrong impression on my mind, and I think on the mind of honourable members.

The Treasurer mentioned the great aid which he said had been given at Home by the Commonwealth Bank. I do not know what the right honourable gentleman has to say about a paragraph that appeared in the Argus yesterday, to the effect that the Commonwealth Bank was one of several which had come to an arrangement to facilitate the operations of the Government by not cashing certain demands within a certain time. it is true or not, but I can understand that the Bank may have helped men who, at the moment the war broke out, required cash at once. B ut the aid given by the Banki n local and Imperial finance was infinitesimal. What was the trouble that had to be faced? There was a demand for small currency. Some thought the Bank of England notes too large, and others thought that a note currency would be too small, and an arrangement was made for the temporary issue of 10s. and £ 1 notes. Within a month or so the' volume of these notes was comparatively small There was a rush for temporary accommodation, and, the issue in proportion to the reserve began at first to increase, although it afterwards decreased. The volume of our notes at present is trifling compared with the power of the Commonwealth to meet them. The chief object in view was to keep trade going, and the operations that were Imperiali n their magnitude as well as in the security behind them were in connection with the the TJnited Kingdom imports an average of about £2,000,000 worth of food and raw material, comprising six or seven chief commodities, in order to keep its industries and its people going. The moment war broke out the acceptance houses had obligations for If I make an arrangethree months, to the extent of about £350,000,000, and as all financing was disturbed-al l relations with debtors abroad and remittances were stopped for I believe we are perthe time being-unles s the acceptance houses could be induced to cash these paper obligations, the imports of the TJnited Kingdom could not be kept I think I could make an up. It is one of the most striking features of the heroic efforts of the I m perial Government that they at once came to the aid of these acceptance houses, I do not regard it as through the Bank of England, and undertook contingent responsibilities to the exteut of about 60 per cent, of the obligations incurred. It is operations of that kind about which we should speak in connection with I m perial finance rather than such questions as that of whether the Commonwealth Bank helped a few Australians in London, who, when the war broke out, were unable, perhaps, to cash their drafts or cheques at the ordinary banks. Before resuming my seat, I wish to refer the Treasurer to a short quotation from a speech I do not think it is true. made by Mr Lloyd George, which is somewhat pertinent to the point that I wish to impress upon him. Speakingi n the first or second week of February last, Mr Lloyd George pointed out that the strength of the Imperial Government for financing was its gold reserve, and the fact also that the TJnited Kingdom, unlike the Continental banks, was not afraid to use that gold for purposes of commerce. He warned his hearers, however, that there was a time coming when they might have to be more cautious. What he said in this respect w ill apply also to Australia. We experienced a bad season last year, and if next season we cannot export as largely as we do in average years, there will be a very great difficulty in meeting, at all events, our imports. We shall certainly have to import more largely, and, in the circumstances I have just mentioned, there may be some difficulty in financing tliese imnorts. Mr Lloyd George, speaking of the British gold reserve, saidacceptance houses. Every day It is true that we have never had such a strain put upon it as during the last few months, and very likely it will be considerably increased during the course of the next six or twelve months, when our purchases abroad are very much heavier than they ever were before and when our sales to other countries are considerably less.",26,Department Of The Treasury

198,Mr Glynn,"I do not know whetherThese are the conditions that confront the great Imperial Government, to 'whose financial strength I made a short reference at the outset of my remarks. In conclusion, I ask the Treasurer, if he increases the volume of the note issue as a means of financing the exceptional obligations of the country, to take care that the gold reserve is not brought near the 25 per cent, margin, and to see that it does not consist of gold held in large sums, such as the £10,000,000, at call. ister and Treasurer) [ 6 . 9 ] stated many times, both i h the House and in Committee, that there is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce the gold reserve to 25 per cent., but that, on the contrary, we shall maintain a working margin of about one-third. The Commonwealth would have had a larger gold reserve than it has at the present moment if we had required the last two monthly instalments of the banks' loan to be placed in the gold reserve. It was my own view, however, that this was not necessaryi and we have left the gold with the banks without any attendant disadvantage to the Commonwealth. I should have pleased the honourable member for Angas, no doubt, if I had allowed these amounts to go into the gold reserve in the Commonwealth Treasury instead of allowing the gold to remain with the banks. tional gold reserve from the hanks, would not the Treasurer have been forced to issue additional notes? ber is aware of the differential proportions, and w ill not forget that I am dealing now with the question of percentages. In effect, if we had not adopted this course, we should have strengthened our gold reserve in proportion to the amount that we have left with the banks. I do not think there is the slightest need to be apprehensive about the present note issue or its prospective increase. fimincier of any standing with whom I have had to deal has put before me any view of serious danger. I promise honorahle members opposite, however, that when such a situation arises I w i ll take steps to apprise them of it . think it is wise to discuss the matter; but I wish now to say that any honourable member, whether he is a member of the Opposition or a supporter of the Government, who wishes to ascertain the whole of the facts, may obtain them from the Treasury.

I rose chiefly, however, to say that the whole Parliament w ill be taken into the confidence of the Government in respect of this and all big financial matters. What is more, we have no objection to securing the assistance of the whole of the best minds in Australia in dealing with these financial matters during the war crisis. No financial crisis has yet arisen, nor is there any prospect of one if I am properly advised, and I am speaking now of advice other than that of the officers of the Department. I appeal to honorahle members not to make statements concerning these matters without first asking me for the whole of the particulars relating to them. I can say no more in this regard. It is not known to the general public that the Commonwealth is in a singularly good position in another respect. It is stated that the The honourable memCommonwealth has great debts. As a matter of fact, however, it has no debts. On the transferred properties we have, of course, to pay interest to the States; but all the investments of our note trust funds are bringing in interest amounting approximately to from 3^ per cent, to 4 per cent, or a little more.

It is in regard to the futur e treatment of the note issue at present in currency that many of us feel concerned. The Treasurer has given us a promise, which I did not expect from him, and which I think is highly reasonable, that, should we approach the danger zone with regard to the note issue, in relation either to the amount of the issue or the amount of the gold reserve, the Opposition will be in formed, and, I take it , consulted.

254,The Mr Joseph Cook,"What other indown; as the right honourable gentleman i.« well aware, no such thing occurred. Now, speaking broadly and generally, I wish to say that-and this is the only criticism I wish to make about the recent financial statement of the Treasurera very large portion of it deals with the part of the Commonwealth Banki n financing the States and the Commonwealth during this war time. I am. unable to see why this matter. has been introduced at such great length, and with so much labour and anxiety, because the figures give the clearest of all indications as to the part played by the Commonwealth Bank during this crisis. The facts, boiled down, are that the Commonwealth Bank has been of no assistance whatever to the Treasurer in solving any of his own financial problems. has not borrowed a shilling from the Bank, so far as we know; and, in all these large transactions, evidently the Bank has had no money to give him. The Bank has assisted the States only to the extent of £2,000,000. If I were championing the cause of this institution, as he is doing, I would be content to express the pious hope that, at some future time, in connection with some other Australian crisis, it might have grown to such proportions as to prove a valuable standby to the Commonwealth. That would be a correct statement of the attitude of this Bank through all these crucial days, and in connection with the serious fiuancial problems which have confronted us. Let us take the figures as they are set out in the Ministerial statement. The Prime Minister tells us that he has already borrowed, or arranged to borrow, from the Imperial authorities, £28,000,000. borrowed £18,000,000 from them in the first instance, which sum is to be transferred by monthly instalments to the States, and he has arranged to borrow another £10,000,000 from the same source. He has also arranged for a loan of £2,000,000 towards the construction of the transcontinental railway, and Jiis Estimates provide for loans which this Parliament has authorized amounting to £7,805,086. These amounts, with 10,000,000 sovereigns, which he is getting from the private banks, make up a total of £46,986,000. It will be seen, therefore, that whilst he is getting £28,000,000 from overseas, he is borrowing the rest from the Notes Fund and the private banks, with which the Commonwealth Bank has nothing whatever to do. Out of a total of approximately £47,000,000-the total loan authorizations-the Commonwealth Bank has not contributed one cent. gentleman should cut out the £7,000,000 that will not be used. of commitments-of what this House has authorized. intended to cover contingencies. It does not represent a debt. £10,000,000 is intended to cover contingencies. Part of Mr Lloyd George's obligations represent contingent borrowing. He assumes that the war will last a year, He but if , by some miracle, it were to end to-morrow, the whole of the money would not be spent. not in existence. pointing out that the expenditure contemplated by Mr Lloyd George is not in existence. It represents contingent borrowing-contingen t in the sense that he anticipates that the war will last t ill the end of the year. I am speaking of authorizations by this House^ and I say that of the £47,000,000 to which I have referred, the Commonwealth Bank has hypothecated not one penny. The whole statement is out of proportion. In the Ministerial statement there were only two small paragraphs, occupying about 4 inches, devoted to financial authorities which have supplied the Prime Minister with 10,000,000 sovereigns, whilst about lie 30 inches were devoted to a bank which has not given him a penny. Just why this elaborate reference to the Commonwealth Bank finds a place in a document which relates to the right honourable gentleman's own financial obligations, I do not pretend to know. gentleman was calling for a statement. I asked the Governor of the Bankf o r one, and he supplied it . doubt that the Prime Minister has permitted .a fine statement by the Governor of the institution to be placed alongside the other financial statements embodied in the document.

262,Together Mr Joseph Cook,"There is nobeen able to play in the tremendous crisis which has come upon us. What has the Bank done? It has lent to the State Governments £2,000,000. we may fairly eliminate from our calculations any reference to municipalities, tramways, and harbour trusts. do not suppose that expenditure under these headings necessarily arises from the war. Therefore, the plain fact is that while the Treasurer's authorizations in connection with the war have risen to the tremendous total of £47,000,000, the Commonwealth Bank has been enabled during this time of unprecedented stress to lend the States-no t the Treasurer, uot the author of the Bank, and not the man who has needed these rolling millionsthe sum of £2,000,000. Whilst the Treasurer has had to go to the private banks for 1.0,000,000 sovereigns, the Commonwealth Bank has not had a sovereign to give him. So far as that institution is concerned, I hope it will continue to grow in resources, in soundness, and in I wish to say as plainly that this war and its consequences only served to bring into greater relief the faulty basis upon which the Commonwealth Bank was established. We did not supply it with any resources. It has had to go round taking the people's pence wherever it could get them. sand pounds that it has collected in the States has reduced the reserves of the States to a corresponding degree, and has thus forced them into its hands. £2,000,000 which it has been able to lend them is only £2,000,000 £6,000,000 that the Governor of the Bank has gathered from the States, and has therefore taken from their financial resources. Before a Commonwealth can stand up to a crisis such as that with which we were suddenly confronted, will have to make for itself a commanding position and status in Australia, so that in time of emergency it may be able to come to the rescue of the national Government. history of the Commonwealth one outstanding we have had to borrow money right and left money to lend us. that wealth Bank with such capital and resources behind it that we shall be able to draw upon it whenever a national crisis Mr Joseph Cook. shall force us to do so. If ever anything emphasized the need for building this in stitution on a different basis the crucial I suppose that time through which we have passed has done that. I hope that the Prime Minister, even now, w ill not t u r n down the I idea of placing the Bank under the control of a directorate. It is the correct thing to do. I would suggest the wisdom of getting the States into this Commonwealth Bank, thus making it a national institution in essence as well as in name. There is another aspect of this matter. We find in nearly every great nation, the national bank coming to the help of the national Governmeut. The Bank of England is the banker of the Imperial Government, the Bank of France of the French Government, the Bank of Russia of the Russian Government. The national Bank of Australia is not the banker of the Australian Government. enough yet. stability. existence for three years. than three years since the Bank was established, and I venture to say that if the right honourable gentleman had called the States to his assistance, and if all the Every thoufinancial resources of the States were behind h i m and concentrated in that Bank, he would have been able to do for Australia during this crisis, through the The national Bank, relatively the same as the other national banks are doing for the out of the countries oversea. That is the object we have to keep in view-mak e the national Banki n its relation to the national Government of Australia exactly what the Bank national banks oversea are in relation to their Governments. I think I am entitled it to say so much, having in view the fact that f u l l y one-third of this report is devoted to the assistance to the Commonwealth supposed to have been rendered by the national Bank.

It would have given us £40,000,000 worth of current business at once. one penny to the wealth of Australia. would have added many millions to the resources of the Bank, and the Commonwealth Treasurer would have been able to borrow from the Bank during this crisis in a way he has not been able to do. I am not going to pursue the matter any further. My only wish is that we may soon create and erect this institution into a national Banki n deed and in fact, as it is now in name. propose to deal with the item in the Treasury Estimates dealing with old-age pensions. financial difficulties which the Government haA'e had to contend with, but we must remember that members on this side of the House made definite pledges during the last election campaign to increase the old-age pension. Although we do not expect the Government, during this session, to amend thc law so as to increase the old-age pension at the present time, we wish to intimate to them that it is the intention of honourable memhers on this side of the House to insist on this increase being granted in the near future. The present pension of 10s. per week is not sufficient to maintain our old-age [ ] 91 friends in decent comfort. Those honourable members on the Opposition side who, on several occasions during their term of office, made a pretence of advocating an. increase in the pension, never had any sincerity in the promises they made to the House and to the country. I am confident that in the near future the present I made a proposition to Government will handle this matter in a way that w ill be entirely satisfactory. There are many other pensions which this Government are pledged to improve, but, unfortunately, on account of the war, we are not able to carry out that policy as early in this Parliament as we should like. We have advocated the payment of a f u l l H a d they been carried into effect pension to the blind, and I am confident that a sufficient number of honourable members in this House w ill be found in support of the proposal to insure its passing. I have a scheme, which I shall later submit, by which we may possibly raise the amount required for that purpose It would have without levying any heavy tax on the majority of the people of the Commonwealth. The subject of pensions for the blind has been discussed in this chamber on several occasions, and as we have only 3,300 blind It would not have added persons in the Commonwealth, I do not think we w ill be loading the people with an undue burden by asking them to pay the blind a pension, which many members advocated in the early stages of the last election campaign. for blind people. some of them, but any person who is earning £1 per week cannot draw a pension. It is our desire that any blind person in the Commonwealth shall be entitled to [8.10] I draw a f u l l pension, irrespective of what his earnings may be. I think when the Government come to consider the question We all recognise the great they will have little hesitation in bringing down an amendment of the Old-age PensionsA c t so as to include the blind people in its provisions. Another item to which I desire to direct attention is the provision made for the old people in the benevolent institutions in the Commonwealth. Under the present arrangement the Commonwealth is saving 2s. per head, for the States receive only 8s. per week for their maintenance, and the other 2s. is being saved. Many of the old people will live for eight or ten years, and perhaps longer, without ever handling one penny of money during the remainder of their lives.",33,Department Of The Treasury

We are pledged to bring in this pension scheme, which, if operating in f u l l effect, would confer a benefit upon 140,000 widows and 92,000 orphans. pension on the basis of the military scheme, it would mean on that basis an expenditure of £8,500,000 per ann u m ; but, taking the basis of application for the old-age pension as a guide-that is, one in three-thi s would be reduced to £2,800,000 per annum. The only items to which the Government are not pledged are the pensions to the blind and to the old people in institutions. pension would cost the Government £85,000 per annum; the pensions to our old friends in the benevolent institutions will cost £ 4 0 , 0 0 0; and an additional 2s. 6d. per week to the old-age and invalid pensions would mean £680,000 per annum. estimate ? which I have obtained from Mr Knibbs. every blind man a pension, whether he was wealthy or not ' it , yes; but I do not think we have many wealthy blind people in the Commonwealth. There are very few indeed, and probably they would not apply ""for the And your party pension. The expenditure on account of the old people in the benevolent institutions would only mean £40,000 per annum, and I should think that the Commonwealth is sufficiently prosperous to be able to pay that amount without any inconvenience whatever. These proposals JOHN FORREST -We have given would mean a total additional expenditure, as far as pensions are concerned, of £3,605,000 per annum; but, as we know that there is an opportunity in the Commonwealth at the present time of tapping resources of revenue not hitherto touched, and from which we might probably obtain Order ! I must the whole of the revenue required, I think it is only fair and reasonable that the Government should give it some consideraI trust that the Gotion. The source of revenue I refer to was that mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa, namely, a tax on bachelors; and in connection with this matter it is instructive to know that 42 per cent, of the male population in Australia is unmarried at the present time. We have heard much in this chamber, more especially since the war broke out, about the unemployed male portion of our community; but my own opinion is that there are probably more women than men If they received the unemployed. Many countries in the world have attempted legislation on the lines I suggest; and it is eminently necessary, in view of the fact that, in the present day, men wait until they are forty-five or fifty years of age before they marry. This is because our unmarried men, in many instances, earn salaries sufficient to enable them to live as single men in such ease and luxury that they do The blind not care to settle down to married life with its responsibilities. All will agree that this question is one of very serious importance to Australia. Authorities declare, not only in Australia, but in other countries, that a great social evil arises from the tendency to which I have referred. The money that could be raised by means of a tax of this kind is urgently needed, especially when we consider that.",34,Department Of The Treasury

290,Mr Sharpe,"If he desired to haveunder the present circumstances, the Government may not find themselves in a position to pay the pensions that have been announced to the people. The presence of so many unmarried men in the community gives rise to evils that we must all deplore. The lives of many innocent girls are disturbed; and men delay marriage until they arrive at an age when their health is not what it would be in the married state. A t forty-five or fifty years of age, as I have already said, they find that they are not so attractive as they were when younger, and they feel compelled to make an attempt to settle down, with the result that, in many cases, they marry girls from twenty to twenty-five years their junior. My own opinion is that any tax under 8 per cent, would not be of much use. As a matter of fact, I am not inclined to think that even such a tax as that would not cause many men to marry, but it would probably cause some to do so. William III . of England imposed a tax, ranging from Is. to £ 1 2 10s. per annum on all unmarried men over twenty-five years of age. In 1785, P it t , when Prime Minister, taxed all bachelors' servants; and in Bulgariai n 1909 a tax of 8s. 4d. per annum was imposed on bachelors. In 1910 the German Parliament passed a before the war the Finance Commission of the Russian Duma approved of a B ill with that object in view. In 1795, unmarried men in France were taxed; and in several of the States of America bachelors are called upon to pay for the privilege of living a single life. The number of unmarried men in the Commonwealth between the ages of twenty-one and sixty is 541,000. member tax a bachelor over the age of sixty ? the honourable member, he has become afraid of some tax of the kind. I fancy that those honourable members who now seem very much amused at this proposal will prove to be its staunchest supporters. If we take one-third of that number of men as taxable, and we impose a tax of £1 0 per head per annum, the resultant revenue, after exempting all earning less than £200 per annum, and all who are responsible for dependents, parents or invalid members of the family, will amount to nearly £2,000,000 per [ 9 1 ] -2 annum. The gross earnings of bachelors who are earning over £ 2 0 0 per annum, amount to £68,211,000; and if we take one-third of that amount as available for taxation we get, at 8 per cent., £1,800,000. Many people consider that a much greater revenue than I have suggested might be raised from this form of taxation. I am not the only member of this House who has advocated the taxation of bachelors. I am satisfied that many w ill be pleased to hear that a proposition was lo be submitted for the taxation of these people. Many of them who are in a position to pay taxation are escaping probably a fifth of the taxation of the community generally in the Commonwealth to-day, and, quite apart from that, by ref r a in in g from getting married, they are not doing their duty to the nation. inember proposing a resolution in conAs far back as 1695, nexion with this matter, or what action does he propose to take? sion to my views on the subject. My idea is that we could raise sufficient revenue by this means to pay the pensions which, I think, should he paid to people in the Commonwealth. The Government do not desire to impose new taxation in law of the kind; and just any other form . This is a source of taxation which can best be tapped at the present time. Many people in the Commonwealth are not paying a tenth of the taxation which they should he paying, and I am confident that I have underestimated the revenue likely to be derived from a tax upon bachelors. I should like to suhmit to honourable members the names of one or two people who have already advocated the taxation of bachelors before quoting the opinions they have expressed. Amongst the number are the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Sir David Hennessy; Mr Carmichael, late Minister of Education in New South Wales; Miss Gladys Taylor, barrister-at-law; Mr Watt, the honourable member for Balaclava; Mr Atkinson, the honourable member for W i l m o t; D r . Maloney, the honourable member for Melbourne: Mr. Denny, the late Attorney-Generali n the Verran Government; and the Rev. Douglas Price, a prominent clergyman in Brissuch as bane.

Look at America. It s curse is its population of aliens from all lands. Bachelors are intensely'selfish, and it is useless for them to cry poverty as an excuse. Most bachelors spend more than would keep two wives. If they only had the sense to marry, they would benefit financially as well as morally. If they don't, and won't, marry-well , tax and re-tax them."" This is what Mr Carmichael saidI find that in the whole of the Commonwealth, out of 1,248,000 men between the ages of eighteen and fifty, 079,000 are unmarried, widowed, or divorced.

It will not take me more than ten minutes to do so. Miss Gladys Taylor said"" If a man remains single from choice, no tax w ill make him marry or alter his selfish existence."" Miss Taylor thinks "" that every person should be married at twenty."" believes that thc unmarried man or woman is a social evil. This is Mr Watt's opinionI don't think that the bachelor is a curse to society. In every State a certain number of bachelors is inevitable. But his subsequent remarks stamped MrW a t t as a keen advocate for the bachelor tax. as the honourable member u s u a l l y is. Mr Atkinson thinks that while, at the present time., there may be some justification for the imposition of a bachelor tax, sucli an impost can hardly be supported on general principles in ordinary times, as it would be only a class tax. "" And,"" he added, '* if the object of the tax is to induce people to marry, then it can scarcely be compatible wit h the idea that marriages are made in Heaven."" T h is is D r . M a l o n e y ' so p in i o n "" SurelyI would tax every blessed bachelor there is,"" he said, when he was asked the question. "" The party to which I belong wants to make life for every man and woman such that they shall have when they make the means to exist without fear for the children, who w ill be the future units of the State."" A bachelor tax would be a realization of one of the ideals he had cherished since he had been in Parliament. "" When I started parliamentary life,"" lie said, "" I had three ideals-woman' s suffrage, old-age pensions, and a child pension. Two of these have been realized through the agency of the party to which I belong, and before long I hope to see this bachelor taxmy fourth ideal-as o realized."" The Rev. Douglas Price, an eminent Brisbane minister, expressed this view"" I do not consider,"" said Mr Price, in answer to a question, "" that this taxwould make any one marry who did not already intend to. Tlie only moral defect in this tax that I can see would be to make unmarried men realize that they have a duty to the State. A man earning £200 a year could well afford to pay 5 or 10 per cent. ThenI should say married men with families, and who are earning less than £250, should be exempt from taxation. If women drew equal wages, ana were economically in the same position, it would be a fair thing to tax them also; but thoy aro not. I advocate the taxation of bachelors only on the ground tliat it will be fair for all who can to take part in the burden of common life. It won't make men moral, nor w ill it induce them to become parents."" ber believe in the t a x a t i o n of spinsters ? other a u t h o r it i e s, gathered from newsShe papers t h r o u g h o u t the C o m m o n w e a l t h, whic h I m i g h t quote.

My chief object was to draw attention to the anomalous position in which the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act places old-age pensioners who become inmates of public institutions. Section 45 of that Act provides thatIf a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane or a hospital, his pension shall, without further or other authority than this Act, be deemed to be suspended, but when the pensioner is discharaed from any such asylum or hospital, payment of his pension shall be resumed, and he shall be entitled to payment in respect of the period during which hiti pension was so suspended, of a sum representing not more than four weeks' instalments of the pension, if the suspension so long continued. The committees of these public institutions undertake a very laborious and trying financial and personal obligation in their endeavour to set up and maintain establishments which will care for could those who are afflicted or in ill-health. The Commonwealth, in assuming control of the old-age and invalid pension system, took over the obligation from those States which had then made provision for the payment of old-age pensions. It seems that the Commonwealth Government are prepared now to pay an old man or woman a pension as long as he or she remains in good health, but that should an old-age pensioner become affl'cted with ill health they cast on the State the obligation of caring for him. Some of these public institutions have two wings-on e used as a general hospital, the other as a benevolent asylum, and we have the spectacle of two roads leading to the one institution. In the benevolent wing, an old-age pensioner may become a paying I shall bring guest. That is his position when he enters the benevolent wing, but should he encer the general hospital wing, then, under the Jaw, and its present administration, he does so practically as a pauper. I do not care to use the word* "" pauper "" in this connection, but it seems to me that the Act as administered to-day declares, in effect, that the Commonwealth Government are willing to pay an old man a pension while he remains in good health, but that at the very time when his necessity should demand some additional allowance his pension is stopped. We are all aware of the great difficulties with which these public institutions have A f t e r that the honourable to contend. In many mining towns, where the hidden wealth of the districts has been, to a great extent, laid bare and won, the population has dwindled Sown, but these institutions are kept going by the public spirit ana philanthropy of the citizens. It may be said that, approximately, one-third of the revenue of these institutions is subscribed by the State-that is the position in Victoriaand the finding of the remaining two-thirds is an obligation cast upon the general community. It seems to me most illogical that the Commonwealth, having undertaken the guardianship of these old people-havin g determined that when they are no longer able to be hewers of wood and drawers of water they shall be able to end their days in reasonable comfort-shoul d create this anomaly uuder which old people, to whom this privilege has been extended, are forced as beggars into these institutions when stricken down by illness.

The establishment of the Commonwealth Bank is the only Labour measure for whicli the Opposition has not tried to take credit; the only one about which the houorable member for Parramatta has not said, "" We introduced it , "" or "" We first talked about it . "" To-night, for the first time, I heard the right honourable member give the Bank his blessing. able member must have been deaf. to hear what the Leader of the Opposition said this evening. Like him, I desire that the Bank, which belongs to bhe people, shall become a National Bank. He compared the national banks of the older countries of the world with our baby Bank, which is only two or three years of age. All the national banks of the world had a struggle in their infancy, and our Bank is in a fortunate position. To make it a truly National Bank, I think it would be a wise thing to get the States to become partners with the Commonwealth, and to form a Board on which they would be represented, not for the control of the Bank's operations, but to give advice. I would make the Bank a truly national institution. The right honourable member for Swan is very much concerned because the Savings Bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank is asking in the Old Country for the shillings of poor people. The right honourable member thinks that Australia ought to in duce the poor people of the Old Country to come out here. Why, then, should he object to the establishment of offices of the Savings Bank branch of the CommonI can quite wealth Bank at Home?

One of them immediately remarked, "" I sliall put my money into the Commonwealth Savings Bank,"" and when I asked why, he replied, "" Because the Labour blokes manage it . and the boodlers cannot take out the money while they are in power."" Throughout the western back country of Queensland, the people have so much confidence in the Labour Administration that they are taking money out of the State Savings Bank to put it into the Commonwealth Savings Bauk. The honourable member for Parramatta complained that the Commonwealth is depriving the States of money deposited in the Savings Banks. Does he not remember the old Protectionist argument, which we shall hear repeated again and again presently, that the great thing is to keep bhe money in the country ?

I hope that the Treasurer w ill act upon my suggestionj as it could be carried out very easily. The trouble generally arises h i the big centres of population.

I am not, in any shape or form, criticising any of the Government's operations. I do not think it is our function here to do more than to help the Government in a matter of very -grave financial difficulty. But I do suggest that it is not the best way to help the Government to pretend that we are not doing things, when it is well known to every one of us here, and to every -student of public affairs, that we necessarily are doing them, and have done them to a considerable extent. same as the British Government. am only saying that what the honourable member for Maranoa said, and what the Minister of Home Affairs cheered, is not correct, and the latter knows it. I do not think that the honourable member for Maranoa was quite fair to the honourable member for Oxley. I think that he ought to recognise that there is some sort of poetic justice in the fact that the two Labour members for Brisbane are men I may say-and I am not exercised in their minds over beef, bachelors, and beer. Does not my honourable friend see something almost of divine retribution in the fact that the bachelors of Australia should be made to pay for the baby bonus? The proposition of the honourable member for Oxley is that they pay for the bonus, and the only weak link in the whole scheme of argument is that the less persons you have to pay-in other words, the more effective the tax becomes-the greater will become the burden that the tax has been created I do not say that for a to obviate! I cannot see that the argument of the honourable member for Oxley will carry very much weight in the community outside. I can only commend him for one thing in connection with the proposal, and that is his extraordinary discretion. For, while recognising how easy it is to secure the affections of the other sex, recognising the supreme impossibility of the lamentable fate outlined by the honourable .member for Maranoa ever befalling any man-the lamentable fate of being unable to get a mate to attend to his hornet-hi s discretion in limiting it to a basis of £200 a year shows that there is some sanity underlying his proposition. It would be a difficult thing indeed to start out to tax every bachelor in Australia, for, after all, bachelors over the age of twenty-one years and beneath the age of sixty years, have votes. But, in proposing only to tax those who have more than a certain sum of money, my honourable friend feels that his poetic ideas are on a fairly safe electoral basis.

Before resuming my seat, I desire to refer to one aspect of the Coming to the terms, moral or otherwisemonwealth Bank which I think is worthy of the atcention of honourable members. On the Estimates is an item of £8,000 for the payment of exchange upon Commonwealth banking operations, and I am afraid that unless this matter is watched the item for exchange will actually be in handed to them in London, where they flated very largely with the laudable object of giving the Commonwealth Bank a particular profit. I agree that the Commonwealth should do all its business through its own B a n k I think every honourable member is agreed upon that point-b'l t I believe that we can go too far in that direction. illustration of what I mean. When I was presiding in the Department of Home Affairs, a recommendation came before me.one morning that a certain railway contractor in Western Australia should be paid some instalment of his contract by telegraphic remittance, and having looked through the papers, and found that this man was entitled to the prompt payment of his instalments as they became due, I looked to see what he asked me. that these sums of money should be Daid into his credit in Melbourne. I ascertained that this request had been overruled, and that the arrangement was that the Department should telegraph the money to Perth or Bunbury, or the particular place in Western Australia where the contractor was located', and that this had actually been done on a previous occasion. The contractor was getting done for nothing what he was quite prepared to do at his own expense. I asked an officer of the Department, "" Why do you charge the Department in this way?"" and he replied, "" The Department is not charged a cent, for it . "" Thereupon I asked, "" Who bears the expense? Is the Commonwealth Bank a philanthropic institution that does the work for nothing?"" and the officer said, "" No ; the Treasury pays."" If the Treasury proposes to pay for all sorts of things for private contractors, for which these people are not clamouring, and to which they have no right, the Commonwealth Bank is going to be, to a certain extent, while beneficial otherwise, a burden on the taxpayers. Mr Kulhi. would pay on the spot. pays where he is entitled to pay, accordgenerally otherwise-of his contracts. Take the transaction to which the honourable member for Maranoa referred, the lending of a large sum of money by the Imperial Government. The States of Australia wished to have the money effect all their balances, and meet all their obligations, but the Treasury would not pay that money in London, and insisted on paying it over in Australia, and, as a consequence, the cost of bringing the money to Australia against all the exchange had to be borne by the people of Let me give an Australia in order, apparently, that the Commonwealth Bank might get a b it of exchange profit. I am anxious that the Commonwealth Bank should prosper, and be given every opportunity to do so, but the action of deliberately placing this burden ou the back of the people of Australia in order that the Commonwealth Bank might show a profit is not good business either for the people of Australia or for, the Bank itself. The honourable member for Maranoa also referred All that he asked for was to the way in which State Savings Bank deposits were leaving the State Savings Banks, and coming to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but if the honourable member would examine the State Savings Bank accounts, he would find that a vast number of the accounts are in excess of the amount on which interest is payable a fact which the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank very cleverly recognised ; because, although he had placed his rate of interest at | per cent, iower than the rate paid by most of the State Savings Banks, he is still getting all this surplus investment. There is nothing very wonderful about that. whether that is a fact. wealth Savings Bank is getting a large number of investments is a fact.

Commonwealth Bank admits that he gets most of his money in that way. involve the larger question to which the honourable member for Maranoa drew attention, namely, the desirableness of bringing all our great institutions into line, trying to get them co-partners in one great national scheme instead of remaining competitors for the savings of the people. I rise to endorse and support the remarks made by the honourable member for Wannoni n regard to the distribution of the old-age pensions. The honourable member has explained the matter very clearly, and I wish to refer only to that portion of his remarks dealing with the payment of pensions to pensioners who are inmates of various State institutions. The old-age pension is granted as a right, and in those circumstances the pensioner is perfectly entitled to claim continuity of payment of the pension. The payment of the pension is an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth, because it is given in order that it may provide tlie aged with the necessary sustenance of l if e ; and, on the other hand, if a pensioner goes into a State institution and is cured, I consider that there is an obligation on his part to pay portion of his pension to that in stitution. A stipulation in accordance with a proposal made by the righ t honourable member for Swan when he was Treasurer, to the effect that a certain portion of his pension should be paid to the institution in which a pensioner is being treated would be quite fair. We are all agreed that the various State institutions are doing some of the best work it is possible for any public bodies to do. Some of the best service that can be given by -citizens is given to the direction and management of hospitals and other public institutions. The skill of our doctors, the devotion of our nurses, the equipment of the institutions for the performance of operations, and the general attention to patients, are the best that money can procure. Therefore, as the Commonwealth has undertaken the obligation of paying the old-age pension, and on that ground the payment of the pension should It accounts for a very be continuous, when occasion arises for a pensioner to enter a State institution to I know several cases of that be medically treated, the stipulation should be laid down that a portion of his Governor of the pension should be paid to the hospital authorities. That is a logical position that should receive sympathetic consideration from the Treasurer. I am sorry that the right honourable gentleman is not in the chamber during this debate upon' the Treasury Estimates, because I would like to offer a few observations on some of his statements about the drought which has afflicted the Commonwealth during the last eighteen months. I have no desire to pose as a pessimist, or to circulate statements which may have a deleterious effect on the credit of Australia. I can quite understand the optimistic attitude taken up by the Treasurer and his desire to preserve the credit of the Commonwealth by every expression of optimism to which he has given utterance on more than one occasion; but I think the Commonwealth is sufficiently sound financially, and has sufficient recuperative powers, to stand on a statement of the position as it actually is. No good can accrue at any time from a mis-statement of our productive position. I do not say that in certain directions the drought w it h which we have bsen afflicted during the past twelve months caused such a tremendous loss of stock as did the drought of 1902. The fact is that in our grazing areas the drought is still in evidence. . We have not had sufficient rain to sustain the growth of feed which is necessary to the maintenance of the stock that has so f a r heen saved. The only reason why the present drought has not in flicted greater loss upon us in the matter of stock than did the drought of 1902 is that our pastoralists were in a better position to withstand it . That has been due entirely to the productive power of the Commonwealth, and to the splendid action on the part of our financial institutions, which enabled our graziers to maintain, as far as they possibly can, their flocks by the purchase of artificial fodder.

I am very glad to say that, so far, we have not sustained quite such a severe loss during the present drought, and for the reason I have stated. But we are by no means "" out of the wood,"" although I hope that the drought has broken sufficiently to enable our pastoralists to maintain the flocks which they have so f a r saved. raisers realized that it was their duty if possible-eve n if it cost them their last shilling-to preserve their flocks as an asset to Australia. tions helped wonderfully. lieve that in Victoria, South Australia, and ""Western Australia the drought which we have experienced during the past twelve months was much more universal and severe than was the drought of 1902. From Mr Knibbs' publication I gather that in 1900-01 there were only 1,517,000 tons of hay in Australia, whereas in 1913 we started with more than double that quantity, namely, 3,217,000 tons. 3902 the highest price realized for chaff in the northern parts of Victoria was about £ 6 10s. per ton, whereas at the present time it is being sold for £ 1 2 and £ 1 3 per ton. It is obvious, therefore, that, although when the present drought started we had more than twice the amount of hay that was held in stock in 1902, our supplies must have been reduced to a lower level than has ever been touched before. The people who have suffered mostly as the result of the drought during the past eighteen months have been the graziers and agriculturists, and they have been met with an increase of the land tax to the extent of f u l l y one-third of the cessary, 100.000 tons of fodder could have original rate. The price of fodder would not be as high as it is if , prior to the admade inquiries from the Trade Commisjournment of this Parliament, in December last, the Minister of Trade and Customs had suspended the fodder duties, just as he did the wheat duties. We should then have been in a position to import large quantities from New Zealand and South America. As a ""Protectionist, I am not an advocate of suspending Customs duties on commodities as soon as a shortage is experienced. But I venture to say that the duty upon wheat was suspended last December because of the pressure which was brought to bear in the great central cities of Australia. The Government are open to a very serious charge on account of their unsympathetic attitude towards the great agricultural and pastoral interests of Australia. is losing sight of the fact that the Commonwealth offered to import direct for the States. orable member took a considerable interest in this matter last session, and that on several occasions he put very pertinent questions to the Minister of Trade and Customs regarding the suspension of the fodder duties. ment imported the fodder the pastoralists would have had to pay the duty. formed the States that if they would in timate what their requirements were likely to be, or the quantity which they were prepared to handle, the Commonwealth would import that quantity for them.

If 50,000 or 100,000 tons of fodder had been imported from New Zealand at that time, we could have obtained our chaff £ 3 or £ 4 per ton less than we are paying for it now, and it would have had the effect of keeping down the price throughout the Commonwealth. As was the case with wheat, a large proportion of the chaff was held by large capitalists, and we may be sure that the price was systematically regulated in accordance with the supply in hand. available through the Union Company. chaff now? price is from £ 1 2 to £ 1 3 per ton. To show that the Minister of Trade and Customs realized that the policy he had failed to adopt in December was the policy he should have adopted, we have his statement at the eleventh hour that he would allow anybody to import into the Commonwealth, and there would be a refund of the duty paid as soon as Parliament met and gave the necessary authority. But we know that it is ter as one affecting the administration of with a matter that relates to the Customs partment are reached.

That letter was written on the 5th March of this year. Had there been sympathetic administration or a desire to deal sympathetically with the pastoral and agricultural interests of Australia, the decisions contained in that letter would have been arrived at in December when the Government decided to suspend the duty on wheat. I have no desire to go into the question of the losses of horses and cattle on account of the drought, but should there he a breaking up of the drought I do not despair of the recuperative power of Australia enabling us to regain the position we have always occupied as the chief sheep and cattle breeders of the world. I have made these remarks in order to show that, in my opinion, when we were faced with a visitation such as the drought, it was the duty of the Prime Minister to place before the people the facts of the case, and not make a misstatement which would assuredly look worse, when the financial interests of the",45,Department Of The Treasury

Monaro) [9.54] I think the Committee is entitled to a statement from the Treasurer in answer to questions which have been raised to-night. A statement was made by the honourable member for Wentworth that on £18,000,000 which had been borrowed from London, exchange was paid to bolster up the Commonwealth Bank, instead of paying the money in London, as asked by the States. If that statement is correct, the transaction is outrageous, and we ought to have an explanation from the Government. Then the honorahle member for Oxley informed the Committee that unless the Government take a certain course of action regarding an increase in the pensions, members on the Ministerial side will take steps to force the hands of the Government. assist us? desire the assistance of the honourable member, who, to-night, with his tongue in his cheek, accused honourable members on this side of insincerity. He should be one of the last members in the House to speak in that manner, for if there is insincerity because we criticise the Bank we are opon the subject of pensions, it is not on this side. It is all very well for the honourable member to make these statements, but he should have shown us his earnestness in the matter. Let the Government say that they will adopt a common-sense attitude by taking up the Bill brought forward by the right honourable member for Swan last session. Country hospitals are being defrauded nf what is their due right, simply on account of the inaction of the Government. The honourable member for Oxley has been talking about a tax on bachelors; but why did not he say something about some of the bachelors who are loafing at the city street corners? Why does not the Government send these men to the front? I know this is not the time to raise a controversy, and, instead of talking about taxing bachelors, it is up to the was a very serious charge. I hope it is Treasurer to give some answer to the statement made this evening. honourable member as to what we do ? honourable member for Oxley charges me with insincerity, he will get some small change. We would be cowards in this House if we did not say what we think. If the honourable member for Oxley talks about quarrelling, he will be sorry that he came into the fight. the Minister sitting at the table has told the Prime Minister what was said in this House about bolstering up the Commonwealth Bank by exchange on money sent from London, and surely he is going to answer the statement at once. I am one of those who believe in the Commonwealth Bank. It is a very big institution. It should be the greatest institution of this country, and I refuse to allow gentlemen on that side of the House to insinuate, or make out, that we are opposed to the Commonwealth Bank simply because we exercise our right of criticism. I ask the Treasurer what he has to say with regard to suggestions for a directorate. I have nothing to say against Mr Denison Miller, hut he has powers that should be shared by men from the different States. What has the Treasurer to say to that? There appears to be an impression that posed to it. The statement made to-night will be viewed with a great deal of alarm in this country, and I again ask the Treasurer if he intends to say anything about it . Is the Treasurer prepared to give an answer to the charge by the honourable member for Wentworth? exchange was paid on a large sum of money for the purpose of bolstering up the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank. Surely the other Ministers sitting at the table heard that. that way. the statement was made, and I repeat it not true. If it is true, it is a public scandal, and a very serious reflection on the Treasurer. I would be loth indeed to guilty of such a grave indiscretion. Why",46,Department Of The Treasury

That is a proper spirit. 1 do not want to fight, and I ask honorahle members not to charge us with insincerity.

A sensible, straightforward, business like arrangement was made with the States, and the money they required for material for their public works purposes could be got in London. I wish to refer very briefly to the matter of old-age pensions.
