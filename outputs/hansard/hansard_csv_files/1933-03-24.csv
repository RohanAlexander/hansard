The particulars of any you, proposals for submission to the Loan Council which the Commonwealth Government may submit to the Loan Council will not be made public until they have actually been placed before that body. The position is being carefully watched, and the Government is gratified to know that the programmes adopted by the various governments of Australia have already resulted in a decided reduction in the volume of unemployment. make funds available for the purchase of blankets and clothing for the unemployed during the coming winter? of any Government decision in that matter will be made at the proper time, and not in answer to a. question. ment consider the provision of clothing and blankets for the unemployed during the forthcoming winter months? The unemployment relief schemes now operating in the States barely supply the food requirements of the unemployed; they do urn provide for the supply of clothes and bedding. ""Will the Government bring this matter before the Loan Council, or the next Premiers Conference? right in saying that no Eederal Government has ever endeavoured to provide directly for the distribution of food or clothing throughout Australia otherwise than by making available certain defence material. In regard to the territories of the Oommonwealth, successive Eederal Governments have recognized their responsibility in this matter. All the Governments of Australia consider-and I think, rightly-that such activities in the States are more efficiently conducted by the States than by the Commonwealth. It is unlikely that the Eederal Government will consider any Australian-wide scheme, to be controlled by the federal authorities, as suggested by the honourable member.

Are you able to say whether his report has yet been received, and, if so, what action it is proposed to take in connection with it? been received. It is a very complete document, .and deals with 'every department of the Parliament. It contains many important suggestions for the reorganization of the parliamentary staffs. Since many of the recommendations apply to the departments associated with both Houses of the Parliament, I have communicated with the President of the Senate, and on his return ful l consideration will be given to the report. THE CENSUS. . obvious unfairness of the Government's decision that the examinations of persons seeking employment on clerical work in connection with the forthcoming census shall be held only in the capital cities of the States, and at Canberra, will the Government consider the possibility of conducting examinations by post so that intending applicants who live in country districts may be able to sit for the examination ? members have stiggested that examinations should be held in various country centres, but, for reasons which, on consideration, will appear obvious, it has not been found possible to adopt that suggestion. I am afraid that the proposal of the honourable member for New England (Mi'. Thompson) is impracticable. The essence of an examination is that each examinee shall be under observation and control during the holding of it. It would, of course, be possible to desjmtch the papers to various country centres, and to require candidates to work under the control of an observer, but that would mean the holding of examinations at a large number of centres. The number of positions to be filled is so small, and the If those who are concerned with the difficulties associated with the organizadevelopment of the Newnes field will tion of such a scheme so many, that the procedure would be quite disproportionate to the end sought to be achieved. munication from a man, who informs me that, after being rejected fourteen times for active service during the war, he was accepted for service in home defence, and holds a certificate to that effect. He has made application for employment in the work of collecting the census this year, but has been refused. Will the Acting Prime Minister give an undertaking that men who can produce such certificates will be eligible for employment in the work referred to ? Act contains a definition of "" returned soldier"", which, doubtless, was adopted by Parliament after a great deal of discussion, and, I should thinkI was not in the Parliament at the time-afte r a full consideration of the position of such men as that mentioned by the honourable member.

42,Mr Stacey (Adelaide) [11.2],"Iad valorem on foreign bitumen will add an extra cost of 14s. a ton to tbe bitumen used in Australia. Many thousand tons of bitumen are used in this country in a year, and the imposition of this duty will add £700 to the cost of every 1,000 tons of it. Honourable members should realize that all the road work done by municipalities is paid for im the form of a tax which Ave know as rates. It has been necessary to lower the rates in almost every State in the last few years on account of the depression. If we increase the price of bitumen to local governing bodies, road-making work-will be restricted, and less employment will be available. In addition to the duty of 10 per cent., local governing bodies have to pay sales tax of 6 per cent, on their bitumen. I understand that the reason for the imposition of this 10 per cent, duty is that the Government desires to provide a preference for a British product known as "" Trinidad"" bitumen. I gathered from, an answer to a question this morning, that "" Trinidad"" had not yet been tested in Canberra. ""We are therefore, being asked to endorse the duty of 10 per cent, for purely experimental purposes. the experiment will be a success. I understand that the price of "" Trinidad"" is very much in excess of the price of American bitumen. An Australian product known as Coalas has been used as a substitute for bitumen, but it has not been satisfactory. Thousands of miles of roads in Australia have been treated with bitumen, either by spraying or penetration, to the vast improvement of their surface, and it would be regrettable if we were to penalize our road-making authorities by approving' of this duty. I remember when the first piece of bitumen road in Australia was made in the St. Peters municipality of Adelaide. That was many years ago The penetration system was used. to-day as when it was first put down, and the cost of maintaining it has been nil. I have had the honour to sit on the St. Peters Council as councillor and alderman for many years, and have also been mayor of the municipality. I , there"" Trinidad,"" which is a wonderful fore, know how important it is to our local governing bodies that road-making material shall be made available at the lowest possible price. It is also being suggested that an extra duty of30 per cent, be placed on the containers of imported bitumen. It would be a mistake for us to approve of this proposal. In view of the fact that the substitutes that we have tried for American bitumen have been unsatisfactory I appeal to the Minister to agree to the withdrawal of this duty. I have had communications from many municipalities and district councils throughout my own State to the effect that this duty will hamper their operactions; and it is on their behalf that I ask for the removal of it. support the requestof the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) up to a point. Until about twenty years ago; there was not the same need to use bitumen for our road work. I would gladly support the proposal of the Government if the Australian tar available to us were' as good now as it was twenty years ago; but; unfortunately, with the exception of New^ castle tar, which, is still fairly satisfactory, it is not suitable for our need. getting better every day. . The Melbourne tar is most unsatisfactory. I understand that there is good demand for all the Newcastle tar that is, available. Certainly there is not enough of it available for the requirements of all municipalities, and it is necessary for many municipalities to use some other suitable material. I am glad that cement is coming into its own in these days, and I am anxious that it should be used to the fullest possible extent, in order that we may avoid the importation of American products. TVe have been experimenting with the use of cement by penetration and otherwise, and have found it very satisfactory, but unfortunately, the cost of road-making with cement is excessive. That road is as good Concrete roads cost, probably, six times as much as ordinary bitumen roads. The concrete roads we have in Canberra are satisfactory, but too expensive for ordinary use. I have asked several questions in the last two days in regard to material, and makes a splendid road when used in certain ways; but I say definitely",16,Division 9 Drug S And Chemicals

We made a road in Melbourne with this material a considerable time ago, and it is not yet showing any sign of wear. shall not spend money on American road-making material if we can get suitable material within the Empire, but at present, material suitable for spraying does not seem to be available elsewhere. I except, of course, the Newcastle tar. It is manifestly unwise for road-making authorities to spray a material on the roads which will last for only six or twelve months if they can spray with bitumen which will last from two to five years, even if the initial cost of the tar is only half the cost of the bitumen. I suggest to the Minister that he look into this subject with the object of trying to meet the wishes of the municipalities in regard ' to the provision of less costly road-making material. I venture the opinion that, because of the multitude of matters presented to the Ottawa Conference, delegates were not fully conversant with the details when they decided that a 10 per cent, duty should be placed on foreign bitumen. I was glad to hear the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) say that his department intends to experiment with "" Trinidad"" for road-spraying purposes. He will find that, because of its characteristics, it does not liquefy satisforeigners, which will give an advantage factorily for road spraying. I am sure that all honourable members are anxious that as much money as is possible should be spent on our roads, because of the resultant benefit to the community. I commend the matter to the serious consideration of the Minister. port the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) and the honourable member for Batman( Mr experimented successfully with Newcastle Dennis), particularly the sentiments that move them to patronize dominion goods rather than those coming from the United States of America. Hitherto both honourable gentlemen have been consistent supporters of every protected item upon which there has been a division in this chamber. However, this item touches interests with which they are closely concerned, for both have occupied high municipal offices, and realize the influence of tariff on municipal costs. I appeal to them and all other honourable members similarly placed, to express like views on items I am very anxious that we affecting country interests. Municipal authorities are doing useful work providing amenities for the cities, therefore I support the request of honourable members, but I maintain that their attitude now is in strong contrast with that adopted by them in regard to industries which closely concern country communities. honourable member is not in order in making such comparisons. should assist those who deal with us, and exclude, so far as is possible, goods from such countries as the United States of America, which trade with Australia as little as they can. [11.19] -Only one request has been made by the various speakers, namely, that the Minister should look into this subject. That, he will do in any circumstances. I hope that when doing so he will endeavour to ensure that Australian interests are conserved. Generally speaking, the complaint has been that we have unduly protected Australian industries. In this instance we are going a little further by imposing a 10 per cent, duty against to the product of Trinidad ancl other sections of the British Empire. We have almost unlimited surplus stocks of coal in Australia, and experiments are continually being conducted with coal products in order to improve road making methods. I know, from my : experience as a member of the Public Works Committee, that the administration in the Federal Capital Territory tar, a product which has since been much improved. The Minister would do well to consider that aspect of the matter, and avoid doing anything that will check the progress of local development.

If , as suggested by one or two honourable members, municipalities desire to have roads with a bituminous surface, they might go further and investigate the qualities of concrete, an all-Australian product, which costs only 25 per cent, more on the pre-duty price.

But-with the increased output from the Trinidad lake, which will result in lower handling costs, and the very probable adjustment downward in the price of foreign bitumen to meet the Trinidad competition, I do not think that even this increase will eventuate. As the American companies find that they are losing business, they will probably reduce the price of what is, after all, a by-product. Of course, they do not want to reduce prices, and they will mislead honourable members if possible with their propaganda. Besides, as I previously stated, a good deal of our road-making is done with Australian concrete and tar. the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr fact that it is a part of the Ottawa Stacey), and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Dennis) are authorities on road-making, on the technicalities of which I would not challenge them. However, they must take all pertinent factors into consideration. £9,270 include the extra cost that would result from the purchase of "" Trinidad"" as against American bitumen, also the 10 per cent, duty? which are available to honourable members. This duty should assist in diverting into Empire channels a portion of the trade previously done with the TJnited States of America, a country which has shown little consideration for Australia when making its tariffs. No doubt, honourable members have been circularized regarding the duty on foreign bitumen. Many exaggerated statements are made to the effect that the Trinidad product is unsuitable for all road-construction purposes. So serious were these representations that the local agents for the Trinidad bitumen were forced to publish a full statement concerning the history and uses of Trinidad bitumen in road-making. The following extract on the subject is taken from the Australian Municipal Journal of the 15th December, 1932 :Trinidad is in reality a binding agency which holds together particles of the road wearing schedule to containers, may I not discuss surface, hence is a ""bitumen,"" and as such them on this, item? complies generally with any standard specification. Actually, due to its well-recognized characteristics, Trinidad is regarded by road engineers as a sort of standard to which other bituminous binders are compared. The article goes onBitumen from the Pitch Lake was the chief binding agency in this early work, and it is significant that many of these pioneer asphalt surfaces, built 30 to 40 years ago, are still in use, notwithstanding the complete revolution in road transport which has occurred since their completion. When honourable members who pose as authorities challenge this slight duty against a foreign articlea by-product of American oil works-othe r honourable members may be influenced to vote against the item. The weight of evidence is in favour of our accepting this proposal because of the preferences we I know that are to gain, apart altogether from the agreement. This article is moderately worded, and honourable members should read it. They have read the propaganda from the other side; let them now read the reply. The statement that thousands of men at present engaged in road repair and construction works will be placed on the unemployed list because of the imposition of a duty on foreign bitumen is most misleading. I have the statistics, This is one of the items arising directly out of the Ottawa agreement, and I ask, therefore, that it be agreed to. The whole position was very carefully examined by the Australian delegation at Ottawa, and our representatives were satisfied that Trinidad bitumen could be used for practically all road repair and construction purposes. I shall watch the operation of this impost to see whether the claims of the opponents of the duty aVe justified. Minister made no reference to the 30 per cent, duty on containers of imported bitumen.

I know that it is useless to argue the matter uuless the Minister is prepared to agree to my amendment. articles listed in item 269 are pest destroyers. They do not create wealth by their application; they merely preserve wealth. It is singular that, in this in stance as in others, there are those who would batten on the primary producer even when he is merely seeking to destroy pests which injure his crop. There are parasitical secondary industries which are prepared to thrive, even on the misfortunes of the primary producer. Tha killing and clearing of timber is necessary for the proper cultivation of the. soil, but the work of the farmer is made more difficult and more costly by the in . creased charges imposed on the material he must use. Surely the Minister w ill take notice of the recommendation made to him. The duties ought to be lower, but they w ill conform to the formula contained in the Ottawa agreement if the amendment of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) is accepted. It should be unthinkable for the national Parliament to impose a levy on the misfortunes of the primary producers. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). It appears to me that we are unduly in creasing the price of articles that are necessary to those in country districts. These weed killers, germicides and in secticides are. not -used in the cities to the saine extent as in the country. .The demand for such materials in f r u it growing areas is very great. They are of enormous economic importance to the primary producers, and should be made available at the cheapest price. Many of these commodities are not manufactured in Australia to any extent.

61,Mr White (Balaclava,"Minister f o rmanufacturers are producing these commodities at prices lower than those at which they could be imported duty free. The Government has shown every consideration for the primary producers by removing the primage duty on the imported articles, so that the duty is actually less than it appears. This subject was inquired into by the Tariff Board in 1925 upon the application of the central council of the Producers Association for the reduction of the duties to, British free, general 10 per cent. The request, however, was made on a general principle that no tax should be levied on the primary producer to support a manufacturing industry, and the applicants admitted that they had not considered the respective prices of imported and Australian dips. The board's inquiries showed that sheep and cattle dip are heing manufactured in Australia on a large scale, and that most of the materials used in. manufacture are Australian. These include phenola distilled produet of tar-causti c soda and arsenic. The only imported materials used are sulphur in sheep dips, and Stockholm tar in cattle dips. The disadvantage of depcn dance on outside sources for supplies of sheep dip was amply illustrated during the war, when great difficulty was experienced in obtaining adequate supplies. The position was such that the Government requested a company to commence the manufacture of sheep dip in Australia, and granted it special facilities to do so. It might be instructive to honourable members to quote the prices at which locally manufactured dips may be obtained as compared with the prices of instance, the price of imported liquid sheep dip in 5 gallon containers, c.i.f. and e, is 40s. whereas the locally manufactured article sells at 42s. 6d. The cost of importing the dip in its powdered form in 10-lb. packets per case, c.i.f. and e., is 67s. I d . ; but the price at which it is distributed here is 50s. 6d. If the duty had to be paid, the cost of the imported article would be 82s. 4d. the duty? lished here, and it is asking for increased of shipping, the British Government exduties. The success of the Wiluna mine pressed the desire that Australia should depends largely on its output of arsenic, and if the industry were not protected it would go out of existence as a result of the importation of Japanese and Swedish arsenic. The local selling prices are reasonable, and members of the Country party should desire to keep this industry going. The matter was investigated in 1925 by the Tariff Board; but in view of the request now made, the Government will ask the board again to consider these duties. -The Minister has just stated, as on previous occasions, that the position is exactly the same now as it has been for years; but I point out that this is not so. The general duty has been increased, and the local manufacturers have a currency protection of 25 per cent. Further, the man on the land who uses this material is now in a very different position from that occupied by him a few years ago. He receives greatly reduced returns from his wool, wheat, butter, meat, fruit-fro m practically everything that he sends overseas. I think that the Minister has made out an unanswerable case. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has spoken over and over again of the plight of the primary producers; but, with all due respect to members of the Country party, it seems to me that they are making a grave blunder. What the primary producer is concerned about is whether' he is receiving a fair deal from those who supply him with the materials that he requires for his work on the land. The Minister has shown conclusively that the imported article. For the local manufacturers are supplying an article at a cheaper rate than that at which this material was previously imported. It does not matter whether the duty is 1,000 per cent, or 6,000 per cent., if the users are obtaining an article of as good a quality as formerly, and yet at a cheaper rate than when it. was imported under almost free trade conditions.

It is well known that some of our leadiug local firms had their chemists at work, and the outcome was that thousands, if not millions, of sheep were saved. The British firm of Cooper and Nephews, although it protested against its goods being excluded from Australia, established works in this country, and now it is turning out a sheep dip which is made for the most part out of Australian materials, and gives employment to our own people. In quality the dip is quite as good, if not better, than that j>reviously provided, and the price is far cheaper. This firm has also supplied experts, who visit the fruit orchards, and are prepared to give technical advice to the orchardists. In these circumstances, why do we hear these frequent protests from members of the Country party? Over and over again, primary producers have admitted to me that they desire the protectionist policy of this country to be maintained. By means of the tariff, this Parliament has obtained a better deal for the primary producers than they have ever had before in regard to many of their requirements. Amendment negatived.

Our mining operations are providing employment, not only in the actual mining of the ore, but also in the making of by-products as well. Already £50,000 has been expended on the erection of this plant at Wiluna. About £400 a week is being paid in wages to 50 employees engaged on work in connection with by-products.

The honourable member would not invest his money in any industry unless he thought there was a degree of permanency in it. The arsenic industry in relation to primary production is of considerable importance. We have an opportunity to establish this industry on a commercial basis, and to make ourselves absolutely independent of foreign supplies. Arsenic is an important munition of war. As the bulk of the world's production is in foreign hands, any British dominion that can produce arsenic in quantity should obviously be given every encouragement. It is vital that the Empire should be independent of foreign sources of supply, in case of hostilities. A number of firms in Australia are engaged in the manufacture of arsenic. The internal consumption is considerable, and there is no likelihood of a monopoly being established. Australia should play its part with Canada in trying to supply the requirements of the British Empire. From information that I have received, I believe that there are markets, overseas that will be available to us for the disposal of this product. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to accede to the request of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) to make a This is a slight variation of the duty.

Yesterday afternoon, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) introduced a deputation to me on this matter, and I promised to give it consideration. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has suggested that the Government substitute a fixed rate of ditty of £10 for the present duties of 25 per cent.

The board inI n that case, there is no quired into this item as recently as 1929, and it would be quite contrary to the Government's policy to impose a fixed rate of duty without reference to the board.

We are informed that it"" has good ore and certain plant, but I think that it will be soon enough to take steps to prevent dumping, when it actually takes place. The duty is adequate, and as the item has recently been inquired into, and is to be investigated again by the Tariff Board, I do not think that there is anything more v to say on the subject. assurance of tbe Minister that, this item will be referred back to the Tariff Board is at least encouraging.

He said that the Swedish works are not yet producing arsenic, and that it will be time enough to deal with dumping when it actually takes place. The Minister knows that Parliament is often a slowworking machine, and that if dumping were to take place during a recess, we would not .be likely to be called together for the purpose of passing a new schedule to alter the duties in respect of arsenic. Defence is better than attack, and to be forewarned is to be forearmed. If the Swedish works start to dump their pro'ducts in Australia, irreparable damage will be done to the Australian industry before this Parliament has time to act. The Swedish works will undoubtedly become a serious competitor with our own -The Minister has consented to refer to I understand that the ore that is being worked in Sweden is more prolific in arsenic than the ore which is at present being mined elsewhere. manufacture this by-product and be able to dump it at any time at a price with which Ave shall be unable to compete. Our own people have invested money in the Australian industry. The reouest of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not extravagant. rate ,of duty shall be imposed equivalent to the present foreign rate. If , as the Minister suggests, a flat rate of £10 a ton represents more than a duty of 42$ per cent., that will have to be taken into consideration. But the point is that the ad valorem duty is valueless when dumping takes place.. It is easy to say that Ave can apply the anti-dumping duties, but they cannot, operate effectively, because it, treaty was ratified, due to the increase in is impossible to obtain proof of dumping when the price charged for the goods in question is not lower than that at which they are sold in the country of origin. In such a case, although the price may be ridiculously low, dumping, according to the customs law, does not actually take place. The process of producing arsenic absorbs mining fumes that would otherwise disperse in the atmosphere. We know the effect that, such fumes have had upon mining areas. They destroy the vegetation for miles around. M'.r. HUTCHIN -That will make little difference at. Wiluna. workers and others are living at Wiluna, and if the fumes were circulating in the atmosphere they would be unable to cultivate flower and vegetable gardens. We must adopt modern conditions of hVing. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has said, it would be serious, indeed, if one of the large producers of this commodity Avithin the Empire were forced out of business because of foreign competition. I , therefore, ask the Government not to close its mind to the suggestion that a flat rate of duty be imposed, because frequently that is the only method of providing effective protection for an Australian industry. tlie Tariff Board this item, which provides for a foreign duty of 42$ per cent.

The duty, which was 25 per cent. British and 35 per cent, foreign, is HOAV 25 per cent. British and 42$ per cent, foreign, so that a wider discrimination is being shown in favour of Empire goods.

I suggest that the request for a duty in excess of 42$ per cent, cannot be described as anything but extravagant. honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr to supply arsenic at a cheaper price any Fenton) spoke of assisting British enterprise by a wider margin of preference, out he had already stated that the TJnited Kingdom did not produce arsenic in excess of its own requirements. The honorable member pleads for the observance of the Ottawa agreement, when by so doing, he can further his desire to raise duties, although normally he is ready to destroy the agreement, and he even resigned from the Ministry as a protest agaiust it. The duty on arsenic is of interest to ""Western Australia, but if an industry cannot compete successfully with the aid of a protective duty of 42$ per cent., plus all the o'ther charges that have to be borne by importers, it is not worth having. We must consider the interests of the users. If cheaper arsenic should be available from other -countries, users in Australia should not be required to pay a price much in excess of that of the imported article merely for the purpose of supporting a few workers in this country. A duty of 42$ per cent, is surely sufficient to protect any industry which can fairly be described as economic. wonders how much further some secondary producers will go to display their inferiority complex. As the result of the Ottawa ageement, the duty on arsenic has been increased by 7$ per cent., and on f.o.b. cost is now equivalent to 47 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has stated that arsenic is imported mainly from Japan and Mexico. If we add to the duty, exchange and transport costs, the local industry is enjoying a protection of over 100 per cent. How such protection can be regarded as moderate and insufficient is beyond my comprehension; it is an outrage. Even the statements made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition warrant us in opposing any increase in duty. He pointed out that this commodity is used in the manufacture of fruit sprays, glass, and sheep dip. An article that is the basis of manufacture in other industries should not be v. unduly taxed. Another attempt is being made to weight the saddle of the jockey who is riding on the primary producer. The statement that an increase of duty would not increase prices is a fallacy. If Sweden should be able attempt to prevent importations from that country by a fixed duty would maintain existing prices of arsenic here, thereby preventing a reduction in the cost of primary production to which this commodity is essential. Trade and Customs) [12.35] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) . said that a fixed duty of £10 a ton would be merely equivalent to the present ad valorem duty. That is not correct. The present f.o.b. price of arsenic is approximately £20 a ton. A fixed duty of £10 a ton would be equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 50 per cent., and £12 a ton to an ad valorem duty of 60 per cent. The fears regarding possible Swedish competition are unfounded as yet In the absence of any knowledge of the price at which Sweden will be able to export we should not at this stage be concerning ourselves about problematical dumping. Any person interested who. has information on this subject should submit it to the Tariff Board. As the result of its inquiry in 1929, the board was disposed to remove the duty ou arsenic, but feared the effect upon the Australian industry, which was then in its infancy. The enterprise in New South Wales to which reference has been made is not producing arsenic, but' has asked for higher duties in order that it might be encouraged to recommence production. The Wiluna mine is engaged principally in gold production. I understand that its equipment is up to date, and that the people connected with the enterprise are not living under those conditions of hardship which the Leader of the Opposition has pictured. However, the facts that the board was disposed to remove the duties in 1929, and that the local production has since increased, warrant a further investigation. Certainly, the Government would not consider the imposition of a flat-rate duty without a preliminary inquiry by the board. Sub-items agreed to.",27,Division 9 Drug S And Chemicals

To some honourable members, that may not seem of much im-. portance; but if that should happen in 20 industries, each employing 100 persons, the addition to the ranks of the unemployed would be 2,000. Already about 350,000 of our people are unable to find employment, and if this Government's tariff-smashing policy is continued, more and more of the Australian people will be added to the number, for it has been stated that what the Government has done so far in the way of reducing duties is only a slight indication of what it intends to do in the future. One has only to compare the value of our importations during the last six or eight months with the figures for the corresponding period of last year to realize the difficulsidered next week, and, if it is then ties confronting our secondary, industries. The outstanding feature of our overseas trade figures is the recent growth of imports from Japan. We, on this side, are prepared to facilitate the passing of this tariff schedule provided we are given ample opportunities to express our' views on important items. The request that this sub-item be postponed is reasonable. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I postponed the consideration of many items at the request of the hill). This industry is not carried on in my electorate, but I am none the less concerned about its future. The policy of the Government may injure workers in my electorate to-morrow. Surely it is only reasonable that we should postpone our consideration of this sub-item until the Tariff Board's report has been received and considered, which will probably be next week. The consideration of this tariff schedule will not be completed, for a month or two, so that there is no need to put this sub-item through to-day. Trade and Customs) [2.21] -Had the honourable gentleman asked a question this morning regarding the Tariff Board's report ou this sub-item, he could have saved himself the making of a long speech, for I could have told Him then that the Tariff Board's report wasexpected at any moment. I have since received the report, although I have not had anopportunity to consider it. This industry was established without any protective duty whatever, and since the duty on foreign goods is fixed at 15 per cent, by the schedule before us, there should be ample protection against Japanese manufacturers. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) spoke of Japanese competition. It may interest him to know that Australia has a favorable trade balance with Japan; our sales to that country are valued at approximately £7,000,000 per annum in wool alone, whereas we purchase from Japan in return goods to the value of only about £2,500,000, much of which is for the purchase of silk, which is not produced in Australia. There is no necessity to postpone the item"". The board's report will be conthought necessary to make any change, an amendment will be introduced for that purpose. Minister's statement is the strongest argument we could have in support of the request of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). It cannot be said that there has been any obstruction by honourable members on this side during this tariff debate. The request that honourable members should be given an opportunity to see the report, which, the Minister says, he has just to hand, i.s the limit of reasonableness. 'Since the Government professes to pin its faith to action only after the Tariff Board's report has been received, its refusal to postpone the consideration of this subitem is incomprehensible. No reasonable request from either side of the House should be treated in the cavalier manner that this request has been. I warn the Minister that he will not gain by adopting such tactics. If he gives the committee his assurance that the sub-item will be postponed, we can then proceed to discuss the next item; -but, if not, the sub-item now before the Chair will be further discussed.

Is it that the Minister is acting in this way because he knows that the Tariff Board favours an increase of duty? It is true that this is an item that has not been protected hitherto; but it is equally true that those engaged in the industry submitted a request for an import duty, and that the Tariff Board conducted a fairly lengthy examination in regard to their request. The Tariff Board's, report is with the Minister, and yet, before he or any other honourable member has read it, we are asked to rush this sub-item through. That comes with ill grace from a government which professes not to move in tariff matters until it has had reports from the Tariff Board. Where is the Government's consistency? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked that consideration of this sub-item be postponed, as has been done on scores of-other occasions when the tariff has been under discussion. Apparently the Minister is determined to rush this subitem through, but I tell the Minister, as plainly as I can, that he will make more progress if he adopts a reasonable attitude towards reasonable requests. Since he refuses to postpone the subitem we intend to discuss it, and we object to its adoption ou the ground that as the Government's declared policy in tariff matters is to follow recommendations of the Tariff Board, we should have the report before us The Minister's reluctance to postpone the sub-item entitles us to assume that board has recommended a higher duty to protect this . industry which is being threatened by importations from a foreign country. His only defence, apparently, is that the country iu question is buying more from us than we are buying from it. as a defence of this particular sub-item. advanced, but when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a similar statement upon the sub-item dealing with tapioca, it was brushed aside, although in that case the tariff was not imposed for the protection of an Australian industry as in this sub-item. This is an industry which gives employment to a considerable number of Australian people. My information is that, unless adequate protection is given to it against importations from Japan, it will be forced to close down, and a large number of employees will be thrown out of work. The industry made application to the Tariff Board, which inquired into the position and has presented its report to the Minister. AH we now ask is that the consideration of this sub-item be postponed until we have bad. an opportunity to read that report If the Minister wishes to be fair ' he will accede to the request. At the moment I am not in a position to discuss the various aspects of the industry concerned. Nor for that matter is the Minister or any other honourable member ? But. we do know that a report dealing with it has been handed to the Minister, and we make the very reasonable request that it be made available to us before we vote upon this sub-item. -The request made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) is a reasonable one. If we follow the usual course this afternoon, the committee will report progress in about an hour's time, so postponement of the sub-item will not. mean serious delay, because if the report is made available to honourable members promptly, they will be in a position to discuss this sub-item when the committee resumes pn Tuesday next. the Trade and Customs) [2.33] -There is really no necessity at all for postponing the sub-item.

I shall examine the report during the week-end, and take immediate steps to make any alteration in the duties that may be deemed necessary. If nothing will be gained by the postponement of this sub-item, it is equally true that nothing will be lost by it. For once I . find myself in agreement with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). I do not know that such a unique happening will ever occur again. I do not think that the duties are likely to be affected very greatly by the report of the board, but as the report has so recently come into the hands of the Minister it is reasonable to ask for the postponement of the item until it has been considered. endorse the remarks of the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson). A perfectly reasonable request has been made. Nothing is to be gained by forcing this item through immediately. [2.39] I hope that the Minister will give earnest consideration to the industry that is affected by this sub-item. This is a matter of serious importance in every capital city of the Commonwealth. I know that the fate of a large number of female employees is dependent upon the action of Parliament in relation to this sub-item. It is not likely that anything, that we may do in this connection will adversely affect the primary producers. The amount of money involved in this industry is, I suggest, too small to certain difficulties that would 'be involved justify the bringing of the industry within the purview of the Ottawa agreement. We are dealing with what is really a side line of the clothing and textile trades, and an auxiliary branch of the rubber industry. These rubber goods have been placed on the market at a reasonable price by the local manufacturers. Most of the people employed in this industry are fitted only for light work. They cannot undertake manual labour, such as the State Governments are proI assure the commitviding almost exclusively for the relief this industry has made available an avenue of employment for female workers which is of considerable importance. If these people are dismissed in consequence of the removal of protection wp4ch the industry at present eujoys, I doubt whether it will be possible for them to obtain employment elsewhere. It cannot be said that our rubber manufacturers are exploiting the community by charging unduly high prices, for their goods. I have discussed this subject with many honourable members outside this chamber, and I have never once heard them complain of the prices charged for these goods. I hope that the Government will agree to the postponement of the consideration of the sub-item. General) [2.41] -This sub-item is in a different class from almost any other item that has come before the committee for consideration, owing to the fact that a report of the Tariff Board has just come to hand.

If it will suit the convenience of the committee to postpone further consideration of the sub-item until 'after the items in group 6 have been considered, the Government will agree to the adoption of that course. Group6 contains the items in respect of which amendments are being made by the present Government in consequence of the receipt of reports from the Tariff Board.

Item 333, sub-items ( A 2 ) ( B ) (Pneumatic rubber tyres and tubes). attention to tbe extent of tbe protection provided by this item. The only inference we can draw from the remarks of the Minister to-day is that, irrespective of the f a l l in the price of raw materials and wages, and therefore of the purchasing power of the people, no reduction can be made in any of these items. Do honourable members realize that the falling off in the volume of our manufactured goods is due to the fact that the people have no money to purchase them? There has been a big reduction of wages, and also in the price of raw materials. The arguments of the Minister would lead one to believe that because these duties were imposed some years ago, no objection should be raised to their continuance. I always thought that the idea of protection was to impose duties with a view to establishing industries in Australia; that when those industries were firmly established the duties should be reduced. If honourable members examine the report of the Economic Committee that was appointed in 1929 by the Bruce-Page Government, and was presided over by Professor Copland, they w ill see that the Avages paid in this industry for the year under £1,300,000, while £2,100,000 was collected in duty on rubber tyres and tubes£800,000 more than the whole of the salaries and wages paid in the Australian industry. Since then there has been a considerable reduction of wages and raw material costs. Are these manufacturers to be allowed to combine and penalize the community ? must remember that present-day tyres Avear three times as long as did those produced three years ago. to the point if the honourable member explained why'tyres cost so much more in Australia than in Great Britain. I shall not move that the duties be reduced, because I haA'e not gone exhaustively into the matter, nor seen the report of the Tariff Board. However, if the Government persists in continuing duties merely because they have been in operation for a feAV years, it w ill discover that, after a time, the people Avill have received such a lesson in regard to our tariff policy that I call they w ill insist on drastic changes, such as are taking place in the United States of America. believe that this item is due for review. When the duty Avas first imposed in 1921, or a little later, the then Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) definitely stated that it Avas not introduced for its protective incidence, but for the purpose of raising revenue for road-building. I should like to know from the Minister AA'hether the revenue collected under this item is still being used solely for the maintenance of main roads. Revenue, as such moneys are not earmarked for special purposes. find that the then Prime Minister gave the promise to AvhichI have referred. The duty on a tyre . i m ported to Australia is greater than the price of the article in the United States of America. It is time that the Government thought of the users.

Therefore, provided production in Australia is economical and efficient, one is justified in comparing costs in Australia with those in a country where perhaps lower wages are paid, and different industrial conditions obtain.

I admit that any responsible body charged with the duty of determining wages and indus'trial conditions would be justified in taking into, consideration their effect upon costs and prices, but wages and industrial conditions have not heen made an issue by the though the honourable member might have been successful in pointing out differences in price in favour of the British manufacturer, he .has not thereby determined or concluded the question.

The manufacture of brooms, &c, has increased greatly in Australia under the protection afforded by the surcharge duty imposed by the last Government. Certain overseas manufacturers, instead of continuing to ship their products to Australia, have been compelled by the high duty to get inside the Australian tariff wall. agreement that Australian factories in this country. found that otherwise they could not compete. The total capital invested in the industry amounts to £250,000, and employment is given to about 1,200 men.

Therefore, any that were imported a few years ago, and they are sold at greatly reduced prices in all the big retail houses such as* Woolworth's and Cole's. These goods were previously sold in chemists' shops at high prices. The 50 per cent, surcharge gave the Australian factories the whole of the local market; but with the low prices ruling in Eastern countries, and in some European countries, there is a danger that the Australian market will be again invaded. 1 am glad to notice that there is a slight increase of tlie general rate under the Ottawa agreement; but I hope that the Minister will later give sympathetic consideration to a request for a higher rate of duty, if it is found necessary, because the surcharges have not been removed for a sufficiently long period for us to see what the effect will be. Of course, if the exchange rate remains at its present level,, the present protection will probably be ample for the time being; but if the exchange, rate should drop to anything like the normal figure, I am afraid that this is one of 15 -MUSICA L INSTRUMENTS. the industries that w ill not be able to carry on without additional protection.

The duties on mercerized cotton yarns are-British preferential, free; and general, 17$ per cent., ad valorem. The cotton-spinners in Australia find that partially mercerized cotton yarns have been brought into this country to the detriment of their industry. This time last year, before the Government made any changes in the tariff schedule in relation to cotton, the spinning ber, 1932, amounted to 940,000 lb., valued industry was in a very healthy state. Bonds Limited were working four shifts a day, and part of their plant was kept going on Saturdays and Sundays. The Australian Silk and Cotton Mills Limited were working full time, and, at periods, 24 hours a day. Davies, Coop Proprietary Limited were in a similarly happy position. bounty expired. Mi-. EORDE -If they could obtain the whole of the market to-day, they could carry on without a bounty, provided they received adequate protection in regard to the lines for which they were prepared to meet the Australian demand; but, at the present time, Bond's are working only one shift four days a week, and the Australian Silk and Cotton'Mills are in operation for slightly less than one shift a week, while Davies, Coop Proprietary Limited are working five-eighths of their plant for one shift a week. The Bradford Cotton Spinning Mills, Sydney, which has 9,500 spindles, will be dependent upon some of the business now enjoyed by other mills that are already slack. This company is in the fortunate position of having its own weaving mill, and makes cotton tweeds. Its efficient organization was transferred from Bradford, and the company will now spin cotton yarns for the manufacture of cotton tweed, supplying a big demand by the knitters for cotton yarns. The other large spinning mills which I have mentioned, were twelve or eighteen months ago working at full pressure, are now working only four six-hour shifts a week; and as the Bradford Cotton Spinning Mills will be getting some of their orders it will result in their having to put off additional employees. This is regrettable when it is desirable 'that as much employment as possible should be provided. over-done industry. labour market is over-supplied. Some persons will tell us that there are too many doctors, lawyers, wheat-growers, fruit-growers, and even members of Parliament.. The imports of mercerized cotton yarns for the six months ended the 31st Decemat £145,000, and for the previous six months the importations totalled 758,000 lb., valued at £122,000, a difference of approximately 200,000 lb., or £23,000, so that there had been a substantial increase. The trade contends that a big proportion of these yarns is partially mercerized, and takes the place of the ordinary cotton yarns that enjoy a protection of 4d. and 7d. per lb., plus the ad valorem rates provided under another group in this schedule. The imports of yarns n.e.i. increased to 3,400,000 lb. for the six months ended the 31st December, 1932, and were valued at £191,000, while for the six months ended the 31st December, 1931, the imports amounted to 1,900,000 lb., valued at £110,000, showing au increase of 1,500,000 lb., or £81,000 in value. Those engaged in the cottonspinning industry contend that the trouble is that tens of thousands of pounds of partially-mercerized cotton yarns are being imported into the Commonwealth weekly at rates of British, free, and general, 15 per cent., and are used in lieu of the ordinary soft cotton yarns. not happening. case as'stated by the spinning mills.

The board carried on a good deal of propaganda among the growers, urging them to increase their acreage, so as to supply the whole of the Australian demand. To a large extent it was successful in these efforts, and its estimate of the crop for the present year was approximately 20,000 bales of lint, an increase of 100 per cent, on the previous largest production of cotton in Queensland. spinners, in the circumstances iu which they find themselves to-day, have cut down their demand for Queenslandgrown cotton, in some instances to almost nothing. The board contends that this will result in its having to export 50 per cent, of the crop, if its estimate of 20,000 bales of cotton lint should be realized. As has been the case with all other commodities, cotton values throughout the world have dropped to such a level that the Queensland Cotton Board, and the cotton-growers of that State, will be substantial losers if they are obliged to export cotton lint to the other side of the world. I urge the Minister to give the matter very careful consideration. He claims that there is nothing in the contention of the Queensland and the cotton-spinners. that the spinners have ample protection, cerized cotton yarns are not being used as a substitute for the ordinary soft cotton yarns manufactured in Australia. But the facts are clear. There have been very substantial increases in the importations of cotton yarns, as there have been in the importations of textiles. Wherever the protectionist policy is whittled away, wherever the tariff wall is lowered, in a time like the present, when the factories of at least one great eastern nation are paralysing many of the countries of the world, Australian manufacturers cannot hope to combat such severe competition. We are told that secondary industries for which raw products have to be imported are uneconomic. Just as the woollen industry is a great natural industry, so the cotton-growing, spinning, and weaving industry should be a natural industry in Australia, which is largely tropical, and in which cotton underwear has to be extensively worn. We hear everywhere the cry, "" Back to the land."" We are Mr Forde. told that the people should not flock to the cities and live ou the dole, but that they should go on the land and produce. It is of no use to put men on the land to produce if they are not ensured the Australian market for their products. In this instance, the manufacturers on the secondary side, and the Queensland Cotton Board on the primary side, comUnfortunately, however, the plain that the tariff protection intended by Parliament for the cotton industry is being evaded, with the result that the cotton-growers will be forced to export their product at great loss, and to compete in the overseas market with blacklabour countries. in respect of the wool industry. ber does not want every industry to be in the same boat.

Bradford Ootton Spinning Mills has a dyeing plant which is the only one of its kind in Australia, and with that plant it proposes to dye yarn suitable for the manufacture of cotton tweed. At present, imported cotton tweed yarns enter this country free of duty. In view of the difficult position of the cotton spinning industry, I urge the Minister to give this item and other allied items, such as drills and denims, his earnest consideration, so that when the report of the Tariff Board is furnished to him, he will be able to place it immediately before Parliament. Trade aud Customs) [3.29] -Much has been said recently with regard to competition, which local manufacturers claim to be experiencing from imported mercerized cotton yarns, single ply yarns spun in count No. 50 or finer, and yarns of two or more ply containing one or more ply spun in count No. 50 or finer. It has been represented by the spinners that partially mercerized yarns are being imported and landed at a price below that at which local manufacturers can supply soft cottqn yarns of similar count. A statpment to that effect was made in a press interview with the chairman of the Cotton Board when in Melbourne, and also with the Premier of Queensland. I have had inquiries made, and I find that the quantity of partially mercerized yarn which is being imported is insignificant. The majority of the users of mercerized yarn, representing such important industries as the knitting, hosiery, and weaving industries, The increase of imports of mercerized demand the wholly mercerized product, and accordingly pay a price in excess of that usually paid for locally manufactured soft cotton yarn. keep a separate record of partially mercerized cotton yarn? monwealth analyst, there is no such yarn. it by the trade.

I have quoted the figures for 1930-31, 1931-32, and for the first seven mouths of 1932-33, which show a gradual'decline. A comparison of the imports of mercerized cotton yarns during the first seven months of 1931-32 and 1932-33 shows that an increase has taken place in the quantity imported in the latter period by 25$ per cent. The figures show, however, .that the average value of imported mercerized yarn was higher in the seven months of 1932-33 than during the corresponding period of the previous financial year, the relative values being 37.35d. per lb., and 34.56d. per lb.,respectively. This definitely indicates that partially mercerized yarns form a mere fraction of the total imports of mercerized yarn. yarn is not out of proportion to the general improvement in trade.

My latest information is that one spinner and one weaver have agreed to purchase cotton at last year's price. The allegation that very large quantities of mercerized cotton yarn are being substituted for Australian soft cotton yarns is not borne out by the exhaustive inquiries made by my department. This complaint comes only from the Melbourne spinners, the New South ""Wales spinners not experiencing any such competition. The Government will take care that if the growers are forced by the action of the spinners to export their crop, no admissions under by-law will be allowed. Tiiis means that the spinners will have to pay 3d. per lb. on any cotton imported. I make that statement for the information of the spinners and others. The facts I have related are an answer to the propaganda of the Opposition and the attacks made upon the Government in regard to the' cotton industry. The speech of the Minister contained a good deal of ""misrepresentation. stated that the Queensland Cotton Board had no objection to the importation of mercerized yarn. for Trade and Customs, the Queensland Cotton Board asked me to impose a duty of 3d. per lb. on rawcotton from other countries. I went into the matter and agreed that it was only fair that the primary producers of Australia should be protected against importations of raw cotton from foreign countries. Consequently, I agreed to a duty of 3d. per lb: on raw cotton and cotton lint. That duty protects the cotton-growing industry because the spinners buy their lint from the Queensland Cotton Board. AlthoughI believe that. the Australian cottonspinners are good Australians-whe n I was Minister they were always ready to co-operate with the Queensland growers -the y would probably be glad to get cotton lint more cheaply than they can buy it from the Queensland Cotton Board. In saying that he will not allow cotton lint to enter Australia free of The duty from other countries, the Minister is only carrying out the intention of Parliament that the Australian cotton growers shall be given a protection of 3d. per lb. I remind the committee that that protection was inserted in the tariff, not by the present Government, but by the Scullin Government, in which I was Minister for Trade and Customs. The present Minister talks of the Government's desire to stabilize this industry. Its stabilization was brought about as the result of legislation introduced by the Scullin Government in the early part of 1930. In January of that year I presided over a conference representative of the Queensland Cotton Board and the spinners. At that conference a stabilization scheme, which would carry the industry to the end of 1936, was decided upon. Under that scheme the cotton growers were to receive approximately 5d. per lb. for their cotton lint. Naturally, the spinners were somewhat reluctant to enter into this arrangement, because they would have liked a lower price; but, eventually, they agreed. I insisted, that a fair return should be paid to the growers. The price of 5d. per lb. varies as the price He of cotton on the Liverpool market fluctuates over or below 9d. per lb. that agreement now? the situation, but I should say that it is because of importations of yarns. The present Government has knocked the bottom out of the cotton industry by varying the duties imposed by the last Government. The Australian spinners had practically the whole of the Australian market for the yarns which they were manufacturing, and, consequently, they could not object to pay a fair price to the cotton growers for their cotton lint. The present Government changed the whole situation by wiping out the fixed rate of duty on cotton yarns. There was consternation in the cotton industry, and a telegram was despatched to the Minister of the day by the Queensland Cotton Board and by the cotton spinners that the industry could not hope to survive unless something were done immediately by the Government.

First, the Minister for Trade aud Customs took off the fixed rate of duty, only to realize that that would wipe out the industry. He thereupon again put on a fixed duty, which he altered on two subsequent occasions. Now the matter has been referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. The trouble is that the present Government has been tinkering with this industry as with other industries. Every interference with industry has led to further unemployment. The Minister quoted figures to show that there had been a decrease in the importations of mercerized yarns over a specific period. The importations of mercerized cotton yarns for the six months ended the 31st December, 1932, were 940,405 lb., valued at £145,000, compared with 758,000 lb. valued at £122,000 for the previous six months. That shows an increase of nearly 200,000 lb., valued at £23,000, in six months. The imports of yarns, n.e.i. for the six months ended the 31st December last, amounted to 3,400,000 lb., the value being £191,000. That shows an increase of 1,500.000 lb., or £81,000 over the figures for the corresponding six months of. the previous year. Those figures bear out what the Queensland Cotton Board and the cotton-spinners say, namely, that they are losing the market for the Australian-spun yarn by reason of these importations. According to the Minister, these people do not know their own business as well as he does. I ask him why certain Melbourne spinners despatched a telegram to the Queensland Cotton Board stating that they were unable to say, with any degree of certainty, what their purchases next year would be. The telegram readsTo-day's estimation merely conjecture.' Future of spinning industry precarious uncertain owing effects Ottawa agreement and existing Government's general attitude.

Such position affects question of price spinners can pay growers.

The Minister says that the Queensland Cotton Board agrees to what the GovernUr. Forde. ment has done; but the board itself has advised me that the whole future of the cotton industry in Australia will be jeopardized unless effective protection is given against the importation of cheap cotton yarns from other countries. The cotton industry of Australia is not a "" tin-pot"" or "" backyard "" industry, but is one which is both a primary industry and a secondary industry of considerable magnitude. Some of the closer settlement schemes of Queensland depend largely on the success or otherwise of the. cotton-growing industry.. The cotton-growers have had a very difficult time, because of seasonal uncertainties, and have been seriously embarrassed by the interference of this Government with the protection which I gave to the industry.
