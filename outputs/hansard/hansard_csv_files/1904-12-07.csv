I do not wish to infer that they receive a share of the profits, but I was counsel for them in objecting to their being compelled to take out a certain proportion of their wages in shares, and I do not wish them to be doubly penalized through loss of work caused by rejection of the tenders. which the honourable and learned member asks? ister interferes with the tender which has been accepted on the ground mentioned by the honourable member for Hume, I wish to know whether he will consider all the circumstances ? tend to lay all the information upon the table, and, in doing so, it will be my duty to make it as complete as possible.

I have been considering the matter ever since I came into office, and my immediate predecessor, who also went into the matter, granted the permission at one of these places, up to a certain date, and refused it at the other. After going fully into the matter, I found that the conditions were in both cases the same, that they were both tidal ports and open roadsteads, where the ships could not stay outside the harbour; also that the tidal conditions were such that they had to come in on the Sunday or pass on.",12,Locomotive Tenders

On the other hand, I found that if we were to open the door in the way suggested the result might be to make Sunday work general. That is the report which has been submitted to me by the officers of the Department who are intimate with the conditions at these ports. WhilstI should be the last to wish to keep stock on board a vessel any longer than is absolutely necessary, I see the danger which has been brought under my notice -that the making of the concession asked for in this instance might lead to Sunday work being made general. ask the honourable gentleman whether in imposing the condition that the workers who will have to work on Sundays at ""Keppel Bay and Flat Top are to get 3s. per hour, he proposes to make the shipping companiespay those men the* increased rate of wages from the time they are engaged at the port or from the time they actually start work?

Just now, they are paying 2s. an hour for Sunday, and, I think, is. 3d. for week-day work. When I increased the Sunday pay by 50 per cent., I did not make any alteration in the hours. I do not know when the time starts, but whenever it may be there was no alteration made in that respect. ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, before granting permission for vessels to unload on Sundays, he will take into consideration the desirableness of seeing that the members of the crew shall also be paid extra for the time they are compelled to work on Sundays? MrM c LEAN able friend that I have already acted in this mattter, and have sent a written intimation of my decision to all the parties affected. I can show my honourable friend a copy of the decision which I sent.

It is rather an important question, and one which has not been brought under my notice hitherto.

58,Mr Webster (Gwydir),"When the leader of the Opposition will make the Bill operative, although it is not all that I desire. Cannot the Prime Minister bea little more reasonable? Is it right for him to use the small majority which he has for the purpose of imposing conditions which he. must know will hamper the administration of the Bill, and certainly interfere with the effectiveness of it? I fully expected, when the amendments came down from the Senate, that they would at least receive the sympathetic consideration of the Government, and, seeing that no partyissue was at stake, that the Government would desire to make the measure more practicable than it was previously. I have already quoted the opinions of men who know what they are talking about, and who have acquired their knowledge in the severest school possible, that of experience. I have also quoted the opinions of men on the judicial bench, who have had charge of the administration of similar laws in the States, and the opinions'of men who have been associated with unions for a lifetime. But it seems that these appeals to 'the Prime Minister will be of no avail. I only know that if this clause is passed as the right honourable gentleman desires, we shall have something to regret in davs to come, because, I am afraid, the Bill will prove an inoperative measure. If honourable members on this side were as determined as I am to safeguard the interests of those whom they represent, they would be preipared to fight to the end in defence of the principle at stake, and no considerations of personal convenience would be allowed to interfere. who may have to explain their attitude on this measure-to explain why they exhibited such apathy-if the prophecy I have just made should prove correct. I have some feeling of sympathy with honourable members opposite. I know they are anxious to return to their homes, irrespective of the legislation which they leave behind, after a long and trying session. said, no considerations of personal convenience should be allowed to influence those on this side of the House, who feel that they have a mission and a duty to protect, at all hazards, the interests of the men and women affected by this Bill. We have been told by several honourable members that only certain unions are likely to be brought within the operation of the measure. No honourable member, however, can prophesy with accuracy what conditions may arise, if such a law be passed. There is not only a possibility, but a probability, that many of the ] trades and callings now followed in the States may be brought within the purview of the B ill ; at any rate, there is a possibility of trade unions being brought into' such contact with them as to bring them within the sphere of a Federal law of the kind. Why should we single out only one or two unions? Eveni f these unions represent only 8,000 or 9,000 men, we have no right to conjecture that they will be the only organizations affected. We have to provide not only for the conditions of to-day, but for conditions which may arise hereafter. It appears to me, however, that there is an anxiety to place on the Statute-book of the Commonwealth an impracticable piece of legislation. The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to associate his name with legislation which'would be welcomed with pleasure by generations unborn; yet with all his aspirations and ability, he is not prepared to wrest himself from the trammels of the organization which seems to most influence him at the present time. Surely the Prime Minister has had sufficient experience in passing legislation to know that it is not always a commendation to have one's name associated with a particular measure. Many laws have been passed in the States which reflect not credit, but, very often, grave discredit on the framers, who are thus proved to have been utterly unfitted for the work they undertook. There is not the slightest doubt that this clause contains the main point of the Bill, and unless the provision be passed There are honourable members in accordance with the wishes of honourable members on this side all the other clauses, 4 however professedly libera] they may be, will prove absolutely inoperative. This clause is undoubtedly the main-spring of the B ill ; and it is of no use the Prime Minister endeavouring to close his eyes to the fact by stating that he is looking after the interests of the community-that his heart is bleedBut, as I have ing for the non-unionists who will be left out in the cold. No explanation will avail the right honourable gentleman, if, in the future, it should' be found that unionism is decaying for want of an incentive. Of course, we know that by that time the Prime Minister may be placed comfortably in some judgment seat-that he may have ' passed awav from the troubled sphere of politics. That is an unfortunate feature of our legislation as conducted by the politicians of to-dav. Those politicians carrv no responsibility beyond a certain idate; they are here to-day, on the whether the Minister of Defence is really highest pinnacle at which their amqualified to lead the Committee. bition has aimed, and to-morrow they take liberties with legislation which they member's pardon. He is not referring to have hitherto advocated. that, come what may, they will be safe was moved by the leader of the Opposiin some haven, comfortably sheltered from tion. I would ask him to confine his reall political warfare. When this Governmarks to that question. ment was formed I thought we were in a very happy position, inasmuch as, if we could not get a reply from one half of the Prime Minister, we should be able to get one from cept the amendment which was inserted in his other half; but I find that I was dethe clause at the instance of the honourable luded in that expectation.

But there are professed Commonwealth, who are anxiously waiting democrats who have deluded the people into to see whether this Parliament is prepared the belief that the legislation they favoured to put fetters upon them. In Sydney, the was"" in the interests of unionists and toilers other day, an organization unanimously generally, and we appeal in vain to the Gopassed a resolution appealing to this Parvernment, on the ground of logic, common Tament to prevent this class of legislation sense, or experience.

The clause before the Committee has been mainly responsible for the wrecking of three Governments. months the Parliament has been practically engaged upon this measure. produced? ticable measure I . should have no objection to remaining here for another period of nine months, or longer if necessary. successful operation of the Bill will depend upon this clause. Some honourable members seem to think that it ought to be . passed with ' the same speed as a mere machinery clause or a clause dealing with regulations. provisions which have been embodied in the clause since it was introduced have practically cut the heart out of the measure. Apparently, honourable members on the other side wish to. place on the Statute-book a law which will be inoperative and unnecessary, or they are trying to make the people believe that they are endeavouring to honestly legislate for the removal of those labour difficulties which always arise in a new country. For the settlement of industrial disputes we have adopted a method which is not yet known outside the Southern Hemisphere. We are seeking to place on the Statute-book a law which will be an example to the rest of the world. In New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia the law contains a provision largely similar to the amendment which has been moved by the leader of the Opposition. No unbiased man can say that in any of those three countries the law has not been a blessing, not only to the employees, but also to the employers. On the one side, it has secured continuity of employment, and on .the other side it has given security to capital. By granting preference to unionists in the measure, we should not only secure the rights of the employees, but also preserve indirectly the rights of bond -fi.de employers who are trying to do their best to develop the industries of the Commonwealth. We cannot, therefore, be charged with acting from a selfish stand-point. A l though it has been made apparent that each side objects to the clause, the Government are nevertheless prepared to force upon them this objectionable legislation. I do not say that the attitude which has been taken up by the leader of the Opposition is the best one in the interests of the B ill . WhatI contend is that when neither employers nor employee's desire the Bil l to be placed upon the Statute-book, a compromise could be arrived at. The Prime Minister could reasonably say to us, "" If you are prepared For nine to strike off all the conditions which have been stipulated during the last nine months, What has it I am prepared to allow the Court to judge. If it were producing a pracfrom the evidence the wisdom or otherwise of granting preference.""

77,Mr Webster,"I do not care fromand also prepare other matter of special interest, which I desire to lay before the Committee. ment proposed by the honourable member for Bland throws us back to the position we occupied before the Bill was forwarded to the Senate, and I regret that it should have become necessary for us to go over the old ground again. The present trouble seems to arise from the fact that whilst honourable members on ..this side of the Chamber propose to give definite directions to the Court, honourable members opposite wish to leave the Court to practically make a law for itself. We think that the Court might by reasonable means-withou t taking a poll of those engaged in the industry, or insisting upon absolute proof-ver y easily satisfy itself as to the side upon which the majority lies. Under the Government proposal, a clear and distinct issue would be placed before the Court, but the amendment of the honourable member for Bland would, by the introduction of the qualifying word ""substantially"" leave it to the Court to make a law for itself. One Judge might say that 10 per cent, of those engaged in an industry constituted a substantial number, whilst others might insist upon a larger percentage being shown. The leader of the Opposition has. stated that myself. I have, on the contrary, taken he desires that a substantial number shall really be a majority, but his intention is -not definitely expressed by the amendment. It has been strongly contended that it would be impossible for the unions, without a great deal of trouble, to show that they represented an absolute majority of those affected. I do not, however, anticipate any trouble on 'that score, because I assume that the Judge would take it for granted that all in the claimant union were in favour of preference. Statistics as to the number of persons engaged in any particular industry would be available, and upon these the opponents of preference would have to rely. Therefore, their case would probably be weaker than that which could be presented by the applicants for preference. If the leader of the Opposition is ready to admit that a substantial number of those affected by an award would really represent a majority, or almost a majority, it would be as difficult for applicants for preference to establish the fact that they substantially represented those affected as it would be for them to demonstrate that they represented an actual majority. substantial number if there were a thousand persons engaged in an industry. amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland would leave it open to the Court to make a law for itself, whereas, in my opinion? the Court should merely administer the law. As I have said, it would be as difficult to arrive at a decision as to whether the applicants substantially represented those affected as it would be to prove that they represented a majority. The Government do not intend that there should be absolute proof with regard to that majority, but that we should trust the Court to satisfy itself upon that point. able member for Gwydir and the honourable member for Grey have made certain references to myself, which I do not feel inclined to allow to pass unchallenged although I have made denials previously. It has been stated by the honourable member for Gwydir that I have declared myself opposed to this Bill, lock, stock, and barrel. That is an absolute misrepresentation of the facts, because I have never so declared particular pains to explain that I am not opposed to the Bill, but to certain provisions, which I regard as objectionable. The honourable member for Grey states that I had declared that my object in supporting the Bill was merely to wreck the late Government. I never declared that to be my object, and that was not my object. The measure has not been used for that purpose, so far as I am concerned. Therefore, the honourable member had absolutely no justification for attributing any such motive to me. The vote to which the honourable member evidently refers, which helped to wreck the Deakin Government, was upon an amendment to include the public servants of the States-simpl y a detail of one clause of the Bill. It did not affect the Bill as a whole. sire merely to point out very briefly indeed the reasons why I cannot accept the Government's proposal, and why I prefer the amendment proposed by .the honourable member for Bland.

82,Mr Hughes (West Sydney),"I dedistinguishes the respective attitudes assumed by the two parties in this Chamber. I wish to give one concrete example-because, after all, an ounce of practice is worth a ton .of theory-whic h came under my notice in the Arbitration Court of New South Wales only three weeks ago, to show that there is a fundamental and the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland. The Trolleymen, Draymen, and Carters' Union, of which some mention has already been made in this Chamber, is one of considerable strength, numbering some 1,200 members. In connection with a dispute which was submitted to the Arbitration Court for settlement, the union sought for preference for its members, and the employers endeavoured to show that the majority of those engaged in that calling were not members of the union. They did not succeed in this, and it was established that the majority of those in the employment of the respondent association were members of the union. pointed out to the Court, however, that the union did not embrace anything like a majority of the persons engaged in the industry affected, or actually engaged in industries cognate to that of the Carters' Union. union, whilst there are at the very least 3,000 persons engaged in driving vehicles in the streets of Sydney. I have no doubt there are very many more than 3,000, but I adopt that estimate because its correctness beyond the confines of any one State, and may be established by the most cursory inspection of the traffic. If we had had to show that we as a union represented a majority of those engaged in the industry, to say nothing of those affected by it, we' should have utterly failed. We should not have been able to obtain preference, and, if that had been denied, the award would -have been, of no service. If , by reason of there is no practical difference between it the decisions given previously, we had not been quite certain that we should obtain preference we should never have gone to the Court, but might have decided upon action which, if taken, might have involved those in commercial circles in very great loss. We should have settled the matter very speedily one way or the other by refusing to work. Here, then, is one of the strongest unions in New South Wales which would, under such a provision as the Government favour, have failed to make good its claim for preference. The provision for preference is the basis of the measure; without it no unions will register; and, unit to be interpreted in no other way. That less the unions did register, the Bill would become a dead letter. Therefore, I shall oppose the passing of the Billi f it embodies this obnoxious provision, and I shall throw upon the shoulders of those who approve of the provision-som e of them doctrinaires who believe in what they say, some of them (bitter opponents of the Bill, and some of difference between the proviso them indifferent to anything but getting into recess-the responsibility of defeating the object of the measure, and rendering it absolutely useless. I have listened again to the case which the honourable and learned member for West Sydney has placed before the Committee. An unfortunate feature of the arguments of the opponents of the proviso is that every case which they have cited, apart from that of the Shearers' Union, is one which can. by no possibility come before the Court. It is impossible to conceive of a trolley and draymen's strike extending over the whole of Australia. Where is the sense in quotI ing a case which, would have point enough in its application to a State arbitration law, but which can have no point whatever in relation to a Commonwealth law? That is my answer to the honourable and learned member. He declares that an There are 1,200 persons in the ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory. So it is if it has any relevancy at all to the case which we are considering. The fact -is that it is almost impossible to conceive of a trolley and draymen's strike extending therefore, his argument completely falls to the ground. Honourable members upon this side of the Chamber are opposing the amendment of the leader of the Opposition for various reasons. My reason for doing so is that in its application to any organized union-to any case which we can conceive will come under the operation of this Billand the proposal of the Minister of Defence. The leader of the Opposition himself has repeatedly stated that there is no practical difference between the two proposals, and that in the working of the measure there will be no practical difference so far as the principle of majority rule is concerned. He has repeatedly affirmed that he does nof desire to obtain a preference for minorities. He has said that any Judge would interpret his proposal to mean that a majority of those engaged in any industry affected by an award must first approve of a preference being granted, and he wishes",20,Conciliation And Arbitration
83,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"has been stated by him time and again. For the very reason which he has assigned) and knowing it to be the practical truth of the matter, I say that the proposal of the Minister of Defence, which is embodied in the Bill, and the amendment submitted by the leader of the Opposition, are practically identical, the only difference between them being that the provision already contained in the measure is a very much plainer and more straightforward statement of the position. I shall, therefore, oppose the amendment, inasmuch as it constitutes a more difficult and indefinite wav of stating the same facts. a very great pity that an important measure of this character, affecting, as it does, this legislation, they would prove almost the industrial interests of the community, should in the past have been made the battle-ground for purely party purposes. I do not think .that that fact can be combated. In the first place, the Deakin Government were defeated upon it by certain honourable members, who declared that their votes must be interpreted in the light of those of wreckers. the Deakin Government. There were only two or three members who voted in that way, and there was a majority of eleven against the Government. very great influence in bringing about the defeat of that Administration. tion at all. ference was the crucial matter upon which the Watson Government were defeated.

An attempt has been made to show that there is practically no difference between the proposal of the Government and that of the leader of the Opposition-that , in the actual operation of identical. That is the view entertained by the honourable member for Parramatta which was expressed by the honourable member's leader.

Why do the Government attach so much importance to the words which are already embodied in the Bill?

I would, also point out that that view is shared by competent legal authorities, and also by those who are engaged in industrialism, who take a leading part in the unionist movement, and whose opinions are valued by large bodies of organized labour. I am glad to find that the Prime Minister recognises that there is a difference between the two proposals. The Committee will not be misled, therefore, into supposing that no difference exists, and subsequently express disappointment when they learn-as the result of the decision of the Arbitration Court-that they have misconceived the position. I desire to make a short quotation from a gentleman who, it will be admitted, is an authority upon this point. I refer to Mr B. R. Wise, who is the author of the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Sydney Worker of the 29th October last contains a very able article written by him, entitled "" Compulsory Arbitration, How it has worked in New South Wales, Preference to unionists absolutely necessary."" I do not propose to quote extensively from this article, but I wish rather to direct particular attention to a paragraph relating to the very matter which is now under consideration. Under the heading of "" What McCay's amendment meant,"" Mr Wise puts the position thus:One last word as to the particular amendment vernment went out of office. That provided that the Court should not grant preference, unless it dustry which requires a considerable amount was satisfied that the demand was made "" by a majority of the persons affected."" I have never yet met a lawyer who was able to tell me what these words mean, or how such a fact could be proved. Nor do I know of any one who has had any experience in the practice of the Court who does not admit that the insertion of such an amendment would make the preference clause a dead letter. ment, which we are assured by some honourable members does not differ materially from that which is under consideration. After stating Mr Watson's amendment, Mr that, for that reason, the union is a highly Wise deals with its effect, and says:The difference between the two proposals is very great. Mr Watson's proposal puts the burfor the most part as engine-drivers in the den of proof upon the persons who deny that the applicants do substantially represent the trade ment puts the burden of proof upon the persons who ask for preference. This is a ditference which will be appreciated at once by any lawyer. That is the opinion, not only of a very able lawyer, but of a gentleman who has made the question of industrial legislation a special study, and who is, therefore, entitled to speak upon it with a greater degree of authority than are most legal men. In the course of the same article Mr Wise points out how this proposal would work in practice. I did not happen to be present in the Chamber when the honourable and learned member for West Sydney was addressing himself to this question, but I understand, from the reply of the honourable member for Parramatta, that he instanced the case of the trolley and draymen in this connection. In the opinion of the honourable member for Parramatta, that case did not apply to the present Bill, inasmuch as he declares that the industry repiesented by that union is not likely to come under its operation. almost impossible to conceive of an interState strike of trolley and draymen. The probability of such a thing is certainly remote, but the honourable member must recollect that there are unions of that character throughout the various States, and. consequently, it is quite possible that a difficulty may unexpectedly arise which may affect the interests of that industry in more than one State. That, however, is a matter of surmise. In the article to which I have referred Mr Wise deals with another industry, namely, that which is represented by the Amalgamated Engineers' Union. He points out that that union represents an inof theoretical, ns well as practical, study upon the part of its members. engineers ? ciation embraces both marine and land engineers; but I cannot speak authoritatively on the point. Mr Wise points out that the members of the Amalgamated Engineers' Association require considerable theoretical, as well as practical, knowledge, and organized one.

109,Mr Brown,"I presume that the assono such qualification. About six years ago, the present Prime Minister introduced a Bill in One Legislature of New South Wales which related to -engineers, and more particularly to those in charge of mining machinery. Prior to that there was no State legislation dealing with the matter, and any man who, by .working as afireman,had obtained a slight knowledge of machinery, was entitled to take charge of an engine if he could find an employer ready to trust him with one. Such men lacked expert knowledge ; they were a menace to those engaged in the works in which they were employed, and the Bill was, therefore, introduced in the interest of human life. A number of accident's directly traceable to insufficient knowledge on the part of those placed in charge of engines and machinery had occurred, and the Bill was consequently introduced to regulate the industry. It provided that if a man could show that at the time of the passing of the Act he had a practical knowledge of machinery, he should receive a certificate entitling him to engage in this occupation. Failing this, he had to pass a fairly stiff examination to prove his fitness for the work, and, on doing so, received a certificate those engaged in .the industry, including without which he could not be employed as an engineer. lation a number of men who, up to that time, had been in charge of machinery, employed more particularly in mining operations, were deprived of this means of employment. Mr Wise points out that a similar course has been followed in some of the other States, and he shows that while the Amalgamated Engineers' Association represents the competent men of the industry, there are many men in charge of engines and machinery who-do not possess the same qualifications. cannot be engaged in the occupation. different States. allowed to do so in New South Wales. measure to which I have referred, they were able to do so. cluded them, and a considerable number of those previously engaged in the industry were registered under it, although they could not pass the special examination as to fitness. We are legi'slating now, not for New South Wales, but for the whole Commonwealth, and we must bear in mind that the conditions vary considerably in the several States. The regulations in some of the States are perhaps more stringent than are those prevailing in New South Wales, while in others we have a state of affairs similar to that which we had in New South Wales prior to the passing of the legislation I have mentioned. Mr Wise points out that under this Bill, members of the Association applying for preference might be met with the opposition of men who were not equally qualified, and who rightly believed that if the concession were granted, thgir opportunities for employment would be curtailed. The mere fact of their opposition would throw upon the Association the onus of proving that they represented a majority not merely' of the most competent men in the industry, but of those actually engaged in it. The leader of the Opposition, and those who agree with him in opposing the Government proposition recognise the difficulty, if not the injustice, of throwing upon such a body of workers the onus of proving not merely that the majority of the members of their union are in favour of preference, but that their application has the approval of a majority of many with whom they are not in touch, and As the result of this legiswhose opinions it would be practically impossible to ascertain. Mr Wise saysMr Watson's amendment, in fact, recognises that the object of unionism is not only to raise wages, but to improve the standard of the workmen. It requires' that character, ability, and skill, when they exist in a trade union, should be recognised by the Court, and have due weight given to them. In fact, the practice of the Court of New South Wales has been only to grant preference in cases where the conditions stated in Mr Watson's amendment have been proved to exist. He goes on to say that he sees no necessity for the limitation proposed by the leader of the Opposition; he thinks that the matter might be left to the discretion of the Court, just as has been done in the legislation bearing on this subject passed in New Zealand and New South Wales. This view of the position indicates some of the problems that we have to consider. It is the opinion of a gentleman who not only holds a very That Act, however, exhigh position in the legal profession in New South Wales, but is specially qualified to deal with the subject from the industrial stand-point, by reason of his close study of, and his association with, a similar piece of legislation now in operation in that State.

I have to make a choice between the two propositions, and, as the result of careful consideration, I have decided that the Senate's amendment or the modification of it proposed by the leader of the Opposition, would do more .to make this a workable measure, acceptable to innot dustrialism, than would the Government operation of this B ill , but whether a proposition.

176,,"I think that the honMr JOHNSON (Lang) -The honorabletion imposed no qualification upon the granting of a preference. was then at issue had nothing whatever to do with the extension of a preference to unionists. At that time the provision under consideration was clause 4, paragraph (b), which reads as follows:In this Act, except where otherwise clearly intended, "" industrial dispute"" means a dispute in relation to industrial matters . . '. certified by the Registrar as proper in the public interest to be dealt with by the Court, and extending beyond the limits of any one State, but does not include a dispute relating to employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, or of a State, or to employment by any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State. Upon that proposal the honourable member for Wide Bay had moved by way of amendmentThat after the word ""State"" the words ""but does not include "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""and includes."" by saying that the statement which I quoted was made when that clause was being considered. particularly to the proposal to include public servants in this Bill, and had absolutely no connection whatever with the clause under discussion. Nor is there one word in any of my speeches upon this subject as reported in Hansard, which is capable of bearing the construction put upon my utterances by the honourable member for Gwydir, who declared that I expressed myself as opposed to the Bill, "" lock, stock, and barrel."" On the contrary, reference to Hansard will show that I am not opposed to the Bill, although I do not regard compulsory arbitration as the panacea for all labour troubles. I simply look upon it as experimental legislation of doubtful utility, even to those in whose special interests it is designed. Upon page 1174 of Hansard, honourable members will see that I statedOn the merits of the proposed amendments, I have, so far, an open mind. I mention these matters to show that there is no justification whatever for the feverish haste that has been displayed in pressing forward a measure of this character at the beginning of a session which might have been devoted to useful legislation. The Government, however, are entirely responsible for that, and for any consequences which may follow their act. To my mind, the crux of the present position is, not whether the employees of the States or the railway servants should be included iu the operation of this B ill , but whether mind, as illogical as would be the contena Ministry which is responsible for the mischievous legislation from which we have suffered during the past two or three years shall be permitted to continue to occupy"" the Treasury bench. It will thus be seen that my attitude had 1 nothing whatever to do with the clause which we are discussing at the present time, but related to a proposal of an entirely different character, namely, the proposal to bring public servants within the operation of this Bill. that the amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition does not go far enough to please me. It is certainly a vast improvement upon the clause in the-form in which it is proposed by the Government, but that is all that can be urged in its favour; Doubtless it was submitted with a view to showing the Government that its author is prepared to meet them in a reasonable way. But I would warn the leader of the Opposition that in submitting to .continual encroachments by the Government upon the principles of the Bill, he is likely to sap the very foundations of unionism. It is possible for him to yield too much in that direction. It is absolutely unjust that one of the parties to this legislation should be asked to forego all the advantages which it at present enjoys without receiving anything whatever by way of compensation. that there is not some ready means of settling differences that occur between the two Houses of the Parliament. The amendment made by the Senate is a very important one, but the Government, in their wisdom, cannot see their way to accept it. It was carried by a fair majority in another place, and has the support of a very large minority in this Chamber. So far as this and the other amendments made by the Senate are concerned, it would appear that it is a question of a large majority of the Senate, plus a large minority of this House, against a small minority in the Senate, plus a small majority in this House. I am perfectly certain that if we could bring the 1.11 members of the two Chambers together to settle the question, this amendment would be carried. It does not ask that'an injustice should be done to any one. It is contended that it seeks to give to one set of men that which non-unionists could not claim. If that be so, what is there to prevent non-unionists from joining the ranks of unionism? That argument is, to my",29,Conciliation And Arbitration

There are a great many members of the legal profession sitting on the opposite side of the Chamber, and I ask them to seriously consider whether it would not be well for us to accept the Senate's amendment, and to go away joyous and happy, to seek rest from the turmoil through which we have passed since the opening of the session. one. returned by the aggregate wisdom of the various majorities in the different .constituenbe able to ascertain the desire of the eleccies of the Commonwealth, propose to reject an amendment made by another place, and to insult the greater part of the population of Australia, as represented by that Chamber. wrecked in connection with this measure, and, without desiring to make any unpleasant suggestion, I would point out that a fourth is now in trouble in regard to this very question. gestion which ought to appeal to the intelligence of the Committee. the kindly courtesy of the Prime Minister, I think that information should be placed before us as to what would be the cost of obtaining the opinion of the voters who created this Parliament in regard to any difference arising between the two Houses. There is no doubt that this amendment, and the others dependent upon it, constitute the sole difference of opinion between the two Chambers, and that there is, a large majority of the members of the Parliament as a whole in favour of them. one large city company, which carries out the work of addressing envelopes, information which enables me to form some estimate of what would be the cost of taking an open referendum through the Post Office. It seems to me that difficulties of this kind could be easily settled if the Prime Minister and his colleagues, with the approval of 12 s 2 the majority of the House, sought the opinion of the people in what may be called, for the sake of clearness, an open referendum. In round figures there are 2,000,000 adults in Australia, and 2,000,000 double post-cards might be issued bearing the question whether the electors to whom they were addressed would accept the B ill , as amended by the Senate, or as it was sent by us to another place. On the 31st December last there were 2,073,200 adults in the Commonwealth, but the number enrolled was only 1,893,586. Taking the larger figures, the cost of 2,000,000 double postcards would be ,£1,500. The charge for addressing 1,000 envelopes in the city of Melbourne is 7s. 6d'., and at ""this rate the cost of addressing the 2,000,000 post-cards would be ,£750.

The expense attendant upon the retirement of three Ministries alone must have been much greater than would be the cost of taking a referendum in the way I have suggested. We contend that every human being should be able to come under the provisions of this measure, and that we should not render it difficult for the Court to determine whether a union applying for preference substantially represents the workers in the trade, or calling, to which it relates. I obtained from I am informed by a gentleman that whilst travelling in one of the tram cars of this city he sawan officer approach the conductor, and heard him say, ""Give me all the money in your pockets."" The conductor had to comply with this request. After this rudely-spoken officer had left the car my friend inquired what was the reason for his action, and was told that it was the result of a new regulation, which compelled conductors to produce the money in their possession whenever they were required to do. so. In the eyes of a stranger unacquainted with the true position of affairs, the action of the officer suggested that the conductor was a thief. I am sure that honourable members, and more particularly the representatives of New South Wales^ would not permit such a system to exist in Sydney. If the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland were carried, and the employees of the tramway service in Melbourne were allowed to form a union, I feel satisfied thai that organization would more than represent the majority of those actually engaged in that calling. I plead with the Government to endeavour to arrive at some easy method of settling these difficult questions. I presume that if the life of this Parliament extends over its f u l l term of three years, similar difficulties to that which.now confronts us are likely to recur. We are to-day'face to face with a situation the equal of which has never previously occurred. We have the will of a second Chamber more democratic, more advanced, and more in touch with the people of Australia than is that which is commonly called the people's Chamber, flouted by a small majority in this House. The two Chambers are in conflict, and I think that would be a ready means of settling the difficulty. It would not lead to the employment of an additional postal officer, and as the Department is under the control of the Federation, the cost of postage would be avoided. dum we should get rid of the present unsatisfactory position. Whether the Opposition, or the Government won, if the Ministry in its generosity saw fit to accept my proposal there would be an end to the trouble, and the Ministry and its supporters, in common with the Opposition, would be abb to enjoy a well-earned holiday. not to accept the Senate's amendment they will receive the support of all the Conservatives in Australia, if such a class of politicians still exist here. great Protectionist Party of Victoria is rent asunder, and I appeal to them to unite in supporting the amendment which the honourable member for Bland has submitted in a spirit of fairness, and for which I myself intend to vote. think that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland is of the very essence of compromise, and one which, if *there be any idea of concession on the part of honourable members opposite, ought to be accspted without demur. It would certainly make the Bill more workable, and would obviate the tendency to litigation which might otherwise arise. We are here to place this measure on the Statute-book in clear, unmistakable Anglo-Saxon terms, so that he who runs may read. We are not here to create work for lawyers; our duty is to declare on the face of the Bill exactly what we mean. We are assured by the Government that they are anxious that the Bill shall be not a dead letter, but an effectual means of settling disputes between employers and employees. If that be so, there is only one way in which they can achieve their purpose. The position is narrowed down to this : that if the Government are anxious to make the Bill a workable one they must recognise that the amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition is a finger-post, pointing the clear road to right doing, and that they ought to accept it. The Government proposal would lead to endless litigation, and would prove a f r u it f u l source of profit to members of the legal profession. It would never be accepted by trade unionists as the final method for the settlethe suggestion I have made ment of disputes. The amendment requires that the Court must be satisfied that the organization applying for preference substantially represents the industry affected in point of number and competence of its members. I am glad that the last three As the result of such a referenwords have been added, because a numerical majority may not substantially represent an industry. A majority which substantially represents an industry must be a competent majority. I do not think that honourable members are fully aware of what the trade unions take upon themselves in accepting the amendment. We pledge them to see that their members are competent, that If the Government are determined they have served their apprenticeship, and are skilled handicraftsmen. It will be the duty of every trade union appealing for preference to show that it has a numerical At present the superiority over the non-unionists in the trade, and that its members have served their apprenticeship, and are skilled in their trade or calling. The honourable member for Melbourne pointed out that the medical profession is a close trade union, which noman can enter who has not obtained the necessary diploma.

Trade unions are now being put on the same footing. By accepting the amendment, we shall require the trade unions to insist upon the technical training of their members. Thus the amendment will serve a double purpose. It will secure that those who are most interested in a trade or industry shall, when necessary, be able to obtain preference from the Arbitration Court, and it will guarantee to the public at large, and to employers in particular, the competence of members of trade -unions.

The proviso, however, would, as it stands, lead to endless litigation, because of the difficulty of proving whether the majority of the trade affected was orwas not contained in the trade union applying for preference.

187,So Far From The Measure Hindering Mr Higgins,"As I understand that weone-thousandth part of the latitude which other honourable members have been enjoying all the morning, thought I do not wish to set a bad example to my honourable friends opposite, because I know how quickly they would follow it. the Chair is the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. I understood the Prime Minister to be making an explanation of his reasons for speaking at this particular juncture. gress the rules of debate, even in making an explanation, but as the discussion has been prolonged I am anxious to clearly define the position of the Government, and of those who are supporting them in this matter. As honourable members will recollect, I desired last night, because of the great .amount of time which has been occupied in the consideration of the B ill , to have a division forthwith on the amendment of the leader of the Opposition. That amendment is well known, since it is word for word the same as a suggestion made by the honourable member in this chamber some months ago, when the proposed recommittal of clause 48 was before us. I therefore was very brief in my utterance last night, but now that the' debate has been prolonged to such a length, I feel it necessary to state clearly the view of the Government in regard to this proposition. TheTe are persons who differ as to the importance of the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. The honourable member for Parramatta quoted the honourable member as saying that in his opinion his amendment was practically the same as the proviso adopted by the Committee, for Parramatta did not quote me quite correctly. member's statement in Hansard, and, with every desire to be fair to him, I say that I think that the honourable member for Parramatta made a perfectly correct statement in regard to one speech, at any rate. I do not know whether my honourable friend qualified his statement afterwards, but dealing with that speech the honourable member for Parramatta fairly quoted the remarks of the honourable member for Bland. gentleman wish to draw me up in reply to. him ? say only a few words. I differ from the honourable member for Parramatta. I think that there is a substantial difference between the two amendments. If there had not been, the late Opposition would have had no justification whatever for refusing The question before to recommit the clause, or for taking up the stand they did. The only justification we could have had . was that there was a serious difference between the two amendments; so serious was it that we were not prepared to consider any modification of our proposal. Now that the I do not wish to transhonorable member asks us to consider a modification of precisely the same kind that we were formerly unable to accept, I want to define the position of the Government in this way: If the two amendments were substantially the same, I should have no objection in the interests of the B ill to adopt the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland, but the Government consider that there is a vital difference between the two proposals, and that prevents us from accepting the modification before us. T,OOO men engaged in an industry, and 100 men in a union registered under the Act became parties to a dispute in the Arbitration Court, they would substantially represent the 1,000, within the meaning of any interpretation which the Court would put upon the proposal of the honourable member for Bland. I am willing to accept the principle of majority rule, but I am not prepared to adopt a conclusion of the kind I have indicated. honourable gentleman does not seriously say that 100 men would substantially represent 1,000? case such as I have mentioned, would very I have read the honourable substantially represent the 1,000.

The Prime Minister has at last distinctly explained why he cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland. He has stated that in the event of its being adopted, if 100 men belonged to a union, they could control 900 others engaged in the same industry. As a matter of fact, that does not occur under the law as it is applied in New South Wales and in New Zealand. words as those proposed by the honourable member for Bland embodied in the law as it -stands to-day. in' New South Wales has proceeded upon practically tlie same lines as those proposed by the honourable member for Bland. has taken into consideration the question whether the applicants for preference represent a fair percentage of those engaged in the industry. In order to show the improbability of such results as those predicted by the Prime Minister being brought about, I would point out that in New South Wales recently, a union, embracing 250 men, applied for preference, but as there were 1,250 men employed in the industry, the Court held that the unionists had no just claim for preference. those embodied in the amendment are. not contained in the Act. If they had been, the unionists would have obtained preference. orable gentleman seriously pretend that if there were 250 men in a union, they could prevent 750 non-unionists 5n the same industry from obtaining employment? tain any such thing. orable gentleman 'has no right to insult honourable members upon, this side of the Chamber, and also the Chairman, by stating that he has been listening to sickening repetitions. That is not only a reflection upon honourable members, but also upon the Chairman, whose duty it is to see that no tedious repetition takes place. As I have said previously, we have a duty to perform. If the honourable member for Wentworth will persist in sitting in front of me and annoying me, I shall take measures to prevent him.

I certainly did say that the Court, in the absence of any limitation, would be guided by the practice which has already been established in New Zealand and New South Wales. That practice is to insist, as far as possible, that those who apply for a preference shall constitute a majority. But I contend-and I have always contended-that there is a very wide distinction between my proposal and the amendment which was carried at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. that there would be a difficulty in establishing the fact that a majority approved of a preference being granted. culty to which I object, rather than to the Court granting a F r e r e r e n c e minority more than the honourable member admits. the honourable member for Parramatta I inferred that I was alleged to have stated that the two amendments practically amounted to the same thing. that impression. am very sorry to again interpose in this debate, but the matter under consideration is of some concern to me. In the electorate which I represent there is a very large number of unionists, and I wish to put myself right with them, in view of the statements of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. WhatI said, during the course of my previous remarks, was that the leader of the Opposition had insisted that his amendment was the only practical means of insuring that the President of the Arbitration Court should not grant a preference unless a majority of those interested in the award asked for it. member puts the case too strongly. did not say that.

The honourable member ought to know that. but if we were to refuse to do so, we should have to conceive a set of circumstances which are almost outside human comprehension. I do not. When Does the honourable member for Bland say that under this clause, if an ordinary dispute occurred, and a majority of those afEver fected applied for a preference, the Court would refuse to grant it? Such a proceeding is almost unimaginable. The provision directs that where a majority asks for a We say that too. preference, the Court may grant it, but If we place this ""may "" there, I take it , means ""shall."" intention. the Court will interpret this clause as it will interpret any other provision in the B ill . Consequently I claim that when a majority applies for a preference, it will be granted, unless an extraordinary state of things should arise. If such a state of things did arise, no doubt an extraordinary way of dealing with it would be adopted by the Court. But, under ordinary circumstances, 1 claim that the proviso in the clause I agree with the leader of amounts to a direction that the Court shall extend a preference to unionists when a majority apply for it . Since the leader of the Opposition desires only to insure that a majority should receive a preference when they ask for it, I claim that the Government proposal constitutes astraightforward method of Sealing with He the matter, and is therefore preferable tc> the indefinite and difficult method which is contained in the amendment. The honourable member for Parramatta is distinctly under a misapprehension as to The Government the meaning of this clause. He imagines that the effect of the provision in its present form is that if a majority approve of a preference being granted to unionists, the Court is bound to concede that preference.., I venture to say-and I am prepared to pledge any reputation which I have It does nothing of the upon my statement-that he is wrong. If he thinks that he is going to persuade the unionists in his constituency, to whom lie has referred, that that is the case, he is making a great mistake. The provision here is simply negative.

I feel that as the result of an interjection made by the honourable member for Parramatta in regard to this matter I have bden placed in a false position. Earlier in the day, while I was endeavouring to show the difference between the Government proposal and that put forward by the Opposition, I .understood the honourable member for Parramatta to interject that the leader of the Opposition on a previous occasion had expressed the opinion that there was no difference between his amendment and that which was carried on the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella before the Bill was sent to another place. he had admitted that all he desired was to secure a majority. to clearly hear interjections made by honourable members. My impression was that the honourable member meant to say that the leader of the Opposition had expressed the opinion to which I have just referred. I was not in a position at the moment to verify that assertion. I accepted it as being correct, and proceeded to controvert the opinion said to have been, expressed by the leader of the Opposition by quoting the views of the late Attorney-General of New South Wales, the Hon. B. R. Wise.

It seems to me, therefore, proper that we should state as definitely as possible how far it is intended to go. WhatI understood was aimed at in the original amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella cepted by the honourable member himself. one or two words, it was drafted by the | honourable and learned member, and modiMcDonald, C. fied by an amendment of the honourable and O'Malley, K. learned member for Darling Downs, being Poynton, A. accepted by the then Government in its Spence, W.

Such a prohibition would be a distinct hardship on unions, and, I am convinced, would be repugnant to unionists, whether they had a sneaking regardfor the Parliamentary Labour Party or not. The great majority of them would not register under the Bill"", if they were restrained from engaging in any kind of political agitation, which is the effect of the amendment of the Senate. A union could take no political action whatever, no matter how free that action might be from party politics, or how important the question to the union taking action, if the amendment of the Senate were accepted as it stands. For instance, the question of workmen's compensation is one upon which trade unionists have every right to agitate, without reference to party politics. They desire to arouse the public to the need for taking steps to protect workmen from injury in the pursuance of their ordinary avocations, it may be through the negligence of their employers; but no such action could be taken without having some political objective, and therefore a union would have to choose between taking such political action, and refusing to come under the Bill and obtain preference. before us affects, not action taken by those who apply for preference, but action taken by'those who oppose the granting of preference.",39,Pairs

Apparently it has been prepared for more than a few minutes, but I did not know anything about it until the leader of the Opposition said that he had given a copy to some one else. of the amendment. of order upon a matter of considerable importance. Clause 55 of the Bil l upon which this further proviso has been adopted by the Senate, so far as this particular question is concerned, consists of two parts, one authorizing the registration of certain associations as organizations, and the other providing that no registered organization shall be entitled to a preference declaration while it is political. briefly, though not quite accurately, expresses the meaning of the provision. The Senate agreed to that proposal. agreed that a registered organization should not be entitled to a declaration of preference, and in view of the provision in' an earlier section to the effect that certain persons, or an organization, might, if they chose, oppose an -application for preference, the Senate added a separate and distinct provision that no opposition to an application for preference should be permitted by an organization which was political. The Prime Minister has moved "" That the Senate's amendment be agreed to."" Now, the leader of the Opposition proposes to move an amendment which includes the words "" political purposes in this section."" I wish to call the special attention of the Committee to the last three words. With the addition of those words, the definition of ""political purposes"" will affect not only the proviso to which the Senate asks this Committee to agree-it not having been previously embodied in the clause-bu t also those portions of the clause which have been agreed to by both Houses. It means that these shall be alterea. the Senate have agreed, in the first place, that associations may be registered as organizations; and, secondly, that when they are registered, they shall not be entitled to a declaration of preference if they are of a political character. The Senate proposes to add that no opponent of preference shall be allowed to appear before the Court to oppose the granting of a preference if the available only within the last two or three organization which he represents is of a political character. The leader of the Opposition wishes to move that "" political purposes"" in this section shall not include certain things. His proposal, I would point out, covers the proviso to which both I was in perfect ignorance Houses have agreed, as well as the other proviso which the Senate has proposed. If the honourable member for Bland disI desire to raise a point agrees with the view which I am urging, he is impaled upon the horns of a dilemma; either he has to say that this definition does not alter the meaning of the word "" political,"" in the portion of the clause which has been agreed to by both Houses-in which case it is useless-o r he has to confess that it affects what both Houses have agreed to. That, not agreed to the clause. will permit me to do so, I shall explain my It view to the Committee. I repeat that the addition of the words "" in this section"" proposed by the leader of the Opposition whilst it was political, would have the effect of amending a proviso to which both Houses have already agreed. If he had contented himself with moving the addition of the words "" in this proviso,"" I should not have objected. The standing order relating to this matter is standing order No. 192, which imposes an express prohibition which the other standing orders cannot overcome. It readsNo amendment shall be proposed to an amendment of the Senate that is not strictly relevant theretovant to the Senate's amendment ? standing order continuesnor can an amendment be moved to the Bill unless the same be relevant to, or consequent upon either the acceptance or the rejection of the Senate's amendment.",42,Pairs

Standing order 193 provides thatWhen amendments made by the Senate, in Bills which shall have first passed the House, shall have been agreed to by the House without amendments, a Message shall be sent informing the Senate thereofj and if they shall have been agreed to with amendments, the Bill shall be returned It is perfectly clear that we have power to amend an amendment. But there has been no agreement between the Houses as to the terms of clause 55. This House has proposed one form, and the Senate another, and now we say, "" We will meet you halfway, by agreeing to your amendment, if you will allow us to qualify it by explaining the meaning of the words ' political purposes.' "" Standing order 207 shows that we can go still further, and Ibe in order. It says thatNo amendment can beproposed in any words of the B ill That is to say, we cannot strike words out of the clause or make any change of that sortwhich, having received the concurrence of the Senate, have not been the subject of, or immediately affected by, some previous amendment. The standing order is badly expressed, but its intention is plain. with amendments after there has been a disagreement between the Houses. tion still stronger. We' are now at an earlier stage, though the two Houses have not come to any agreement in regard to clause 55. If the Senate has made an amendment which affects words which we have agreed to, we are entitled to strike out those words. thatNo amendment can be proposed in any words of the Bill which, having received the concurrence of the Senate, have not been the subject of, or immediately affected by, some previous amendment. It pro""Previous amendment"" means, an amendment made by the Senate, so that if the Senate inserted a clause, we could, in acwords to which we had already agreed. The Minister of Defence has referred to page 478 of May, but I would ask him to not. The look at the following passage on page 477I f a Bill be returned from one House to another with amendments, these amendments must either be agreed to by the House which had first passed the B ill , or the other House must waive their amendments : otherwise the Bill will be lost. Sometimes one House agrees to the amendments, with amendments, to which the other House agrees. So far the prima facie position is all right. We wish to amend the amendment of the Senate, and I apprehend that the only point which you, Mr Chairman, have to consider is whether the amendment of the leader of the Opposition is relevant to the' addition to the clause made by the Senate. If it is not relevant, it is out of order, but if it is relevant, it is in order. You have nothing to do with ""its ulterior effect upon the construction of the Bill. Then, at page 478 of May, it is stated that I t is also a rule, that neither House may, at this time, leave out or otherwise amend anything which they have already passed themselves; unless such amendment be immediately consequent upon the acceptance or the rejection of an amendment of the other House. "" Leave out "" ; that is the very point which is dealt with in standing order 207. We cannot alter our accepted words unless something has been done by the Senate, which is a reason for qualifying what we have done. But to "" leave out or otherwise amend"" is quite different from adding something in the nature of a proviso upon a proviso. I know that your attention has been called to this point, Mr Chairman, and therefore I shall not speak at greater length. But in May reference is made to the Commons' Journal, and particular reliance is placed on what occurred in England in connection with the Municipal Corporations Bill, about seventy years ago. In the Commons' Journal will be found instance after instance of amendments which have the effect of saying, ""-We will agree to the amendment of the Lords provided that they The standing order savs will qualify the meaning of certain Words throughout the Bill.""

I do not think honourable members intended to prevent an employers' organization from applying its funds for the printing and circulation of pamphlets against the Immigration Restriction Act, the Pacific Island Labourers Act, the Victorian Factories Act, or any similar measure. Buti f the amendment is agreed to as it stands, any organization whose rules funds to be used purpose will appearing before the Court to oppose an application for preference. ment goes far beyond what we had in view. The amendment of the leader of the Opposition will have a retro-active effect, which is perfectly justifiable, and that effect will be a healthy one, because we went too far in the first instance. I do not think honourable members wish to penalize unions of employers or employees because their funds may be spent in pamphleteering or in employing lecturers or lecturesses. good deal of confusion has been caused by concerned, we shall be upon incontestable the leader of the Opposition in using the ground. If , however, we go beyond that, word "" union "" in reference to the amendand use the words "" in this section,"" with ment.

It seems to me that the Senate is perfectly reasonable in providing that the conditions which are imposed upon organizations asking for preference shall be imposed on organizations resisting such applications. The honourable member for Bland is willing to agree to the Senate's amendment if the words ""political purposes"" are defined as having a certain meaning. If that were the whole of his proposal, he would occupy a stronger position than he does. But he goes further, and proposes that this definition shall apply to those words throughout the whole clause. If he proposed to amend the amendment of the Senate, what the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne terms the retro-active effect of his proposal would have passed unnoticed, and his position would have been firmer, though it cannot be denied that if the words "" political purposes"" are permit a penny of its given a certain meaning in the Senate's for any such amendment, they may, later on, be simifee debarred from larly interpreted wherever they occur.

Inasmuch as the Senate has accepted the proposal made with regard to organizations applying for preference, without any amendment 'or definition whatever, they clearly had no intention to alter that. That is to say, they intended to accept that provision without alteration. But they propose an addition affecting those organizations which oppose preferences,, and this amendment proposes that "" political purposes "" in that amendment shall have' a certain meaning. Permit me to point out that honourable members opposite are proceeding upon their own interpretation of the meaning likely to be attached by the Court to the words "" political purposes."" For aught I know, ""political purposes"" may include, in the mind of the Court, any or all of the things mentioned in the amendment of the honourable -member for Bland. The honourable member is proceeding on the assumption which, to my mind, appears largely unwarranted, that the Court will hold that no unions will be entitled to oppose preference if they are pursuing any of the objects he has indicated. I would not venture, off-hand, to say in advance what the Court, after argument and consideration, will regard as being exclused by the words "" political purposes."" what we are aiming at? be free from ambiguity. I did not want this provision. member accepted it . ber for Bland and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne have strayed into the consideration as to what is healthy or unhealthy, what is desirable or undesirable, and the respects in which the House should be free or fettered. I am not now dealing with the merits of the amendment. I am pointing out that the whole argument of the honourable member for Bland turns upon his own interpretation of the meaning of the words "" political purposes."" The honourable member's arguments on that point wsre not in their proper place. I do not think that this definition of the words "" political purposes"" would exclude a number of the purposes to-which the honourable member for Bland has referred. I think that many of them might be denned as labour or industrial matters, and probably would not be excluded as political by the -"" strictly "" and "" directly."" Court. Therefore the honourable member for Bland must not claim any weight for his argument, owing to his own interpretation of the words ""political purposes."" I feel sure that they will be found to be . far less restrictive than he is inclined to believe. As the honourable member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out, it would be possible by a re-interpretation of words embodied in an amendment submitted by the Senate to affect the meaning of a whole Bill which we had previously passed, and to which the Senate had already agreed. agreed to the Bill as passed by us. whole B ill , with four suggested amendments. The honourable and learned member argued that, in dealing with this amendment, we could adopt an interpretation of its language which would apply to the whole of the provisions of the Bill in which similar language was used. terpretation was relevant to the clause in which it was inserted. the doctrine of amendment to such a length that no Bill could ever be taken to be settled, even in its most vital principles or its most important provisions, until the last amendment had been passed. learned member mean to say that the amendment must relate to nothing but that which but the honourable has been inserted by the Senate? I had to. that is the only ground upon which we can stand with safety. Directly we go beyond that we launch ourselves into the region' of argument. This amendment may be right or not; it is near the border-line.' My difficulty is that I do not see how, in the reading that is being given to t h; words "" directly relevant"" and "" strictly relevant"" it is possible to draw the line in such a way as to give any force or effect to the words. If the contention of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that anything which is relevant to the proviso is therefore relevant to the B ill , and that every word'of the B ill is relevant to every other word, be correct, we should have it in our power in the Very last amendment to vitally alter the whole character of a Bill.

The question is one solely of the interpretation of the words ""strictly relevant thereto.'' The view put forward by the honourable and learned member is that the word "" s t r i c t l y "" means ""exclusively,"" and that the amendment must relate exclusively to the proviso before the House. I entirely dissent from that interpretation. The amendment must, however, be one which distinctly modifies the particular proposal beforethe Committee. It must therefore be one which is "" strictly relevant "" to it. It must either add to it or modify it in some way. There must be some clear visible connection between it and the proposal which is under consideration. The next point which arises is "" What is the meaning We of the word 'relevant'?"" According to ordinary acceptation, it means "" having applicableness or pertinence; applicable, pertinent to the purpose; appropriate."" First of all we have to be satisfied that any proposal before the Committee is one which can be connected with the amendment of the Senate. We must establish clearly and distinctly that it has reference to it, otherwise it is excluded from our consideration. What is the position?

Now it is further proposed that those who are' opposed to the granting of a preference shall have certain conditions imposed upon them. That is the effect of the whole provision. This clause has been modified by the Senate, and returned to the House. We take up the position that, we are quite prepared to accept the clause in its modified form, so long as we are allowed to still further modify it by the insertion of words defining ""political purposes."" Then the question arises, "" Is the proposal of the honourable member fot Bland relevant?"" I submit that it is. A motion to define that term is relevant to the issue. Our next consideration should be, "" I s it strictly relevant?"" I claim that it is, because it defines the term used in the Senate's amendment, and no other term. It defines the meaning of ""political purposes."" If we were to say that the honourable member's proposal should apply only to the Senate's amendment it would then be exclusively relevant. this particular part of the clause has been passed by the Committee and sent up to the Senate, 'and that the Senate has made a modification in it. Surely, then, it is open to us to insert another modification ! Surely we are not to be excluded from dealing with it simply because, in order that we may be able to accept the Senate's amendment, we desire to add a further amendment. As a matter of fact, what the other Chamber has returned to us is the entire clause as it left this Chamber, with an addition. I take the view that we are quite prepared to accept that clause, upon the condition that we are permitted to add a further modification to it. If we d'o not possess that power, our powers are very restricted indeed. After. all, the question resolves itself into one of interpretation. It becomes a question of what is the meaning of the words "" strictly relevant?"" stances suggested by the honourable mempressly repealed or modified, and the common ber, would there ever be an end to the exchange of Bills between the two branches W ill the honourable of the Legislature? add anything to the amendment of the Senate which constitutes entirely new matter.

The question is whether the proposal of the leader of the Opposition is relevant to the amendment. I do not think the Prime Minister will contend that the words of that proposal are not strictly relevant. He may contend that they are not exclusively relevant. with which we can agree is that which has been made by the Senate. and learned member for Darling Downs contend that the amendment of the Senate refers to the whole of clause 55 ? part of the clause. Let us suppose It is quite true that that an addition of fresh matter were made to the clause. It necessarily follows that it must modify everything which has preceded it. honourable member think that the Senate has introduced an entirelv new bodv into this Bill? has done is to declare that when anybody opposes preference it shall be subjected to certain conditions. We say in effect, "" Very well ; we are prepared to accept that proposal, provided that the conditions are defined."" Surely it cannot be urged that the defining of those conditions makes the proposal of the honourable member for Bland not "" strictly relevant"" to the amendment.

I shall presently show that it is within the power of emplo) ers to apply r for a preference. provision is to provide equality of preference. If we alter the Senate's amendment only, we shall interfere with the whole spirit of the clause. I would point out that there are cases in which employers may apply to the Court for a preference. Take the pastoral industry as an example. The pastoralists number very many thousands, and occasionally the Australian Workers' Union has been called upon to supply the men required by them during the shearing season. It is therefore quite conceivable, in connection with an award of the Court, that the pastoralists may ask that the organization in question should supply them with labour, and to supply it to them first of all. That would be a case of preference. If the reasoning of the Minister be correct, it will be impossible for us to make the measure a workable one. We ought to endeavour, as far as possible, to overcome difficulties between the two Houses, and it'seems to me that when we desire to bring all the provisions of a clause into harmony we cannot separate an amendment made by another place from that with which it is connected. To reverse the decision of the Senate would be to do something contrary to the spirit of fair play to all parties which actuated another place in inserting this provision. It seems to me that an excellent case has been made out for the. amendment which the leader of the Opposition has put before the Committee, and that it is clearly in order. honourable and learned member for Northinto conflict with this Chamber, it might ern Melbourne in the view that the point of order raised is a most important one, affecting not only the question immediately before the Chair, but the relations of the two Houses. The more subtle point, as to relevancy, has been debated at length by the I maintain that, if you legal members of the Committee, but with all respect, it seems to me that they have not thrown much light on the subject. I do not think it is wise that we should determine the point at the present juncture. In view of the importance of the amendment, and the serious bearing which any decision given by the Chairman would have upon the relations of the two Houses, I think it would be w ise for the Minister to withdraw his : point of order. If that were done, Mr The Speaker and the Chairman would have an opportunity to'carefully study the question, and to decide it at a later date. It is generally contended that the decisions of a Chairman of Committees do not create precedents, but The intention of this we cannot get away from the fact that they must largely guide our future actions. If the point of order be pressed at this stage, it seems to me that it may ultimately be dealt with by Mr Speaker, and that we may have conflicting decisions. I hold that the procedure which we follow in dealing with the clauses of a Bill in Committee should be observed when we are considering a message from another place. When a clause of a Bill is being considered in Committee, Ave may deal with it sub-clause by sub-clause, or as a whole. An amendment may be-made in a sub-clause, and, that having been dealt with, we proceed to consider the next provision. It is true that we may not go back to the first part of a clause, which has once been dealt with in this way, but if necessary we may insert any proviso to qualify that which we have already passed. Why should we not be able to adopt the same course in connection with this matter? The amendment made by the Senate modifies the clause as agreed to by the two Houses. I agree with the contention of the Minister as to the position in regard to that part of the clause which precedes the proviso in question, but I hold that we are entitled to insert any further proviso to that made by another pjace. We have a right to insert any proviso affecting the whole clause. If that were not within our power the procedure by which we are governed in dealing with a Bill in Committee would be wrong.

Is not the whole Bill one, and is not every clause to be construed by the lighUof every other clause?

If we ate at liberty to say what the words mean in the Senate's amendment, surely we are at liberty to say what they mean in the other proviso, because of the intimate connection between the two! I say that there is no warrant in the Standing Orders for the rejection of the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. There would be a warrant if it were not strictly relevant to the amendment of the Senate, but as it is strictly relevant, there is no such warrant.

If the reference to us had been in terms like these, "" The Senate desires to secure the insertion of certain words in clause 55,"" or ""The Senate will agree to clause 55 if the House of Representatives will agree to the insertion of certain words,"" it would be competent for the Committee to deal with the whole clause, but, as things are, we can deal only with the amendments of the Senate as they stand. The amendment of the honourable member for Bland creates a difficulty. In using the words "" in this section,"" he has drawn my attention specifically to the fact that the words which he wishes to define aTe to be found in another part of the clause, and it is his desire to apply his definition to them. words "" in this section "" were omitted from his amendment, there would be no difficulty, so far as I am concerned, because I should only be called upon to rule as to whether the amendment was strictly relevant to the Senate's amendment. A t the present time, the question is not one of relevancy, but of application and effect. I shall be very glad if honourable members can show me that clause 55 is under discussion, and can be amended as proposed. tion, Mr Chairman, and, so far as my immediate purpose is concerned, would be willing to omit the words "" in this section,"" because the words "" political purposes "" do not appear in any other part of the B ill , and, therefore, the words "" in this section "" are not necessary to effect my purpose. Buti f the attitude which you have taken up I am very grateful a ruling. to my mind, if the amendment were ruled out of order, it would have a restrictive effect upon our action in the event of any future disagreement or difference with the Senate. I should, therefore, like a course to be taken on this occasion similar to that which was taken some three years ago, when, a hignly important question of proI cedure having been raised, it was, after the Chairman of Committees had given his opinion, referred, on the motion of the present Prime Minister, to Mr Speaker. I make this suggestion because I think it highly desirable that a definite course of proce'dure should be laid down by obtaining the opinion of the chief presiding officer of the House. Otherwise we might have two opinions-on e governing our proceedings in the House, and the other governing our proceedings in Committee. aware, the Minister of Defence and myself were forced to consider the amendment of the honourable member for Bland very hurriedly, and, coming to the conclusion that it was not strictly in order, a point of order was raised by my honourable and learned colleague. But, as the debate has gone on, I have become more and more doubtful on the point. I agree with the Chairman that the question is one of some difficulty. We are perfectly willing, however, to withdraw our objection to the amendment. better to have a ruling on the point ? course being taken, but I wish to withdraw my objection to the amendment, in order to save time. intend to accept the amendment ? a great deal in it which we may fairly and honestly accept.

I admire a man who is ready to defend a position which he has assumed, and I think that it is a very great mistake for suggestions to be made from both sides of the Chamber that the Chairman should abrogate his rights in connection with this question. mittee, I wish to point out that it will be far more satisfactory to us to obtain a ruling from the highest authority than to express our individual opinions by means of a vote. Seeing that we have a Speaker of high competence-and I believe that the leader of the Opposition informed him some little time ago of his intention to submit this proposal-it would be more satisfactory for us to be guided by him than by a mere chance division.

In the House : THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES I have the honour to report, by direction of the Committee, that the honourable member for Bland has submitted an amendment, which I ruled out of order. That amendment was in the nature of an addition to a motion by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister had moved in connection with clause 55That the amendment of the Senate be agreed to. Thereupon the honourable member for Bland movedThat the motion be amended by the addition of the following words :"" Political purposes "" in this section does not inmaterial qualification of clause 55. That clude obtaining or maintaining provisions applying to all persons in any particular industry without discrimination, as between those who are and those who are not members of an organization with respect to the regulation of the following industrial matters :1. Preservation of life and limb. 2. Compensation for injuries or death. 3. Sanitation. 4. The sex and age of employees. 5. The hours of labour. 6. The remuneration of labour. 7. Protection of salaries and wages. 8. Conditions of labour generally. I have ruled that the amendment exceeds the scope of the Senate's amendment, and could not, in my opinion, under our Standing Orders, be received. detain the House at very great length, because this very important point has already been considerably debated, but I would point out that any procedure which is likely to affect the possibility of arranging compromises between the two Houses of the Legislature must have a very important bearing upon the decisions which will be arrived at. I fesl that it is highly desirable, in the interests of legislative peace, that where there is an element of doubt as between one proposal and another, the leaning should be towards the adoption of that course which offers the greatest freedom for arranging a settlement of any differences which may exist between the two Chambers. I contend that the proposal which I have submitted is in order, because it aims ,at qualifying an amendment which the Senate has made in clause 55 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. That provision, as it was returned to this Chamber, contains the following proviso: And further provided that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization so long as its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its, members to do anything of a political character. I contend that by inserting that proviso the Senate.has materially qualified clause 55 as it left this Chamber. Had that provision been passed in the form approved by this House, it would have been open to any organization to appear before the Arbitration Court and to oppose the granting of a preference to unionists. The amendment of the Senate has had the effect of debarring some organizations from opposing the granting of a preference.

444,Mr Watson,"I do not desire to to qualify the Senate's amendment by defining the meaning of "" political purposes."" Our Standing Orders declare that so long as an amendment is strictly relevant to the amendment of the Senate, it is in order. Standing order 192 saysNo amendment shall be proposed to an amendment of the Senate that is not strictly relevant thereto, &c. I maintain that my proposal is strictly relevant to the amendment of the Senate. I would further point out that May, page 478, contains the following reference, which is somewhat similar in terms, although its phraseology is slightly differentIt is also a rule, that neither House may, at this time, leave out or otherwise amend anything which they have already passed themselves; unless such amendment is immediately consequent upon the acceptance or the rejection of an amendment of the other House. I hold that this amendment is immediately consequent upon the acceptance or rejection of the Senate's amendment. Under these circumstances, I maintain that my proposal is in order, and I can only urge, as an excuse for bringing the matter under your notice, Mr Speaker, its very great importance. this matter at length, for, in addition to what the' Chairman has said, the honourable member for Bland, if I may be permitted to say so, has put the case very fairly before you, Mr Speaker. I merely wish to say that I raised the point of order practically on the ground that the amendment, while affecting that sent to us by the Senate, would not only by its effect, but by the very use of the words "" in this section,"" affect something to which both Houses had agreed. I refer to the earlier proviso in clause 55, which I submit it would not be competent for us to affect-a t any rate in express terms-by further amendment. urge that clause 55, as sent to the Senate, declared that, so far as this House was concerned, no person-and I 'use the word "" person "" in its broadest sense-coul d ask for a preference except upon certain terms. The Senate inserted an entirely separate proviso, that no person should be able to oppose the granting of preference except on the same terms. Our proposal limits the powers of those who desire preference, and the amendment made by the Senate limits the powers of those who wish to oppose preference. The Senate accepted our conditions relating to application for preference, but the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland avowedly seeks to limit applications for preference which both this House and the Senate have agreed upOn. That was the main ground of my contention. I do not propose to labour the matter by quoting the Standing Orders bearing on the question, or what May says with reference to it, because I know, Mr Speaker, that you are familiar with those points. I am quite content, having made this statement, of the substantial ground on which I raised the point of order, to leave the matter to your decision. provide very clearly that when a point of order is raised, Mr Speaker shall listen to the statement of the point of order by the honourable member who raises it, and shall then give his decision. In some cases I have given my ruling forthwith, but at other times I have sought such help as one or two honourable members on each side of the House might desire to give me. In this instance I have listened to a statement made by one more honourable member on each side of the House, and do not propose to require further assistance beyond that which, perhaps, one honourable member on each side may be prepared to give. It would unnecessarily take up the time of the Housei f I were to invite a general discussion on the point. I shall be pleased to hear one honourable member on each side but no more. understand it, is, what is there to prevent this amendment being put before the Chair? Standing order 192 providesNo amendment shall be proposed to an amendment of the Senate that is not strictly relevant thereto; nor can an amendment be moved to the Bill unless the same be relevant to, or conseI quent upon, either the acceptance or the rejection of a Senate's amendment. I take it that, unless that standing order forbids the proposed amendment, it can be put. The proposed amendment, in my opinion, does not come within the prohibition, and, therefore, may be put. It is no answer to that argument to say that it affects some other portion of the Bill. That is almost the inevitable consequence of any amendment. The Senate, by amending clause 55 in the way it has done-by inserting what I may call a co-relative proviso to one immediately preceding itcannot have intended that a different meaning should be given to the words ""political purposes"" in the one proviso from that",58,Pairs

As we have a right to define the words "" political purposes,"" in the one case, ""It seems to be perfectly consequential that we should have the right to do so in the other. I feel sure'that common sense and legality agree in giving the Committee power to consider the amendment. wish to express my extreme regret at having to differ in any way from the ruling given by my honourable friend, the Chairman of Committees. It has always been a pleasure to me to support any decision which he has given in the exercise of his functions, and it is, therefore, with regret that I find myself compelled on this occasion to differ from the ruling which he . has given. I should like, next, to say that if I had any doubt upon the question submitted to me, I should certainly give the benefit of it in the direction of conferring the largest possible powers on this House in determining any issue. I think that in any case of doubt we should rather seek to enlarge the powers of the House, than to limit them. For that reason, if I were in doubt on this question, I should give a ruling in the direction I have indicated. On this occasion, however, for reasons which I shall very briefly state, I have no hesitation in arriving at a decision. It is true that, as the Minister of Defence has said, there are two circumstances contemplated in the two. provisos-the proviso in the B ill , as sent up from this Chamber, and' that which has been inserted by the other branch of the Legislature. There is the proviso relating to an application for preference, and that relating to opposition to any g if t of preference. But I have to look, not so much at the form, as at the substance of these proposals. When I examine the two provisos, I see that the other branch of the Legislature has most carefully followed, to the very letter, our it has inserted, evidently intending that whatever principle applied to opposition to an application for preference should also apply to any application for preference. The same principle was intended to apply in each case. In fact, the Senate really asks us to insert after the word "" Court'' in the proviso which we passed the following words:-""o r to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization."" Then the proviso would read on as passed by us. The substance of the whole difference between the two branches of the Legislature is evidently that whatever conditions are intended to apply in one case shall apply in the other. The conditions in each case' must be identical. We have therefore not two separate matters, but one, to deal with, and that is the nature of the restrictions which are to apply either to an application for preference or to an opposition entered to such an application. On that ground, I rule that we may determine in any way which the House may desire what definition shall be applied to the words "" political purposes "" -appearing equally in both provisos. The definition which we apply will have reference, not only to the second proviso inserted by the Senate, but also to that of which it forms an essential part-the proviso which was sent up from this House to the Senate. There are one or two other points which I think strengthen that view, but, as on this ground alone it seems to me that the matter is clear, I am content to leave it at that, and to rule that the amendment, if the House pleases to accept it, is one that we may make to the proviso which has been sent down. In Committee: the Committee that Mr Speaker has ruled that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland is in order. I shall now proceed to put it. External Affairs) I have been able to carefully consider this amendment, and find that it has the great advantage over all the arguments which we have heard for weeks and months past in reference to this vexed question, that it fairly and honestly recognises the interests of the workers as a whole, that it recognises the interests of unionists and non-unionists alike. I should like to the form' of clearly direct the attention of the Comproviso in framing that which mittee me.

I do not, so long as the sanitation is to include the dwellings of non-unionists as well, as of unionists. I would object to sanitation which passed over non-unionists for the benefit of unionists. The preamble, however, covers both parties, and confirms the principles for which we have been fighting so steadfastly during all these weary months. We have asked that no discrimination shall be made in these matters between those who are members of organizations and those who are not. I welcome my friends back to the broad ground of national legislation. The fourth subject is "" the sex and age of employees."" There have been laws on the statute-book even of the mother country for a long time past preventing inhumanity by the employment of children of tender age in industrial occupations whose burdens they were unfit to bear, and prohibiting conditions under which the sexes have been employed together in a manner repulsive to every feeling of modesty and self-respect.' Who objects to agitation for the improvement of such laws, so long as not only the unionist boy and the unionist girl, but all boys and girls are legislated for? The fifth subject is "" hours of labour."" In many of the States the hours of labour in.some occupations are already regulated by statute. In Victoria there is such legislation affecting the miners, and I believe that there is similar legislation in New South Wales. The Postmaster-General,.when Minister of Mines and Agriculture in that State, had the honour to pass a law which very much improved the conditions of the miners, and although he tried to provide for a limitation of hours of labour, he failed to do so, because of the action of the more conservative House of the Legislature in throwing out his proposal. Then there is legislation on the New South Wales statute-book regulating the ages at which children may be employed. T have no objection to any man, or any number of men banded together in a trade union, taking political action to bring about even better legislation upon such subjects, though, before such legislation can have effect, the electors and the Legislature of the country must agree to it. The"" remuneration of labour"" is another legitimate subject for political agitation by fhe workers of the Commonwealth. not wish to limit the healthy individual freedom of any man or of any body of men in Australia. We have so far""been dealing Mr Reid. with a widely different subject, with the demand that a Court of Justice shall use its powers to make distinctions in every-day work between one man and another. That is a different thing from preventing individuals from agitating for domestic reform by the improvement of laws relating to the comfort and the conditions under which workers are employed. I should be very sorry to think that any member of this House wished to impede such activity. The ""protection of salaries and wages"" has, I understand, been provided for in New South Wales. who does not sympathize with the abuses which have occurred over and over again through men who, after working week after week on a large contract, have, when it is finished, been deprived of their wages, sometimes by misfortune, and at other times by dishonesty and fraud. Is there any one who does not sympathize with the desire of the workers to secure the payment of the wages which they have earned? NowI come to the last of the matters enumerated in the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. I understand my honourable friend to wish to embrace all matters that cannot be specified, similar in character to those that are mentioned. The honourable member will see that the words "" conditions of labour generally,"" might permit of the circulation of a socialistic propaganda. I know that the Honourable member does not wish to use ambiguous words that can be construed in two or more different ways. I feel quite sure that he does not wish to introduce, at the end of the amendment, a provision that will be more important and far-reaching than all the others, and to couch the provision in .general words, the meaning of which cannot be easily understood. My honourable friend does not draw up amendments in that spirit. My desire is that the matter shall be clearly expressed, and I suggest that, for the words ""conditions of labour generally,"" we should substitute the words "" similar conditions affecting employment."" There is another amendment that I would suggest, namely, that the word "" industrial,"" in the opening paragraph of the amendment, should be excised. The term "" industrial I do matters "" is there used in a general sense, and not in the technical sense in which it is employed in other parts of the Bill. Under trie interpretation clause, the term",61,Pairs

I should like to say-and this is the only reason why I made an interjection whilst the Prime Minister was speaking-that it seemed' to me that he was travelling over the old ground to a certain extent. There should be no misunderstanding in the country as to the attitude maintained by the Opposition with regard to the matter referred to by the right honourable member. We never for a moment advocated anything with the slightest intention of influencing the Court and causing it to deviate from the strict path of official duty. Nothing could be further from the truth than to suggest that we had any such intention, and nothing could be further from the effect of the provisions advocated by us. There is not a line in the Bill, or a syllable, which dictates, to the Court that it should ever give preference irrespective of the circumstances connected with the application. about preference is that the Court shall have the fullest power to give or refuse, according as it thinks just or right, and if not a single word of limitation had been inserted in the Bill, there would not have been the smallest possibility of influencing the Court except by evidence and legitimate argument. But limitations have been imposed which are not found in any other similar measure. These limitations, which were not objected to by the members of the Opposition, relate to the notice to be given to persons interested in any application made to the Court, as to the nature of the organization which shall be entitled to ask for preference, and other matters. I say, without any fear of successful contradiction, because the B ill itself will show it, that the only fight' on the part of the Opposition in relation to the matter of preference has been conducted with the object, not of gaining an advanI am willing to accept tage for unionists over non-unionists, but of assisting unionists to achieve their legitimate aspirations, which are directed to the good of labour at large. If there had been It is. a great pleasure to the least indication of a desire on the part of the Labour Party to insert in the BillI shall any provision that would have given the unionists an unfair pull over non-unionists they would have found me opposing them. able and learned member will not enter upon a general discussion of the clause. I I think understand that he is explaining an interjectionthat he made. is only fair that I should do so. I desire to be quite frank with the Committee. In relation to this amendment, for which I am to some extent responsible, I desire io point out that there has been no departure by the Opposition from the position taken up from the first, and I do not think it is fair to represent to the country that we are now abandoning the fight in which we have hitherto been engaged throughout the discussion of this B ill . We must place oh record the fact that our efforts in regard to preference have been in the direction of enabling unionists to secure the amelioration of the conditions of labour for all workers alike. came on that ground we met them; that ground is common to both of us. misunderstanding, if one has existed. Does the right honourable gentleman wish to have All the Bil l says it believedI do not think he does-that the unionists and the Labour Party, who are supporting them, are endeavouring to steal a march upon the non-unionists of this country ? The demands we made Avere legitimate, and this amendment is in perfect consonance with them, because the unions which are endeavouring to improve the conditions of labour would be placed at a decided disadvantage if there were no power to grant preference. The penalization of the unions would be so great that they would be deterred from making anv efforts to advance the cause of labour. When we admit that any political purpose that has not for its object the advancement of labour of every kind, whether organized in unions or not. is indefensible, so far as preference is concerned, we make no departure from the principles we have advocated from the beginning.",62,Pairs

I was discussing nothing but the amendment. The Prime Minister stated to-night that what was embodied in ithe amendment was all that the Government had fought for. If that be so, it is remarkable that no such proposal ever emanated from them. It remained for the Opposition to bring forward, not only in principle, but in form, an amendment which I venture to say will exercise a very beneficial and enlarging influence upon the whole measure. I believe [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. that it will not only satisfy the desires of the a long way towards conquering the bad feeling which has been engendered in our discussions. the honourable and learned member for Indi began his speech he expressed pleasure that the Government had seen fit to adopt this amendment. The honourable imember, however, is not a good actor. and learned member had not been upon his feet more than five minutes before he showed mayunmistakable indications of great disappointment ; and from that moment his speech has been a tirade against the Governmentnot for resisting the amendment, but for adopting it. I speak as an outsider, who was absent from the Chamber when the proposal was adopted by the Prime Minister. But it does not take one long to understand the honourable and learned member for Indi. The five minutes during which I was present in the Chamber were sufficient to convince me that though the honourable :ind learned member had begun his speech by expressing pleasure that the Government had adopted the amendment, he was really sorry that they had done so, and is now anxious that the country sha.ll know that he is the designer of it. He informed us in a modest way that he had had ""a little to do with it "" himself. From the moment that I saw its phraseology, I recognised the designer. Although, as a whole, that amendment is unobjectionable, it contains certain words But in reply to a which are utterly unnecessary, and which have been inserted only to parade something with which the honourable and learned member has never exhibited any sympathy, namely, a desire to help non-unionists.

Is this amendment designed by the honourable and learned member to indicate that henceforth unionists and non-unionists are to be a happy family, and that no harsh terms of opprobrium are to be applied to the latter?

Though the proposal is designed oot to block other matters from being held to be of a non-political character, it practically lays down the lines upon which the powers of existing unions may be exercised without depriving them of the right of having their cases adjudicated upon by the Arbitration Court. But in the case of non-unionists, everybody who reads these words, even with a minimum of literary * intelligence, must realize that they are utterly unnecessary. If the honourable and learned member for Indi, as the creator, or even one of the parents, of this amendment, imagines that the public of Australia will think that the Labour Party have always been anxious to provide for the non-unionists, as well as for the unionists, he is welcome to his belief. But, although I hold that the words to which I have referred are utterly useless, they are quite harmless. As an affectation of good-feeling towards the non-unionists, they have no value. The public have been reading the debates upon this Bill for months past, and they know the attitude which the Labour Party has assumed towards non-unionists. The word "" scab '' has been thrown across this Chamber over and over again; and the honourable and learned member for Indi is entirely in sympathy with the use of that word. and learned member be compelled to withdoes the question of "" sanitation "" nor of draw that statement. does the honourable and learned member object ? member has stated that I am in sympathy with the use of the word "" scab."" His statement is absolutely inaccurate, and he had no right to make it. honourable and learned member's repudiation, I withdraw my statement, and apologize most humbly. He has addressed the Committee as if the acceptance by the Government of this amendment constituted a complete vindication pf his attitude upon the question from beginning to end. I have no hesitation in saying that the object of the amendment was not only to embarrass the Government, but to embarrass the whole of their supporters before the people of Australia. It has utterly failed to do so. If there ever was anybody who was "" hoist with his own petard,"" it is the honourable and learned member. I regard the amendment really as a concession, because so long as the word "" political "" remained undefined, it was quite possible to contend that the advocacy of such a scheme as the nationalization of the tobacco industry was an allowable function of trade unions. But the honourable and learned member for Indi has now laid it down, in terms to which I cannot take exception, that the functions which those organizations are permitted to discharge are purely of an industrial character. Nobody has contended for a moment that a trades union should not be permitted to use its organization for any and every such political purpose, so long as it did not attempt to make itself a sort of seed-bed of Socialisma kind of nursery for the espousal, of the nationalization of State industries. tend to that business quite as (veil in their individual capacity. most pronounced individualists in this Parliament, I hail the amendment with confidence, because under its operation the wings of these organizations will be clipped, so as to prevent them being used for unlimited political purposes; and that owing to the efforts of the Labour Party itself.

"" The remuneration of labour ' relates to the 1 wages which a unionist shall be paid. have justified the existence of trades unions for many years. Seventeen years ago, I published a magazine article, a considerable portion of which was devoted to justifying trade unions as a means of dealing-throug h their officers-wit h a large body of men, whom it would be impossible to reach individually. Nobody can object to a trade union maintaining a particular rate of wage, any more than one can object to a bank maintaining its rate of interest, or keeping down its rate of discount. Passing on to the matter of the "" protection of salaries and wages,"" I claim that that constitutes merely a repetition of the same thing. The last words, if I may say so without any warmth, have a somewhat dangerous aspect. Although every lawyer in this House is aware that the doctrine of ejusdem generis, when applied to this provision, would have the effect of limiting irs operation to matters of a kindred nature to those which precede it, it is desirable that the public should understand that the last of this category may be intended as a sort of drag-net to bring in a number of matters which were not included in the preceding paragraphs. As long as it is perfectly clear that it is not intended by paragraph 8, to include matters which are not covered generically by the preceding paragraphs, I shall have no objection. There is one other objection which I am sure that honourable members generally will recognise. general provision, which precedes the category, the phrase, ""The following industrial matters "" is used. ters "" is a term that is defined in the interpretation clause. the Opposition has agreed to strike out the word "" industrial."" objection to the proposal. that I am very glad of the opportunity to convince any one who has any doubt about the matter, that, although I may, at times express myself very emphatically upon industrial questions, I have always been an advocate of trade unionism. desire to see trade unions limited in their functions., as long as they are not used, contemporaneously with their being adopted for the purposes of this measure, and as organizations which non-unionists may have to join, as seed-beds for political purposes, I which have nothing to do with that which I should call legitimate union, work. Subject to that condition, I hail the amendment with pleasure, and I say quite seriously to the leader of the Opposition, that, so far from regarding it as a concession on the part of the Government, or of rabid individualists, I should look upon it as a definition which has a curtailing rather than an extending effect upon the term "" political"" as used in the Bill in which it is to be inserfed. to the remarks made by the Prime Minister, I may say that I have no objection to the elimination of the word "" industrial."" If that be done, it certainly will not limit the operation of the proviso, and it may perhaps prevent any conflict with the term ""industrial matters,"" as defined in clause 4. Coming to paragraph 8, I think that it would perhaps be as well to substitute for the words "" Conditions of labour generally"" the words "" Other conditions similarly affecting employment."" That would remove the objection which has been put forward. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has stated first of all that he regards this amendment as a restriction of the original proposition. Considering that the original proposition, if insisted upon, would have debarred unions from taking part in political agitations of any character, If a i l to see where the restrictive effect of this amendment comes in.

In my experience of unionism, the only men to whom such opprobrious epithets have ever been applied are not the non-unionists as a class, but that particular section who are ready to step in, and accept work under conditions against which unionists are striking. Men who take work in an industry in relation to which there is a strike in progress, have had applied to them by unionists generally such terms as "" scabs "" and ""black-legs,"" as well as other opprobrious epithets. generally are not .of this class. They are men who, from one cause, or another, are not in the ranks of unionism, but who, in the vast majority of cases, are in absolute sympathy with the efforts of unions to tetter the conditions of the working classes. That sympathy is made manifest, not only in the political arena, where, as I'have said, the Labour Party derive the largest proportion of their support from non-unionists, but also in connection with serious labour disputes. When the maritime strike took place, men who had never been organized put their hands in their pockets, and liberally assisted the unionists who were struggling for what they considered to be reasonable conditions of employment. sist the men in Victoria. bulk of non-unionists have always manifested their sympathy with trade unions, and that fact has always been recognised by the unionists themselves.

There is certainly no foundation for the suggestion that our amendment has been put forward merely with a view to em barrass the Government. able member's assurance. sulted the honourable and learned member for Indi as to the form the amendment should take.

The amendment has been submitted with a genuine desire that unionists shall be allowed to take part in legitimate political agitation in political movements in which they have been able to engage for yearsa right of which it would be most improper for us to attempt to deprive them.

He was reminded that the State Government of which the right honourable gentleman was the head did not carry the Eight Hours Bill. through the Lower House. place it on the statute-book. direct the attention of the Prime Minister to one or two inaccuracies in the statement made by him in accepting the amendment. What did the Government do in the first instance? D i d they not propose to accept the amendment as inserted by the Senate? Although the Prime Minister has now accepted the amendment, he had previously the State Parliament. moved that the Committee agree with the amendment of the Senate, which would prevent the members of organizations from exercising the rights which he is now willing to give to them. Therefore, one of two things must have happened. Either he did not give sufficient consideration to the Senate's amendment, or the interest in the unionists and the non-unionists of Australia, which was so prominent a feature in his speech, was created in him very suddenly. I congratulate him upon being able to wheel round so quickly,, and accept an amendment of this kind, after doing all he could to defeat it with a view to the passing of an absolutely contrary proposal. I think that the amendment of the honourable member for Bland will greatly improve the Bill, and will tone down a great deal of the opposition which would otherwise be shown to some of its provisions. The Prime Minister took the various parts of the amendment one by one, and said, in regard to each of them, "" No one can object to this; no one can object to that."" The Opposition never objected to giving the trade unions the fullest opportunity to move for legislation on all these matters. The amendment of the Senate, however, to which the Prime Minister wished the Committee to agree, would have prevented unionists and others from utilizing their funds for political purposes without defining the meaning of those words, and in this way I believe that every union would have been prevented from expending a penny in securing the return of any member of Parliament. ment of the honourable member for Bland, the unions would not be able to spend their money on the employment of Mr Tom Mann as a Socialist lecturer. However, the only way to secure the amelioration of the conditions of the labouring classes is to return to Parliament men who will pass legislation dealing with comso on. If the unionists do what they were told to do when the strikers were being I wish to tried at Deniliquin, they will seek to redress their grievances at the ballot-boxes, and not by strikes, and the amendment of the honourable member for Bland will enable them to do so by allowing them to spend money in securing the return of candidates pledged to advance the subjects named.

We have before us an amendment which will allow industrial organizations to take action in seven specified and one general direction, without being thereby prevented from obtaining preference from the Arbitration Court. It is clear that all the Liberals in this Chamber, I myself amongst them, are full y seized of the advisability of giving unionists the right to endeavour to alleviate the conditions of the working classes in the manner proposed. abundantly clear by the speech of the Prime Minister, which, in my opinion, is the best which has been delivered on this proposal. Until the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable member for Hume, spoke, there was no discordant note amidst the general jubilation with which the amendment was received. But the honourable member for Hume has gone further than any other honourable member who has addressed the Committee on the amendment. He has told us that, under it, the industrial organizations* formed to facilitate the administration of the measure, which non-unionists will be compelled to join because of the preference clause, will be able to declare for what parliamentary candidate their members should vote, and for whose return they will devote their funds. Therefore, under the Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not say that. which I drew from the honourable member's remarks, but if I am wrong I shall be glad to withdraw my statement. I cannot believe that that is the object of the amendment,and therefore I wish to know from the leader of the Opposition if he thinks No t in paying Tom that an industrial organization could devote its funds to these objects. I should like to ask the leader ""of the Opposition, is this : If there are two or more political parties advocating reforms in the eight directions specified in the amendment, does he propose to leave it to the officials of the industrial organizations to say to which of them their funds shall be devoted ? I congratulate the trol over the unions. After fighting would. That is the only objection which I see to the amendment. In itself, it is most praiseworthy. But, if , for the sake of argument, every party in the political arena proposed to forward the objects stated in the amendment, the question would arise, to which of these parties should the funds of the organization be devoted, and the settlement of that question would be in the hands of one or two persons. conclusion. orable member for once in his life is quite correct.

I wish to know whether there is a safeguard in the direction required. exceptional position this evening of having no longer to fight for the political liberties of those whose position was endangered by this clause. It is no longer necessary to point out that honourable members who were ostensibly discussing the preference clause were really discussing the subject now before the Committee, because what they objected to. chiefly was, not the manner prescribed for the determination of the majority affected by an application for preference, but that the men and women who constitute the trade unionists of this country, and who have done so much for the emancipation of their fellows, should be allowed to continue their good work. I hope that the Prime Minister will accept my congratulations on his marvellous conversion in this matter. So sudden a conversion by one holding such a high position was never before seen in the history of this, or any other country in the world. morning sittings. the right honourable gentleman say that. To my mind, the Prime Minister estimated the chances of carrying a motion antagonistic to the proposal now before the Committee, and discovered, on counting heads, that place and power depended on his backing down, because the common sense and justice of honourable members had been appealed to by those who know what the wants of the people are. I take no notice of the attempts of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and his echo, the honourable member for Wentworth, to square their consciences with the acceptance of an amendment against whose jprinciple they have been fighting for weeks and months past. Non-unionists, as well as unionists, have obtained benefits from the efforts of the latter, and I am glad that line ""Prime Minister has now consented to allow them to continue their good work. As a legislative enactment cannot be framed to distinguish between unionists and non-unionists, the Prime Minister is making a virtue of necessity. It is absurd to say that we are backing down because we do not differentiate in this amendment between unionists and non-unionists. All along the line the non-unionists have benefited from the sacrifices made by unionists. The honourable and learned member for Parkes, an aristocrat of the individualistic school, has changed his opinions. He cannot translate himself to this side of the House, and has had to square his views with those of his leader. I sympathize with the honourable and learned member. He certainly is not made of the material which will enable him' to leave the Government side of the House and join those with whom he now professes to be in sympathy. members opposite receive me? the unions, our ranks are open to all. I regret that the honourable and learned member so far forgot his dignity as to make references to certain terms applied in the heat of the debate by some honourable members on this side to non-unionists. Those remarks were directed, not to non-unionists generally, but to those of a certain type who, like criminals, have shown themselves prepared to rob their fellow-men of that which they had acquired by their own labours. It is a slander upon the non-unionists as a class to apply to them the terms which the honourable and learned member has repeated this evening. ber is now referring to them as criminals. only to a certain type of non-unionists. There are good and bad in all sections of the community. Among the members of the profession to which the honourable and learned member belongs there are to be found some of the greatest scabs and blacklegs that ever existed. Whilst we are much indebted to the honourable members who have evolved this amendment, since it will have the effect of rendering the Bill less objectionable, we are also entitled to congratulate ourselves upon the light which the action of the Government throws upon the circumstances which led to the removal of the' late Government from office.

The amendment is not all that I could desire, but I recognise that compromise is a leading principle of politics, and that, so long as we do not sacrifice principles, we are sometimes justified in making concessions to the views of others. Whilst, however, the clause relating' to preference remains in the B ill in its present form, even this concession will not satisfy the unions. I shall vote for the amendment, inasmuch as it affords the best way out of a somewhat difficult position, and reserve to myself the right to exercise my vote at a' later stage in the manner that I think necessary Po conserve the best interests of those I represent. vellous change, the f u l l purport of which I am not yet able to appreciate, has come over the spirit of our dream, and our actualities in the House, since I went to tea. Apparently it is a good thing to go to tea. had been raised by the Minister of Defence as to whether the amendment was in order. point of order has disappeared, and that the Prime Minister has accepted the amendment. I think that that is good work for two short hours. All around me there is a chorus of congratulations upon.the amazing readiness of the Prime Minister to adapt himself to his changing environment, which the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who is a great Spencerian, would tell us is one of the marks of fitness to survive. That organism which can adapt itself to an everchanging environment is the best fitted to survive in this best of all possible world's. learned member looks pleased. look pleased when I find that among the faces around me not one is awry. think, however, that it is not so much the prospect of passing the amendment, as the hope of reaching home for Christmas, that is casting a beautiful halo over everything. AlthoughI may look' pleased, I am yet in some doubt as to whether this amendment will accomplish all that is claimed for it. When one considers the readiness with which honourable members who have never shown any leaning in our direction have adopted tha amendment, and the amazing unanimity with which they are now smiling a cheerful acquiescence, such a doubt is excusable. learned member is a little suspicious. son to be. I should like to ask those smiling gentlemen opposite in what way the unions can do all these things which are set forth in the details of the amendment. Would it ibe competent for a union to contribute towards the expenses of a candidate who pledged himself to support proposals in the directions indicated? other proposals as well. stand that the powers of the unions under this amendment are to be limited to political action only in cases where a candidate advocates only these matters set forth in the amendment? What appears to me to be obvious is, as the honourable member for Gwydir said, that we already enjoy the rights which it is proposed with this flourish of trumpets to confer upon us. Every union has the right to agitate for the improvement of the conditions of employment, When I left the Chamber a question and, so far as I know, has always claimed the right to exercise it . The method which they generally adopt is to Upon my return I find that the send out a circular letter, or to ask a candidate, either publicly or privately-, whether he is in favour of such and such a thing which the union desires to see brought about. If the candidate is favorable to the views of the union, and he is the only one among those who represent themselves who leans in that direction, it would appear to be the obvious and undeniable duty of the union to support that man. the view taken by the union which would it support? We are all agreed as to the course that should be adopted in the case of only one It is impossible not to candidate being favorable to the aspirations of the union. I are not the Court. able members may not be members of the Court, I should like to know their opinions as to the effect of this amendment. I think we have every right to know exactly how far it is intended that the amendment shall go. If there be only one candidate in favour of a particular proposal, everything will be clear; but if there be two or more entertaining the same views, I desire to know what will be the position of the union.

What would be the position if some member of the union then moved that £ 1 0 be devoted towards defraying Smith's election expenses. Could that be done under the amendment? been done even without the amendment. phatic. The proviso to that clause readsProvided no such organization shall be entitled to any declaration of preference when, and so long as, its rules or other binding decisions permit of the application of its funds to political purposes. I take it that the amendment of the leader of the Opposition does not deprive the words which I have just read of the limitation which they impose upon the clause. When a proviso limits the effect of a clause, and, later on, some powers are, by exception, taken from the proviso, all the matters which are not specifically mentioned in the exception are still forbidden by it. That is the rule generally applied to the interpretation of a statute. Consequently, it would seem that as the expenditure of fund's under this provision for certain purposes is forbidden, and as in the exception to the proviso-whic h is what the amendment of the honqrable member for Bland practically amounts to-powe r is not given to expend funds in that direction, funds may not be so expended. Therefore, the rights of unions are limited, so far as their action in this particular direction is concerned'. tended. to me clear that the effect of the amendment of the honourable member for Bland is to confer upon them the power to do certain things. But it does not provide them with the means with which to do them. Andi f what I have said be true regarding the words dealing with the application of funds, it is also true regarding the other part of the proviso which refers to organizations of a political character. ""political character"" is defined as not including certain matters. But as those in themselves are of no value if the method by which alone they are to be obtained is barred, I have serious doubts whether the amendment means anything at all. Nobody can predict how far the Arbitration Court will say that it extends. We must be glad that we live in a time when fixity of principles is no longer regarded as the mark of a great man, and when that politician is considered the nearest approach to a statesman who can, within half-an-hour, make such a volte face as we have seen to-riight, and find himself supported by the whole of that gallant, but It might possibly have rather discordant dishevelled phalanx which sits behind him. that the Government have accepted the amendment. From the beginning, I failed to see any objection to allowing trade unions to agitate politically for a direct amelioration of the conditions surrounding the employment of their members. I did object, however, to compelling men to subscribe to funds which, were devoted to that purpose. However beneficent the object may be, I hold that men ought not to be obliged to subscribe to it. I regret that the Committee did not accept the amendment which I submitted upon a previous occasion. Personally, I am of opinion that it is a great mistake to endeavour to ban expressions of opinion of any character. 1"" assure the honourable and learned member for Indi that there has been no .change, at all events, in my attitude upon this question. learned member would increase the list of subjects contained in the amendment? clause is as clear as it ought to be.

Why not allow members of organizations to agitate directly ? The Bill impliedly recognises the right of members of trade unions to agitate politically for the direct amelioration of their conditions ? I cannot see any logic in saying that whilst we 'approve of the right to agitate by allowing unions to become organizations, we shall not permit them to agitate directly. What we really should do is to define "" political' purposes ' ' to mean ""industrial matters."" The latter term includes all matters relating to work, pay, hours, privileges, &c.

I do not object to the amendment, but I do object to forcing men by means of a preference to subscribe, whether they like it or not, to trade unions. Upon the whole, I welcome the amendment as a concession in principle to the desire of some honourable members, that unionists should be allowed as hitherto to agitate for a change in the conditions of labour in the direction contemplated by the appointment of an Arbitration Board. morrow morning the people of Australia will be rather dumfounded when they read the utterances of the honourable and learned member for Parkes. I am pleased that in him we have a convert who has informed us to-night for the first time that he is in favour of everything which is contained in this amendment.

The provisions of that Act have been conveniently summarized by one of the leading local manufacturing firms for the ready comprehension of their employees. The following is that summary : "" No one under thirteen can be employed in a factory. No female can work more than forty-eight hours in a week. No male under sixteen can work more than forty-eight hours in a week. No girl under sixteen can be employed between the hours of six in the evening and six in the morning."" it.

The words of the song, "" Not understood,"" must often have occurred to you, Mr Chairman, during this debate.

There has been a misunderstanding, but now we are all in agreement, though we discovered the fact but an hour or two ago. The supporters of the Government desire that the unions registered under the Bill shall be primarily industrial, not political and shall be used to t ameliorate the conditions of the people and improve the lot, not of a small section, but of the great' body of the community. We have discovered now that we are in agreement with honourable members opposite on that subject too. They also now believe that the benefits of the measure should be given to the whole of the people, and not to a limited section of the community, so that there has been another misunderstanding in that case. I should not have risen to speak had not one or two honourable members appeared to be astonThose who ished at the action of the Prime Minister in accepting this new-born baby around which we are all clustering, f u l l of hope and satisfaction. When the leader of the Opposition offered it to him, he would have been justified in remembering that it is dangerous to trust the Greeks, even when they come bearing g if t s ; but he did not show any distrust, nor make any Cassandralike cry. He paused for a moment or two to see whether the baby was in order, and, having discovered that it had none of the No ailments to which children are frequently subject, that it had not the thrush or appendicitis, although the investigation may have While disclosed a Semitic origin, he received it into the bosom of the party. I make these remarks to show how unreasonable some honourable members are. The head of the Government did no more than any person would have done in social life. He merely saw that the child was reasonably satisfactory before receiving it into the home circle. It is a matter for regret that during these debates honourable members have not shown a little more consideration for one another. Now that honourable members opposite realize that we are prepared to go as far as we can in the direction of real reform, they should withdraw some of the undesirable but characteristic statements which they have made, with the obWe on this side ject of prejudicing us. We felt all through that the progress of the country depended, not upon any class or sect, nor upon our legislating in favour of minorities, but upon our passing laws in the interests of the whole of the people. We know how our forefathers had to fight against the privileged classes, and yet in the twentieth century we have been asked to set up another privileged class, which desires to govern -the masses of the community. Our refusal to do this has been the cause of difference in regard to the matter now under consideration. Now that the golden gates have been opened, through which every man can. march unmolested to his labour, and without being compelled to belong to any organization created to advance the interests of any small section, harmony should prevail, and it might be acknowledged that each side of the House has been misunderstood by the other.

The Judges advised us from the bench to seek our remedy through the Legislatures. Now that we have made our organizations so strong that we have compelled our political opponents to swallow the principles of a lifetime, an attempt is being made to deprive us of some of our most valued privileges. In Australia, and in other parts of the world, the two antagonistic forces of labour and capital are struggling with all their might to obtain the upper hand, and we cannot afford to consent to any legislation which will have the effect of rendering our organizations less powerful or effective than they are to-day. Our principal means of achieving our ends is political action, and I object to limitations such as those which would be imposed under the amendment. There are many.matters upon which the trade unions should be free to take action other than those which would be embraced by the provisions of .the amendment. WhilstI admit that the amendment will to some extent minimize the injustice which would have been done to unionists, it will still involve a large surrender of their powers. I was very pleased to hear the statement of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that the trade unions will not be affected unless they register themselves as organizations for the purposes of the Bill. measure will not interfere with our organizations, because they will refuse to come under its operation. The Bill was introduced in this Chamber, in the first instance, for the purpose of tiding over an industrial difficulty, but it has now assumed such a shape that it will prove a curse, because it will deprive the organizations which avail themselves of its machinery of their liberty of political action. They will have no power to combat the operations of the large trusts and i combines which are now operating to the t serious prejudice of the workers, and which, in other countries, are grinding them down I represent organizations which have to the depths of slavery, and I cannot, Many therefore, place the stamp of my approval upon any such legislation. ings in this Committee this evening have been of a memorable character.

Honourable members . opposite started with a determination to secure unlimited preference to unionists. If that demand had been conceded, the unions would have become an immense political power, and the Bill would have -been used as an instrument for capturing the whole legislative forces of the Commonwealth. Having been defeated upon that point, honourable members shifted their ground, and desired to secure unqualified political power for the organizations registered under the Bill.

Believing that the whole effectiveness of the measure will be impaired by this provision, it is impossible for me to take the responsibility of recommending it to the electors. I am of opinion that it will tie absolutely ineffective, owing to the restrictions imposed upon the granting of preference. I am f u l ly convinced that with those restrictions it cannot achieve the object for which it was originally put forward, and consequently I cannot recommend anybody outside of this House to place any faith in it. At the same time. I do not feel inclined to object to the adoption of the report, because the Senate has yet to consider the Bill in the form in which it is returned by this Chamber, and it is just possible that it may hit upon some method of regulating the granting of a preference which will meet the objections of honourable members opposite. In that hope I am quite prepared to agree to the adoption of the report. matter is that for those who desire a Bill of this sort at all, it would be a great advantage to have on the Statute-book the foundation for a system of arbitration. If , as the result of an appeal to the electors, it transpired that we were wrong, and that the Opposition was right in the position taken up by us with respect to the three or member think that that has anything to do four serious matters on which we differ, it with the question before the Chair? would be infinitely more easy for my honourable friends-provide d they commanded the support of a majority of the electorsto give effect to the views they have at heart but I am endeavouring to follow the lines by amending a measure which was already in adopted by the Prime Minister.

I totally disagree with the suggestion of the Prime Minister, that this B ill would lay the foundation of a whole system of arbitration, and I very much regret that in passing this legislation we are about to set a very bad example to the States Parliaments. This Parliament has been elected 'upon the broadest possible franchise, and as it has been elected by a democratic people, its legislation ought certainly to be democratic. Nevertheless it has imposed restrictions upon the self-government of industrial organizations that are not to be found in any of the State legislation on the subject. These restrictions, to my mind, must retard the whole movement of trade unionism. Every one must admire the heroic struggle which trade unions have made to secure better conditions for the workers. not clear as to the limits of this debate, -",79,Smith The Y Are Using Or The Mode Terms And Conditions Of Employ

I deny that there is any attempt to coerce men to join unions, or that labour members seek to control such bodies. The idea is absurd. tion? honourable member is going beyond the matter before the Chair. The question before us is whether the report of the Committee shall be agreed to. That report covers the decisions of the Committee on the four amendments which came to us from another place. Any discussion which bears upon either one of those amendments, or the whole of them, would be in order; but any debate on the general aspect of the measure will not be in order. discussion is wide enough to allow me to clearly explain my position. I have not spoken since certain amendments have been under consideration, and I do not wish it to be understood that my silence means approval of the decision of the Committee. I have, from the very outset, taken a great interest in this measure, and I wish to clearly define my attitude. An effort has -been made in the most unfair way to interfere with the operations of trade unions, and I hold that as the result of the passing of this measure, the work of these admittedly noble institutions will be hampered. I am opposed to the restrictions which have been imposed. Trade unions have always clone their very best for all persons engaged in the industries which they represent. HenceI say that the limitations which have been imposed will retard the whole movement for the betterment of the conditions of the workers. The measure will not be found satisfactory, and I throw upon the' Government the whole responsibility for it. It is true that they have not been in charge of the Bill from the outset; but the Government in office, when it is finally passed, must bear the whole responsibility, because they need not have taken it up in the condition in which they found it. I refuse to accept the responsibility of being a party to the adoption of certain of these clauses. I accepted one amendment because it was the best we could get; but I feel satisfied that the measure, as a whole, will be unsatisfactory, and I wish to enter an emphatic protest against it. the vote is taken, I wish to say that I shall vote against-the adoption of the report, because I believe that it relates to certain clauses which will destroy the effectiveness of the Bill. I believe, that unionists in coming under this measure, will be making, a great sacrifice in the interests of industrial peace, and that they will not receive anything like the return which they are entitled to expect. They are entitled to receive full preference in compensation for the sacrifices they are making, and it was the general idea of the framers of the Bill that that should be extended to them. The refusal of the Committee to grant it, is one reason why I shall vote against the adoption of the report. I shall vote against it because I am also opposed to class legislation of the kind of which a major ity of the Committee has approved in trying to exempt certain sections of the community, namely, the agricultural labourers and the domestic servants, whose present position is little better than slavery, from the operation of the measure. I am also opposed to it because it attempts to take from organizations the right which they have enjoyed for many years past to use political influence for the redress of grievances. The workers have been continually urged to take that course, but the Bill practically prevents them from doing so. Having stated the reasons why I cannot support the measure, I shall content myself with voting against it. at the last elections opposed the measure, I feel that I owe it to my constituents, as well as to the House, to explain my reasons for the course which I now propose to pursue. I do not intend to state now the reasons which actuated me in opposing the Bill, because I set them out fully in my second-reading speech. Some of those reasons have disappeared, because of the amendments which have been made in the measure. It has, however, been borne in upon me during the ten months that we have been in session, in which period we have been engaged chiefly on this measure, that there is a very strong majority in this Chamber and in the country who desire to have the Bill passed into law, and I can see that if I were to exhibit the spirit of factious opposition which has been displayed by honourable members opposite, I should not be advancing the cause of my constituents.",80,Smith The Y Are Using Or The Mode Terms And Conditions Of Employ

I have already shown pretty plainly that I cannot vote for a Bill which takes from the unionists rights and privileges which have been given to them by State laws. I have not changed, my opinion, but the Bill is taking from the unionists rights which they have enjoyed ever since we obtained constitutional government, although by means of a compromise we have got back some of these rights. I am opposed to the Bill as amended, because it does not give preference and full political liberty to unionists, and therefore I shall vote against it being placed on the Statute-book. opposition to the adoption of the Committee's report on the rejection of the Senate's amendment relating to preference. I had anticipated that the Bill would be fairer to those who will be called upon to assist in its administration by carrying out the award of the Court, but, seeing that the results which we hope for cannot be obtained, I shall vote against the motion. of the Government in connection with the Senate's amendments leads me to take a pretty serious stand at this stage. I anticipated that the proposals of the Senate, in regard to the inclusion of farm labourers and domestic servants, and the removal of the workable restrictions placed on the granting of preference, would have been accepted by the Government in a spirit of compromise. They have, however, disagreed with all three amendments, and I understand that they accepted a part of the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, enlarging the political freedom of unionists, only when they found that a number of members would leave their ranks and vote against them if they did not. the' Bill requires too great a sacrifice from those who were primarily responsible for its introduction-the trade unionists of this country. I believe that after another ejection or two at most, with their present freedom unrestricted they will be able to exercise their political influence to such good effect that a majority will be returned here, who will place upon the Statute-book a measure which will not unduly interfere with their liberties as this measure would do. member will be a conservative by that time. as conservative as the right honourable member is. .1 have heard .honourable members opposite say that they do not believe in arbitration, and are opposed to every word in the Bill. Some of those on this side are now giving them an opportunity to express their disgust at the proposal to place such a measure on the Statute-book. We shall see whether they will have the courage 'to vote against the adoption of the Committee's report, or whether they will consider the Bill sufficiently mutilated and party ties will prove too strong for them. understand the feelings which actuate those who intend to vote against the adoption of the report, because I myself have'frequently felt inclined to vote against a measure which I was afraid would be of no service in bringing about industrial peace, seeing that the unions would not register under it.' Now that the amendment of the honourable member for Bland has been accepted, however, I am prepared to send the Bill back to the Senate, hoping that we have not yet reached the final stage in its consideration. There will still be an opportunity to reject it if no further improvement is made. it clear that the Bill does not meet my ideas of what an Arbitration Bill should be. In my opinion, the clause providing for preference is unworkable. I wish the Government had met us in regard to that clause as they have done in regard to clause 55. I understand, however, that no great credit is due to them for accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, because they did so only when they knew that three or four of their supporters would vote for it. accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, I did not know how my supporters were going to vote in regard to it.

I move That the Committee's reasons be adopted. make our position clear by dividing the House on the motion. point out that the Senate is waiting to receive this message before it adjourns. The reasons stated are those of honourable members who voted against the Senate's amendments. Speaker, if the reasons can be submitted separately ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume) I understood the Prime Minister to read a statement to the effect that an amendment could not be seriously considered. is that the likelihood of a dispute affecting domestic servants extending beyond the borders of any one State could not be seriously regarded.

Minister has recovered from his pique order. The honourable member for Kennedy has been upon his feet three times in connection with these reasons. In the first place, he inquired how they should be put. Since then, he has made a speech. He broke off from that speech, and is now making another. In view ofl the fact that you, sir, would not allow the Prime Minister to say a word! in explanation, I claim that the member for Kennedy is out of order. ber has misunderstood the position. In the first place, the Ffonoraole member for Kennedy asked-as he liad a perfect right to do-upo n a point of order, whether the reasons could be put separately from the Chair. When such a request is made, it is obligatory under our Standing Orders that the questions shall be put separately. Then, the honourable member commenced his speech, intimating that he had not distinctly heard the reasons when they were first read. Thereupon, I directed the Clerk to read them, and after that had been done, I allowed the honourable member to continue his speech. honourable member for Parramatta has compelled me to make a fourth speech. I object to the reasons advanced in the message for the exclusion of agricultural labourers from the operation of this Bill.

Further, I oppose the reasons embodied in the message, because they do not convey to the Senate what is really at the root of this legislation, namely, the fact that it is class legislation. I much time in placing my views before the House"", because the majority of honourable members are opposed to me. Nevertheless, I think that the opinions of the majority should be couched in such terms able member. be couched in such language as would not be calculated to mislead. Minister has declared that the reasons embodied in the message are only those of the Government. I would point out, however, that when they reach the Senate they will be regarded .as the reasons advanced by this House. I object to the statement contained in reason No. 1, because there is no evidence to show that the conditions of the farm labourers vary in the different States. I deny that the conditions surroundJohnson, W. E. ing their employment vary even as much as do the conditions in other industries. In any case, that is not a sufficient reason Knox, W. for refusing to accept the amendment relating to them. vernment have other reasons for adopting this course. There is no reason why farm labourers should not be -brought under the control of the Court in the same way as are other workers. The same remark will apply to domestic servants. The maritime dispute of 1891 extended to various unions, and there is no reason why a dispute among domestic servants should not extend beyond the limits of any one State. The conditions under which domestic servants are called upon to labour are practically similar in all parts of the Commonwealth. Take the position of domestic servants in hotels. are not excluded from the operation of this measure; it is only domestic servants in private employemnt who are shut out. agree with the exclusion of farm labourers and domestic servants. I hold that no one Consequently, I claim who can be reasonably brought within the provisions of the Bill, should be excluded from it, and that the reasons proposed to be given for the exclusion of these persons are not correct. I . do not know of any debate which has taken place in this House that would support the giving of these reasons. The Government realize that it is idle to occupy think that because certain workers are not organized, they never will be; but that merely shows that they know very little about trade unionism.

Last week I promised the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and others to provide statutory power in the Governor General to appoint a commander of the troops in time of war, instead of leaving the power to be exercised, as at present, under prerogative. In pursuance of that promise, 1 had inserted, while the Bill was before the Senate, an amendment providing that the Governor General should be empowered to "" appoint an officer or officers of the Defence Force to command the whole or any portion of the Defence Force in time of war."" In the next place, I promised that provision should be made for securing the seniority of the Inspector-General. Accordingly an amendment was made in the Senate providing that the Inspector-General and the Director of the Naval Forces"" shall have such seniority and powers as may be prescribed,"" the words ""seniority and"" being inserted. In the Senate, there was also inserted the words "" or performed "" after the word "" exercise"" in a place where those words did not appear, although they occurred in other portions of the measure. In omitting the words "" General Officer Commanding "" in one clause, the word "" the "" was not also honourable members if necessary. But we omitted, and an amendment in the Senate has put that matter right. Those are the whole of the amendments made by the Senate, and to enable me to take steps to put the scheme in operation at the earliest date, I ask honourable members to deal with them to-night.
