It has been a difficulty to me all along, because notwithstanding strict inquiry, it has been found in all these coses that the persons presenting themselves are British subjects, to whom, as I have often explained, no Act of State will apply.

Clausei The immigration into tlie Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs of this section (hereinafter called "" prohibited immigrants"") is prohibited, namely :(a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out and sign in the presence of the officer u passage of fifty words in length in the English language dictated by the officer ; -> (l>) an3' person likely in ""the opinion of the Minister or of an officer to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable institution ; (a) any idiot or insane person ; (rf) any person suffering from an infectious or contagious disease of a loathsome or dangerous character; (e) any person who has within three years been convicted of an offence, not being a mere political offence, and has been sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer there for, and has not received a pardon ; (/') auy prostitute or person living on the prostitution of others. But the following are excepted :(;/) Any person possessed of a certificate of exemption in force for the time being in the form of the Second Schedule, signed by the Minister or by any officer appointed under this Act, whether within or without the Commonwealth ; {h) members of the King's land or sea forces; (j) the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government; (ji) the master and crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel in any port in the Commonwealth : Provided that the master shall upon being so required by any officer, and before being permitted to clear out from or leave the port, muster the crew in the presence of an officer; and if it is found that any person, who according to the vessel's articles was one of the crew when she arrived at the port, and who would in the opinion of the officer, be a prohibited immigrant, but for the exception contained in this paragraph, is not present, then such person shall not be excepted by this paragraph, and until tlie contrary is proved shall be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant and to have entered the Commonwealth contrary to this Act. (it) any person duly accredited to the Government of the Commonwealth by the Imperial or any other Government . or sent by any Government on any special mission ; (/) a wife accompanying her husband if he is not a prohibited immigrant, and all children apparently under the age of eighteen years accompanying their father or mother if the father or mother is not a prohibited immigrant ; but so that the exceptions in this paragraph shall not apply if suspended by proclamation ; and such suspension may be of general application or limited to any cases or class of cases ; (m) Any person who satisfies an officer that he has formerly been domiciled in the Commonwealth or in aivy colony which has become a State. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I move That the words ""the English,"" line 8, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" an European."" I had intended at one time to alter this amendment so as to make the clause read "" in tlie English or any prescribed"" language, in order to meet objections that had been raised by the Japanese Consul and other Japanese who have been visitingus. I find, however, that five of the States already have in operation Acts containing a provision similar to the clause as I propose to amend it . The intention is that if any intending immigrant can write the words selected by the Customs officer in any European language, he will be permitted to enter tlie Commonwealth. I have said that I desire in no way to offend the Japanese. I quite recognise the class of j>eople they are, and I also realize the advantagewhich is likely to result to the Commonwealth from trade and commerce with them. They have developed a very considerable trade with us lately j they have their steamers coming here regularly, and they have lately sent experts here with a view to purchasing our wool and to generally developing trade with the Commonwealth. That is what every one in this House must wish to see; but, whilst I am desirous to meet the Japanesei n every way, I feel that we could not possibly accede to their suggestion that the Japanese language should be one of those in which the test may be made. If that were yielded, there would be nothing whatever to prevent large numbers of Japanese from coming into the States. I am at one with the whole of the members of this Housei n desiring that the Japanese should not come here in large numbers, and I agree thoroughly with the desire that we should have a white Australia, although I think, with the honourable and learned member for Parkes, that a very ' great deal more has been made out of the danger to the Commonwealth through alien immigration than is warranted by the circumstances. laws are quite sufficient to prevent our being seriously contaminated by an influx of aliens, and yet if the proposal to pass fresh legislation had been brought forward as a protection to labour, I would have been one of the first to support it. I recoguise that if Japanese can come here in any large number, they will compete at low rates with white labour, and I will be no party to that. On the other hand, so far as tbe tropical parts of our Commonwealth are concerned, I will not join in shutting out those who have come here to carry out industries which would never have been developed or have reached their present state of prosperity, except by means of alien labour. I , therefore, differentiate between the conditions that have to beconsidered in the tropical parts of the Commonwealth and those in the Southern States. trade of Japan with tbe Commonwealth amount to 1 trade of Japan with us is a very considerable one, and it is proposed to double tbe number of steamers now trading to Australia. They already have a regular line of steamers, but whatever the trade may be now, it is the future that we have to look to, because we know that when trade is once opened up between two great countries, it will develop very rapidly. Apart from that, the mere fact of these Japanese steamers coming here results in a large amount of employment being given to white people, and our commercial intercourse with Japan should certainly be fostered in every way possible. I do not wish to make a second reading speech, but simply to submit my amendment to the committee. intention to support the amendment, but as there is some doubt as to how it may be interpreted, I would ' ask the Attorney General whether intending immigrants will be required to pass a test in their own language, or whether the Customs officer will have the right to say what European language shall be selected ? worth) -It is desirable that a reply should be given to the question asked by the honourable member for Oxley, which is a 15 Y 2 very important one, namely, whether the Customs officer should have the right, say in I feel that our present the case of'a German, to select the French or the Russian language for the purposes of tbe test 1 I take it that all these things must be governed by regulation, but the clear and honest understanding is that, since we do not desire to keep out educated and reputable Europeans, no European shall be asked to write 50 words in any language but bis own. External Affairs) I may say at once that there is no desire on the part of the Government to keep out educated or reputable Europeans, and I do not think that that is the wish of any section of this House. If the honourable member will look at other parts of the Bill he will see, first, that tbe dictation is not to be set to the immigrant unless the officer asks that it should be. These tests will be applied under Ministerial authority, and with a dedoes the sire that the purposes of this Act shall be carried out, excluding that' class of immigrants who are, by the common consent of this House, considered to be undesirable. Apart from that there is no desire to keep out Europeans of reputable character. I do not think it is the intention of the Commonwealth to commit itself to any such action at the present time, but as to those undesirable immigrants, who have been the subject of discussion in the House and in despatches, it is the intention of the Government to make the exclusion as perfect as possible. To put an illustration : If a Swede were asked to write a passage at dictation, I should not dream of instructing the officer to subject the immigrant to a test in Italian. That would be unfair, and is not what this House has in its mind in passing this legislation. I think this statement will be sufficient to clear up any doubts that may exist. Honourable members may rely upon it that this Act will not be worked unfairly or oppressively in regard to those whom it is not our common desire to exclude, but that every care will be taken to prevent its being defeated by those whom we desire to keep out.

MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I wish to point out that there is a large number of Europeans who are desirous of coming here, but under the conditions which it is now proposed to impose, they will not know whether they will be admitted or not t ill after their arrival. Some of these men have made good citizens in the past, and have very materially assisted in building up the Commonwealth. I think there should be some distinct understanding as to tbe exact position which they occupy. It would be a very serious matter indeed for a man from any European country, after selling up his home and paying his passage to Australia, to be debarred from entering the Commonwealth. It would be far better for the Government to adopt the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Oxley, and provide for a purely European language test. I should like to understand distinctly whether it is the intention of the Prime Minister that the officer, acting under Ministerial authority, shall have the option of selecting the language in which the immigrant is to be examined, and whether the House, must trust the Minister that the officer will select a proper language for the intending immigrant. I ask this question because the honourable member for Melbourne appears to have an opposite intention. with the statement of the Prime Minister. wrong, but I understood that the honourable member wished to leave it to the immigrant to say in what language he should be examined. no such intention. The Prime Minister means that the officer shall have the selection. will be instructed. MV. HIGGINS -The meaning of the words, I think, is clearly that the officer can dictate such language as he thinks fit. I understood that the honourable member for Melbourne wished the immigrant, and not the officer, to have the selection of the language in which the former should undergo the test. As these words stand, I think they mean that the officer can examine the intending immigrant in any language which he thinks fit. The Prime Minister appealed to the committee to trust the Minister and the officer not to apply the Italian language, for example, to a Swede, or the Swedish language to an Italian. and learned member can trust us to do that. stand whether it is to be left to the officer to select the language in which the immigrant shall be examined, so that the latter cannot say to him "" I want to be examined in Italian,"" or "" I want to be examined in Swedish."" Then again, I cannot see how the Prime Minister proposes to overcome the irritation which we have been warned will be caused to Japan by excluding the Japanese language and including ""any European language."" the difficulty. thing has been made clear by the Japanese authorities lately, it is that they do not object to the English, language being prescribed as a test, as all foreigners would then be included in the same category, but that they do object to any European language being prescribed unless the words "" or Japanese,"" are also added. that. under this law for some time. mittee to be seized of the two points to which I have directed attention before voting upon this matter. I have no objection to the option of selecting any European language being left with the person who is desirous of entering the Commonwealth, but I cannot see what advantage there is to be gained in the way of propitiating Japan by confining tbe selection to EuropeanB u t the officer languages. why there should be all this fencing over the question of who is to be admitted, and who is to be excluded by the adoption of the European language test.

34,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I cannot seegood scholar in order to be a good workman, a good gardener, or a good agriculturalist. Every one who comes from the old country knows that nine-tenths of the agricultural population of Great Britain are uneducated, and if we asked some of those people to write out 50 words from dictation in their own language it would be impossible for them to do it . The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Bland was the only true solution of this difficulty. What is the use of fencing? Our desire is to exclude the coloured man, and yet it is now proposed to make the test one in any European language. best citizens of Queensland, of whom that State to-day is justly proud, would have been unable successfully to emerge from the test which is now proposed. Under this amendment we shall exclude the very men whose presence here we desire to encourage. We wish to exclude the coloured man, and yet all sorts of fencing is apparently to be indulged i u simply because we do not wish to offend the susceptibilities of the Japanese, the Chinese, or the Assyrians. I credit the Government with perfect sincerity in this matter. They have shown us that they wish to do something to overcome an admitted e v i l ; but how they are going to surmount the difficulty which is now presented, I cannot Germans who would come here, and who would make good colonists. If we put the test to them, somebody might say they were undesirable immigrants; and what would be the consequence t As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Kennedy, these people may have sold their homes and everything they possessed in order to come out here to start anew, and if this test were applied they would be taken back on the ship to the port from whence they came, and left, probably, in dire poverty and distress. There is not a member of the House-no t even the member for Melbourne, with all his conservative ideas-wh o would like to see that; yet that is what the amendment aims at. We might as well say straight out that we want to get rid of the coloured man, and do it without fencing in the way we are fencing now. All the language tests that can be devised will not stop the evil. whether the Government are prepared to accept the amendment, though I understand that they are. The working of the amendment will depend entirely on administration, and the more honourable members look at the matter, the more they will see that it is likely to give rise to a lot of trouble, difficulty, and danger that might very easily have been avoided. For instance, a shipload of desirable immigrants might arrive and, owing to some misunderstanding on the part of the Customs officer, might have a prohibitory test of 50 words applied. That would cause a lot of annoyance to the nation to which they belonged, and complaints would be lodged with the consul of their nation-that is not at all unlikely Many of the to happen. Whilst we have a number of excellent men in the public service, some of them have made mistakes in the past, and are likely to make mistakes in this connection. I trust the committee will not agree to leave it to the immigrant to prescribe the language. If that be done we shall have to admit Chinese, Zulus, and other coloured men who have acquired a knowledge of English; and the Japanese, who are being taught English, and are quick to learn, will acquire sufficient knowledge to secure their admission. That would defeat the object we have in view. It seems to me that the position the Government are going to take up is that they will keep in their own hands, under administration, not understand. There are plenty of only the language that has to be dictated, but the decision whether or not the test shall be applied. I understand that if a shipload, or only a few immigrants, from any European nation, which is not regarded as undesirable, arrive here, tbe test will not be applied at all. I should like to know whether that is so or not. If it is not so, the difficulty referred to arises, of possible objection to people to whom hitherto we have not objected. If the Government do not intend to apply the test to such people, but intend to apply it to immigrants from other parts of the world, it is the duty of the Government, through their consuls, or through Mr Chamberlain, in some way to let the nations concerned know of our intention. If we do not let our intention be known, we shall have a number of aliens coming here, as they are reported to have gone to Natal to the number of 200. These people were refused admission to Natal, and will, no doubt, go back to their homes with a grievance against the Government of that colony. If a shipload of similar immigrants come to Australia, and are refused admission, they will go back with a",18,Paper
35,Mr Spence (Darling),"I do not knowsubstantial grievance, because of our not letting their Government know that, no matter what language they possess, they will not be admitted. The amendment really leads to the same difficulty that it was claimed would arise if we had passed the amendment rejected by the committee a few days ago. Undoubtedly we shall be acting unjustly to Japan, China, and other nations, unless we tell them straight out that no matter what their people do they will not be admitted. We should state distinctly what we. really mean. There appears to be some confusion, and it is right that we should understand how this clause is to be worked-whethe r the immigrant, the Customs officer, or the Minister is to have the choice of tlie language in which the test is applied. Unless we understand that, we shall be voting for something which may prove a great failure; and, personally, I feel that the provision will make a great deal more trouble than if we had said straight out at the beginning that we were not going to admit these people. By adopting the indirect way proposed, we shall cause difficulty and cast discredit on nations with which we have no quarrel. New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand contains a direction similar to that in the amendment, and it has not been found to cause trouble in any one of these places. If it were to cause trouble iu the Commonwealth of all places in the world, and nowhere else, that would be a very strange result. I take it that this Bill will be administered with a certain amount of discretion ; but the Ministry, and no officer, must be responsible for its administration. On the other hand, nobody who presents himself as an immigrant can be entitled to choose for himself the method of the administration of the Act. What will be done will be this. The officer will receive certain instructions; and if the Government cannot be trusted to carry out this measure in good faith with the Housei f no Government can be trusted to do so -then , of course, it is-uot much use having a Government at all. Buti f a certain amount of discretion is allowed to the Government, it will be exercised in this way. instructions, which will be sufficiently f u l l and explanatory, and it will be for him to choose and apply, and not for the immigrant to choose, the test. A t the same time, care will be taken to see that the officer does not apply any test in those cases in which it is not desirable to apply it . In regard to that class of immigration which is desirable, no test will be applied at all. We all understand the class of immigration which is desirable, and that which is not ; and the officer will have full instructions on this subject. He will have instructions not to place any apparently desirable immigrants under any condition of hardship whatever. There is no danger to the class of immigrants referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa that class who have done so much good in the past in Australia. There will not be the slightest danger of their being shut out, even if they have not much knowledge or learning. We all understand to whom the measure is to apply. There will not be the least bother about tbe matter, and, as I have explained over and over again, the test will be applied, if carried in the sense the House understands, with a due sense of my relation of good faith and confidence with the House. I may be trusted to administer the measure, and it is not desirable to bandy too many words about it , either on my part, or -n the part of anybody else. The whole administration of the measure will be perfectly understood long before it is passed. In the first place, ship-owners, who are in the habit of bringing out all classes of labour, desirable or undesirable, will perfectly understand the discussions which are reported in the newspapers every day. In the second place, the consuls of all the powers receive copies of Hansard, and know what we declare in this House. I am not going to send a circular to the agent of every Government, or to every Government, because their representatives know perfectly well what we mean, from the records of our debates and proceedings. As to the word "" European,"" I have already stated several times that this test, in its application under tbe powers of the measure, would not so seriously differ from the proposal in the Bill as it now stands as to induce me to make any bones about accepting the amendment. I shall accept the amendment. I can only give the committee my assurance The officer in each place will receive that the Ministry have every intention of keeping their word to the House in the operation of the measure. As to the Bill not operating, we have five places in which it operates successfully; and, as to the",19,Paper
36,Mr Barton,"The legislation of Natal,danger of the automatic exclusion of desirable immigrants, I have only again to refer honourable nembers to the words in the clause, ""when asked to do so."" MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I regret that I shall have to oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne, not because I do not think it is desirable in one sense, but because the Prime Minister has said he is prepared not to enforce any language test with people who are desirable. It seems to me that if we change the test from the English language to a European language, we are offering a direct insult to Japan. member allow me to make a further explanation upon that point? Representations have been made to us that we ought to add the words "" or Japanese."" I find that the test which is proposed in this amendment has found its way into all the legislation carried on the subject, although the -word "" English"" has been put into some of the Bills which have not yet become law. The proposed words have been in the legislation which has been carried, and have not been made the subject of any protest whatever. We have no indication from anyquarter. -whethe r from the Imperial Government or any other authority--that there is anything in this word ""European"" that would complicate any of the relations of the Empire whatever. Upon that understanding, and knowing that it has not been the subject of complaint in the past, and that it has worked well, I am not disposed to accept the suggestion either to add the word "" Japanese,"" or to forbid myself from accepting the amendment which has been proposed. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am pleased that the Prime Minister has made that explanation, but at the same time the Japanese representative in Australia only lately declared that he was thoroughly satisfied provided that wecarried the test proposed -the writing of 50 words of English-and that then no insult would be offered. But if we now change to the word "" Eu ropean"" without putting in the Japanese language, we must feel, no matter how we disguise it , that in some way, which is not directly declared, we cast a reflection upon the Japanese. As long as the Prime Minister declares that he is prepared to let good and honest European immigrants come in without applying the test,-we ought to carry the Bill in its original form, containing the provision with regard to the English language. If we do that we do not cause any trouble, and do not distress the Empire in any way, shape, or form. But, as has been said here time after time during this debate, our great Empire looks to Japan for assistance in the case of there being trouble in the eastern portion of the world. Let us not do anything that will strain that relationship. If we can accomplish the same object by means of the provision in regard to the English language, why should we offer an indirect insult to the Japanese? I come to another point, W ill the honourable and it is this : would not this proposal in some way affect immigration ? Wouldi t not act, as the honourable member for Maranoa has said, in such a way as to debar intending emigrants from the interior of Europe from coming to Australia ? Those who have travelled in the interior of Europe know perfectly well that the working people there, who are desirable as immigrants for Australia, would only hear one side of the case-that they cannot come here unless they can write 50 words. One can travel through considerable parts of the interior of England and of Ireland and find many people who cannot write 50 words. Nevertheless they are desirable immigrants. The same is the case in regard to Denmark, the Netherlands, and other countries in Europe. So that, unless we are careful, this measure may have the effect of making those people hesitate to emigrate to Australia. I want to direct attention to another point. I could take honourable members to tbe States of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina, where there is a considerable black population, and I could bring ship-load after ship-load of black people who could easily write 50 words. I saw only lately in a paper from one of the Southern States of America a leading article in which it was stated that a black actor, who had been out to Australia, had been talking about the great time be had here. He spoke of how he was received, and entertained, and looked after, and of how he was treated by the white ladies here in comparison with the way he was treated by white ladies in the Southern States. He absolutely suggested that black people should emigrate to Australia. So that we may have immigration from the black population of Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia.",20,Paper

We want population, and that we can get only when it is understood that it is not education alone that we want. The committee is making a mistake in treating the education test as the end itself when it is only the means to tlie end, and was never intended to be anything else. The test is calculated to shut out immigrants from the best parts of Europe. Let us provide that it shall be in the English language, with an instruction to the officers administering the Act that it is to be applied only to coloured people. The clause is unsatisfactory as it stands, and even when amended as proposed by the Government it seems to me that it will still be unsatisfactory. Everything depends on the administration of tbe Act, as pointed out by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne. The officer who I presume will be the Government interpreter will not be familiar with the language spoken by every European who desires to land in Australia. administration, I think it is a matter of very little consequence whether we insist upon the test being in the English or in some European language. When the B i l comes back from another place, I hope I shall have another opportunity of voting in favour of the amendment which was brought forward by the honourable member for Bland, because, unless amended in that direction, it will be unsatisfactory. a mistake to give the Government a perfectly free hand in this matter. The countries from which emigration will take place ought to know what are the conditions under which they may land here, and they should be able to learn them from our statutes. It is all very well to say that Hansard is read. I doubt even whether this debate will be read, but as the clause stands there is no other means by which a foreign country can gain information as to what extent the obligations of an Act of Parliament will be enforced as soon as immigrants reach here. I think, therefore, that we ought to declare our will freely in the Act. In my opinion, also, we ought to state that the language for the test may be selected by the immigrant. What will be the position otherwise ? The test will be put always in the English language, because we are not to assume that the Customs or immigration officer will be a linguist. If a. Swede comes here, under the clause as it stands the officer will be obliged to dictate50 words in Swedish or in English to theimmigrant. The Prime Minister says that this provision will not be used harshly towards immigrants; that the officer will not give a test in the Swedish language to an Italian immigrant. But what are we going to do? Is theofficer going to read out a test in Italian if an Italian comes here, or in French if a Frenchman comes here? The result will be in all cases that the officer will have to select the English language. I think we ought to compel the Government under these circumstances to supply interpreters. will do. it stands. There is no power for the test to be dictated, except by the immigration officer himself. I would suggest to the As everything depends upon Prime Minister that it would be well to amend the clause by providing that the test shall be "" dictated by or at the instance of the officer."" virtue of doing that? stands the officer must dictate the test himself. If an Italian comes here and desires to land, it is intended that the responsible officer shall read out the test in the Italian language. An officer may not be able to do that, and the man would not be able to come in. Then we can exercise an act of State to prevent an undesirable immigrant from coming in, if we wish to do so. This clause gives no right to the immigrant. It is simply an additional precaution, to be applied when we wish to exclude any immigrant, but it absolutely gives no right to the immigrant. If an immigrant wishes to have the test applied in the Italian language, the officer will have to read it out to him. If he cannot do so, then he will say "" I will not let you in."" Therefore, the principle of not declaring in the measure itself what is to be complied with is a bad one.

Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) Now that we are launched upon this course of not caring much what provisions are in the Bill, but looking only to the declared intentions, and trusting to the way in which Ministers are going to administer the law, it probably does not matter much which of the two forms we adopt-whethe r we say the test shall be tbe "" English"" language or an "" European"" language. If we leave English as the test we shall offend continental powers, and if we alter the word to "" European"" we have the express declaration of the representative of Japan that we shall offend that nation. I only rise to suggest an not be I suggest that we might adopt some sort of test that would be common to all nations. Suppose we adopted a mathematical test, and insisted upon the first three books of Euclid, putting the "" Pons Assinorum "" at the head ? heard the honourable member make. Mr G. B. EDWARDS It may be a joke, but the whole thing seems to me so oblique, and so much of a subterfuge, that we might adopt a mathematical test with just as good results. In taking the language test, while trying not to offend Europe, we offend Japan, and while trying to meet Japan, we offend Europe. The matter has not been considered, and it might not be so much of a joke as it seems to some persons to have a mathematical test, which, at any rate, would enable the Prime Minister, under his system of administration, to keep out anybody he liked and let in anybody he liked, while it would have the further advantage of offending no nation. worth) I am always ready to give credit to the Administration in carrying out a delicate and difficult matter of this kind. We have further on in this Bill a very severe penalty against ship-owners or charterers with regard to the matter of bringing restricted immigrants here, and it does clear announcement either through the Gazettes of the different countries, or by. printed regulations under this Bill, it will be almost impossible for any one to come here who may not be turned back after getting to our shores. That is a very serious and dangerous thing, and it therefore seems to me that there ought to be some regulations with regard to the test, and that we should have a very definite statement from the Ministry that these regulations will be printed and distributed. 1 am very much inclined to think it would be better to make this matter more definite.

I do not intend to labour the matter or to move any amendment, but if my honourable and learned friend the member for South Australia moves an amendment which will indicate that the European immigrant has a right to choose his own language, I shall certainly vote for it, because I think it will after all be the most honest and straightforward way in which to deal with the matter.

Sir MALCOL MM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -The Prime Minister has made a great deal of the NatalA c t during the discussion. If I withdraw my amendment will he accept the provision of the Natal Act or other Acts which have been passed ? Apparently there can be no question as to our being right if we followed the Natal Act or any of the other Acts. amendment is easily comprehended. If 1 were to adopt the form in the Natal Act, then there would be the form set out in the schedule, and people could come in hordes to defeat the test. Or if I were to adopt the form in the New South Wales Act, which is the form set out in the schedule, or in a substituted form to be proclaimed from time to time, by tbe loss of time in obtaining a fresh proclamation the test might be again defeated. The Tasmanian Act is the same as the New South WalesA ct in that respect, and the New ZealandA ct has a form set out in the schedule. None of these will do for such a sufficiently stringent administration of this Act as I purpose. I am quite willing to make a concession. If the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia were adopted in this form, I should not objectA passage of 50 words in length in an European language as directed by the officer. mean at the instance of the Minister? the officer must not exceed his instructions on peril of losing his office. officers might do less than their instructions conveyed. them out in the manner directed-the y will be mainly officers in tbe Customs departmentI shall immediately concert measures with the Minister of Trade and Customs to see that they do their duty or that others do it for them. I think that the Prime Minister might very well accept the amendment suggested South Australia in regard to the immigrant having the power to select, not the passage of the language, but the language in which he shall be examined. That is to say, if? he be a Swede he will select the Swedish language, but he will not select the particular passage which he will have to write at dictation. I think the right honourable gentleman rather misapprehends the scope of the suggested amendnient.

There is no necessity to allow the person who comes in to in one sense dictate how the operation shall be performed. It is quite sufficient if the officer does his duty. I do not think I ought to consent to an amendment which really has at the bottom of it a supposition that there might be cases in which an officer and a Minister would conspire 'to defraud an immigrant out -of his choice of language. That is not the way in which any such Act can be administered. Any Minister who attempted anything of that kind would, I hope, be thrown out at once. I am not going to attempt it anyhow. Immigrants will not have the test put to them unless the officer is directed to put it ; and when he is so directed, he must be allowed, even by the Minister, a certain amount of discretion, which he must perfectly understand, so that he does not put the test unfairly to those who ought not to be tested, or even unfairly to those who are to be tested. The case that has been put of Europeans is one that requires no further explanation. We all know what the Act is aimed at. AVe all know that it is going to be administered in the spirit of what it is aimed at. I cannot see any necessity for allowing a selection, unless it be upon the supposition that the officer or the Minister is going to perform a fraud on the immigrant presenting himself for admission.

I would point out that the difficulty which he suggests would also arise in connection with the provisions of the four succeeding paragraphs. The adoption of the amendment would do away with one of the safeguards of the Bill, inasmuch as it would be impossible to take action against immigrants who had been wrongfully admitted, while the ship-owners responsible for their transport would have got away. One of the safeguards of this measure is that ship-owners will probably protect the Commonwealth by likely to become a public refusing to allow persons to embark on their vessels who do not possess the qualifications necessary to enable them to land. It is quite true that the subsequent paragraphs do not contain the words "" in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer,"" but it is patent that somebody must decide whether a person is, for example, an idiot or insane person, or a person suffering from an infectious disease, ifcc.

The amendment will cover most of the classes of labour likely to be affected through people being inveigled into unfair agreements in ignorance of the conditions obtaining in Australia. ral) I would ask the honourable member for Bland to accept an addition to his amendment in order to cover tbe cases to which he has referred. to whom tlie honourable member alluded when he made his concluding reference to the possibility of the establishment of new industries in the Commonwealth, are excluded under the amendment as it now stands, and it is necessary to make provision to permit skilled labourers to enter the Commonwealth if they are of such a character as to be able to add to the industrial wealth of the community. The words which I suggest should be added to tlie amendment areProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in tlie Commonwealth. That, I think, will cover the case of experts whose special training renders them desirable citizens, whether they come under contract or otherwise. that addition to the amendment. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I move That the following words be added to the proposed new sub-clause :-""Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in Australia, or to persons under contract to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in tlie coasting trade in Australian waters, if the rates of wages specified therein are not lower than the rates ruling in the Commonwealth."" I had intended submitting this amendment in a somewhat different form, but I understand the Ministry will accept tbe amendment as now drawn. seems to me somewhat complicated. W ill tlie amendment have the effect of stopping steamers coming from home calling at ports along the coast ? MrD is AKIN -The amendment relates only to the coasting trade. are in the coastal trade seeing that they call at Fremantle, Adelaide, and Melbourne, and go on to Sydney. 15 z the honourable member for Melbourne to explain the amendnient ? Sir MALCOL MM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -The amendment has been very slightly altered since the honourable member for Bland saw it, and the reason for my asking the Attorney General to alter it was that I was under the impression that, as previously worded, it might mean that vessels' like The persons those of the P. and 0. and Orient Co's., which come here to deliver mails and are not actually trading on the coast-which are not termed coasting vessels in other* Bills which have been passed were included. I am quite sure no honourable member would desire to make this clause applyto those vessels. amendment ? sels come out here at times with their crews engaged at lower rates of wages, and compete on this coast with vessels on which therates current in Australia are paid. for in sub-clause (;) ? Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN I do not think so. Then .again, the clause^ might prevent a ship-owner bringing out his vessel under contract at rates of wages existing in England. This amendment is-, to provide that as soon as vessels come onto the coastal trade here, the crew shall bepaid the rates of wages ruling on the coast. worth) I understand there is a general consensus of opinion with regard to the amendment or the new sub-clause proposed by the honourable member for Bland. I do not desire now to offer any final opinion as to the policy involved, but I have an objection to the sub-clause. In the first place I doubt whether in passing it we are not straining our Constitution. Of course, under section 51 of the Constitution, we have the right to deal with "" immigration and emigration,"" and I have no doubt thatas the years go on these powers will be extended and amplified, if not strained. A t the same time, when we come to deal with matters of contracts made, we deal with legislation which should more particularly be done by the States.

150,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"the Constitution pass a proposal like that of the honourable member for Bland. I doubt very much -whether it is well at this period to strain our rights under the Constitution. In the next place I think we have not sufficient knowledge to decide whether it is wise at the moment to make, for the whole of Australia, such drastic legislation, which, moreover, does not seem to me to come exactly witliin the purview of this Bill. I have noticed a tendency amongst honourable membersvery good in its way-to try to amplify these Bills so as to take into consideration avery possible contingency of the future. The proposal of the honourable member for Bland is a very serious one. I am sure that he admits that himself. While I suppose it will be carried, and while, as I have said, I do not desire to give a definite opinion as to a matter of policy of this kind, I do honestly feel that, in the first place, it is straining, if not the letter, at any rate the spirit of the Constitution; and, in the second place, I think it is a kind of legislation that might, for the present, remain in abeyance until its necessity is absolutely proved. These are my views ; they may not be in unison with those of the majority of honourable members, but I thought it my duty to express them. with regard to the constitutional point raised by the honourable member for Wentworth, that I think he need have no doubt upon that question. Sub-section (27) of section 51 of the Constitution gives us power to deal with "" immigration and emigration."" Those words are not in any way curtailed, and the power is as ample as the words can express. This Parliament has power to make any legislation For the peace, order, and good Government of the Commonwealth, without introducing the Commonwealth, in this respect. In addition to that, we have complete power to deal with trade and commerce by means of legislation. So that in whichever of the categories legislation of this kind is placed, it is within the Constitution, and, of course, is more clearly so when we take both of these provisions together. think that the amendment is a fair one. It tends to prevent the admission into the Commonwealth of persons who, especially if they are not well educated, will be probably -o r may be, at any rate-brough t here in ignorance of our industrial conditions, and who will thus enter into bargains which But they would not have made if they had had the opportunity of observing the working of our institutionsHaving expressed this opinion long ago with regard to the Agreements ""Validating Bill of New South present Wales, which the honourable member for Wentworth will recollect, I have no hesitation in. expressing it again-that I think to allow people to come in under these circumstances, permits a competition, which may not only in itself be grossly unfair, but is unfair almost to. the extent of the competition of that other kind of labour which we want to prohibit. Moreover, this legislation has the further disadvantage of guarding against the making of agreements of which the workmen who made them would repent as soon as they landed on our shores. I think the amendment is a fair one, and shall therefore support it . principle, I am in favour of the amendment which has been proposed by the honourable member for Bland. It is, I take it, an amendment which we can make, though I should not presume to give any opinion upon its constitutional aspect. I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Prime Minister upon that point. The amendment, as I read it , is intended particularly to I should like to say apply to the possibility of there being industrial disputes within the Commonwealth and the introduction here of men intended to subvert the claims which are made by those engaged in such disputes. I have been consistently opposed to the introduction of any labour for that purpose. I think that if there are any disputes in Australia we should be quite prepared to fight them out within our own grounds and upon the conditions which apply within the limits of other people to create further trouble. But I have had knowledge of the necessity of introducing considerable numbers of men for particular industries, because they have had special training and experience. amendment which is now proposed, but in As to the other question, I that which I saw earlier in the day I do not think it was provided, and we are now here introducing into a Bill which proposes to deal entirely with immigration, the question of a minimum wage; because it says that these persons shall not be introduced unless it is prescribed that they shall have a",31,Honourable Member Wh O Is To In His Pocket And The Officer Says We

My whole object in rising is to say that inasmuch as the amendment has not been circulated in print, I think we should have an opportunity of recommitting the clause if it is afterwards found necessary to reconsider it . ""WhereasI intended to support the amendment which circulated by my honourable friend the member for Bland earlier in the day, and while I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne, I think we should have a further opportunity of considering its effect upon the introduction of people who may be necessary for carrying out our great enterprises. committee ought to be at one with the honourable member for Blandi n the object sought to be attained by his amendment. AVheni t is carried, as assuredly it will be, the Government ought to set to work at once to devise means for properly effectuating the amendment. The simple passing of the amendment in the bald form in which it is now proposed will not have the desired effect. It will be impossible to test the matter; no machinery is provided for discovering whether a man arriving here on board ship is under contract. We know perfectly well that it is not uncommon, but far from it , among the Chinese who come here, for them to be not merely under contract, but under bonds and ties of a very stringent and secret nature which we cannot hope to fathom; at all events up to the time they land. same may occur in regard to cheaply paid labour of all kinds. What means are there on the face of the Bill to carry out the desire of the honourable member or of tbe committee, when the amendment is carried, that persons under contract of the kind referred to shall be excluded 1 None. There is no power of investigation. A question may be asked and a person may refuse to answer it, or may answer it falsely; and what is to happen when that person enters tlie Commonwealth ? How is this provision to be carried out? It is merely a pronouncement; that is all. I want to direct the Attorney-General's attention to the fact with which he is perfectly conversant, no doubt, that this matter has been found to be the subject of such severe pressure in the United States that the most carefully framed provisions have been 15 z 2 : Besirivtion B ill . 5367 passed, not once, but from time to time in order to meet the evil. on 26th February, 1885, chap. 164'. the Act of 23rd February, 1887, chap. was 220. There are very elaborate provisions in about eight or ten sections. Some of them are of considerable length, and strict precautions are taken for carrying out the object of the measures. When I point out to the committee one or two matters that are dealt with in these Acts, honourable members will see at once how necessary it is that proper machinery provisions should be provided for giving effect to the amendment. For instance, besides enacting that it is unlawful to import any one under such a contract, the necessary condition is made that all such contracts shall be void. within the purview of a Bill of this character ? the purview of this Bill, because if we are legislating to restrain undesirable immigrants, we want to see that the provisions are not ineffectual. The American Acts are with a view of restraining undesirable immigration, and are similar to the provisions of this measure; but ancillary to these provisions of prohibition, they contain also provisions which are necessary in . order to prevent evasion. What we want to provide is that if by chance, or The fraud, or accident of any kind, or by certain acts that we do not foresee or cannot prevent any persons under contract should gain admission to Australia, the contracts under which they come shail not be binding. It is no use saying that persons under such contracts shall not be admitted to Australia, if when they do succeed in getting in, we allow their employers to keep them practically in a state of servitude.

I want to emphasize the fact that although the Act of 1885 was carefully drawn it was found to be insufficient for the purposes, and the amending Act of 1887 was found to be necessary in order to make it effectual. Here we are, so to speak, without any of those safeguards provided for in the American law, and it will be necessary, if t tlie amendment is carried, to give the Government time to properly frame a series of clauses which will insure, so far as we can do so, that the will of the committee shall be to exclude any person who is under a concarried out.

Courti t was held in the case of the United States Government v. Trinity Church, that the Rev.

The clergyman was excluded by reason of a certain proviso to the clause setting forth who may be excluded. Actors mentioned in the proviso, but as clergymen were not, the Circuit Court held that by I reason of that proviso Mr Warren was a prohibited immigrant. I am sure this amendment will be carried, and I hope that the Bill will be passed ultimately in such a form as to prevent any loop-hole for its evasion. MrA . PATERSON (Capricornia) I do not think that any member of the committee has the real object of this clause more at heart than I have; but I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth, that the amendment is too drastic. What is it that we wish to accomplish 1 We do not want to keep out men of muscle and sinew and brain; we want to keep out certain classes of contract labour. The honourable and learned member for Indi appealed to me strongly in his speech just now. I think that wrong lines have been adopted, and that it should have been declared in the amendment that all such contracts shall be illegal. Then there would be no objection to the proposal. I do not see any sense in keeping out the men; we should make the contract illegal. We are getting into a little confusion, because there are three distinct proposals before the committee. There is the proposal of the honourable member for Bland, that in addition to the exclusion of people under tlie language test, there shall be a power tract or agreement to perform manual labour in the Commonwealth. As to that I think there is a general feeling in the House that it is an extra power which ought to be conferred. I do not think we need be troubled about the Chinese, with their mystic agreements, because we apprehend that we shall be able to keep out the Chinese by the language test. I understand that very largely the intention of the amendment is to provide that men shall not be brought from outside the Commonwealth in order to aid a particular side in fighting a strike.",33,Honourable Member Wh O Is To In His Pocket And The Officer Says We

205,Mr Sydneysmith (Macquarie),"member for Melbourne has also endeavoured to safeguard tlie clause in a way which, I think, is judicious. I have very great pleasure in supporting the amendment, in order to guard against the evils which hare been indicated. If it is understood that the Prime Minister has no objection to recommit tbe clause to-morrow, if necessary, to carry out the intention of the committee in a more reasonable way, 1 do not see any objection to this proposal. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I presume that the clause will refer only to contracts and agreements made in futuro . The presumption is that the Bill will come into immediate operation-a t least we hope that it will. I do not think it is necessary to put in a special clause to preserve the rights of existing contracts. The canon for the interpretation of statutes is that an A ct shall not be deemed to be retrospective unless it is specially made so. It is only fair that we should have that rule clearly in our mind, because there may be in existence a large number of these contracts. I do not know whether the arrangement still exists, but Queensland did enter into one under tlie treaty with Japan; and the arrangement as set out in the correspondence was that, when tbe planter wanted to indent his labour from Japan, he made the application in Queensland; it was sent on to Japan, and then passports were signed and the immigrants were indented. When this Bill is in operation these immigrants coming under any existing contract, I presume, will have to pass the education test. tract they will not be admitted. MrL . E. GROOM -Then I think we ought to distinctly state so. I presume that the Commonwealth in taking over the matter of immigration and emigration, also took over tbe rights which are attendant on the treaty. As Queensland has no right to modify or to re-arrange the treat}', I presume that the only consistent way we can deal with the subject now is to take advantage of the clause in the treaty, and let tlie Commonwealth give notice of the termination of the treaty. But we should distinctly understand now whether or not the clause is to be retrospective. of the honourable and learned member's speech is one of some importance, and one to which I .am not prepared to give an immediate answer. I would rather consider it, as I have no doubt he desires that I should. As to his argument about contracts, it seems to me that tlie clause is sufficiently prospective in its operation to cover tbe case of contracts entered into before the passage of the Bill. We are trying to declare who are the classes of immigrants whom we do not want; and the question is whether we should include those who have already entered into such contracts. those they might try to defeat the measure by entering into contracts. must have been some engagements made toimport British subjects here during the time the Bill has been pending. The same thing may occur with regard to contracts ; but as far as I can. see the clause covers the ground. While I think this paragraph ought to be taken as now amended, I would not for a moment undertake to say that I will not recommit it if occasion arises. If I see reasons why the clause should be recommitted, I shall be very glad to take that course, with the object of improving tlie Bill, and if, in the meantime, honourable members who have suggestions to make will assist me by showing them to me, I shall be very pleased. gest to the Attorney-General that any amendments that may be made should be printed and circulated at once for the information of honourable members. connection with this subject a great deal of attention has been directed to Queensland, and the special correspondent of the Argus, writing on the Kanaka question in that State, while admitting that the Kanaka is a declining factor, contends that the Hindoos and the Japanese are rapidly increasing in numbers there-and increasing under contract. A gentleman engaged in mercantilepursuits in Queensland, writing to a friend in Melbourne the week before last, bears out what the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs says, and shows the necessity for making this measure apply as quickly as possible. The letter reads as follows :You might see Mr Mauger or Col. Reay. Mr Mauger is a member of the House of Representatives, and secretary to the National Anti-Sweating League, and in company with Col.

Let him know what is going on here, for there can be no doubt that iF the Alien Restriction Bill is delayed even for a few months hundreds of Hindoos, Japs, and Cingalese will be brought to North Queensland under contract. Agents are busy, and movements are being made in that direction now ; and when these people get here they will do an untold Amount of harm, both to wages and morals. I am in a position to know what is going on, and am sure that if the members of the Federal Parliament knew the urgeno3' thej' would stop this business at the earliest possible moment. myth. for Melbourne says that it is all a myth, but I can assure honourable members that the gentleman who wrote this letter knew what he was writing about; and, whilst the view of the honourable member for Melbourne may be correct, I may say that I have been informed times out of number that if the importation of Kanakas were stopped, an effort would be made to fill their places with Hindoos. -coloured labour say that that is what they will do. now. -may mention that I have been introduced to Japanese agents, who make it their business to recruit Japanese labourers and to look after their interests, even to tbe banking of their money. The same thing is often done with regard to Hindoos, as -agents make it their business to engage labour in gangs, under contract, to bargain between the men and their employers, and -to look after the labourers' money. I therefore think that the Prime Minister will be wise if he gives the House to understand that this restriction with regard to labour under contract will be brought into operation at the earliest possible moment, and that those now engaged will be notified through tlie press at once that their contracts will become null and void. have not the amendment before us in print, it is difficult to understand what its effect will be. I take it, however, that if a P. and 0. steamer, coming from England, took goods from Fremantle to Sydney, the rate of wages paid to her crew would have to be the rate prevailing in the Commonwealth. under paragraph (J). ( j ) does touch that case, because it only provides for cases where seamen are landed, and then they are exempted, provided they are re-shipped. That paragraph does not meet the case of a vessel coming to Fremantle and taking goods on from Fremantle to Sydney without landing any of her crew. This is a difficulty which strikes me, and, as I understand the Prime Minister intends to reconsider the whole matter, I am merely indicating what seems to me to be the effect of the amendment-withou t dealing with it as a matter of policy. It seems to me that if goods are shipped from Fremantle to Sydney, the ship taking them must be engaged in the coastal trade, and the wages paid on that ship should be the rates prevailing in the Commonwealth. the Government to take into consideration the aspect of the case put forward by the honourable and learned member for Indi, with reference to introducing subsequent clauses to ensure the efficiency of the proposal. to the voiding of the agreement, I think we In support of that, I have power under clause 15 dealing with regulations. could provide in the Bill that the agreements would be void it would be more satisfactory. considering. some time ago, but I did not suggest any amendment of this sort, because I was rather in doubt as to whether, in an Immigration Bill proper, we had the right to introduce a matter of this kind.

I think the amendment is a very dangerous one. The argument used in favour of it can be used with equal force in favour of other forms of coloured labour. The honourable member who proposed the amendment based his argument very largely upon the fact that these men are imported by their employers under bonds of £ 1 0 0 that they will return them; whilst another argument was that the men are not allowed to leave the foreshore, and consequently cannot be dangerous to the whole of Australia. But what guarantee has the Commonwealth that these private arrangements will not be altered in the future, and that the men will not be kept ? What safeguard have we, either, that the State laws of AVestern Australia will not be altered ? The arguments that white men cannot do the work, and' that tlie black pearlers will not contaminate the rest of Australia, will, in a few weeks, be used in regard to the Kanaka traffic. It will be urged that the Kanaka is only brought here for a time, and it may equally well be said that he will not contaminate our race strain.

Half-castes may have crossed with Quadroons, or Octoroons, and so bhe mixing up of nationalities and hybrids continues until "" Mongrelia"" is literally the name that should be applied to the region.

I am sure that if I were to read the whole of this article the committee would see that it is not worth our while discussing whether we should allow any of this class of people to land upon that portion of Australia. The pearl-shelling industry there means that the employment of this class of labour has created a class of mean whites who are not worthy of this country. The way in which they have treated some of the unfortunate wretches whom they have under their control is simply horrible, and we should not waste our time considering whether they should be allowed to land here. If they want to go back to Singapore let them go. as to the numbers engaged in the pearl fisheries there ? MrM c DONALD have never seen any. I know that at Thursday Island at one time there were, roughly speaking, about 2,000 Europeans employed in the industry, and to-day there are only 65, while there are over 1,900 aliens employed. manned by Japanese. Japanese employed in the industry there now. This matter requires to be taken into serious consideration, and personally I hope the committee will not adopt the amendment proposed. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I do not think the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Coolgardie will carry out what the honourable member desires. The clause as it stands at present provides for the exemption of the crew of any vessel in port temporarily, and I think that is all we can reasonably ask. I have a knowledge of the pearling business, as I have had some little experience of it. I owned three or four pearling boats at Port Darwin, which were manned principally by Japanese crews, and the men employed are all booked as "" crew."" As a rule the crew of each boat consists of six men-the diver, the tender, and four men all booked as a ""crew,"" and shipped before the harbour-master in the ordinary way in which European sailors would be. The wages of the crews run from £ 3 to £ 4 per month with rations. The tender, Yes; he was a the man who looks after the diver, holds the pipe and the life-line and so forth, receives about £ 5 per month, and generally has a little in with the diver on the amount of shell secured. The question of remuneration so far as the divers are concerned is not of so much moment, because whether they are white men, Manillamen, New Zealanders, or Japanese, the divers, as a rule, receive the small wage of from £ 4 to £ 5 and £ 6 per month, with rations, and what they call a "" lay "" of so much per ton upon the shell they take. The"" lay "" is sometimes as high as £ 25 per ton, and sometimes even a little more than that, going up to £ 3 0 . It is a bonus upon every ton of shell they get, and I have known instances of divers earning as muchas £ 6 0 and £ 7 0 a month easily. As to white divers, there is no doubt they can do the work at a certain depth ; but when it comes to deep-sea diving, to anything I could not say; I over 13 or 14 fathoms and from that up to 18 fathoms, the native divers, and especially the Bay of Islands Maories, are undoubtedly the best for the work. are better at the greater depths 1",44,Malcolm Mceacharn Those And Professional Men Of Various Kinds Were

I. think the committee is indebted to the last speaker for some very valuable information. I want to know, if there is to be a vote, how far the honourable member for Coolgardie thinks that these words will suit his purpose. There is a great deal of force in the last speech. All the pearl fisherman will have to do will be to employ as his crew men whom he means to dive. It is simply a legal question whether the man employed in diving and assisting the diver is a part of the crew. frequently, and has been used in regard to the immigration lawsa number of people who are really passengers are called the crew and brought in as the crew. How much easier it would be to treat men employed in diving, as giving assistance in the ship and being of the crew also ? What is to hinder a man from saying"" This is my crew; I choose to have five or six."" The words used here are "" The master crew and other persons employed in."" So far as lean see, if the honourable member wants to get permission to land, there will be no gain from the amendment. But I am afraid that if weonce admit the principle that, forthesake of preserving an industry, we are to allow the landiug of undesirable immigrants we shall be met with a very formidable difficulty when it comes to the question of Kanakas. It would be of use if honourable members could have statistics to show how far the pearling industry is a means of wealth to the Commonwealth, and how many men it employs. MrV . L . SOLOMON -It means an export of nearly a quarter of a million from the Commonwealth. sirable aliens employed in pearling would it be much less ? I apprehend that the greater part of that quarter of a million would be still conserved to the Commonwealth if 16 A we had the industry in the hands of whites. I feel that these words will not help the honourable member; and when we come to vote on the principle I should much rather keep the line clear and distinct. We should not make exceptions in favour of any industiy, if it means infringing on the principle of having a white Australia. I shall vote against this amendment, under the circumstances, so far as I can see at present. imagine that this innocent amendment would unloose such a storm of protest as has sprungup, particularly from this quarter of the House. The object of this perfectly innocent amendment is not to allow thesepeople to come and stay on shore, but to give to the employees who may not comeunder the definition of crew the same facilities as are given to the master and crew. That is the whole sum and substance of the amendment, and why it should be met with so much hostility I am at a loss to understand. I was advised that the men whowork on board these luggers could not be considered as members of the crew, but if the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is correct in saying that they would be considered as on the same footing could easily employ them as members of the crew. people who are employed on these pearlingluggers, my amendment will happily be unnecessary. An attempt has been made to liken these pearl-shell getters to the Kanakas. I would point out that whilst the Kanaka lands and-works for three or four years under contract the men employed on the pearling boats remain on shore for only a few days, and even thenconfine themselves to the foreshores.. Moreover the country where they land isabsolutely barren, and as to the clanger of a hybrid race mentioned by the honourable member for Kennedy, I think that the Minister of Defence will be able to assure the honourable member that the number of these hybrid products is very small. I was not aware that the pearl-shelling industiy had such extensive ramifications, and that so many people were employed in other localities as now appears to be the case ; but I did not like to see a little town in my electorate disappear.

328,Mr Mahon,"If the clause covers theBroome, because my electorate is so extensive that it would take one a year to go over it , but the facts placed before me show that the pearling industry could not be carried out by means of white labour, and that if the people employed on the pearling luggers are prohibited from landing, their head-quarters will be shifted to some other place, and Broome will disappear from the map. The question of competition with white labour need not be taken into account, and the risk of race contamination is so small as to be hardly worthy of consideration. Even if power were taken to prohibit these pearl-shellers from"" landing it would be impracticable to maintain a police force in such remote localities sufficient to prevent them from coining ashore. In view of the light thrown on the subject by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr men, because they reach the border at a V . L . Solomon, and of the legal interpretation of the clause as it stands given by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I shall be glad if I may be permitted to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 6(1) Any immigrant who evades an officer or who enters the Commonwealth at any place where no officer is stationed, may, if at any time thereafter State to another, unless there is some he is found within the Commonwealth, be asked to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of section four, and shall, if he fails to do so, be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant offending against this Act. (2) Any immigrant may at any time within one year after he has entered the Commonwealth be asked to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of section four, and shall, if he fails to prevent free passage from one State to do so, be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant offending against this Act. in this clause that any immigrant may at any time within one year after he has entered the Commonwealth be asked to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a), section 4. I would like to know what is the reason for that limitation 1 some limitation, because I think honourable members will all agree that after an immigrant has been a long time in the Commonwealth, after having, perhaps, sold out his home in another country-h e might have evaded the law, because that is a thing to which humanity is prone-it might be a hardship to send him away. It is thus necessary to impose some limitation of time. I think that a year is a fair limit, because if a person comes into the Commonwealth in contravention of the law, it is reasonable to suppose that he will be found out within twelve months. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I should like to know whether this clause will meet the difficulties that arise in Queensland through a number of Chinese coming from the Northern Territory into that State. Perhaps the Prime Minister is aware that some time ago a large number of Chinese came from the Northern Territory into Queensland, crossing the border near Camooweal.

Clause agreed to. Clause 9' (Penalty on masters and owners of ships).. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I move That the following words be added to the clause:-""No penalty shall be imposed under this section on any master or owner who proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had no knowledge of any prohibited European immigrant being landed contrary to this Act, and that he took all reasonable precautions to prevent it."" I wish to point out that it is utterly impossible for a ship-master or owner to know whether some of these prohibited immigrants are suffering from an infectious or contagious disease, or whether they have within three years been convicted of an offence-no t being a political offence-for which they had been sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer. Equally impossible is it for them to determine whether any immigrant is likely, in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer, to become a charge upon the public. I contend that a shipowner should not be subjected to the heavy penalties which are prescribed in clause 16, if he has acted in good faith, although I quite admit that there can be no excuse for a ship-owner who wilfully lands any prohibited coloured immigrant.

Has the Prime Minister considered the relation of the police force of the States to this Act and to the Federal Government ? This clause gives power to a member of the police force, in addition to his multifarious duties, to arrest, but there is no duty imposed on him. There must be a number of clauses in Bills which have been before us which relate to the duties of the police force directly or indirectly. I have not thought out the question myself, and I want to know what would happen supposing a member of the police force should refuse to arrest or stop any immigrant.

I understand that a promise has been given by the Prime Minister that, if possible, tbe Pacific Island Labourers Bill will be passed through Parliament this session. will not be necessary. That the following new clause be added to follow clause 8:-""Any person coming within the definitions of a prohibited immigrant contained in section four, and any aboriginal native of Asia, Africa or Polynesia who is convicted of murder, or manslaughter, or rape, or an aggravated assault, or an attempt to commit any such oflence, shall be liable on the expiration of any term of imprisonment or servitude imposed on hiin, there for to be deported from the Commonwealth pursuant to an3' warrant of the Minister."" This clause may appear upon the surface to be rather severe, but I should like to remind the committee that the principle of deportation is already introduced into the Bill in clause 8. It is laid down in that clause that in addition to or substitution for imprisonment, any person who, being a prohibited immigrant, is found within the Commonwealth, shall be liable to be deported from the Commonwealth. If the committee refuse to adopt this new clause the Government may be placed in this peculiar position : It may be possible that a perfectly inoffensive, harmless, and good citizen will be deported under clause 8 simply because he had not complied with certain conditions. That is to say, if he got into the Commonwealth in any way except the way recognised by this Bill, he, upon discovery, would be liable to deportation or imprisonment. The man might be a perfectly good citizen, and a worthy man, yet he would be deported. I m o v e On the other hand, a man might commit murder, and on his liberation from imprisonment would be thrown back upon society to commit offences afresh. I understood the Attorney-General to say that we have between 70,000 and SO, 000 of these aliens within the Commonwealth already. There is no provision at the present time whereby the Government can do more to any of them who commits a serious offence than inflict certain punishment, and then as soon as they have finished their term of imprisonment or servitude, they are free to commit offences again. Of course murder is punishable by death, but sometimes a man who commits murder is not punished by death. A t any rate, for murder or manslaughter, or offences against women, or an aggravated assault, these aliens may be imprisoned and afterwards liberated.

Japan would not receive back a man who had committed a crime in Australia, then, of course, the matter becomes a question of international law. I presume that, in such case, Providence would be on the side of the big battalions. duce tbe question of big battalions. Mi*. MAHON If a Government refuse to receive back their own subjects, we might compel them to do so, provided we had the force at our back. It all comes back to a question of strength. WhatI desire to impress upon the committee is that we have at tlie present time a large number of aliens in the Commonwealth. Very often these men use the revolver or the knife, and if dangerous characters such as these commit a crime once, it is very probable that as soon as they are released they will commit another. I do not see why we should be burdened with a class of criminals of that sort. It is provided in clause 4 that if an immigrant has within three years been convicted of an offence, not being a mere political offence, he may be sent back. That practically provides for deporting the man. Honourable members will observe that we deport an immigrant for a crime committed outside Australia but tlie peculiarity is that, if he commits a crime within the Commonwealth, he is not liable to deportation. To my mind, that is not sensible legislation. I should like the honourable and learned member for Northern. Melbourne to consider that, while we propose to send back an immigrant who has committed a crime outside Australia, we are not giving ourselves power to deport a coloured alien who commits a crime here. Honourable members who read tlie newspapers of the day must know that, in nearly every record of the criminal courts throughout the various States, mention is made of crimes committed by men of colour. I have in my possession proofs of the readiness with which Afghans and Hindoosi n the lonely bush of Western Australia will draw out the revolver or the knife against the traveller there. It will be an additional incentive to these people to obey our laws if they know that, by any serious infraction of them, they will render themselves liable to be deported to their own country. I do not think it is necessary to take up much time in recommending this clause to the committee. I hope the Government will see their way to accept the principle contained in it . I am not committed strongly to the wording of the clause, and if the Prime Minister or tlie Attorney General can improve on it , I should be very glad to accept their amendment. of leave of which isI t is a question of force. To place certain restrictions on immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of prohibited immigrants. The title corresponds with that order of leave.

374,Mr Barton,"This is a Bill the orderBill, not on the grounds that have been debated already, but because they would -apply equally to any aboriginal native of Asia, Africa or Polynesia, who were in tlie Commonwealth before the Bill began to operate. If it is intended to apply the clause to them, then I am afraid that with that phrase in it, it committed very serious offences. The queswould be outside the scope of the Bill, because that portion of it does not deal either with the placing of restrictions on immigration, nor does it provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of prohibited immigrants, as the order of leave specifies. The honourable member's case is perhaps imperilled to that extent. within tbe definitions of a prohibited immigrant. earlier part of the clauseAny person coming within the definitions of a prohibited immigrant contained in section 4would. But there is a distinction drawn between them and "" any aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or Polynesia."" That deals with a new class beyond that which is dealt with in the first part of tlie clause, and I am afraid it might be held to be outside the seope of the Bill itself. My honourable friend will see that the Bill is not proposed with the view of either restricting the immigration or providing for the removal from the Commonwealth of any but prohibited immigrants. Those already in the Commonwealth before the Bill operates-wh o have come here legally-canno t be placed within the class of prohibited immigrants. clause were in existence. retrospectively in this way: that being in the Commonwealth it would be a question whether the Bil l operating from this timesupposing it were passed to-night-coul d be held to provide within its title for the removal of persons who are not within the class of prohibited immigrants by name or by description, but who would under this clause be prohibited immigrants. Apart from that I should like the honourable member, if he will, to consider the proposed clause in another aspect. It is all very well for us to provide in clause 8 for the deportation of those who have been convicted merely of a contravention or evasion of this Act, the ordinary criminal character, but simply a breach of a regulated statute. That is an offence which Ave can punish to a certain extent with certain unprisonment, but it comes within the class of minor offences. Tlie persons at whom the new clause is aimed are those who have tion that will arise is"" What are we to do with these people if we try to deport them 1"" We can legislate against the influx of criminals, and so can any other State or foreign power. Indeed, in many cases, they do legislate against the influx of criminals. Foreign powers no doubt have such legislation, but although these persons may have been their subjects, and we may on that account return them to them, so far as their criminality is concerned, we have prosecuted and convicted them, and in that sense they are our criminals, and not theirs, and they might very sensibly object to receiving them back. of the State from which they came if they have not been naturalized here. are still their subjects, not having been naturalized here at all, the crime of which they had been convicted would have been committed within the Commonwealth. crime gives them some claim on the Commonwealth. gives them the slightest claim on the Commonwealth.

386,Mr Barton,"Murders committed byexecution. I am not going to trouble about that part of it. I would like the honourable member to reconsider the clause, and, if possible, to withdraw it, because it seems to me thati t cannot come to much in any event. There is another thing I want to mention about it. It speaks of murder, manslaughter, rape, or "" any aggravated assault."" The definition of crimes which are called "" aggravated assaults "" differ in different States. We have also to recollect that the general criminal law of each State is reserved to itself. It is not a Commonwealth affair, and as these laws differ we have to be very careful how we make our references to them in any clause of this sort. In the States the circumstances which make up these crimes are defined, and the -circumstances often differ; so there can be no real meaning in this term "" aggravated assault,"" or, if there was any, it would be subject to infinite complications. If the honourable member persists in the clause it would be advisable for him to alter that expression, and use some term which would be -applicable to the higher classes of offences as .they are known in all the States. used were ""felon}' against the person"" it -would relieve the clause of some of its difficulties. On the whole, however, I think we should find very great difficulty in putting the clause into operation, and it would raise continual controversies between us and others, which we do not want to raise, while we do want to deal with our -own affairs in our own way. Then tbe use of the term ""aboriginal, native of Asia, Africa, or Polynesia"" is likely to cause difficulties, and if the honourable member took out that expression he would get all he wants from the earlier part of the clause. tention that the clause would not come within the scope of the Bill or of its title, its title is "" to place certain restrictions on immigration,"" and I think that would cover the clause in this way. If I , being a prohibited immigrant, or an aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or Polynesia, know that if I go into a certain country and commit any offence there I may be removed from that country, tbe effect would be to discourage my immigration to that country. lean see that in that respect the title would be sufficient to include the clause proposed. I think the expression used, "" an aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or Polynesia,"" will not meet a class of people who come to Australia and commit many crimes, and that is the negro population of America. There are nine millions of negroes in America, all of whom speak English, and they have in America universities specially established for those people. ber think these persons would be deterred from here by fear of the consequences that would ensue if they committed any crime ? here under the Bill as it stands, and if the honourable member wishes to exclude them he must extend the definition he proposes; because, although these people may be said to be aboriginals of Africa, they are natives of America. them. described as aboriginal natives of Africa if they are born in America. I think there is a justification for the honourable member's proposal. AVe have a case in Victoria which the Attorney-General will remember, which shows that these people are greatly below us in every sense in civilization. I refer to the case of the convict King, who is now in Pentridge, and who has been made notorious by the newspapers. After years and years of imprisonment, he was released about six months ago, and he immediately committed some of the most desperate crimes. Only a week or so ago he was sentenced to a further six months' imprisonment because he struck a warder. The man is quite uncontrolled, and simply does not know what it is to restrain his iiberty. where, because I believe lie was born in Victoria. proposed by the honourable member for Coolgardie had been in force, this man, upon his release six months ago, could have been deported. be deported as native of Africa, Asia or Polynesia, if he was born in Victoria. that part of the proposed clause should be extended in order to include all coloured persons, including Afra-Americans. them away?",53,Malcolm Mceacharn Those And Professional Men Of Various Kinds Were

I would suggest to tbe honourable member for Coolgardie that he should leave out the second part and retain the first part with some modification such as I suggest. honourable member for Coolgardie desires to effect is very desirable if it can be done. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has indicated a way out of some of the difficulties, but I am afraid that there is a difficulty still in the form of words suggested. He might use the words in the clause, or these wordsAny person who would be excluded under the provisions of section 4 of this Act who is convicted of murder . 1 Or, he might sayAny person to whom the provisions of section 4 oE this Act is applicable who is convicted of murder. We should still have to go back to the provisions of clause 4 to find out what persons are alluded to, and there we have five or six categories of persons, but there is no distinguishing between the race and colour of a person so far as these definitions are concerned. The honourable member will notice that we have here a great many classes of persons who, under the clause as it is proposed, mightbe deported if they were convicted of the offences named therein. I do not know but that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in his suggestion to extend the definition of immigrants, has offered the best solution. 1 would like to point out to the Prime Minister that if these objections be overcome, as a way of carrying out the clause, we might adopt words somewhat similar to those in clause 8, and make the continuance of the finding of such person within the Commonwealth, after the issue of a warrant of deportation, an offence against the Act, punishable, as under clause 8, by imprisonment, which would cease on the offender going out of the Commonwealth, or finding sureties to do so. In that way there would be practical effect given to tbe intention. Either you would shut up this undesirable person, or you would bring such pressure to bear upon him that he would leave. But I see that there are difficulties in using the definition in clause 4, unless some such words as the honI am not going to stick orable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has suggested can be adopted. way committed to the wording of the new clause, so long as the principle is preserved and we can manage to arrive at some agreement. I did not quite catch what the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said about the introductoiy portion of the new clause, but I am quite agreeable to strike out the words and any aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or Polynesia. That, I think, is the principal objection which the Prime Minister has advanced to tlie clause. I am also willing to make the next line readwho is convicted of a felony or of murder, or manslaughter, or rape, or an aggravated assault. against the person"" would cover the whole of the offences enumerated. sible objection that might be made, I suggest that we insert after the words "" section four "" the words "" and not naturalized within the Commonwealth."" If these words are inserted they will show that the person who is returned is no subject of ours, and has no claim upon this country, but preserves intact all his original rights in the country from which he came, and consequently no reasonable and proper objection can be raised to taking him back again. Clause amended to read as follows :Any person coming within the definitions of a prohibited immigrant contained in section 4, and not naturalized within the Commonwealth, who is convicted of any crime of violence against the person shall be liable on the expiration of any term of imprisonment or penal servitude imposed on him there for to be deported from the Commonwealth pursuant to any oider of the Minister. That the following words be added to the clause:-""Any such person found within the Commonwealth after the issue of such order, shall be guilty of an offence against the Act. and shall be liable to imprisonment for not more than six months, provided that the imprisonment shall cease for the purpose of deportation, or if the offender finds two approved sureties, each in the sum of fifty pounds, for his leaving tlie Commonwealth within one month.""

418,Mr Piesse (Tasmania),"I m o v edifficulty about adopting the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Tasmania. As I understand, the honourable member for Coolgardie wishes to make this clause one that might be used, and not one that must be used, because there are crimes of violence which are of a minor character, and in regard to which deportation would be a punishment entirely out of proportion to the offence. The amendment pioposed by the honourable member for Tasmania seems to point to making it compulsory to deport persons in all cases. Minister does not quite follow my amendment, because what I propose would only come into operation after the exercise of the Minister's power to make an order. posal of the honourable member for Tasmania would operate most harshly, because it says, in effect, that because a man has been imprisoned, and found guilty of some crime, he shall be subjected to additional imprisonment until he can find sureties, which it would be impossible for a man in his position to find. Amendment negatived. New clause, as amended, agreed to. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I m o v e That the following new clause be inserted to follow clause 16 :-' ' The Minister shall cause to be made annually a return which shall be laid before Parliament showing the number of persons refused admission into the Commonwealth on the ground of being prohibited immigrants, the nation to which they belong, whence they came, and the ground upon which admission was refused; the number of persons who passed the test prescribed by sub-section (a) of section 4, the nations to which they belong, and from whence they came."" My reason for moving the insertion of this clause is that I think it is desirable that Parliament and the country should have the fullest information as to the working of this Act, and as to the number of undesirable aliens seeking admission to the Commonwealth. ask for information under each subsection of sub-section (4) ? New clause agreed to. Mi-. G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) I move That the following new clause be inserted to follow clause 17 :"" IS. This Act shall continue and be in force till the 30th June, 1904, and no longer."" I scarcely think it is necessary to explain the meaning of this provision. When the Prime Minister made his Maitland speech, the whole of Australia interpreted his declaration as meaning that one part of tlie Government policy and that not the least important would be. some strong legislation in tbe direction of prohibiting the introduction of coloured aliens into the Commonwealth. Throughout the election campaign-certainl y in nine out of every ten contested elections the question of what steps were to be taken to stop this influx held a very prominent place. Prom the opinions expressed by both candidates and electors, it was quite apparent that there was a genuine feeling throughout Australia, not only that something should De done in the direction of stemming this tide of coloured immigration, but that something would be done. When this House met, there was no doubt from the tone of the speeches made during the debate upon the address in reply that there was a very decided opinion that such legislation should be commenced early, and should be pushed to a conclusion before the close of the session. When the Bill containing the proposals of the Government was presented, there was a general feeling among members on both sides that those proposals were quite inadequate to achieve the purpose which Australia had in view. We know that throughout the debates which have taken place upon this Bill during the past two or three weeks, there has been a perfect unanimity of feeling that the proposals of the Ministry-n o matter how politic they may be, and no matter what conditions exist to render them less drastic than they would otherwise have been do not meet with the approval of Australia, and will only be consented to on account of considerations of policy. When the honourable and learned member for Indi, who was one of those who sympathized very strongly with the dominant idea that something definite ought to be done, projiosed an amendment under which, from time to time, we might pass resolutions of tbe two Houses of Parliament affirming that certain classes of persons were undesirable immigrants and should be prohibited from landing, was at first sight disposed to agree with him.

But seeing that this Chamber has most unanimously pronounced-notabl y in the speech delivered by the Attorney-General -that the proposals of the Government are not sufficient in themselves, and are only adopted out of consideration for our relations with the mother-country the sort. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Inferentiall y that has been admitted all through. It has been admitted that our hands to a great extent have lieen tied by a consideration of the policy of the mother country. That being the case, it would be wise of us to limit the operation of this Billi n such a way that we shall know definitely before it passes this Chamber that within a specified period it will come up again for consideration. During the interim it is possible that there may be developments of Imperial policy which will render a solution of the difficulty easier. It is just possible that some happier way may be discovered of settling this question, which will avoid causing irritation to friendly powers. Seeing that there can be no mistaking the feeling of the country that this measure does not go far enough, and recognising that it goes no further than any State legislation could have gone before the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and that one of the chief arguments in favour of federal union was that this Parliament would have enlarged powers for dealing with this question, it will be wise on our part to adopt this clause, so that we shall know definitely that within a certain time, irrespective of what Ministry may be in power, it will come up again for consideration and settlement in the light of such experience as the Commonwealth has obtained in the meantime. aliens come in after two years ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS intention. nearly as great at the present time as some of the opponents of tbe Government proposals have endeavoured to make it appear. Buti t is impossible to magnify the proportions which it is likely to assume if repressive legislation is not enacted. If this measure passes Parliament in its present form there will be a natural conservative force which will fight against its being seeking to limit the operation of this Bill1 brought up again for consideration. Then in three or four years' time, when we find out the inadequacy of this Bill, we shall not be able to consider it . A ny Ministry which may happen to be in power at that time will be prone to take the view that it is unwise to re-open the question. It would be well, therefore, for us to declare that, though we have agreed from considerations of policy not to make this Bill so drastic as we think it ought to have been, we reserve to ourselves the right to re-open this question within three or four years, and to reconsider it in the light of the experience attained in the interim. We have displayed very great moderation in this measure. We have been very largely guided by a feeling of loyalty to the mother-land, but our responsibilities to our own country are so great that we ought not to allow this opportunity to pass without asserting that we will take precautions to insure its reconsideration. We have had in the State Parliaments responsible Ministers who would not have taken such an oblique course as has been taken by the present Government. Wentworth, Lang, Parkes, Higinbotham, and a great many of our past masters would not have been so mealy-mouthed on this question, but would have dealt with it directly and definitely. We should not allow this measure to pass out of the House without taking some steps in the direction I have indicated to insure a re-opening of the question when we should have had a little more experience to guide us. the honourable member for South Sydney, I do not think that we needed so long a speech about so little a matter. But if we are going to begin this sort of principle of terminating the operation of remedial measures, and leaving ourselves in the lurch and possibly helpless, we shall have a nice state of things. The honourable member has let these given us no more reason for trying to apply the principle of temporary legislation to this I have no such law than he could have given us in regard I do not think this evil is to any other law.

I should imagine that this B ill will not take very long to deal with. In fact, I am surprised that so much time has been devoted to it elsewhere. I do not think that would have happened except for clause 45, which has given rise to considerable discussion. I shall not take long to-night to explain the Bill, because it is to a very large extent composed of an amalgamation of the provisions of existing State laws. When the Commonwealth was formed, I presume that it was not expected by the Statas that the Commonwealth Government would not exercise the powers that are given to it under the Constitution. Having power to deal with questions such as the acquisition of property, there must be some law under which to deal in detail with all those matters ; and I think the fairest and simplest method that could be devised is that which has been adopted in connection with this Bill, to import the simple machinery which is in existence in the States. There is no desireI am sure it is not thought that there is any desireon the part of the Commonwealth Ministry or the Commonwealth Parliament to press unduly in any way on the States; though I should like to from some statements which I have seen in the public press one would imagine that it was intended to do some injury to them in connection with property that has been taken and will be taken in the future. But a thought will show that that is not the case. The Commonwealth is representative of the States, whose property, as will be shown by-and-by, though it comes under the power of the Commonwealth, is really still owned by the taxpayers to whom it previously belonged in the States. What have a general is taking place is simply a transference from the ownership of the States to the ownership of the same people in the Commonwealth. It is for this Parliament to devise means by which we can deal fairly and without friction of any kind with the States from whom we are taking property. The Bill is divided into seven different parts, and it commences with a provision giving power to acquire property by purchase. The third clause of the Bill provides that the Governor General may enter into an arrangementWith the owners of any land which is required for any public purpose, and with any State where such land is Crown land of the State, for the absolute purchase by the Commonwealth, for a consideration in money or its equivalent of such land. That, of course, is a preliminary to dealing with other matters; and honourable members will find as we proceed with the Bill that it is intended to give power to the Commonwealth to compulsorily acquire land. If we cannot agree with the States or with an individual, the next course must be to acquire by compulsion; and clause 6 provides that the Commonwealth may have power to acquire land compulsorily for any",59,Malcolm Mceacharn Those And Professional Men Of Various Kinds Were

SOLOMON -Until the High Court is established, what is to be done 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think there is a provision in the Bill as to a State court dealing with the matter. There is rather a stringent provision in the Bill which precludes a Judge from referring a matter to arbitration unless witb tlie consent of both parties. This is an innovation in comparison with the law as it stands in New South Wales. In that State a Judge may refer a case to arbitration. If it is an intricate case which would occupy the time of the court for a considerable period, he may appoint an arbitrator. I happen to know that is so, because I have had to deal with one or two cases in which arbitration has been ordered. The Bill sets forth that the justice must give the award, and there is to be no .arbitration without the consent of both parties. The next provision, which will be found in clause 17, is in regard to compensation. Sometimes only a portion of a block of land may be taken over, and it may be that in dividing the land the Federal Government may erect buildings, excavate channels, or carry out other works that will injure the remaining portion. There is a provision in clause 17 that if there is any injury done to the portion which is left, the owner shall have the right to compensation for that injury. As against that, however, the iand is to be taken over at the value at ' which it was assessed on the 1 st January previous to the date on which it is acquired. Very likely there will be some discussion on that point. The provision is inserted with a view of protecting the Commonwealth from any increased payment due to the value of the land being raised by the action of the Government in taking it over. In the case of land taken over in the last quarter, or the last month of the year, the value is to be fixed as on the 1st January preceding, but it may happen in some cases that the value has increased prior to tlie action of the Government. It may be necessary, therefore, to insert some provision in order to prevent any grave injustice being done to the individual. All that is desired is that as the result of the action of the Government in acquiring the. land there shall be no increased value for which we shall have to pay. If an increase has taken place between the 1st January and the date of the acquisition of the property, without being attributable to the action of the Government, then it would not be fair to take away the owner's just claim in regard to it . present. Sir AVILLIAMLYNE I will not say that there is a weakness there; but it mav be necessary to amend the clause so as to prevent a possible injury being done to any individual whose land is compulsorily acquired. Then, supposing the Attorney-General finds that the deeds of the land are absolutely correct, that everything is in order, and notification is given to the individual that the Government raise no objection, there is a provision that the Government must be prepared to pay the money for the land, under whatever arrangement is made, within one month. Speaking from the very large experience I have had in connection with these resumptions, that seems to me to be rather a short time to allow; but the advantage is in favour of the individual whose land is being taken from him. If the Government do not pay the compensation within one month, they have to pay",61,Property Acquisiti On Bill

451,Mr Glynn,"The clause does so at the individual interest at the rate of 3 per -oent. on the amount of the compensation which they ultimately have to pay. That is a very great improvement, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, upon what has existed in some of the States. I had last year to bring in a Billi n the State of New South Wales with a view to reducing, from C to 4 per cent., the amount of interest payable to owners of land when compensation was not paid immediately on the resumption -of any property. There the law for a great many years made a payment of 6 per cent, interest necessary. It was availed of for a great many years, and I speak advisedly when I say that in many cases the owner -of the land did not try to get a settlement because he was all the time getting 6 per -cent, from the Government. That was a very high and a ruinous interest for the Government to pay, and in some cases the .settlement extended over ten or fifteen years, and the individual was receiving the 6 per cent, interest all the time. The object of this clause clearly is to induce the owner of the land to get a settlement as soon -as possible, and to meet the Government in as fair a way as he can. Part4 of the B ill deals with the question of mortgages, -charges, and leases. AVhere the mortgage upon land or property is for a larger amount than the amount at which the property is valued, it is necessary that there should be some method of dealing with it . The method proposed is that the Government shall treat with the mortgagee, and if they -cannot come to terms with him the mortgagee has just the same right as any other -individual to get a settlement of his claim through the High Court. There is also a provision in clause 40 that if the land is under lease to a tenant, the tenant is not to be turned out of his possession without some compensation, and under the Bill he will be dealt with in as fair a way as the -Commonwealth proposes to deal with the individual owners of land or with the States. Part5 of the Bill deals with land and property acquired from a State. It is on this part of the Bill that I .anticipate all the discussion will take place, and as honourable members are aware the Priine Minister has promised not to deal with clause 45 until an opportunity is given to the representatives of the various States to discuss it. I think I shall be able to show before T sit down that on this particular matter, which is a debatable matter, an alarm has 16 B been created which I hope is scarcely justifiable, and may be looked upon merely as an alarm and not as a reality. Under section 85 of the Constitution power is given to the Commonwealth to resume land and property. It providesWhen any department of the public servioe of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth1. All property of the State of any kind used exclusively in connection with the department shall become vested in the Commonwealth ; but in the case of the departments controlling Customs and Exciseand Bounties, for such time only as the Governor General in Council may declare to be necessary. Mr A"". L . SOLOMON -No declaration in 7 regard to these departments has yet been made. has been arrived at yet. Under sub-section (2) it is providedThe Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind, used, but not exclusively used, in connection with the department. That seems to me to point clearly, and I have no doubt it was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution, to the fact that there are many Custom-houses on the borders of the States that have been required while Customs duties have been collected between the States. By-and-by, and in some cases even at present, these will not be required at all, and it would be manifestly unfair to saddle the Commonwealtb with all these buildings when we do. not want them. There is, therefore, a. provision in the Constitution, which is reflected in the Bill now under discussion, that when we do not require these buildings or any other buildings-it is not restricted to that class of buildings which I referred to only because it seems to me that they were specially in the minds of the framers of the Constitution at the time-w e need not take them over absolutely. section 85 to which the honourable member refers.

455,Sir Avilliam Lyne,"Quite so : or forthey will he returned to the State, and we shall pay rent for them only up to that time. I wish to direct attention to this particular section which seems to me a very wise provision and which, as I say, is reflected in this Bill, to show that we shall not not be called upon to keep any property, which has automatically come over to the Commonwealth, longer than we require to keep it in connection with the business between the various States. 2. It is sub-section (1) to which the honourable member is referring. providesThe Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind, used, but not exclusively used, in connection with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the maimer in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken b}' the State for publicpurposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth. That is the particular sub-section, and I have already quoted sub-section (1). In this Bill, clause 43 provides(1) Where any Crown land of a State is acquired under this Act, the State shall, subject to the Constitution, be entitled to compensation for the value thereof. (2) The value of the title or interest of the State to and in such land shall be estimated as if the Commonwealth not to disturb existing the State were the proprietor of an estate in fee simple in such land, subject to any estate or inpay for the properties. terest which any person may at the time of such acquisition have in such land. (3) The State shall not be entitled to compensation in respect of the loss of any rights of dominion, taxation, or revenue, or in respect of the severance of such land from any other land of the State, or in respect of any injury to any other land of the State. The latter sub-clause was put in, as honourable members will understand, with a view to prevent any compensation being paid because we take a part of a State. It is simply the value of the land, without considering the decrease it gives to the area of the State that we have to pay. that the Commonwealth has to pay for the Crown land of a State? Sir WILLIAM LYNE Crown land for the federal city, but for the Crown land of a State for any other purpose. conformity with the Constitution. Without looking into it very carefully, I thinkthere is a provision to deal with Crownland in the same way as land takenfrom private individuals, and the representative named by the State is to act in the same way, and have the same powers, as an individual in dealing with his own land. tion 51 provides for the acquisition of property on ""just terms"" from any State oiperson. Sir WILLIAM LYNE We are providing for just terms in this Bill. Clause 44 saysTbe compensation payable to a State in respect of any land acquired under this Act may, at tlie option of the Governor General, be paid in any one or more of the following modes, that is to say(a) by payment to the State of the amount of such compensation; or {!>) by the Commonwealth becoming responsible to tlie State for its liabilityfor principal and interest in respect of such a part of the public debt of the State as is the actuarial equivalent of athree-andone-half per cent, loan of the same currency and of the amount of such, compensation. That is the clause under which, I think, in nearly all cases, if not in all, thesematters will be dealt with. If it were the case of a large purchase it might be convenient as between the State or States and arrangements by borrowing a large sum to On the other hand, where the compensation does not come to so much, it may be better to pay the amount which is decided upon. Now comes the clause about which there has been so much discussion. We cannot go outside the Commonwealth Act, and the whole question in dispute, if. I may use that word, is whether or not the properties that have been taken over or have come over from the States to the Commonwealth automatically will come under sub-section (2) of section 89The Commonwealth shall debit to each State(a) The expenditure therein of the Commonwealth incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance as at the time of transfer of any department transN o t for the ferred from the State to the Commonwealth.

The undersecretary of the Attorney-General's department expressed the opinion to me that it was not necessary, but if it is shown in the course of the discussion, or the Attorney General advises me that it is necessary to have the federal capital territory expressly exempted, we can insert a provision to that effect. Clause 53 provides, as is enacted in all State Acts, that on the acquisition of any property the Government shall have power to at once take possession and carry out all necessary temporary works. Power is also taken to go on to adjoining land, if necessary, to carry out works on the land that is acquired, and if any damage is clone compensation will have to be paid. the Constitution Act will that power be taken ? Sir AVILLIAMLYNE the honourable and learned member the section of the Constitution bearing upon tlie matter, but he will fully understand that it is absolutely necessary to have such a power in cases where it is desired to build on the boundary of the acquired land, or to erect fences, and so on. Under clause 61 power is given to dedicate land to any public purpose by proclamation, and the proclamation may be revoked, cancelled, or altered as may be deemed necessary. It is necessary to have this provision, because grants of various kinds will have to be made for public purposes, and the Commonwealth must be endowed with the same power as is given under similar Acts in the various States. Clause 62, which is the last in the Bill, gives power to make regulations. As I previously explained, the Bill is a short one, and is mainly based upon Acts in force in the various States. I feel that a misconception has arisen through the quoting of the figures which I have referred to tonight, as to the values of the properties to be taken over, but a great deal of that trouble will be smoothed away when it is thoroughly understood that no reliance is to be reposed in these figures as guides to the actual values of the properties. These values will have to be arrived at in an entirely -different manner, and after fair conShoud not the land sideration of the valuations made on both sides. AVhen that is understood, and the method in which we are to pay or not to pay-that is, to allow things to remain as they are-is clearly grasped, there will, I am sure, be no objection to agreeing to this Bill without much discussion. I shall not say anything further at the present stage, but if honourable members are prepared to go on with the discussion for an hour tonight, I shall be very glad. If on the other hand there is a strong feeling that the discussion should be postponed, I shall be quite willing to take that course. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). It is so early in the evening that I think that if any of us can assist in the pushing on of the Bill we should do so, and although somewhat ill-prepared to speak at this stage, I will take the liberty of offering a few remarks. In the first place I must express considerable surprise that a Bill of this nature, after having passed through all its stages in another branch of the Legislature, and having been presented to this House, be virtually referred to an I cannot tell irresponsible conference, consisting of the Premiers and other representatives of the different States, who are to consult, not with this House, in whose hands the measure is at present, but with the members of the Federal Government. It does seem to me to be a bit of a farce-to put the matter in very mild language-to take that step at this stage. If it were necessary to consult with the representatives of the various States as to the mode in which they desired to be paid for the buildings and land in connection with the transferred departments, that consultation should have been held before the Bil l was drafted and placed before the two branches of the Legislature. Now the work already done by the Senate is to be reviewed, and its decisions are to be commented on and discussed by representatives of the different States, and",65,Property Acquisiti On Bill

469,Mr Higgins,"Unde r what authority i nwe are told by the Minister in charge of the Bill that the Premier states that it is not desired to deal with the most important clause in the Bill, which involves the repayments to the States of the amounts due to them, until he has discussed the position with the various State Premiers and Treasurers. The representatives of the States are thus to be called upon to practically intervene whilst this Parliament is considering a certain measure. ably found that he could not go on with the Bill without taking that course. MrV . L . SOLOMON I take it that the proper course would have been to have consulted with the State Premiers as to the mode in which the different Parliaments would have liked the properties to be paid for, before the Bill was drafted at all, and before the two branches of this Parliament had been called upon to waste a large amount of time in discussing a measure which has to be reviewed by others who do not represent the people of Australia or the various States one whit more, if as much, as we represent them. That does seem to me a strange departure i u this early stage of our Commonwealth historya departure which should not be allowed to pass unchallenged by honourable members. MrG LYNN -They were bound to have had that conference under the Constitution before they introduced the Bill. MrV . L . SOLOMON I accept the statement of the honourable and learned member, and agree that it would have been wiser to have known tbe opinions of the various State Parliaments, although those opinions can be pretty accurately gleaned by a reference to the debates in the Federal Convention. I have a very clear recollection that in those debates the consensus of opinion was that it was highly inadvisable that large sums of money-the equivalent value of the various properties transferred by the different States, such as Customs-houses, post-offices, &c -shoul d be handed back to the States, because such a course of procedure would probably result in extravagence. refreshing my memory by a glance at some of tbe discussions, and I find that there was a special amendment which the Parliament of South Australia desired to have inserted dealing with this particular point. My colleague, the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, dealt with it at considerable length. The general opinion expressed then was that the mode of payment which ought to be adopted by the Commonwealth was the taking over from the various States of a proportion of their debts equivalent to the value of the transferred properties, so that all temptations to undue extravagance such as might assail the Treasurers of the Statesi f they were suddenly placed in possession of manyhundreds ofthousands ofpoundswould be removed. But I shall have to deal with this point a little later on. I wish to say a word or two in regard to clause 14, which contains a reference to the method to be adoptedintakingoverproperties from private individuals. I wish to point out that that clause provides-and tbe provision appears to have been taken from the New South Wales Act of 1897-that the decision as to the compensation claimed by any person whose property is taken by the Commonweiilth shall be entirely in the hands of a justice of the High Court. In some of the other States -notabl y that of South Australia-the amount is first fixed by a board of arbitration, with an appeal subsequently to the Supreme Court. In the first place, arbitrators are appointed by the Government and by the party aggrieved, with an umpire to be agreed upon by the two. Such a course is, I think, preferable to that which is adopted in this Bill. It does seem hard that a man should be forced to go to the most expensive tribunal from a legal point of view-namely , the High Courtto have his claim for compensation decided without first being allowed an ojrportunity of a much simpler and more inexpensive means such as is provided by an arbitration board. South Australia 1 MrV . L . SOLOMON -Undoubtedly . In all questions of commercial value where the question in dispute is a simple one which can be decided by expert evidence in a few hours, I think that arbitrations are much more speedy, inexpensive, and satisfactory than appeals to courts with extreme jurisTo-night I have been diction. speaking of juries?

MrV . L . SOLOMON I am not dealing with that point. But if in the meantime it is necessaiy for the Commonwealth to take over any properties under this particular clause there is no court provided to which the owners can appeal. people fighting themselves. MrV . L . SOLOMON I do not think that a private individual as a unit of the Commonwealth would pause very much to consider whether he was fighting himself and had to pay one four-mulionth part of the verdict, if he saw a chance of getting a few thousand pounds out of the Commonwealth purse. MrV . L . SOLOMON I was alluding to cases in which the Commonwealth acquires property from a private individual. It is for the private individual to claim what compensation he is entitled to for the resumption of his property. Sir able member suggest that there should be arbitration before the matter goes to the court t must recollect that this clause provides for a Judge without a jury. MrV . L . SOLOMON A Judge without a jury is perhaps better. cheaper than any arbitration. MrV . L . SOLOMON I dare say that honourable members will be able to judge of the wisdom or otherwise of doing what I suggest. I wish also to point out that in section 85 of the Constitution Act there appears to have been an omission made by the Government in regard to the declaration which is provided for. We are starting to discuss this B ill on the presumption that thewholeof theproperties of the departments, including those of Post-offices and Customhouses, are to be taken over. The valuation which has been provided for includes the buildings connected with the Customhouses, except those small border Customs buildings, which are of very little moment. I think £10,500,00 0 has been estimated as the value of these various properties, and that sum was meant to include the whole of the Customs-houses in the different States. Unless that is so, the Commonwealth Government having taken over the properties It will be just as well if it of the departments, it seems to me that under sub-section (1) of section 85 of the Constitution, a declaration such as is there provided should have been made. I point that out to the Minister, because I certainly think there has been an oversight. If the Government do not intend to take over the buildings in connection with this departI t would be a case of the ment, or only to take them over for a given time, a declaration should have been made. I am not aware that such a declaration has been made, and I do not think it has, though perhaps the Minister may inform us later on. declaration made, but we do not want two sets of Customs-houses along the borders. MrV . L . SOLOMON -But I take it that the value of the Customs-houses on the borders is not a great deal. Sir WILLIAM LYNE In some cases, of course, the value is not great. MrV . L . SOLOMON -As a general rule the Custom-house consists of a t in and wood shanty. ber is wrong there. MrV . L . SOLOMON A great number of tlie buildings are of that kind, and their The honourable member value can be estimated in hundreds of pounds, and certainly not in thousands or tens of thousands. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth Government may take over the whole of the properties in connection with the various transferred departments, and pay to the various States their fair value. Dealing first with clause 44, it seems to me that if the Bill had stopped at that clause there would have been very little matter, either for complaint on the part of the States interested or for discussion in this Parliament. The mode of payment provided under this clause is evidently the true interpretation of what was intended at the time tbe Constitution was framed. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I forgot to say that clause 45 does not of necessity come into operation. It only comes into operation under certain circumstances. MrV . L .

487,Sir Avilliam Lyne,"It was introducedblot, and it was put in, not with a view of indicating to the Commonwealth Parliament that there was any idea that one-fourth of the Customs revenue of the various States should be expended by the Commonwealth Parliament, but as a maximum limitation. I am sure that honourable members will agree that that was the idea in connection with the new services. I have a distinct recollection that, at that time, the estimate for the new expenditure of the Commonwealth was something about £300,000 per annum. It was provided that, as a mode of keeping accounts, each State was first of all to be credited with the Customs revenue derived in that State and with the revenues from the various departments of that particular State taken over by the Commonwealth, and was then to be debited with the expenditure in connection with each of those departments, and in addition to that was to be debited with eventually ? its proportion of the new expenditure of the Commonwealth. The new expenditure included the cost of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Judiciary, the Inter-State Commission, and other new departments which only came into existence by reason of the establishment of the Commonwealth, In connection with the transferred departments, it was clearly laid down that tlie system of bookkeeping to continue for a period of ten years was to be such as would allow the accounts of each of the States to be kept separately. credited with its revenue from the Customs, the Post-office, and from the various departments transferred, .and was in turn to be debited with its expenditure* whilst, when it came to the new departments, each State was to be debited with a proportion of its expenditure, per capita of its population. expenditure? MrV . L . SOLOMON I do not think it does. I cannot imagine for an instant that it was ever contemplated that the States were going to hand over their properties in connection with the various departments, and were then going to have the whole amount'pooled, and be credited in proportion to their population. As far as my recollection goes there was no suggestion of such a course being -adopted during the whole of the debates at tbe Convention. -If the Postal department taken over from any State includes buildings worth a million pounds, the interest at 3Jper cent, being £35,000 per annum, while that State is. credited with its revenue from that Postal department on the one hand, it is debited with the expenditure of the department on the other, and it will also have to be debited as part of the expenditure on that department with the interest on the cost of thosebuildings during tlie bookkeeping period, asprovided under the Constitution. to the State. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Precisely . It is taking money out of one pocket and putting it into the other so far as the State is concerned j but there is this difference : that the State has been relieved of that million of money for which the Commonwealth becomes eventually responsible. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The Commonwealth. per head of the population. MrV . L . SOLOMON -It may be that ultimately, years hence, the population will, have to pay in proportion to the number in each State, but only when the principal is paid. In the meantime, for ten years, the interest on the debts of the Stateswill have to be paid by the States. Fori nstance, in New South Wales, if the transEach State was to be ferred properties amount to £3,000,000, that State will have to be debited each year with the interest upon that £3,000,000, whilst she is credited also with the revenue from the transferred departments. There is another mode in which the matter mightbe dealt with. Instead of taking over a proportion of the debts, it is perfectly competent for the Federal Government either to float a loan, which would enable them to pay over the whole of the cash value of these various properties to each State; or, on the other hand, to issue bonds bearing a rate of interest to be agreed upon to the amount of the gross aggregate value of the whole of these properties, and to pay each respective State the value of those properties in such interest-bearing bonds. stitution enables the Government to do what is proposed ?

VENTILATION OF THE CHAMBER That the House do now adjourn. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I wish to refer briefly to an answer given to me to-day by the Ministeri n charge of the Postal department in reference to tlie employment of Asiatic aliens in the Postal and Telegraph department in the Northern Territory. I am quite aware that these men were employed for some time before the department was taken over by the Commonwealth. On many occasions I have endeavoured to put a stop to the practice, and I trust now that the attention of the Government has been called to the matter, that that which I was unable to do in the State Parliament will be done readily by the Federal Government. ber know the capacity in which these persons are employed 1 MrV . L . SOLOMON -They are employed as assistant line men, cooks, office boys, and in various other capacities. A great many more were employed for some years, but continual driving at the South Australian authorities led to the dismissal or removal of a number of them. I trust that the ^Government will take an early opportunity of dispensing with the services of all Asiatics who can be dismissed. A t the same time. I would ask the Prime Minister to look into the question as it affects tlie Customs department. particulars in regard to all the departments that have been transferred. May I add to the numerous troubles of the Prime Minister by pointing out that he might see whether there is not some means tion of this chamber. One of the greatest evils a debating body can suffer from is that of not having fresh air. I think the Prime Minister must have felt, as visitors even have felt, that the air in this chamber gets vitiated very quickly. There is a kind of device for raising the hair of those who sit on the extreme back bench, but I must say that it does not seem to purify the air. I am quite sure that a little expenditure would bers and in the clearness of the ideas expressed by them. the attention of the Minister for Defence to a report relating to the court martialling of an Australian soldier in South Africa. In the Age of Saturday last a foe simile was published of the order made by a court martial against a member of one of the Victorian contingents. I do not look upon this as a Victorian affair. I regard it as an Australian matter. I have been a soldier myself, and I can quite understand the feelings of the irregular troops that are serving in South Africa today. When I was serving in South Africa from 1877 to 1881, the troops raised locally were called irregulars. They were not subject to the same laws and regulations as the Imperial troops except in regard to loot. For the committal of crimes for which an Imperial soldier would be flogged, these irregulars-consistin g of the Natal Field Horse, the Diamond Field Horse, Brabant's Horse and others similar to those in Australia-were subjected to heavy fines. After being fined once or twice, they were liable to be expelled not only from the force, but from the colony. Of course I have only the testimony of the Age, but knowing what I do of militarism, and the",70,Property Acquisiti On Bill

498,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I wish to drawmanner in which court marfcials are conducted, I think it gives a fair and square account of what took place. for Defence and many honourable members will doubtless meet me with the argument that we must not put too much faith in newspaper reports. All that I have to say in regard to that is that it is quite possible that but for the exposure made by tlie Age, no one in the Commonwealth would have known of the incident. I consider that the punishment which has been meted out to these men who went to South Africa to yield their lives, if necessary, in the cause of the Empire, is altogether unjustifiable. During the last three or four months we have heard a lot of screeching about what the Australians have done. I should like to have the gentleman here who called these troops "" whitelivered curs."" If I had him in this chamber for five minutes I should show him whether they are white-livered curs or not. These men are defending the fair name of our Commonwealth, and for an officer to make use of such an expression is an unwarrantable insult. When they were wanted as scouts and for regular work it was all right ; but now that it is desired to they are doing police duty now they are not good enough. disgraced themselves like a lot of those who have been sent out to South Africa from Great Britain. We know that one General has alluded to the City Imperial Volunteers, about whom so much fuss was made, as being always in the way.

So far as my countrymen are concerned, they gize ? are quite able and willing to take their own part. I am taking the part of those Ausletter I have received. tralians who are languishing in gaol for comwould not apologize. According to that mitting a crime which they considered was letter, Major McKnight said, "" Very well, not an offence at all. When they were consir, I shall make a note of this and report fronted by this gentleman in gold lace and you to tbe proper authorities."" Whether jingling spurs, these soldiers, being used to that was done or not I do not know, but the nomadic life, and the free and easy way from my knowledge of military methods I of Australians, as I hope they will be alam quite sure that if Major McKnight's ways, objected to his insults. I happen to note was brought before the proper authoriknow the overbearing manner of some of ties it was promptly pigeon-holed, and there these British officers. It is bad enough for will be no redress for Steele. Knowing this, an Imperial soldier that he is bound to obey all I askis that some effort shall be made and that he is brought up in such a strict to sift these statements and find out disciplinarian manner. If I had committed whether they are true, because if this' the same act as that with which the court man has been convicted upon evidence.such martial dealt, I should have expected to be shot. As an Imperial soldier no doubt I The Minister would have beeu shot. When the Australians first arrived in South Africa, however, Lord Roberts stated that in regard to discipline they were not to be treated in the same way as Imperial soldiers, and I cannot see why, as soon as he left the country, Lord Kitchener and the rest of his officers should have forgotten that fact. I see by the Herald that Major McKnight is expected to arrive here about the 10th or 12th inst., and I shall be quite satisfied if the Government promise to go thoroughly into the matter and to do their best, if they cannot secure a pardon for the Victorian soldier who has been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, to at least have him sent back to Australia. According to the Age, he is now languishing in an English prison. Major McKnight took down the words to which this soldier and others of his contingent objected. I have in my possession a letter from a man who has served with the Australian troops in South Africa, but does not know the individual in this case. He states that Major McKnight took down the words that were used by the make policemen of them and officer in question. Brigadier-General Beatson stigmatized them as a "" fat damned lot of They have never wasters."" That is a fine expression for an officer to use. During my whole military experience I never heard a general express himself in such terms to a private soldier. Later on he called them "" a white-livered lot of curs."" Then the men resented this, and Steele, who was one of those who rescape-goat, while the officer has escaped He said he",71,Australian Troops In South Africa Pacific Islands Labourers Bill

If it is not possible to get them to-night before the House adjourns, 1 hope an effort will be mode to let us have them in the morning, because a mail leaves to-morrow afternoon for Queensland, which it will be necessary for us to catch if we wish to avoid delay in sending copies of the measure to the north. Minister for External Affairs), in reply If the honourable member will allow me, I may say that we have made arrangements about that. presented to us by the authorities of Queensland that it would be acceptable to them to receive a number of copies of the measure. The Postmaster-General seconded that request, and I have promised to send about 120 copies to Queensland by the first mail. I think those copies have just been received, and are in my room at the present time. copies should now be distributed to honourable members. The copies required for Queensland can be provided in sufficient time for to-morrow. objection to that being done. As to the question raised about the ventilation of this chamber, I am sorry to hear , there are so many complaints about it. It has been rather cold this winter, but on the other hand it is very cool in summer. That is one thing to be said in its favour. When we sat here in the Convention we hod nine days of hot winds, and this chamber was then the coolest place in Melbourne. I hope honourable members will remember that sometimes it may be the best place to sit in. The matter will be looked into, but of course no structural alterations can he made in the building without due consultation with the persons to whom it belongs. As to the matter raised by the honourable member for Maranoa, it is my intention to collect such information, and as much information as I can, upon the subject. He will forgive me if I say that I cannot undertake to base my belief on this matter wholly on newspaper reports. Those who have official responsibilities must await more authoritative information than is conveyed in a newspaper report. Newspapers are no doubt most useful ; but at the same time the varying statements which appear through these channels cannot be accepted as definite evidence upon which we can act; certainly no Government can act upon them. WhatI propose to do is to make inquiries. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Maranoa will think that any of these men were subjected to any treatment which a British soldier would not have been subjected to, or that in the method of trial they were treated in any way other than as British soldiers. Having taken the oath of allegiance and fully enlisted, they became subject to the Army Act and the Articles of War, It was rewhich were applicable to them as to everybody else. Consequently, as the honourable member has said, had he or I done the same thing, we might have been subject to the same sentence. We do not know anything about this matter absolutely, until we get the official information which may be forthcoming. ThatI have already asked my right honourable friend the Minister for Defence to procure at the earliest possible moment. Until we see exactly how matters stand, the House will agree with me that we may render ourselves, perhaps, ridiculous if we take premature action. So far as the action of these men is concerned, I am perfectly willing to believe that it may have been some passing ebullition of temper, and that they may have been too severely treated. We do not know anything about that, but it is quite possible it was so. We know, also, that however much men may be endeavouring to do their duty as officers, they, too, are subject to fits of temper at times, and may give provocation to those under them. A t the some time my honourable friend will, I am quite sure, be the last to say that the private soldier is to bo tbe judge of his general or to overrule his authority. honourable member will not say anything of the kind.
