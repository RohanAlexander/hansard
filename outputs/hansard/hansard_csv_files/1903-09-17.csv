17,Sir John Forrest (Swan,"Minister,evening. It was stated by the honourable and learned member t h a t a large number of t h e men belonging to the R o y a l A u s t r a l i a n A r t ill e r y were being kept in Melbourne, instead of being stationed a t the forts a t the entrance to P o r t P h ill i p . The inference I gathered from the honourable member's remurks was thafc the number of men now in Melbourne was larger than formerly, and t h a t these soldiers would be better employed in looking after the guns at the forts. If in dfchafcthere are 232 men on the establishment of the RoyalA u s t r a l i a n A r t i l lery in V i c to r i a . stationed afc P o r t P h ill i p Heads, 85 are at the V i c to r i a Barracks, and there are five vacancies. I am informed by the General Officer Commandin g thafc there are t h i r t y less Permanent GarrisonA r t ill e r y m e n now in M e l bourne than immediately prior to Federation. This small detachment of eighfcy-five men is n o w ' k e pt in Melbourne for the purposes of guarding Government House, for m in g guards of honour, escorts to fche Governor General, performing technical duties, and g i v in g in structional services in connection w it h the schools of instruction recently established for the M i l it i a and Volunteers. W it h regard to the case of Sergeant-Major Coffey, who, we were informed, had died of phthisis and from disease contracted in SouthA f r i c a , I am informed as follows :Sergeant-Major Coffey served with the first Victorian contingent, and was invalided suffering from phthisis. He was granted a temporary pension of 3s. 6d. per diein by the Imperial authorities on oth August, 1901, and the State Government supplemented this by another 3s. 6d. per deim. He died on the 18th September, 1902, and the widow was granted £10 for his funeral expenses, and has since been in receipt of an allowance of 21s. per week from the Patriotic Fund Committee. The conditions attached to pensions provide that unless the soldier dies within twelve months of the date of contracting the illness, no pension is granted to the widow or relative. Sergeant-Major Coffey did not die until two years after contracting the disease. A representation with regard to Mrs. Coffey has, however, been sent to the Imperial Government, on 22nd May last, asking their favorable consideration as regards the case of the widow. the reply Government % Sir JOHN FORREST y e t been received. statement thafc the pay of the Permanent A r t ill e r y m e n in V i c to r i a had been reduced, I find t h a t the f o l l o w i ng are the facts :New rates of pay for fche Permanent Artillery were adopted from the 1st of July, 1902, to apply to all new appointments, and to those serving only when re-engaged or promoted ; and these rates were in accordance with the rates of pay recommended by a Pay Committee appointed specially to consider the same. These new rates of pay, as compared with the old rates of pay in the three large States, where there are the largest establishments of Permanent Artillery, viz., New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, are an increase on the average daily rate for non-commissioned officers and meu ; but involve a decrease in Victoria in all ranks except that of warrant officer. Thej' are an increase on the old rates in New South Wales aud Queensland. Therefore when non-commissioned officers or men at present serving, finish their period of engagement, they Of these, 142 are lose in pay in Victoria, except in the case of warrant officers, but gain in all ranks in the cases of New South Wales and Queensland.' The honourable and learned member entertains the view t h a t officers are treated better t h a n the men under the new Pay regulations. Thafc is not so. I find t h a t fche facts are as follow :W it h regard to officers, the new rates of pay adopted for them are less than the former prevailing rates for the respective ranks in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. Whereas no non-commissioned officer' or man has been brought on the new rates unless he is re-engaged or promoted, all offieers were brought on the new rates of pay at once, and fourteen of them in consequence suffered a reduction in pay, the rule being adopted that where the officer's salary was above the maximum of the new rates, it was brought down to the maximum. Concerning the remarks of the honourable and learned member in reference to the reduction of 6d. per day in the pay of the carters in V i c to r i a , I find t h a t When the new rates of pay were adopted, all fche rates or allowances for special duty pay were revised by the artillery officers, and whilst two carters in Victoria previously received Is. special duty pay per day in connection with carting the stores, they now, under the new special duty pay, receive only 6d per day. The total pay, however, with these allowances, amounts to 4s. per diem, or 28s. per week, and this is, of course, exclusive of their rations, uniform, quarters, fuel, light, and medical attendance. These privileges may certainly be said to equal, at least, 2s. per diem more, which would give a total remuneration equivalent to 42s. per week (6s. per diem, as thej' are paid for Sundaj's). It is understood that the usual pay of carters employed civilly is not so high as 42s. per week. As was the nature of a general rule, the amount of carting done for the Victorian Artillery is not very onerous. received from the Imperial This informatio n was supplied to me only No reply has as thi s morning, and I thought it would prove W it h regard to the interesting to honourable members, and especially to the honourable and learned member for Corio, to whom I shall be very glad to f u r n i sh a copy. intended speaking at some length upon",13,Department Of Defence
18,Mr Brown,What,14,Department Of Defence
19,Mr Thomson ( N O R T H S Y D N E Y ),"I hadvarious matters whioh are included in these Estimates, but as there is a general desire to adjourn over to-morrow and to secure an early division upon the amendment which has been indicated, I shall make my remarks exceedingly brief. Concerning that amendment I merely desire to say that, having appointed a military expert-and , consequently, having decided that an expert's services were necessary-it is a serious step to take the management of the forces out of his hands. I quite agree that it is for us to outline the policy which should be pursued, and to state definitely the amount of money which we are prepared to expend for military purposes ; but having done thafc, it is scarcely desirablefchafcwe should take the details relatingfcothe control of the forces oufc of the hands of the General Oflicer Commanding. If we wish to do anything in that direction we should deal either wifch fche Minister or with fche expert when the term of his engagement has expired. For these reasons I do nofc think it is advisable-es pecially as the saving which would be effected is a very trifling one-fo rfcheCommittee to interfere in mere matters of detail. I am strongly in favour of the exercise of economy in connection with our Defence Forces. Bufc with fchat economy I think we should have efficiency, and under the present arrangement I fear that we are not getting efficiency. For instance, iu, connection with our arms-ou r guns and rifles-and wifch our forts we have notfchafcperfection which is essential if we are to be secure against a sudden attack. If fche South African war has proved anything, it is that under conditions such as would exist in case of an attack upon Australia, we require not so much highly trained men as troops possessed of a certain amount of efficiency in military movements, and experienced in the use of the most perfect weapons which can be placed in their * hands. If we do not secure that, ovir whole defence system rests upon a rotten foundation. I have in my possession some data wbich I had intended to place before the Minister, but in deference to the desire of the Committee, I shall reserve it t ill next week, when I shall have another opportunity of addressing myself to this matter. A t the present moment, how ever, I shall content myself with saying that all the , forces upon which we should have to rely in time of warwhether they be partially paid, volunteer, or reserve forces,fchelast named consisting 10 Q 2 largely of the members of rifle clubs-shoul d be armed wifchfchemost up-to-date weapons. The only way in which they can be so equipped is by the Government providing the arms. They are beginning to provide them in fche case of volunteer and partially paid forces; but they seem to have made up their minds not to do so in the case of that branch of our Defence Forces whose services are specially devoted to attaining proficiency in rifle shooting. I think that is a wrong policy. I am sure that, whilst keeping down expenditure in all directions in which a fair return forfcheoutlay is not forthcoming, this Committee is sensible and patriotic enough to vote any sum that is necessary to provide those munitions of war without which all our defence expenditure is practically valueless. That is the position which I had intended to put before the Committee afc greater length, but in deference to the general desire to adjourn over to-morrow and to secure an early division upon the amendment which has been outlined, I shall not occupy further time. rightly understand the temper of this Parliament concerning matters of defence it is that fche Commonwealth forces sliall consist of fche adult male population of the Commonwealth. Indeed we have gone a little further than thafc We have decided that it shall comprise all our male population from eighteen years of age upwards. In perusing the report of the General Officer Commanding, I notice thafc he speaks very highly of fche cadet corps and the rifle clubs. But when I come fco examine fche provision which haa been"" made in the Estimates for these branches of our defence, I find that his words represent so much empty sound. Very little money has been appropriated for their encouragement. I am thoroughly in accord with all that has been said by the honourable member for North Sydney, and with much more thafc he might have said in regard to the treatment of these two branches of our defence force. I would specially direct the attention of fche Minister to the fact thafc a very large number of the men who have devoted their time, and a considerable portion of their substance to qualifying themselves as expert marksmen, have purchased their own weapons. But, as honourable members are aware, fche barrel of a rifle is serviceable only for the discharge of about 13,000 rounds of ammunition. Time after time the Department has been approached",14,Department Of Defence

30,Mr Wilkinson,"I bhink bhe Mintliis House, and the country generally, we should begin our training in the schools. Cadets should be drilled until they leave .school at the age of fourteen, and we should continue to train them until they are old enough to join the rifle clubs. We should .drill and arm them, so that when they are old enough to join rifle clubs they will be able to do good work. If we adopt that system we shall obtain a force which, in a time of emergency, will be able to render a good account of itself. I am reminded that there is a desire to go to a division without delay, and, in view of that fact, I shall bring before the notice of the Minister in his .own Department several matters which I proposed otherwise to put before the Committee. I desire, however, to request the Minister to explain the disparity which exists between the salaries paid to certain officers in one of the most important branches of our Defence Eorces. I refer to the instructional staff, or, in other words, the drill instructors. I understood that with the creation of the Commonwealth we were to obtain uniformity. When the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General visited Brisbane to help the cause of Federation they said that, with the establishment of the Commonwealth, various savings would be effected, and that we should obtain uniformity in several directions. They declared that instead of having six tin-pot armies and six tinsel commanders we should have one Australian army and a'. General Officer Commanding. But, if I am rightly informed, uniformity so far as salaries are concerned does not exist. The drill instructors engaged in this work in New South Wales receive. £ 2 0 8 per annum; in Western Australia, £196 per annum ; in Victoria, £177 per annum ; in South Australia, ,£175 per annum; in Tasmania, £ 1 7 3 per annum ; and in Queensland, £ 1 6 6 per annum. These men discharge corresponding duties in each of rhe States, and they should receive equal remuneration. I have also a list which shows that preference is given, without exception, to instructors who .have been in the Imperial Army. .the point of view of the General Officer Commanding, but not from our standpoint. honourable member that the only Australian force which surrendered in South Africa was led by an Imperial officer. We did not find our men surrendering when they were led by their own officers, and I assert that we have men as competent to instruct our forces-me n who have been trained on the battle fields of South Africa-as are any officers to be found in the Imperial Army. General Officer Commanding we must have these Imperial instructors. the Department rely a little more on our own resources instead of going abroad for these men. member. I have in my possession show that in every instance Imperial officers are receiving from £ 1 0 to £ 1 6 per annum more than is paid to Australian officers discharging similar duties. ance with agreements made .prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth.' We have not engaged any Imperial officers since then. days ago why a certain classification had not been carried out, and it seemed to me thafc fche reply I received was, to say the least, a little ambiguous. It was said that because certain meu were not appointed afc certain dates they were nofc given promotion. Some of these instructors joined the service -years before those who are now receiving larger salaries. Some of them were in the service only two or three years, whilst others have been in .the service nine or ten years and are getting less pay. SirJ OHN FORREST -They were introduced before Federation. men promoted so that they could receive the same pay as the Imperial non-commissioned officers 1 . Why should they be placed at a disadvantage ? However, I shall probably have an opportunity of discussing this matter wifch the Minister in his office some time during next week, and, at the present stage, will content myself with the observations I have made. cannot allow this opportunity to pass without making some reference to the disbandL e t me remind the ment 'of Commonwealth volunteer corps.

It was expected that the forces would be put on an entirely citizen basis; but tliat has not been done. That work awaits some kindlier hand than that which, I am afraid, the right honourable gentleman has brought to bear. When is this sort of thing to stop ? Is every new Commandant to be given a free hand to "" cut "" and "" slash"" where he pleases, and to be applauded the more he is able to "" c u t "" in connection with the rank and file? We have reductions of ±""20,000 one year, and of £30,000 another year in the expenditure on the men who have to do the fighting, and who are scantily paid in any case. I hope the Minister will see that some better treatment is given to the rifle clubs, because, after all, in the guerilla warfare which we mayanticipate in the case of a raid on Australia, it is to the members of those elubs to whom we shall have to look -for the mobile force winch is to help to keep the enemy at bay. ply with the wishes of the Committee that the debate shall be restricted as much as possible, but I musb ask honourable members to bear with me while I draw atbenbion to the very large decrease which is proposed in the expenditure on rifle clubs in Victoria. The actual expenditure under this head last year was £27,550, and the proposed expenditure for this year is only £19,002. The rifle club movement in Victoria has been carried on with exceptional activity, and I protest against a reduction which is likely to impair the progress of these organizations. members of rifle clubs have no rifles. in a moment. In the other States the amount proposed to be Spent on rifle clubs is totally inadequate to the number of men who are eligible. In New South Walesthe estimate of expenditure is £5,750 ;. in Queensland, £ 1 , 7 4 5 ; in South Australia, £ 2 , 5 9 5 ; in Western Australia, £2,850 \ and in Tasmania, £ 1 5 0 . But I wish to call particular attention to the remarkable reduction of £8,54 8 in the case of Victoria. I am aware that the right honourable gentleman will indicate to the Committee that he intends to give a capitation grant which will in some way make upthe deficiency. I do not make the impracticable or unreasonable request that 400 rounds of ammunition may be given free.. The importance of the movement would perfectly justify that quantity of ammunition being given to each rifleman. But at the pre j sent stage, and until the House has arrived at a determination to have a citizen soldiery pure and simple, I think it would be askingfor too much. My strong feeling is in favour of rifle clubs. I believe that if the Minister had asked for a vote of £64,000 instead of £32,000, it would have been readily granted. I should like the right honourable gentleman to Say definitely what are his new proposals in connection with a capitation allowance to the rifle clubs, and why the very large decrease in the Estimates for Victoria has. been made ? The debate which took place some time ago ought to convince him that the House will endorse any efforts which he may make to promote the cadet movement. I should like fco know if he has conveyed tc* his successor the promises which he made in this regard, and what steps have been taken to secure the co-operation of the States Governments through the medium of the Education Departments. It is very important that no delay should take place, and that regulations should be framed as quickly as possible. one of those who anticipated that the reduction in the Military Estimates last year would be made at the expense of the rank and file. I regret that our apprehensions in that regard have been too generally realized.

If the General Oflicer Commanding does not know of these facts he should be informed of them, so that justice may be done. I should not have leferred to the matter here, but for the fact that the case -was laid before the Minister for Defence nearly a fortnight ago, with a request that he would cause an inquiry to be made into it, and no answer has since been received from him. Therefore, it seemed to me that the only way in which to get the wrong righted was to bring it before honourable members, and, by a sort of public outcry, cause justice to be done. If social influence is to be used to obtain the promotion of unqualified men over the heads of others, it will be small matter for surprise if our forces go to pieces. We had hoped that under the General Officer Commanding promotions. would be made solely with regard to merit and seniority, but the use of social influence apparently began with Lt -Col.

' Tasmanian Forces is owing wholly to the want of money. of money so far as the Commonwealth ia concerned. I addressed myself to this subject when the Budget was under discussion,, and I was followed by my honourable colleague,' Mr Cameron, who spoke against fche proposal which I thought it desirable to advocate, and in favour of retrenchment in the interests of the State finances. I desire to point out, however, thafc the honourable member is one of the bitterest opponents of taxation in any form, more especially when the imposition of new taxation is likely to result in additional burdens being placed upon the landed proprietors of Tasmania. The question of retrenchment in connection with the Commonwealth Forcesi n Tasmania was nob raised during the State elections there. During those elections the battle was fought upon bhe question of reducing various local establishments, decreasing bhe> salary of fubure Governors, lessening bhe number of represenbafcives in the State Parliamenb, doing awa)' wibh bhe University,' and obher subjects of local importance. The expense of the Commonwealth Forcesi n Tasmania was not touched upon. I am during the elections the present Premier of bhe Sbabe would nob have received bhe very large support which he has received. He himself did nob mention it during the elections. But since gebbing into power again he has, with the kind co-operation of that member of the Ministry who is one of the representatives of Tasmania, induced bhe Treasurer bo submit esbimabes in which the position of the Tasmanian Forces is quite anomalous. I hope that the good sense of fche Committee will lead to the decision fchat this matter, like other matters of Federal concern, is one entirely for the determination of bhe Commonwealbh Parliamenb, wibhoub regard to the wishes of any State Minister. If similar recommendations had been made by the Premiers of the other five States and had been adopted, the Federal Commonwealth Forces would have passed' inbo nothingness like the baseless fabric of a vision.

A feeling exists throughout the partially-paid forces that they have had to bear the brunt of the retrenchment. It has been abundantly demonstrated by the honourable and learned member for Corinella that savings might have been effected in a different direction' altogether, without affecting the efficiency of our defences. The public expected that when the Defence Department was transferred to the Commonwealth a considerable saving would have been effected in the expenses of administration and military control. It was thought that there would not be the same need for large military staffs in each State; and we were justified in supposing that the amalgamation of the States Departments would have resulted in economy of management. We find, however, that the pruning knife has been applied principally to the citizen forces. The men do not object to bear their share of any reduction which may be considered necessary, but they feel that the reorganization effected has not been conducted upon proper lines. Men are being called upon to perform clerical duties instead of working the guns; and in many other respects the present administration is not satisfactory. I hope that the Minister will take notice of what has been said during this discussion, that provision will be made for the expansion of our citizen forces as occasion requires, and that the permanent forces will not be kept up to their present standard. standing the desire of the people of the required to do that under the State GoCommonwealth to give ful l support to t'le vernment. citizen forces of Australia, Parliament is apparently powerless to give effect to their I feel sure that the wishes. if it goes to work in the right direction. absolutely powerless up to the present time.

198,Mr Fisher,"That is the highest comasked to believe that, because an officer has been trained in the Imperial Army, he is superior to one who has received his military education here. There is no justification for such a belief. We have certainly no evidence that the Imperial officers engaged in the South African war acquitted themselves more creditably than did officers who were sent from Australia and other colonies, and I protest against the constant reiteration of the statement that, without Imperial officers, our army would be useless. The General Officer Commanding does not hesitate to say again and again that Australian officers who consider themselves to be well conversant with military tactics know very little indeed on the subject, and that their crude notions would lead to disaster in time of war. That asseryear; but that economies have been tion has yet to be proved. In the very early days of the South African campaign the opinion was expressed-and , no doubt, it was engendered by feelings of patriotismthat tlie Boers would immediately be crushed ; that they could not withstand the superior discipline of the British Eorces. But, was that prediction verified? In the same way, if we were called upon to resist the attack of an enemy, Australian officers, knowing more of the tactics which would be necessaiy for the kind of warfare that would be carried on here, would be able to do greater credit to themselves than would any Imperial officers. I am not one of those who expect our troops to derive any great advantage from Imperial commanding officers or instructors. On the contrary, I consider that we shall secure the greatest benefit to the Commonwealth by encouraging the belief amongsb Australian citizens bhab bhey are equally capable and worbhy of governing and of filling bhe highesb posibions in the army and navy. to bhe wishes of bhose who are anxious to return bo their homes, I do not propose to discuss these Estimabes as fully as I should obherwise have done. discussed ? is a most important one. I reluctantly agreed lasb year bo the proposal to reduce the Estimates by a lump sum, and, .1 bhink, thab in doing so I placed my posibion clearly before bhe Commibbee. As a member of the New South Wales Parliament I had some ' experience of the results of reducing Estimabes in bhis way, and of leaving departmental officers to work out a scheme of retrenchment in accordance with bhe wishesof bhe Legislabure. Our experience bhere was bhab bhe work was invariably commenced ab the wrong end. I feared bhab bhe same resulb would follow our experiment of reducing last year's Estimates by a lump sum, and my fears have been largely realized.. Our desire was that instead of building upa large force of permanent officers and men, we should place more reliance upon our citizen soldiery, and that our expenditure should be in the direction of expanding and efficiently equipping our citizen forces. We find bhab bhe Esbimabes have been reduced in accordance wibh the promise given last effected not amongst the more highly paid officers and men of the permanent forces, as desired by the Committee, but by impairing bhe efficiency of our citizen soldiery and. limiting the opporbuniby for bhe expansion of the sysbem.

I recognise the impossibility of bringing aboub a reform by means, of a lump sum reduction of the Estimates, or by reducing a particular ibem, as proposed by the honourable member for Maranoa.

On the other hand, if the fault rest with the Minister, let us entrust the administration of the Department to some one else' who will .carry out the wishes of the Committee. The Minister in charge «f these Estimates has just handed over the administration of the Defence Department to a colleague. I trust that the present Minister for Defence will succeed where his predecessor has failed, and that our desire that the Commonwealth should rely chiefly upon a citizen soldiery for its defence will be more fully recognised in the future. I trust that the Department will encourage the formation of rifle clubs and detatchments of Australian Light Horse in country districts, and that these forces will be provided with up-to-date equipment, witliout which a Defence force is practically useless. Let us supply our forces with adequate equipment, and instead of building up an expensive system of permanent troops, as we have done iu the past, give every reasonable encouragement to our»citizen soldiery. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I regret to find it again necessary to direct the attention of the Minister to the position of the Victorian Rangers. of our Defence Porces has been most shamefully treated. that treatment if it had been necessaiy for the purposes of retrenchment; but the action taken by the Department will have precisely the opposite effect. It will more than treble the expense which was formerly incurred in the maintenance of this force. Originally the Victorian Rangers were purely a volunteer force, and I have been assured by their officers that as such they were most attentive and assiduous in the discharge of their duties, and did all that was possible to make themselves efficient. They volunteered in large numbers to serve in South Africa, and acquitted themselves most creditably whilst there. I 'have also been informed by their commanding officers that the Rangers, although a purely volunteer body, outdistanced all competitors in rifle shooting at the recent Sunbury encampment. Notwithstanding these facts, this force, above all others, was selected to be either eonverted into the Australian Light Horse or disbanded. Most of the Rangers are working men, residing in country towns. horse, and therefore cannot avail themselves of the proposal that they should become members of the Australian Light Horse. If they could do so they would at once become a partially-paid force. They have now been told that that they must accept either one or other of the alternatives I have named, and a large number who are unable to avail themselves of the first are compelled to submit themselves to the second. In view of their record-in view of the fact that they proved themselves to be the most efficient rifle shots at the Sunbury encampment, and that they rendered most excellent service in South Africa, it is shameful that their services as volunteers should not be retained. they have no right to be volunteers. . MrA . M c LEAN If they were allowed to continue as volunteers a saving of considerably over £200 0 a year would be effected, and a preliminary expenditure of about £ 9 0 0 would be avoided. I would urge the Minister to inquire into the position of these men. I trust that if he discovers, after a careful investigation, th;.t it is impossible to retain them in their present position-althoug h to any ordinary individual it seems remarkable that it should That branch of be so, having regard to the fact that they cost the State practically nothing, and are I could have understood ready to give their best services to the Commonwealth when called upon to do so-h e will allow this branch of tiie service, as an alternative, to be merged into rifle clubs. they are unanimous. MrA . M c LEAN I have said that they were anxious to remain as they were; but that after the matter had been discussed in this House, the alternative was put to them that they must either be converted into Light Horse or be disbanded. Rather than submit to disband ment a considerable number of the Victorian Rangers have agreed to join the Australian Light Horse. Now, a large number of others, as I have said, have not been able to. do so, and they have had to submit to disbandment. That is what I complain of, and what these men have a perfect right to be dissatisfied with. I should like to know whether the Minister will look into the matter, and ascertain whether it is not possible to retain the men in their present p o s it i o n a n d , if not, whether the right honourable gentleman will They cannot afford to keep a give facilities to merge the men into rifle",30,Department Of Defence

To my thinking, if ifc has any purpose -whatever, it should eventuate in a motion to dispense -with the services of the General Officer Commanding. That would certainly be logical, and surely more to the purpose than hostile criticism, which ends in nothing. Tf the military experts in fchis Chamber consider fchat the Defence Department is going to tlie dogs so rapidly, as apparently they do, the proper proceeding is to table a motion recommending the dismissal of the General Officer Commanding, or else to move a vote of censure on the Government. The proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, made during fche Defence Bill discussion, is preferable to the practice we are now following. He desired that the control of fche naval and military forces should be withdrawn from the present highly paid experta man with an European reputation-and vested in some members of this House, and other persons picked up from outside. certainly be a scratch combination. I dare say that fche affair would look very well with General Mauger commanding, supplemented by Major-General McCay, and wifch the honourable member for Maxanoa, who certainly has. had practical experience of soldiering, occupying the very prominent position of Chief of fche Staff. Seriously, I tliink fchat a good deal of time has been wasted, and that, in order to direct the discussion fco a concrete issue, something different might be. done. I can fancy the difficulty that an officer brought out from the old country has in placing the scattered forces of this Commonwealth on a proper footing. I can imagine also that his difficulty must be accentuated a thousandfold by the attitude of honourable members of this House, who, without having had his experience or possessing his expert knowledge, offer him suggestions which probably he knows very well cannot be carried out; or which, if adopted, would result in the disorganization of the forces. I can just imagine whafc any successful general, who had conducted campaigns infcheold world, would say if he had to endure a fusilade of this kind. Would Washington have won his victories if a nagging Parliament had been behind him, hampering every effort he made 1 Would the victorious Germans have conquered France, if their chief geueral had had his hands tied by members of the legislature telling him to do fchis and not to do that ? It is proper that Parliament should fix the cost of this Department and give genera] directions regarding ifcs expenditure, but we ought to stop there, and not attempt to regulate every minutiae. We should lay down principles, and leave details to others. Now, in my view, nearly three-fourths of the money expended upon the land forces of Australia is practically wasted. What we need to do, in my opinion, is to foster the creation of rifle clubs, to teach every man how to shoofc, and to give all facilities to practise shooting. That is all that we need bother ourselves about at present, so far as concerns the land forces of Australia. The bulk of our outlay should be upon a fleet to protect our shores. Buti f we bring a man out from England, who possesses the highest expert knowledge, surely we ought to take his advice. If we are involved in law, why do we consult a lawyer ? Because we realize that he knows That would more about law than we do. If we go to consult a physician about; bodily ailments, we do so because he knows more about physical disorders than we do. Similarly, why should we incur fche expense of obtaining expert military advice at all unless we follow it? Thafc is fche view which I take. Of course, I may be very presumptuous in offering an opinion. I never shouldered a rifle,, and I have not had thafc extensive experience in military affairs which, I am sure, justified the honourable member for Melbourne Portsi n propounding his elaborate scheme for the management of the Defence Forces. However, to come down from the clouds to a practical matter, I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to a point which, small'as it may be, is of considerable importance to some of my constituents. Some time ago, a number of them put their hands in their pockets and built a drill hall in an important town in Western Australia, with which fche Minister is well acquainted. I refer to Menzies. They paid £ 4 0 0 forfchishall, and handed ifc over to the Defence Department.

Ifc has regardfcofchesystem which has been adopted respecting promotions. I do not believe in a hard and fast rule of seniority governing promotions. I believe that promotion should be by merit. But where seniority is coupled with meritorious service and success in examination, some strong reason should be given before an oflicer is superseded by one who is junior to himself-wh o has had the officially ? same, if not greater, opportunities, to perfect himself in his work, but who reason at all. Of course, when an officer has not passed anything likefchesame exanv inafcions. The case alludedfcobyfchehonorable member for Bourke hasalso been brought under my notice by a friend of mine who is conversant wifch all the facts. Ifc is a pity fchat these subjects have to be brought up in this Committee. But I am afraid that although they be trifling in character and few in number, they would be considerably added to if fchat natural reticence, coupled with a desire to observe discipline, which It was purchased by characterizes most of fche ofiicers in our defence forces, did not operate against the further ventilation of them in Parliament. I deprecate fche discussion of questions of discipline, and even of advancement, in Parliament'; but where a manifest wrong has been done, or is being contemplated, and where an oflicer has taken every step which he can take in accordance with the regulations to protect his rights, and to prevent himself being superseded by one who has not anything like the same claims, then I think this Committee is the proper body before which to ventilate the case. I should not speak upon the matter if I had not made careful inquiries into the merits 'of it . I have .read the various Gazette notices affecting the case, As I have said, there is and I have also scanned the reports with regard to the examinations. Having done so, I cannot for the life of me understand why It is a matter which Lieutenant T. G. L . Scott, the oflicer referred to, should have been passed over in favour of a junior oflicer who has not passed his examinations so creditably. The position is this : Four ofiicers received their commissions on the same day. It was stated in fche Gazette noticefchafctheir seniority was to be reckoned according to. merit. Thej' went up for examination, and their names were published in the order which they were fco keep. But Lieutenant Scott, the gentleman whoheaded fchelist,has now been placed below fche gentleman who was lowest on fche list, and who is to be promoted over his head. Lieutenant Scott has passed his examination for a ' captaincy. The other oflicer, Lieutenant Bruce, has not. Yet, for some reason or other, Lieutenant Scott has been placed lower on the list than Lieutenant Bruce. The only reason thafc I think can be given is that Lieutenant Bruce proceeded to South Africa.",32,Department Of Defence

234,Sir John Forrest,"I have taken a question were fully looked into, honourable members would see that the difficulties were far greater than they appear on the surface, and it would have to be confessed that a real effort has been made to comply with their wishes as expressed in this Chamber last session. I have taken the trouble to ascertain what reductions have taken place in the Defence Department since the transfer of the States Defence Forces to the Commonwealth. made by honourable members have been directed to what appears to them to be an inclination on the part of the Government to apply the reduction which this House desired should be made to the rank-and-file, and, as far as possible, to leave the permanent ofiicers of the force, untouched. I do not think an examination of the facts will bear out that statement. I find tliat since the transfer of the Defence Forces of the States to the Commonwealth on the 1st March, 1901, the Department has reduced the establishment of commissioned officers by fifty-four, which includes six officers from, the Naval Forces. Forty-eight of the fifty-four were colonial ofiicers who have been retired, and six were Imperial ofiicers whose engagements have terminated. Against this total reduction of fifty-four ofiicers the following additions or appointments have been made :Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, General Oflicer Commanding, who was lent to us by the Imperial Government, and who came here on a three years' engagement ; and two other Imperial officers, Lieut -Colonel Plomer and Major McLagan, who were appointed for three years by the States of Queensland and New South Wales prior to the Commonwealth assuming control of Defence matters, and consequently we were in no way responsible for their being engaged. Militia of Queensland were appointed to the Instructional Staffi n July, 1901. There is another officer, Major Reade, who is a C.B., with a record of distinguished service in South Africa. He is now appointed to the Instructional Staff, but he was an oflicer of the partially-paid forces of South Australia. His appointment was made not long after the transfer. Then there was the appointment of Lieutenants Long-Innes and E. H . Reynolds, who were cadet officers, and who qualified themselves by competitive examination for appointment in the Permanent Forces. They were appointed in April, 1901, almost immediately after the transfer. appointed 1 Wales. Then Lieutenant De Passey was given a commission in South Australia. He was a warrant officer who had done good service in South Africa, and was given his commission at about the time of the first meeting of the Federal Parliament. There were two other appointments conferred on The principle observations deserving warrant officers, R. E. Page and R. E. Sheldon being given second lieutenant's commissions. These fourteen appointments of ofiicers were the only new ones made since 1st March, 1901, and all were made during 1901, before the necessity for retrenchment was ascertained. ment was a very good one. He is a splendid oflicer a very good oflicer, and he came with a very good record. These fourteen ofiicers can scarcely be called new appointments, as, excepting the Imperial officers, tbey were all in the Defence Force as Militia officers, but, deducting them from the fifty-four; it will be seen that there has been a total reduction of forty officers since the transfer of the Defence Department to the Commonwealth. The total number of permanently employed commissioned officers, including the Instructional Staff, appearing on these Estimates is 103eighty-eight military officers and fifteen naval officers-as against 143 when the transfer of the Forces to the Commonwealth took place. It must be admitted that a reduction of forty officers out of 143 is a tremendous reduction. No less than one-third of the whole of the officers have been retired since 1901. Honourable members know very well that Five ofiicers from the there has been a reduction of the Estimates for the Permanent Forces, including the In structional Staff, as shown in the Estimates for 1903-4, from £217,091 to £193,721 , which is a reduction of £23,370, or over 10 per cent, on the Permanent Forces alone. The Estimates for the partially-paid forces have been increased from £150,274 for 1902-3 to £152,176 for 1903-4, an increase of £1,902. There has been a reduction in the expenditure on volunteers from £34,715 in 1902-3 to £22,283 for 1903-4, caused to a large extent by' the conversion of volunteers into partially-paid forces. 1 is about.",34,Department Of Defence

239,Mr Page,"That is what all the troublemembers that we have reduced these Estimates during two years by £259,633 of -which £62,381 represents reductions in the' permanent forces, including the instructional staff, it cannot be said there has not been a really bond Jide effort On the part of the Government to meet the wishes of this House as to the reduction of expenditure in the Defence Department. If everything is not exactly as honourable members would desire, all I can say is that that must. happen in any case of general reductions. about dissatisfaction; but how could it be otherwise when the expenditure has been reduced by a quarter of a million 1 The altered state of affairs cannot be as satisfactory or as agreeable to those affected as would a continuance of the old conditions; and the wonder is that there is not much more dissatisfaction. Rut reductions have been made-officer s have been retired, and the forces have been put on a uniform basis -and , if only a little breathing time is given, there is every hope that we shall get along even better than we have been doing, Whatever' may be said as to the General Officer Commanding, it cannot be suggested tliat he has not thrown himself, heart and soul, into his work. He has not come here for three years' pleasure, but in order to increase his reputation, and to render us valuable service. Sir good work he is doing. great difficulties the General Officer Commanding has had to encounter in consolidating the whole of the forces and placing them on a uniform basis, we may be conffratulated on the fact that there is not much more dissatisfaction than there appears to be. I take with several grains of salt the opinions expressed by honourable members as to what ought to be done, or what they would advise in the way of military administration if they had the opportunity.' I suppose that most of us have received a good deal of that kind of advice in our experience. Even in parliamentary life men promise to do great things if they are installed in Ministerial office, but when they are installed matters are usually found to go on pretty much as before. There is too little regard given to the qualifications which the General Officer Commanding possesses. If we were to import an expert for the construction of railways, water-works, irrigation works, or other undertakings of that character, we should not be inclined, I -think, to hamper him very much in regard to the number of persons he required to assist him. We would not treat or speak of such an expert in the way in which some honourable members seem disposed to treat and speak of the General Officer Commanding; if we did, the expert would probably refuse to continue the work. We have heard a good deal Commanding would "" take the office."" gage an officer for a short time to do certain work it is not usual to keep complaining of him while he is fulfilling his duties. Let a man in that position be allowed to finish his work, and then is the time to complain if we are not satisfied. In addition to all his other duties the General Officer Commanding has the technical administration, nnder the Minister, of a large department, involving the expenditure of something like £600,000 a year ; and, as the military adviser of the Government, he is responsible for the discipline and equipment of the whole, of the forces. If the General Officer Commanding is not assisted in his work, and given an opportunity of doing his best, it will not be to our advantage; and for that reason, during the time. I was Minister for Defence, although I desired to carry out the wishes of the House and to exercise my own judgment, I was very anxious to aid the General Officer Commanding in the -important and difficult duties of his office. gen.tleman allow the General Officer Commanding to do every thing he desired, and give him every thing he asked for ? not; but I did my best to assist him in the work he had to carry out. As to rifle clubs, I recognise that a cheap and efficient way of defending the country is to instruct citizens in the use of the rifle. One of the last of my acts before I left the Defence Department was to leave on record the following minute :The rifle club system being a most efficient means of training the citizens of the Commonwealth in the use of arms, and a most valuable adjunct to the Defence Force of the Commonwealtb, I desire to encourage and perfect this organization to the fullest extent.",35,Department Of Defence

The regulations should be amended so as to provide an increased contribution for the formation of new rifle ranges of £20 for clubs of thirty and £40 for clubs of 100, instead of £10 and £20 as at present. 3. A capitation grant of 5s. per annum for all efficients should be given for the purpose of enabling rifle clubs to meet their expenses, and maintain their rifle ranges. I have written to the right houorable the Treasurer asking him to make provision on the Estimates for a sufficient sum to enable a half-year's capitation to be paid during this financial year. 4. Some additional privileges in regard to railclubs. Those who are not willing to purway travelling should be conceded also to efficients, to enable them to more easily enter into rifle club competitions. 5. Members of rifle clubs qualified to impart instruction in recruit drill should be encouraged to act as instructors to members desiring such instruction, being paid a fee for such services. The Treasurer has acceded to my request, and, therefore, the clubs will have some li'ttle money for ordinary corps expenses, instead of the members being compelled to dip their hands into their own pockets. Commanding make that recommendation t the recommendation of my own motion. Provision is not made on the Estimates, but the Treasurer intimated his willingness to comply with the request, on my undertaking to mention the matter to honourable members when the Estimates were under consideration. MrL . E. G.R003t -And as'to the supply of rifles ? thei'e is some difficulty, arising altogether from economical causes. In ""Victoria no rifles have ever been supplied to the clubs, but in New South Wales and other States rifles have been supplied. In Western Australia there are not as yet, I think, any legally organized clubs, but I believe there is a willingness on the part of those who support the movement in that State to provide their own rifles. In Victoria, where the rifle club system has flourished to a far greater extent than in any otlier part of Australia, there has been no complaint made about members having to supply their own arms. W it h that fact before me I felt a difficulty in introducing a system which would result in a considerable drain on the public purse. A t the same time, I fully recognise the force of the arguments placed before the Committee by several honourable members, and I propose to ask the Minister for Defence to consider whether some easier means cannot be found of providing rifle clubs with rifles. I do not know whether the request will result in rifles being supplied absolutely free, but, while I do not like promising anything for another Minister, I think I may say that something will be done in the direction suggested. I think I may promise to recommend the Min ister to make a reduction i'n the price of rifles, and also to take steps for loaning rifles to chase rifles at the small price we mav be able to arrange, will, perhaps, be content to share rifles lent to the clubs. There is a similar plan, I understand, in Victoria and the other States, the clubs lending rifles to members who make themselves responsible for their safekeeping. The honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Bland and others, referred to the desirableness of reductions in the Head-QuartersStaff. I have given that matter consideration, and though, as I have already said, I must be the General Officer very careful about making promises when acting for another Minister, I am willing to undertake that as vacancies occur and vacancies will probably occur by the transfer of Lieut -Colonel Owen, and on the expiration of the term of engagement in the case of Lieut -Colonel Plorner and Major McLagan-the Minister will consult the Prime Minister and the Cabinet before new appointments are made, so that the matter may be thoroughly thrashed out, and a decision arrived at as to how far any reductions are possible. Inquiry may be made as to whether the clerical staff of the Head-quarters Staff and other branches can be reduced, and to what extent returns and correspondence can be avoided. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Hartnoll, the Treasurer will make a statement which I think will prove satisfactory. As to the cadets, I undertake that communication will be made with the States Governments, in order to ascertain what plan can be arranged by which the children in the schools may best be drilled and trained. It is surrounded witli some difficulty, because the Education Departments are not under the control of the Commonwealth. But I have not the slightest doubt that the States will be only too willing to work with the Commonwealth in regard to the training and drilling of cadets. Until the Defence Bill is passed, we shall have no authority in regard to cadets.",36,Malcolm Mceacharn An D Very

W it h the rifles on order, there will be sufficient magazine rifles for the peace establishment of the forces, and .this is independent of the Martini-Enfield rifle, of which we have 34,000 in the Commonwealth. W it h the rifles which are provided for on the Estimates, and with those which are on order, we shall be able, not only to do all that is necessary in regard to the peace establishment of the forces, but to comply to a very large extent with the requirements of the rifle clubs. I hope that I have referred to all the matters which have been brought under my notice. All I have to say now is that, notwithstanding the adverse criticism-whic h we must expect, I supposeI thank honourable members for their intimation that they are now prepared to pass the Defence Estimates without amendment. Treasurer) -The question of the expenditure in Tasmania has been pressed very strongly on the Committee by its representative, Mr Hartnoll. When the Estimates were submitted to me, I found that a very large extra expenditure was proposed for the State. Last year its Defence expenditure -came to £' 15,000, and this year we have provided a sum of £ 2 1 , 0 0 0 a n in-crease of £6,000 in that little State, AVhenI was asked to provide a considerable sum for the purpose of paying the volunteers in that State, I felt that it would place I shall be very glad indeed to make the a very great strain on its finances. Knowing the great struggle which the State Government has had for a long time in consequence of the loss of Customs revenue through Federation, I felt bound to press very strongly on the Defence Department the advisability of delaying that further expenditure for at least twelve months. The Minister for Defence very strongly urged that it should be incurred; but ultimately, on my appeal, he gave way on the understanding that the money should be provided in the next financial year. Afte r that, some requests were made from Tasmania; but the blocking of the expenditure should be put down to me, in the first instance, if any blame is attachable to any one. If any attempt were made to force this additional expenditure on the State independently of the effect upon its finances, I should have to oppose it very strongly indeed. I have always held a strong view as to the functions of a Committee of Supply. While honourable members have a perfect right to cut down the Estimates of the Treasurer-of course, without impairing his ability to carry on the King's Government -the y sliould not, unless the circumstances are very extreme indeed, attempt to increase the amount of the expenditure which he proposes, because, in addition to the fact that the responsibility is on his shoulders, there is the important fact of his acquaintance with all the circumstances of the case. I feel that the volunteers in Tasmania have a grievance, inasmuch as the volunteers in other States have now been converted into partially-paid forces. Werei t not for the condition of the finances in Tasmania, I should not have raised any opposition to this request. However, if I find during the course of the year that the revenue which the Commonwealth collects for the State has increased, or thatother expenditure has diminished to such an extent as to allow me while still giving back to the State the promised amount, as I always try to do if possible, because it is the basis of the State Treasurer's expenditure-to make this provision in whole or in part I shall be very pleased indeed to place the volunteers in the Statei n the same position as the men in the other States. I hope that the expenditure will be kept within the proposed amounts, and that the revenue will increase. In both or either of these events necessary provision. If my honourable friend is satisfied with this promise, I hope that he will not press the matter any further.

I have always had the feeling that the Treasurer-n o doubt at the solicitation of friends-departe d from tlie true Eederal principle that all the people -within the Eederation should be treated alike. I am constrained to think that the first desire of the Minister for Defence at that time must have been to intimate to the militia in Tasmania that they should lie placed on exactly the same footing as the volunteers in other States. I feel quite certain that he must have submitted to the Cabinet estimates which placed the volunteers in all the States on the same footing, and be unable to keep going. that it was some malign or, perhaps, friendly interposition which created this difficulty. I do not know whether the men will be willing to rely on this, the fourth promise which has been given to them in three consecutive years-that if they would only wait for another year they would be placed on an equal footing with their comrades in the other States. I recognise the futility of taking further action. In view of the limited attendance and of the intimation which has gone round to.the Government supporters and those who have a kindly feeling towards the Treasurer, no other course is open to me than to accept his promise, which I do in the hope that the finances of Tasmania will become so buoyant that he will be able to place its field force on the same footing as that force in the other States.

If he had received his just dues he would have been swung up by the neck, because I look upon him as nothing more nor less than a murderer. ber should not be so harsh. more nor less than a murderer. He has left women in Queensland without husbands, and mothers without sons. No one was more severe upon him than the Minister himself. Sir JOH N FORREST I did not go so far as the honourable member has done. he should be punished, and yet he afterwards appointed him to a command in South Australia. Sir JOH N FORREST -No, he was appointed to that position before he returned from South Africa. That, of course, detracts somewhat from the force of my remarks. . There must be something radically wrong with this officer, because Major Tunbridge, who was one of the smartest officers in the Commonwealth service, and whose loss was deplored by the people of Queensland, could not get on with him. Then, again, the South Australian Commandant was responsible for the muddle over the refusal of a guard of honour for the Governor of South Australia, Sir George Le Hunte, upon his arrival in that State. It was owing to his folly and stubbornness that the whole of the confusion took place, and yet he seems to have escaped without any censure. He should certainly not have been rewarded with a staff appointment. If that is the way in which the Government intend to reward those who donotdotheirduty, I fail to see how they can adequately treat conscientious and efficient officers. I should like to know what has been done in regard to the latest esoapade of the officer referred to. I do not wish the Miniseral Oflicer Commanding and myself were very much annoyed that there should have been even an apparent want of courtesy to the Governor of South Australia upon his arrival in that State. It appears that the State Government did not wish a guard of honour to be furnished, because the expense would be charged against the State, and the Commandant having ascertained the fact, thought that was all that was required of him. Instead of telegraphing to head-quarters, or acting upon the instruction which was given at the time of the transfer of the Department te the Commonwealth, that States Governors were to receive the honours from the military to which they had been previously accusI repeat that he is nothing tomed, he was satisfied with tlie intimation from the Premier of South Australia that a guard of honour was not required. However, he was informed afterwards that the General Officer Commanding disapproved of his action, and that he should have telegraphed to head-quarters if he had any doubt about the matter. In order to prevent a similar contretemps in the future, we have made provision by which guards of honour, if composed of citizen soldiersvolunteers or partially paid-shal l be paid for.

On a previous occasion I ventured tb express the opinion that this Department is not keeping pace with the necessities of the people in the Western State. Were1 in a position to compare the total expenditure of the Department during the years prior to Federation with that incurred since its transfer to the Commonwealth, I could prove that, especially in (General Contingencies), £ 3 , 8 5 5 ; the new and rapidly developing portions of the State, the Department has failed to fulfil its duty to the people. The only figures available for purposes of comparison with the expenditure since the Commonwealth assumed control of the Post and Telegraph Department are those for 1899, and I find that a true comparison could hardly be made, because it appears that the expenditure under the State and under the Commonwealth is ranged under different headings. T admit at once that the expenditure by the State upon new post and division telegraph offices, repairs to old buildings, and new telegraphs and telephones, during 1899-0, does not compare favourably with the expenditure upon those items by the Commonwealth for 1902-3, or the pro£3,400; posed expenditure for the current year. But in connection with an item of greatest importance to a scattered electorate such as I represent, namely, that relating to new mail services, I think the Postmaster-GeneForces Division ral will find that a very considerable reduction has been made in the amount alloArtillery), cated compared with that which the State £230; expended when the Department was under its control. ATithout unduly dwelling on that point, let me direct the serious attention of the Postmaster-General to the £3,036 ; division 164 (Volunnecessity of providing for a greater expenditure, and of devoting a larger share",42,Honourable Members Hea R Hear
275,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"I have aof his attention to those portions of Austvalia whioh are being opened up by our pioneers. The people of the cities and more thickly-populated localities can very well look after themselves. They have no difficulty in reaching the departmental ear. Not so with those who occupy and develop far inland parts of our territory, whose wants can find no utterance except through their representatives here. It is all very well to supply telephones and telegraphs and other conveniences to people who are already surfeited-if I may use such a term-wit h all the blessings of civilization. To those who live in the remote and sparsely settled parts of the continent, a reasonably good mail service is an inestimable boon, and these are the people for whom the Postmaster-General should display all tlie solicitude he can spare; and seeing that the present Postmaster General has come fresh to his office, with fill the buoyancy of a youthful Minister, it is to be hoped that he will set himself resolutely to the task of giving due attention and care to the wants of tbose who live in the remoter districts. He must recognise that the coastal communities depend to a very large extent not merely for prosperity but for their very existence upon the presence in the remotest parts of the continent of a contented and prosperous people. I am now under the necessity of directing attention to the administration of the Deputy Postmaster-General in Perth; and, before the Western Australian section of these Estimates is dealt with, it is essential that the Postmaster-General should say distinctly what he proposes to do with that official. the whole of the Commonwealth who is notoriously disloyal to the Federation, and notoriously incompetent for the proper discharge of his duties, it is the Duputy Postmaster-General at Perth. The Postmaster General must be aware, from the records of his Department, that this officer has been guilty of insubordination. He must know also from what has taken place in this Chamber, and from the charges which have been made, and which have never been answered, that this officer unites to the ferocity of a Russian Czar all the trickery-if not worse-of a Tammany boss. I use these words advisedly. In dealing with his officers this man, in some cases, has been absolutely merciless. Mr Mahon. be so in connection with the last case of embezzlement in which he actually went into Court and gave testimony which resulted in a young man being acquitted of a very serious charge. moment that he is merciless to all his subordinates. WhatI say is that he is merciless and ferocious to some of his officers, and guilty of the grossest favouritism in the case of others. I am not such a fool as to make the other statemeut. The records of the Department will prove that he has been guiltj' of insubordination. In this connection I shall instance a case which occurred some time ago. In spite of instructions from the Postmaster-General that no more transfers to remote stations should be made without his approval, an officer was sent from Coolgardie to Eucla. This man had undergone all the hardships. of early gold-fields life and was in poor health. Instead of being sent to a place where he would have a chance of recovery, he was ordered to proceed to Eucla, where a boat calls once every three months, and where he would be very lucky if he saw a strange face once in three years. The officials in Melbourne do not appear to have sufficient backbone to stand up to this man and suspend him for his breach of instructions. I should like to occupy the position of Postmaster General for twenty four hours. If I did so this officer would be but of the service. Apparently the Government is greatly embarrassed in dealing with this officer. He has not yet reached the statutory age at which he can If there is one officer in retire, and the Government have not the pluck-althoug h they have plenty of evidence-to lay a charge against him. I am sorry that the Minister for Home Affairs is not present, because I desire to say nothing against this officer which I am not prepared to utter before his dearest friends. But even they will not offer unqualified defence of his administration. He knows nothing, and apparently does not desire to learn anything of the needs of any part of the State outside Perth and Fremantle. Upon every possible occasion he has blocked reform.

Upon the other side, .going up from Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, railway communication is now being exten-ded in a line almost parallel with the railway which proceeds from the coast at -Geraldton to the Murchison gold-fields. The mails from that part of the countiy usually travel by way of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie. Between the points of termination of the Murchison railway and that of the line running through Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, there are a great many important mining centres. The residents desired that a mail service should be established between these two points.

The people -desired that a mail service should be established between these two points, and in -obedience to their request I pressed the matter on the attention of the ex-Postraaster-General. After going into the matter very fully, the honourable gentleman decided to call for tenders for the establishment of the mail service in question. Upon several previous occasions a similar request had been refused by the Deputy Postmaster-General of Perth. He pointed out that no necessity -existed for such a service, and contended that it would not pay. In fact, he used all the stock arguments that a crusted Conservative can find against any reform, however 10 R necessaiy it may he. The Postmaster General, however, ignored his recommendation, and towards the end of May invited tenders for the initiation of this mail service. Early in June a tender was accepted, and the contractor was notified to take up the work. Naturally, I assumed-althoug h I called at the Postmaster-General's ofiice to ascertain whether it was so--that this mail was running. I was informed by the Secretary that it must be running, otherwise the Department would have had an intimation to that effect. What happened ? Not until the 29th August did I learn that the mail service in question had not been established. Although a contract had actually been accepted in the early part of June, the initiation of the service was deliberately delayed by this officer during the whole of this period, evidently because he did not wish the trade of that portion of the State to be concentrated in Geraldton. that district 1 I refer is that proposed to be established between Nannine and Lake Way. * asked the Postmaster-General to demand an explanation from this officer regarding the delay which had occurred in the establishment of this mail service, and I was informed that the following wire had been received from him :Se the delay in arranging the Nannine contract.

That was one case. outlying stations. I know of one man who has been stationed at Eucla for not less than seven years. Other officers have been kept at remote stations for four, five, and six years, whilst others again remain permanently at Perth and other salubrious places along the coast. I am satisfied that the Inspector will do his best to see that this grievance is redressed; but no harm would be done if tlie Postmaster-General offered an incentive to its early removal. It is palpably unfair that one section of officers should be stationed all their lives amid the pleasant surroundings of a city, while others are compelled to go into the back country, for practically the same remuneration, and to submit to all kinds of inconveniences, hardships and discomforts. There should be a fair division of the advantages and disadvantages of the Department in a State such as Western Australia. As an illustration of the loose way in which the reins of administration are held in Perth-and the Minister for Home Affairs will not be pleased to hear of thisI may mention that long after the Coolgardie water supply was available to the people of that city, the men in the local post and telegraph office, instead of obtaining tlieir supplies from this source, which had been provided at great cost to the country, were actually buying water from outside parties. been the practice; and nothing was done by the Perth deputy until a subordinate officer drew attention to the waste. the source 1 10 B 2 by the present Deputy Postmaster-General, It is not so now. because I believe that the Minister is seized It was so when the last of most of the facts. They speak for themi t happened under the rule of the officer whose administration I am now criticising. Several other cases have since occurred, but as the Public Service Inspector is now stationed at Perth, and will be able to see that justice is meted out to any delinquent, I do not think the Committee need take any action in the matter. I should like to refer to the hardships suffered by some of the postal officials stationed in outlying districts. These are matters which demand the attention of both the Postmaster-General and the Public ServiceI n spector. A t some of the remote stations the isolation of officers is as complete as if they had been condemned to solitary confinement. They endure the unbroken solitude of Selkirk on Juan Fernandez, without the solace which rendered his lot tolerable. Not infrequently men exiled for years to tliese lonely outposts become mentally affected. Others are reduced to the condition popularly d i be d as ""balmy,"" and escr nearly all absorb from their surroundings some painful .peculiarity of character which, in after life, distinguishes them from their more favoured fellows. An anecdote, not altogether of doubtful authenticity, was related to me by a recent visitor to one of these far-off stations. An officer had died at his post and was buried on a gentle eminence which overlooked the station buildings. To this spot the visitor noticed that the man in charge paid repeated visits during his intervals from duty. A little acacia had been lovingly planted over the grave of the deceased official by one of his comrades.

It has regard to the recent appointments of telegraph messengers. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that an examination was held, and that as a result various ' appointments were made. "" A blank space was provided to be filled in with the name of the place to which those who were examined desired to be appointed. three weeks ago I drew the attention of the Subsequently it was discovered that it was Postmaster-General to what then appeared impossible to fit in the new appointees to the to me to be rather a serious breach of a places to which they most desired to go.

I ""sincerely hope -that the Minister-whos e sympathy, I feel certain from his past political and social history, will be with the ladswill, if it can be done, find means by which this grave additional expense of boarding out the lads with strangers will be avoided. I am satisfied that better results would then accrue to the service. These lads are being those who occupied the position of porters",47,Postmaster General S Depart
296,"Mr Salmon"" (Laanecoorie)",There is,48,Postmaster General S Depart
297,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"Som esubstantial increase, and there was no right of transfer or appointment to better situations in the Department. The men engaged as letter carriers, on the other hand, took a lower salary, because it gave them the right at a later stage to rise to better positions, carrying mucli more substantial salaries than the porters could ever hope to receive. Since the Public ServiceA c t was passed, that oldestablished rule, which was practically a contract and was reduced to writing, has been to a certain extent varied. A t the time when I spoke last, on the 27th August, some eight men who had been acting as porters, were given superior positions as sorters. I laid the facts before the Postmaster-General, and he very kindly promised to have the matter laid before the Public Service Commissioner. The result of his sympathetic statement was that an indignation meeting, which was to be held by the letter carriers of Yictoria, was turned into a meeting of satisfaction. But, unfortunately, nothing has been done since that date. I should like to know from the Postmaster General whether he has actually prepared a statement for the Public Service Commissioner, and, if so, whether he has sent it on 1 If that has been done, what has been the result of his remonstrances or suggestions to that officer ? A point which, perhaps, he may not have noticed, because I did not make it at the time. I spoke previously, is that these men claim that under section 84 of the Constitution they are entitled to the positions for which they ask. They claim that their rights and privileges are being invaded to an extent which is not allowed by the law. I therefore hope that the honourable gentleman will make a strong representation to the Commissioner. would ask him to note, first, that there was a contract existing between these men and the previous head of the Post and Telegraph Department in Victoria. Next, I ask him to note that that contract was reduced to writing, is tangible, can be produced, and that these men were engaged under its terms. In the last place, I wish the honourable gentleman to observe that, under section 84 of the Constitution, their rights are being violated unwarrantably. To illustrate how unfairly the present system operates, I propose to state the case of two men, A and B. I do not desire to give their names, although I could do so. They joined the Department at the same time-in 1886. They both.joined as porters. Two years afterwards A relinquished thesalary he was receiving, £10 a month, and agreed to take £ 7 a month and become a letter carrier, because of the higher position that he hoped to obtain in due course. From 18S8-that is to say two years sifter he joined the service-h e has been acting as a letter carrier. Since that time he has received about £200 less in salary than B, who has -actedall along as a porter, has received. The astonishing circumstance about the whole business is that, under the regulations which the Public Service Commissioner has brought into being, this porter who joined at the same time as A did, and who has already received about £ 2 0 0 more than the lettei carrier, is one of those who is to be pro moted to the new position of sorter. So that the sacrifice made by A, in relinquishing something like £ 2 0 0 in the hope of getting a superior position later on, goes for nothing, and his legal rights under the contract with the Victorian Government have been swept aside. He has not attained to the superior position which he hoped to-reach, while the other man, who sacrificed nothing, and who has been receiving the higher salary, has been placed over his head. I give this instance to show how unfairly the system has operated. .1 am bound to say that I do not think the Public Service Commissioner knows of the circumstances. I feel confiand honourable man, and that if he were aware of .the circumstances he would at once rectify the error. Therefore I was deUghted when I heard the Postmaster General promise on the previous occasion that he would lay the matter before the Public Service Commissioner, and would have the I grievance rectified. I will say no more on the subject now, except to ask that the Minister will give us an intimation as to what he has done or proposes to do. There is another matter upon which I desire to touch briefly for the purpose of eliciting information. It will be recollected that in older to obtain the minimum wage, which we provided for in the Public Service Act, persons occupying clerical positions in the Post and Telegraph Department had to undergo an examination. As one of the surprising results of the examination it was found that all the female officers who had presided over their several offices for some time failed in the examination, whilst their subordinates,",48,Postmaster General S Depart
298,Dent That Mr Mclaughlin Is A Fair,"mindedand junior appointees in many cases, passed the examination. This led to very great injustice, and the Deputy Postmaster-General for Victoria, Mr Outtrim, I believe, actually certified that the female offinot be known to some honourable members cers in charge of branches, and who failed to pass the examination, were in many, if not in all, instances better officers than those who did pass the examination and obtained the minimum salary of £ 1 1 0 per year. When the matter was previously mentioned, Senator Drake, who was then Postmaster-General, said that it would be brought before the Public Service Commissioner in such a way that a solution of the difliculty would be found. I mention the matter again for the purpose of discovering what has been done to enable these women to get the minimum wage, seeing that they have been certified, as fit for their positions by the Deputy Postmaster General, and have occupied those positions, with, credit to themselves, for some time. and is that it was never intended that the payment of the minimum wage should be dependent upon-an examination. It was intended to be a living wage, paid for services rendered, and the institution of an examination of those occupying clerical positions, though it may be the law, is really from the office on the ground were really a contradiction of what honourable members of this House intended in passing the Bill. It may be that we carried the provision in such a way that an examination became necessary, but I am sure that we did not do that knowingly. number of honourable members on the subject, and they agree with the opinion I am expressing that the provision for the minimum wage had nothing whatever to do with any examination of the persons in these positions.' revenue which the Department suffered on' It was felt that they were occupying positions for which they were entitled to receive a minimum wage upon which they could live. might very well be based upon examination, but with respect to the appointments which officers then held, it was intended by honordo their betting in Melbourne. When I able members that the minimum wage should be paid irrespective of any otlier condition than service. I ask that the Minister when replying to the debate will give the Committee some idea of what he is doing or what he intends should be done in connection with the matters to which I have referred. two matters which I should like to bring I official to take the step he did, or any person .under notice of the Ministeri n connection I may enter a telegraph office and compel one with the working of his Department in Victoria. I propose first, to refer to a matter which I brought before the House some time ago in the form of a question. It may that racing clubs here have telegraph offices established on their grounds, and telegraph operators are sent to these oflices from the General Post Office. It would appear that some person holding a responsible position in the Victorian Post Office, gave the secretary of one of the racing clubs in Melbourne authority to exercise a censorship over telegrams transmitted from the office on the grounds of the club, with a view probably of extending a similar right to the secretaries of all proprietary racing clubs in this city. a question in connection with this case ? some person must have authorized the secretary of the racing club to which I refer, to My own opinion was take this step, as the club published in their official programme a statement to the effect that the secretary would exercise a censorship over telegrams sent from the ground, and that telegrams in cipher would not be sent on any consideration. The result was that persons desiring to send telegrams prevented from doing so. I asked whether the person who authorized the secretary of the racing club was brought to book in any way, and I must confess that I did not receive what I considered tb be a satisfactory I have spoken to a answer. The reply given me was that no ' one authorized the secretary to take this step. If that reply is correct I should like to know why the secretary of this racing club has not been prosecuted for the loss of the occasion in question 1 We can understand that the object of the action taken by the secretary was to compel persons who desired Euture advancement or promotion to bet to pay 5s. or 10s. entrance money to enable them to go to the race-course managed by the club instead of allowing them to I asked whether the club in question had been required to make good the loss of revenue suffered by the Department on the occasion, I was told that as no one had been authorized to do what was done, there was no one who could be held responsible.

307,Mr Tudob,"I admit that power hassee that it is the officers of his own Department who will not recommend the Public Service Commissioner to employ this man. Any person applying for temporary work as a line-repairer is compelled to register at the Post Office, and the officers in charge there have practically complete control and are in a position to say who they will have as permanent men. I do not think that it was ever the intention of this House when we passed the Public Service Act that such a state of affairs as that should exist. In connection with the line repairers' branch, an anonymous letter was sent to me some time ago, complaining of the way in which it was worked. I do not, as a rule, take notice of anonymous correspondence, and I would not raise the question which this anonymous correspondent desired me to raise. I submitted it to the Secretary of the Department, and asked him whether he could do anything with it. His reply was that the letter was anonymous, and he could therefore take no notice of it. I then said that I would ask a question in the House about it One complaint, I. remember, was that in the absence of ordinary work the temporary hands were employed on one of the railway lines in taking down the insulators, and washing and replacing them. Another statement was that on the Eootscray-road the arms of the telegraph poles were sawn off and holes drilled for the reception of others, thus weakening the posts. I asked the Secretary if he would have an independent made, and he replied in the affirmative; but the man who was appointed.to inquiry, instead of ascertaining there was any truth in the statements made in the letter, went to each man and asked if he had written the document or knew anything about it. I have not been able to see the report which was made as the result of the inquiry ; but that was the state of affairs in the line repairers' branch about twelve months ago. So far as I know, no report has ever been presented to this House or to any one in authority on the subject. matter in which the Treasurer is, no doubt, interested, but which has received no attention during the discussion of the Estimates. I refer to the case of the transferred officers in the Post and Telegraph Department in Victoria, who, according to a State law passed just prior to Federation, are entitled to increased salaries. The question has already been before the Supreme Court of Mr Tudor. Victoria, and a decision given in favour of the men. The Victorian Government, it appears, declined to pay these officers for the time they were in the employ of that Government during the two or three monthsbefore the transfer of the Post and Telegraph Department to the Commonwealth. Two test cases were heard in the Full Court, and, as I have already stated,, a decision was given that the men wereentitled to the extra money. I notice that no provision is made on the Estimatesto meet the demands of these men in case of"" the Commonwealth or the Supreme Court again deciding in their favour ; and I desire to know whether the absence of that provision will prevent justice being done to the semen, who, according to law, are entitled to the extra money, and should receive it at the earliest possible moment. Even after the cases had been decided by the SupremeCourt, the Victorian Government refused to pay j but on the men putting in 50 oi100 writs day after day, the Government climbed down and settled two or threemonths ago. ago as that. question in the House six weeks or twomonths ago, the honourable and learned member for Indi, who was interested in the case, as a barrister, stated that the Victorian Government had intended, inquiry to appeal to the Privy Council, but had received high legal opinion from England thatmake the they practically had no case. These men whether are anxious to know whether the Commonwealth Government intend to pay, or whether another appeal will have to be made to the law courts. There -is no desire to threaten the Government, and the men will be perfectly satisfied with a straightanswer one way or the other, because they are naturally desirous of having a settlementafter a lapse of two years and a half. I contend that these men ought not to be compelled to resort to law when other members, There is another of the' service, who receive salaries of £600 to £700 per annum, are being paid increases from £ 1 0 to over £ 2 00 per annum month after month under the same Act, and if themen who receive small salaries are compelled to fight in tlie law courts, those who receive higher salaries should also have to justify their claims in the same manner.

I have noticed in the press lately that a. number of females engaged as cleaners at the Melbourne Post Office are asking Jiati n common with others employed by the Commonwealth they should be paid the minimum wage of £ 1 1 0 per annum. These women, who do harder work than others who are receiving the minimum wage, are entitled to some consideration, along with others who occupy similar positions in the Commonwealth service. They are practically permanently employed, some of them having been in the service for twenty years; and if their remuneration cannot be raised to the standard which they desire, their case should be looked into, and, at any rate, some concession made in regard to holidays. These women never have any leave of absence, while ©ther employees, who are in receipt of high salaries, enjoy an annual leave of two or three weeks per annum. Some of these women are widows with families, while others have ailing husbands; ancl, considering that they start work at six infchemorning, and.have to return in the evenings and work until about; 9 o'clock, something oughfc to be done to make their lot a little easier. Post and Telegraph Department, though not important as a revenue producer, is perhaps the most important service transferred to the Commonwealth from the point of view of thenot the convenience of the public. As to the administration offcheDepartment, I do not know that I can say anything but what iscomplimentary, considering tliat the effortsN o ; it is not fair of all the States have been directed to curtailing expenditure. If we have met wibh rebufisfrom both the present and the late Postmaster-General, we must recognise that the States have demanded retrenchmentin all fche transferred Departments, and that this is likely to operate against Perhaps then the Premier spoke as the extension of facilities during the operation of the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution. A t the same time, retrenchment may be carried to excess. In a trate in one spot to-day and in another I have not the slightest to-morrow, every encouragement to settlement oughtfcobe given by the provision of the ordinary conveniences of 'life. TheTreasurer, no doubt, regards revenue as the one great essential to good government; but unless inducements are offered by providing settlers with those comforts and facilities which all are supposed to enjoy under our advanced civilization, settlementon what are called the waste landsof Australia will be retarded rather than encourage'd. I have"" on manj' occasionsinterviewed both the present and the late Postmaster-General in regard to providing postal and telegraphic facilities for settlers on the repurchased estates in Queensland. The other night, when dealing with the question, of the Crown lands in New Guinea, I said that the alienation of large areas of land was one of the many causes of the railways of Australia not paying. The Governments of Australia, now recognise the fact, and to-day, in Victoria, Queensland, and other States, largeestates are being repurchased with theobject of settling a yeomanry population, and thereby increasing the traffic on therailways. But where there is settlement thereought to be postal and telegraphic facilities.

Mr Wilkinson. carriers have addressed to honourable memIt is only just to the Department bers a communication on the subject of their grievances. It comes, not from one individual, but from the Queensland branch of the Letter-carriers' Association. Written on the 12th September, it reads as follows :. A t alargely-attended meeting of theabove Assodepartments. ciation held on Monday evening, 7th instant, it was unanimously agreed to invite your intervenThe tion, to prevent a very serious hardship, as well as an injustice being imposed upon a large number of employees-betwee n eighty and ninety-of the Although the Mail Branch, G.P.O., Brisbane, through the of telegraphic and posstoppage of an allowance for overtime and working on public holidays, which had been paid by the Queensland Government for about thirty years prior to Federation, and paid byfcheComDepartment. monwealth Government from the time fche Postal Department was taken over, until the 30th June last. This allowance, known as "" English Mail Allowance,"" varied from £26 per annum, downwards, according to salaries-fch e majority of which were under £170 per annum-and was by I have had Special Regulation, Queensland, 1890, confirmed as ""payment for all claims for overtime and holidays."" A t the same time, "" Overtime Regulations,"" which were inapplicable fco the peculiar system offcheMail Branch, were suspended. The Just adverse conditions which officers of fche Mail Branch had fco contend against, such as extra early, late, and irregular hours, and being compelledfcoget meals in town-non e of which affect those in other branches of the DepartmentWe ought not to and which led fco the paymenfc of this allowance in the firsfc instance, upwards of thirty years ago, have up to the present time been neither removed nor modified. The new regulation re overtime issued by the Public Service Commissioner, while removing none of the disabilities under which we labour, practically amounts fco a reduction of income, by sums The ranging from £26 per annum downwards, fco upwards of eighty officers. We believe that the conditions existing here are peculiar to Queensland, and the new regulation, whicb may suit offices where overtime is only occasional, is totally unsuited to our case. Experience in Queensland has proved that the payment of a fixed sum has been an incentive fco diligence instead of, as the Commissioner appearsfcofchink,an inducement to loitering over the work. Notwithstanding periods They have to forego of adversity and retrenchment infchisState, and many changes of Government, the English mail allowance has never been suspended or curtailed, but has been passed by Parliament year after Just year. The deprivation of this allowance, which has been regarded as part of our salaries, and on which we have based our calculations when financing for the upkeep of our households for so many years past, will prove very embarrassing fco us, the majority being in receipt of less than £170 per annum. In March last, owing to the stoppage We should make the residents in at that time of the allowance for three months, a muss meeting of officers interested instructed a committee to draw up and forward a petition to the Commissioner, through' our Deputy Postmaster-General, embod3'ing the above, wifch other I am reminded that the letter reasons, for fche retention of the allowance, but up to the present no reply whatever has been SupplyI received. We were led to believe that Federation would better our condition, while we had a public .assurance from the Honourable J. G. Drake that there would be "" levelling up but no levelling down "" in the transferred State Dewrtments. . So far as I am aware, the grievances of the letter carriers have not been redressed. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General :has been aware of what has been going on. -the circumstances until I read that letter. -of the honourable gentleman, I feel sure that if any injustice is being suffered it will be remedied. intention to bring the grievances of the letter carriers before the Postmaster-General. This afternoon I received a copy of the 'letter which has just been read. I was not .aware that any other representative of -Queensland had been communicated with, -nor did I know until five minutes ago that a -deputation had been appointed to wait on the Postmaster-General to-morrow-a t what hour I do not know. I have not been asked to join the deputation, perhaps owing to the fact that I am leading the Opposition tonight. I wish to emphasize the remarks of the last speaker on the subject of the allowances to the men in the mail, branch at Brisbane. They claim to be paid for extra -early, late, and irregular hours. For thirty years the Queensland Government paid the men a sum ranging from -£26 per annum -downwards. The withdrawal of the allowance is a very serious matter to them. No doubt many of them have families to provide for. Their request is deserving of every consideration at the hands of the Postmaster-General. The allowance was withdrawn very soon after the Public Service --Commissioner entered upon his work. I think that the question ought to be reconsidered ""Virtually the salaries are now, to the amount named, smaller than they were previously. 'These men have to live out in the suburbs in order to obtain cottages at .a sufficiently low rent, and, therefore, they are at the --expense of getting their meals in town when they are called upon to attend at these irregular hours. General to take the matter into his favor-able consideration, in order to see if he cannot grant the relief asked for. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) WKile congratulating the honourable member for Oxley upon having risen to the position -of acting leader of the Opposition so soon [17 SEPT., 1903.] (1903-4). 5207 after joining their ranks, I must also congratulate him upon having brought this 1 question before the Committee. As he has stated, an arrangement was made to bring it before the Minister, but unfortunately it was not known to us then that the honourable member had received this letter. The men of whom he has spoken have a just grievance, was not aware of and I ana sure that the Postmaster-General will see that justice is done to them. It was, of course, expected that under Federation there would be uniformity throughout the postal service, but at the same time it was understood that the rights of transferred officers would be preserved. Their statutory rights are preserved by the express words of the Constitution, but their complaint is that, although for a period of up.wards of thirty years annual appropriations have been made by the Queensland Parliament as an allowance for overtime, and for extra work done in connection with the sorting of the English mails, that allowance is now taken from them. It must be remembered that the overtime which they are called upon to work does not mean, as is usually the case, staying an hour or two longer at the office after the ordinary work of t|je day is done. These men have to come on duty at extraordinary hours, and have to put themselves to great inconvenience to give the quick despatch of letters which the public desire. The allowance which they have hitherto received is in reality a substantial addition to their salaries, and, depending upon its continuance, many of them have entered into financial obligations extending over long periods, so that the sudden deprivation is a matter of serious consequence to them. I would point out that the men concerned do not live within the divisions represented by any of the members who have spoken. We do not desire to use political influence in the administration of the Department, but speak purely in the interests of justice. The men, we consider, have a serious grievance, which demands fair treatment at the hands of the Commissioner. I hope that the Minister will consult the Commissioner on the subject, and I think that if he makes inquiries I ask the Postmasterinto it he will be able to strongly recommend special consideration for them. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the question of telephone guarantees for extensions to new centres. In my own division there are places like Clifton, Stanthorpe, and Goombungee, all of",53,Chapman Surely The Country Like Ours Where People May Concen

318,Mr Wilkinson,From what I know,55,Chapman Surely The Country Like Ours Where People May Concen
319,Mr R. Edwards (Oxley),"It was mywhich promise to become large centres of population; and the people there are pressing very strongly, and, to my mind, very justly, for telephone communication. I can understand that tlie Minister should require some guarantee, in order that the Department may not incur loss in connection with extensions, but a sort of promise was made some time ago that the advisability of reducing the amount of these guarantees would be considered. A t the present time the sums asked for are so high as practically to block extensions. I do not ask for the abolition of guarantees,"" because I recognise that some system should be adopted to prevent the extension of the telephone, at the public expense, to centres which are never likely to be able to give a sufficient return ; but some discretion should be shown by the Minister. When officers report that places promise to become large centres of population, it is wise to extend the telephone system to them under less stringent conditions than the present regulations prescribe. I might specially mention the case of Clifton. That is a township situated in the very centre of the Darling Downs district, and close to some of the large estates which have been ^-purchased. The land is being rapidly taken up, and is increasing in value, while the population is growing. The residents are therefore asking for telephone communication. But, under the present regulations, a few men are required to guarantee a very large amount in order to obtain what is a convenience to the district generally. Cannot the Minister have more elastic regulations framed, so that it will not be impossible for rapidly growing townships to obtain telephonic communication which, if granted, will in time become a valuable source of revenue to the Department 1 If the Minister gives the matter careful consideration, he will see that a more liberal arrangement will not only increase the revenue of his Department, but at the same time give valuable assistance to those' who are engaged in developing the resources of the country. the Postmaster-General what is to be the policy of the Government with regard to new telegraph lines. There are several places in my electorate-ou t in the Never-Neverwhich are now quite cut off from communication in times of flood. It is a strange thing, in this twentieth century, to have townships in which there is neither a telephone nor a telegraph office, although thetelegraph line runs through them. That,, however, is the position of many Queensland townships. When the Department are asked to give telephonic communication they say-""What about the revenue ? We want a guarantee of so many pounds per annum before doing anything."" There are twotelegraph lines running through the township of Jackson, in my electorate, and. although the people have asked for telephonic communication with the nearest railway station,' which is thirty or forty miles distant, the Department will not agree to the erection of the wires until they obtain a cash guarantee. But what i& every one's business is no one's business. No one is ready to take the matter in hand and give the guarantee, and consequently nothing is done. I rose, however, to speak more particularly in regard to telegraphic communication. There is in my electorate aplace called Stonehenge, which is 100 miles from Longreach aud forty miles from. Jundah. Jundah is further west than Stonehenge in a direct line, but it isonly forty miles distant by road, and telegraphic communication could be given, by a line going direct, which need not be more than 35 miles long. Thecountry is perfectly level, being the watershed of the Thompson River, which runs into Cooper's Creek, so that there are noengineering difficulties to be feared. Theline has been promised as soon as funds are available, but if we go on as we aregoing now, I do not think that funds will_ ever be available for new works. I should like to know from the Minister what objection there is to the people erecting a private line-no t a telegraph line, but a telephoneline. I know that a telegraph line would not be allowed. member mean a line going across privateland entirely, or a private line which would have to cross public property ? there are hundreds of miles of telephone lines which are carried on the fences, one of the wires being used for the purpose. I saw in the newspaper, a few days ago, that the Minister was about to frame new regulations in regard to telephone charges, and I ask, therefore, if a line such as I speak of would come under them 1 Sir PHILIPEYSH I doubt it .",55,Chapman Surely The Country Like Ours Where People May Concen

Honourable members in most cases act upon the strength of ex parte statements, whilst the other side is known only to the Ministerial head of the Department, and therefore no good is accomplished by the discussion brought about. I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the complete these men a square go.

324,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"On every ocevery direction, and yet the officials seize every opportunity to place obstacles in the way of extensions, and to diminish the facilities now enjoyed. I hope that the Minister will make an effort to curb this disposition on the part of his subordinates, especially where the more sparsely populated or remote districts are concerned. I wish to emphasize some of the remarks made by honourable members in reference to the increments to which the letter carriers are entitled, and the position of the women cleaners in the Melbourne General Post Office. The letter carriers have been involved in serious monetary difficulties by their efforts to establish their claim to the increments referred to, and now find that they will be required to enter upon further litigation. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a definite statement as to the position taken by the Department in regard to the claims of the men, aud that we shall have an assurance that no further litigation will be necessary. The men have been driven from pillar to post. They have obtained a judgment from the Full Court to the effect that they are legally entitled to island, so that they may know what is. the increments, and if the Postmaster General is satisfied upon that point I trust that he will, honorably carry out the promises upon which the men have relied. The claim of the women cleaners in the Melbourne General Post Office to be brought under the operation of the provision relating to the payment of the minimum wage of £ 1 1 0 per annum, seems to have been established beyond doubt. I do not say that £ 1 1 0 per annum is not too much to pay them, but certainly something should be done to accord them justice, and to establish their right to be classified as permanent employees. Some of these women have been in the Department for twenty years. From a return recently furnished by the ex-Postmaster-General, it. appears that the eighteen female cleaners in Sydney are paid £ 1 per week, except the forewoman, who receiver. £ 7 8 per annum, and that in Melbourne there are twenty who are paid £ 1 5s.' per week, and five who receive £ 1 per week. Perhaps the Public ServiceA c t could be amended to meet the case of these employees, to secure to them the privileges to which they are entitled as public servants, and to give them their proper status. I hope that the Minister will be able to make a satisfactory statement in regard to these women, and also* in reference to the letter carriers' increments. The men"" have been very much harassed. bought houses on the strength of the promised increments. reside within my electorate entered into obligations for the purchase of properties-, on the faith of the promises made to them,, and I hope that the flagrant breach of faith which has been committed will be repaired, and that no further litigation will benecessary. If an assurance can be given to that effect, it will bring gladness to thehearts of many men, and as the whole sum involved is not very great-no t more than £30,0001 trust that the difficulties in the way will be at once removed. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I desire to know if the Postmaster-General has doneanything towards establishing telephoniccommunication along the coast of K i ng Island, for the benefit of the 600 or 700splendid pioneers who have made their homes there.

I need scarcely assure honourable members of my regard for the toiling pioneers who have a claim to the sympathy of the Government, when they take up land in the remote districts of Australia. Neither the honourable member for Coolgardie nor tlie honourable member for Moreton can impress me more strongly than I was previously impressed with the extent of our indebtedness to those who pioneer the country and prepare it for the settlers from whom we receive a.",57,Chapman Surely The Country Like Ours Where People May Concen

326,Mr Hume Cook,Some of them actually,58,Chapman Surely The Country Like Ours Where People May Concen
327,Mr Ronald,"Yes; several men whogood price for the lands which we sell. AlthoughI cannot enter fully into all the questions which have been addressed to me, honourable members may rest assured that in every instance in which the Department can derive a revenue which is at all commensurate with the capital outlay involved in any work which may be suggested, it will do its utmost to prevent any complaint on the part of individuals, no matter how far distant they may be from the centres of population. Their interests will not be forgotten, but will be considered along with the greater interests of t h e cities. Thus.far I address myself chiefly to the honourable member for Coolgardie, the honourable member for Moreton, and the honourable members for Maranoa, who have these matters specially at heart, and who have called attention to them. As I arn about to enter into a consideration of the Estimates, I wish to enlist the assistance of the honourable member for Coolgardie by informing him that, so far as Western Australia is concerned, considerable attention has recently been given to the working of the Department in that State with a view to installing as its manager an oflicer who and with the energy and enterprise that a man filling such an important office should possess. That is the object we have in view, and the gentleman who now holds the position has sought for a retiring allowance. I dare say that the honourable member for Coolgardie is aware that under the Western Australian statutes he is not yet entitled to retire upon his ful l pension. But, although he may lack two years of service in that respect, I do not think they ought to constitute a barrier to obtaining such improvements as we hope will flow from the appointment of an oflicer who is more in touch with the Department, and possibly more in sympathy with the Federation of which he is a servant. If , therefore, in the Acts of Western Australia there are any provisions under which an officer can be retired for the benefit of the State, and under which upon his retirement he can receive that solatium to which those Acts entitle him, the gentleman to whom referencehasbeen made will be speedily retired. I pass now to the very vexed question of the treatment which should be meted out to temporary employee's. Their cases are constantly being brought under my observation. Indeed, I have already had occasion to address a minute to the Prime Minister upon the subject seeking his advice, and asking how far I am at .liberty to make such> representations to the Public Service Commissioner as will cause him to reconsiderdecisions at which he has arrived. I have been waiting during the past two or threeweeks, whilst cases have been accumulating, in the hope that I might speedily be placed' in possession of a,completelistof the ofiicers who imagine that they have legitimate grievances in respect of those decisions, so that I might make a recommendation to my colleagues based upon some definite principle.. I have been asked what has been done in. regard to the rather large body of men in Victoria who feel that they have a grievance, and who are strengthened in their viewby the fact that Minister after Minister has very strongly expressed the opinion that the decision of fche Supreme Courtshould havedetermined the matter. Itshould, however, be remembered that the Commonwealth Treasurer is but the trustee of thefunds of the States, and that to them hemust render an account. If , therefore,, money is to be spent in a matter of thiskind, it should be expended with the concurrence of the State concerned, and ceris imbued with modern ideas, tainly not in defiance of the decision of that State that the money is not due to themen. have themselves paid the increments, andadmitted that they are legally liable. Sir PHILIPFYSH I do not intend to discuss the question with the honourable member. Speaking from a layman's stand-point it appears to me that these men are labouring under a legitimate grievance to which, they should not have been subjected so long, particularly' as the Court has decided in. their favour. But, as I have already pointed out, when the Commonwealth has to deal with money which it holds, in trust for a State, it must take care thati t expends it constitutionally. W it h that object in view, the whole case was remitted to the Prime Minister; it wasconsidered by tlie Cabinet, and referred to the Attorney-General for his opinion. months ago. ferred -to the Attorney-General by his colleagues only within the past two months. in reference to the matter six months ago.

I am unable to enlarge considerably upon the serious question, as some regard it, of what we shall pay to the -charwomen employed by the Federal Government.

I have tlie list of salaries here.

If they came under the provisions of the Public Service Act they would be entitled to three weeks' holiday a year, but even which are specially concerned. teen days' holiday per annum. not. are closed fourteen days a year. They do not remain open on the National holiday, on the occasion of the post-office picnic, on Show Day, the King's Birthday, and other holidays. on those days.

It is unneccesary for me to pursue the subject further than to say that I think that due consideration is shown to these women, and that it would be a great mistake on their part to pursue this matter much further. Representations have been made to me from time to time in regard to men who have been employed temporarily in the service for some years, but have not been placed on the list of permanent, officers.

This Bill has been passed by the Senate. It was considered there at some length, and with a great deal of care, as I perceive from the debates which took place upon it . That novelty provided for in clause 37, and may be regarded by honourable members as not to that which has, in the form of exempting them from expending as much labour in its consideration as would otherwise have been necessary. I need not call attention at any length to the fact that it was a wise foresight which included the making of laws upon patents amongst the powers granted to the Federal Parliament. That there should be a law of general application on this subject throughout the Commonwealth, instead of the diverse laws which have heretofore mind, so self-evident a proposition that I do not intend to take up time in supporting it . When I come to the question of fees, as I to make, it will, in that respect, be seen how incentive to inventive talent.

Without wasting time upon minor matters, I may point out a few of the salient provisions of visions, amongst which the most important is the constitution of a Commissioner of monwealth. This we considered necessary in order to enable the Department, when established, to carry out the examination as to novelty as provided for in the Bill. I am here referring to the examination as to",63,Naturalization Bill
376,'Amendment (By Sir Edmund Barton),,64,Patents Bill Second Reading
377,"Amendment (By Sir Edmund Bakton) On The Report Of The Conference, And That","an amendment, been placed at the end of clause 35. Without dwelling too long upon this topic, I may say that I ara of opinion that the amendment made in clause 35, in another place, should be removed, and that so far as the mere examination is concerned it should be sufficient if the Commissioner is intrusted with the determination of so much of the question of novelty as is covered by clause 37, which says tliat the examine]' shall ascertain and report whetherThe invention is already patented in the Commonwealth or in anj' State, or is already the subject of any prior application for a patent in the Commonwealth or in any State. The amendment, which does not well find a place in clause 35, whicli was a clause for the purpose of dealing with merely formal matters, imposes upon the examiner the duty of ascertaining and reportingWhether the invention is novel or has been already in possession of thg public with the consent or allowance of the inventor. That includes not only the ordinary question of novelty, but also the question of what is known as j u s publicum in a patent. We think it would not be wise to commit the examiner in the first instance on the subject of novelty, involving in many cases the taking of vast bodies of evidence, and the performance of functions scarcely germane to the office of fin examiner. It is a fact that in Germany and the United States that is done, but it is not done under the law of Englandasitexists, which has, I think, been found to be perfectly sufficient to enable these matters to be dealt with in a proper way. It must always be remembered that in the great majority of cases applications for patents are not the subject of objections, and that the stage for any objection comes first when a person who may otherwise have objected, and has not done so, finds that he ought to bring some suit for the purpose of establishing his counter right, or is himself the subject of some proceeding for the infringement of a patent. In these cases the whole question is brought before a tribunal constituted for the purpose, and a much more judicial, efficient, and impartial investigation then takes place. As will be guides for the future, it is much better that they should be given by courts of the highest learning and knowledge, than that they should be given by. a mere examiner of patents. honourable gentleman propose to constitute the court 1 able member will find that provided for in one of the earlier clauses of the Bill. The question is one which will be dealt with in Committee, but as the Bill stands now, the Supreme Court means the "" Supreme Court of the State in which the Patent Ofiice is situated, or a Judge thereof."" I think the sufficiency of that provision is a question which may engage our attention; and we may consider whether we should not make it somewhat more extensive. The amendment providing that the whole question of novplty sliould be gone into by the examiner, was inserted under an impression that it would assist inventors by saving them expense, that it would encourage inventions, and prevent the register being crowded with useless patents. We think it would not do any one of these tilings. On the contrary, we think it would probably be found to unduly harass inventors. There are instances cited in the reports presented to us of-the expei'ience of Australian inventors in the United States Patents Office, where the system of general examination for novelty prevails, which show the truth of what I say, and prove tliat this provision would not save inventors expense, but would render the employment of patent attorneys more necessary than before. The American system is the living and pleasure of a multitude of patent agents, to whom its existence is a necessity, and the inventor who runs away with the idea that the United States law was just made solely for his benefit is recommended to visit Washington in order to have his eyes opened. It would not prevent the issue of invalid patents, because Edmunds, a recognised authority upon the question of patents, when in the United States, was informed by persons who were in a position to know the facts that, in that country, something Uke 70 per cent, of the patents granted were, when litigated, declared void. That to a large extent is the result of committing to a less learned authority work which should really be done by a judicial tribunal. In decisions upon these questions the debates on the Patents Act Amendment Bill of 1902, in-England, statistics were brought forward to show that"" the proportion of patents upset in Germany, where the same system prevails, is especiaUy great.

379,Sir Edmund Barton,"The honorexamination as to novelty by an officer instead of leaving the matter to be decided by the proper tribunal, when, if ever, the question is raised, are these.1. That it is impossible to say from a written document whether the invention described in it is novel or not. Por instance, in Germany patents were refused for fche Bessemer steel process, ancl the Siemeivs Regenerative Furnace, as not being novel. That is a very striking fact, and it is now acknowledged that the Bessemer steel process is one of the greatest inventions of the age. 2. That ifc is impossible for an examiner, however competent,fcoknow whether an alleged invention ig novel or nofc. 3. That it is unjust in the granting of patents to rely on the judgment or opinion of one individual. 4. That ifc gives rise to an erroneous belief in the minds of people that fche Crown guarantees the validity of the patent. Whichi t does not. In the United States and Germany, where the system exists, quite as many patents are set aside as in other countries, and some authorities contend that the proportion is greater. 5. That underfche S3'Sfcem patents arearbitrarily ventors, will be able to come to the central refused for useful and meritorious inventions. These beiug the objections, when we come to that portion of the Bill, we shall endeavour to restore it to its original form, and confine the examination as to novelty to the searching of the register, for which purpose we must have the transfer of the State Departments, and the determination of the question of whether there has been any prior application for a patent in the Commonwealth or in any State. 52 enables objection to be made to the Commissioner on the ground of novelty. and objection being made on that ground the objection may be examined into. In the absence of any such opposition we do not think it will be wise to have a prolonged investigation upon that subject, which would, undoubtedly, be of great expense to inventors. In the transfer existing patent applications will not be interfered with except that the Acts will be administered by Commonwealth officials instead of by State officials, the fees, when collected on such patents and applications being received on behalf of the States. Part III . provides for the keeping of a register of patents. visions relating to a register of this nature, and I need not detain the Housei n discussing them, important point. Where is the register to be kept ? will arise, and it may be found, when we discuss this part of the measure, that it is not wise to have more than one central register, or more than one central examiner. It may be found wise, although not yet pro-, vided in the Bill, to have receiving offices in various parts of the States to which applicants may address correspondence and documents, and which will be in immediate touch by telegraph or otherwise with the central ofiice. office. be one examination in chief, and the register must be kept at the central office, because otherwise there would be instant confusion. that mechanics, who are the principal inoffice? explained afterwards, they will not be required to attend the central office in person. Part IV . of the Bill relates to procedure, and here there is some departure from the English system. Division1 of this part deals with applications. In England and several of the States the applicant for a patent must be the "" true and first inventor ""-the term used in the Statute of Monopolies, Act 21 of JamesI -o r a person claiming under ""the true and first inventor."" The decisions which have flowed from this expression are, in some cases, very interesting, and I may mention one in which "" the true and first inventor"" was held to include an importer of an invention from abroad. Except for the necessity of giving some elasticity in the administration of an old law as time goes on, the decision was about as far from the original meaning as one could well travel. In the present day, on the other hand, the necessity for that doctrine has disappeared, .owing to improved means of communication, which enable persons .to deal with matters for themselves, instead of leaving them in the hands of importers.

386,Mr Wilkinson,Ho w can we expect,66,Patents Bill Second Reading
387,Sir Edmund Barton,"As will beperson claiming uncler him, to apply for a patent. There is another important matter in the same division referring to the examination as to novelty. Until 1902 no examination as to novelty was made in England. An application could be opposed and invalidated on the ground mentioned, but unless opposition was entered the grant of the patent issued as of course, if the applithat no inventor would apply under tliis cation and specification complied with the conditions laid down. But in other countries, notably, in the United States and Germany, a general examination as to novelty is required. The Conference of experts, which was held in the Commonwealth, reported in favour of examination as to novelty to the extent of ascertaining whether the invention had been previously patented or had been the subject of a prior application for a patent. Curiously enough, a committee appointed by the Board of Trade in England arrived independently at the very same conclusion. It is now recognised almost universally that some examination as to novelty should be made, and the question is as to how far this examination should go. There are many grave objections to the practice prevailing in the United States and Germany of requiring a general examination as to novelty. The Bill, as introduced in the Senate, followed the recommendation of the Conference of officers, but an amendment was carried providing for a general examination as to novelty. This was a departure from tlie. general scheme of the Bill, and I think tliat this House, in its wisdom, will restore the measure to its -original form. 'Division2 of this part of the Bill provides for wide grounds of opposition. Any objection on which a patent could be upset after the grant may be taken before the grant issues. This provision, coupled with the examination as to previous patenting, will fifibrd the best security that can reasonably be provided that the patent when granted will not be open to objection. Division3 provides for the eifect of the patent and its duration. The term fixed is fourteen years, as in England and all the British dominions, except Canada, where the term is eighteen years. . Divisioni relates to the amendment of specifications, and, follows the English law, so that I need not trouble the House at any length, especially as this and many other parts of the Bill are essentially for consideration in Committee. extension of a patent, and this again follows the English law. Division6 demands perhaps a little more consideration, because it contains a provision which has been somewhat severely criticised. This division provides for the grant of an additional patent for an improvement. This is in accordance with the recommendation of the conference, and it is purely enabling, seeing provision unless satisfied that his patent would be safe if he succeeded in getting it. That, again, is a matter which will be considered in Coinmittee, and which ,1 do not at this stage propose to discuss. Division7 provides for the revocation of patents, and is almost identical with the English law. A patent may be revoked in case of fraud or for other good reasons known to modern law. PartV . deals with the working of patents. This part as introduced provided for the working of patents in Australia within five years after the date of the granting of the patent, and prohibited the importation of patented articles after four years, the patent being revocable on the application of the Attorney-General if this clause were infringed, and the article were not being manufactured within the Commonwealth. That is a provision which the Senate omitted, but I think there is a good deal to be said for it , and I , or the Attorney-General when he returns, willmove the re-insertion of the original clause, for which there is abundant justification. The question of free-trade and protection, in my judgment, scarcely arises, because, if a patent law were regarded from thatstand-point, every free-trader would vote against every patent, which in itself is a protection and grants a monopoly. A patent not only establishes a manufacturer or inventor in a better position than others in the same country or wherever the patent operates, but in regard to the process of manufacture itself gives a monopoly to a single person, and guards it for a period of time, so that there shall be no possible competition. That is the nature of the grant of a patent, and it seems to me that a provision that a patent may be revocable unless the manufacture takes place in the country where the patent is granted, is not in the direction of increasing the protection, but in the direction of taking away the protection if good ground be shown. I may mention that a similar Division5 provides for the provision is in force in Canada, Germany, and in South Australia, so that it is not entirely new or without good warrant. This clause was not inserted for the benefit of the inventor, but for the benefit of the public. I may mention the further fact, which seems to be very strongly in favour of such a provision,that owing toits operation in Germany, manufacturers there were enabled to secure manufacturing rights in the case of linotype machines at a much cheaper rate than in England. The remainder of this part of the Bill follows the English law, which will be familiar to honourable members who have had occasion to look into the subject. Part VI . deals with infringements, and also follows the English law. An important provision of the B ill is that the Court may call in an assessor in any proceedings relating to an infringement; and the plaintiff must deliver the particulars of the infringement complained of, while the defendant must deliver the particulars of his objection. If the defendant disputes the validity of the"" patent he must state his grounds, and if one of the grounds is want of validity he must state the time and place of the previous application, or the previous use of the patent which he alleges. That is enough to show the nature of the proceeding. Clause 85 providesIn any action for infringement the validity of a jurious to the rights of a patentee, so that patent shall not be disputed on the ground of want of novelty by reason that a patent for the same invention was applied for or granted more than fifty years prior to the application for the first mentioned patent, if the invention has not been in public use in the Commonwealth or a State at any time during sucb period of fifty j'ears. Part VII. relates to the rights of the Crown, and follows modern English law. Eor instance, a patent under this Bill gives the same rights against the Crown as against the subject. that under English law before modern legislation-and to the case of Feather v. the Urotvn the Crown was held to have a right to use and make any article subject to a patent without any payment or royalty, or compensation to the inventor. ceased to be the law in England, and, of course, we propose to make a very opposite law here. Crown, however, in administering a Department, whether of the Commonwealth or of a State, may use an invention for the public service on such terms as may be a.greed on with the patentee, or, in default of agreement, on such terms as may be Sir Edmund Barton. settled by arbitration. There is a provision that.the inventor of any improvement in instruments or munitions of war may assign the invention and tlie patent to the Commonwealth, and the assignment is to be valid, notwithstanding any want of valuable consideration. The next provision of consequence in this part is in clause 93, which is as follows :The communication of any invention for any improvement in instruments or munitions ot war to the Minister for Defence, or to any person authorized by him to investigate the invention, shall not, nor shall anything done for the purpose of the investigation by sueh person be deemed publication or use of the invention so as to prejudice the grant or validity of any patent for tbe invention. Honourable members will recollect that on occasions, when the question of the Crown taking up an invention and using it for military or other similar purposes has arisen, the inventor, in many cases, has been chary of disclosing his process ""to the Crown or its representative, on the ground that that would be regarded as a publication of theinvention,and might render the invention publici jwris to the extent of depriving the inventor of his rights. It will be enacted here, if the House agrees, tliat no publication of that kind shall have any effect inwhere it is impossible to judge of the value of an invention except by becoming acquainted with all its processes, this provision will secure the patentee from prejudice. Part VIII . provides for the appointment of patent attorneys; and this is in accordance with the recommendations of the Conference. It is provided that persons may be registered as patent attorneys on passing the prescribed examination. An y person Honourable members will be aware registered as a patent attorney may be removed from the register; and no person I need only refer lawyers who has been employed as an officer in the Patent Office shall be registered as a patent attorney until he has ceased to be an officer for at least twelve months. The reasons for the latter provision are obvious. Any But that has person who proves that at the commencement of the A ct he was bona fide practising as a. patent agent in any part A responsible Minister of the of the Commonwealth, and had been so practising for six months prior to such commencement, may be registered without passing the prescribed examination, There is a penalty, which may be as high as £100, for a person describing himself as a patent attorney, unless he is registered or entitled to practise as a patent attorney under the Act. I think that it should extend to his practising or acting as a patent attorney without having the right .to do so, because obviously that would be imposing upon the confidence of the public. Parts IX . and X . contain the ordinary provisions with regard to regulations and fees. The remaining portion of the Bill to which I propose to call attention is the second schedule, which prescribes the fees to be collected. These amount to £ 1 3 £ 8 up to the sealing, and £ 5 for the renewal of a patent. amount to £ 5 in New South Wales, £9 in Yictoria, £ 1 8 in Queensland, £ 8 in South Australia, £ 1 8 in Western When a person wishes to patent his invention throughout Australia, he has to pay £96, whereas the fees for taking out a patent for the Commonwealtli will be. less than one-seventh of that sum. official fees 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am not now referring to the' payment of fees to agents or for drawings, but I shall be making a liberal allowance if I say that, in addition to the official fees, the applicant will' have to pay £ 7 in fees for documents and drawings, bringing the total fees for a Commonwealth patent up to £ 2 0 . Under the present system we may fairly allow £ 4 for fees in each State for a. like purpose, making an addition of £ 2 4 to the £96 for official fees. That would bring the entire cost of getting a patent for the Commonwealth to perhaps £20, as against £ 1 2 0 to secure like rights for all the States under the present system. in the first instance, and £ 5 at the expiration of seven years,' when a renewal of the patent is applied for. than from £ 1 2 to £ 1 5 would be payable for seven years, counting the fees to agents and fees for documents and drawings. In any event, the total cost, including agents' charges, would bo probably £ 2 0 under the system we propose, whereas it is not less than £ 1 2 0 under the present system. I cannot put that more strongly than' by quoting from a memorandum of the Board of Tradei t was presented to the Premiers' Conference last year-certai n figures as to patents issued in recent years for the six Australian 10 T colonies. In the years set out the six Australian colonies issued patents at the rate of 2,600 a year. If I assume that under the new system only 1,000 patents a year will be issued, that will be more than a liberal allowance for the duplication of patents under the old system. Taking the saving on each patent at about £100, the total saving to the inventive persons in the Commonwealth will be about .£100,000 a year. That argument alone sbould be strong enough to induce honourable members to give their attention to this Bill. tration of the benefits of Federation-. Australia, and £ 3 8 in Tasmania. striking illustration of .the' benefits of Federation. It is in directions such as these, which are of a practical nature, that' the advantage of Union will most commend itself to, and must evoke the thanks of, the community. is for purely law suits have gone on in the different States with varying results. able member is quite right. In the different States there have been law suits respecting different patents, but involving the same principle of law, and varying decisions have been given. That, of course, will be obviated under the new system. Having, in the absence of my honourable and learned colleague, the Attornny-Qeneral, who was. to have conducted the Bill through theChamber, gprie through its main provisions,. I do not think that I need detain honorable members any longer than to say that it isfairly drawn, and provides for a goodworkable law under modern principles and methods. It may, therefore, be fairly commended to the judgment of the House, and I shall consider it an honour to this Parliament and the Government if , before we part, it is placed on the statute-book. not the least intention of making a second reading speech. the debate. would be justifiable to take that course at this stage in the history of the Parliament. . I think that what tbe Prime Minister has told us to-night would justify us in agreeing to the second reading of tbe B ill and discussing its provisions in Committee.",66,Patents Bill Second Reading
