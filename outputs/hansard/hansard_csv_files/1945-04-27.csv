My colleague, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and I have discussed the matter, and he has placed it on the agenda for oonsideration by the Production Executive. We are much concerned about it, and are anxious to give such homebuilders the same priority in regard to materials as is given to the Government. WIRE NETTING. Munitions say whether there is a prospect of reasonable supplies of wire netting being made available in the near future? Many farmers are suffering from the ravages of rabbits, and are unable to obtain wire netting of a suitable kind. that increased supplies of wire netting shall be made available to primary producers. We have the facilities for manufacturing more netting, but so far we have, been unable to get enough A l class labour to do the work. As the honourable member must understand, firstflass man-power is required in the fighting services, and the kind availaible to us is not, unfortunately, of the kind suitable for the heavy industries. I am taking the matter up again with the Minister for Labour and National Service with a view to obtaining enough labour to relieve the existing shortage of supplies. Debate resumed from the 26th April (vide page 1151), on. motion by Mr That the following paper be printed:Equipment of Australian Troops-Minis terial Statement. Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [11.3] -This debate seems to have covered fields not at first contemplated All the agitation in the press prior to the debate beginning was based on allegations that there was a shortage of equipment for use by our troops serving overseas. That, I understood, was to be the principal point of the attack. The Government was to be criticized because of its alleged failure to provide the equipment needed to enable our forces to perfornu the task allotted to them. The debate has proceeded to the accompaniment of a good deal of 'bluster on the part of honourable members opposite, but they have failed to produce auy convincing evidence to support their contention that the Government has been at fa.ult. The report of my colleague, the Acting Minister for the Army (Senator Eraser), completely disposed of the allegations against the Government. However, as a service Minister, I know that it is not possible for any government to provide all that is required all the time in every place where it is needed. We know that the exigencies of war are responsible for shortages from time to time, but it has been conclusively proved that there has been no general or substantial shortage of a kind likely to hamper the men in their operations I am most anxious against the enemy. Some honourable members opposite must by now be feeling somewhat, guilty because of the uneasiness which they have caused in the minds of relatives of servicemen by suggesting that the Government has failed to equip the men properly. absolutely satisfied? in the work which the Government is doing has only -been increased by the ineffective efforts of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) to belittle it.",19,Bousing

47,Mr Drakeford,"My satisfactionlutely satisfied on the subject of equipment 'i tnat the position in regard to equipment is absolutely satisfactory, and to assert anything of the kind would be absurd. I have said that it is impossible at all times to provide all the equipment necessary in every place, but I repeat that there is no general shortage. Having listened to the Opposition's frontal attack on the Government, and then to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), I could not help coming to the conclusion that the attack had been planned without his knowledge. Had he looked around while he was speaking, he would have seen that most of his few supporters had vanished from the field. The debate was on a pretty low level until the Leader of the Opposition spoke, having ibeen dragged down to that level by those of his supporters who had spoken before him. As a matter of fact, the Leader of the Opposition did not come into the debate until it became necessary to rescue it from the depths into which it had descended. The whole campaign against the Government was vamped up by the press of New South Wales, and the attack was led from New South Wales, which has a great horror of the possibility of the country being led by Leader of the Opposition regarding the a Victorian Prime Minister. The newspapers persistently attack the Government for its alleged shortcomings, leaving altogether out of consideration the effects of the war. Like the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles), I have visited the forward areas, and I regard myself as privileged in having had that opportunity. I have talked to the men. There were no newspaper reporters present, but there were war correspondents, and they were anxious to discover the reactions of the men. ceived any letters from the men containing complaints about equipment? honourable member for New England seems to have received them all. The men must regard him as the general recipient of complaints, a belief in which, apparently, he encourages them, but I should prefer to regard him as the waste paper basket"". I have not received any letters of complaint from the men. A few letters have been sent to me which indicate that tliere is not complete satisfaction. There is a good deal of dissatisfaction among the men on the ground that they are not more actively engaged, but in war there must always be periods of inactivity. A t such times men become bored, and some of them send letters to gentlemen who prove themselves sympathetic, such as the honourable member for New England. received no such letters? -The honourable member for New England has repeated that question several times-. It is evident that he is merely being obstructive. honourable member for New England is disturbed in his mind because he must realize that he failed completely in his attack upon the Government, and he is now trying to justify himself. I have visited the men in forward areas, and know how they feel. Generally speaking, they would like a more active role. That is readily understandable, bin what they desire cannot always be given to them at the time when they want it. The point raised by tht use of our forces is a matter for general disputation, but I , as a service Minister, have had to rely upon the advice tendered to me by those who undertake the responsibility of planning the campaign. Some reference was made during the debate to a shortage of aeroplanes, but little was advanced in support of the charge, and it can be dismissed as having no substance in it. Indeed, one has the feeling that the whole attack was merely a political venture designed to discredit the Government, and to damage the reputation which it has established over a number of years. I reply to the charge that there has been a shortage of aircraft, not because I think the charge in itself merits serious attention, but because, if it were not answered, uneasiness might be caused in the minds of the relatives of servicemen.

Statements in letters by men who have not a complete knowledge of thc facts are not evidence that the Government has failed to do its job properly.

Had he sought information from me, he could have obtained it. mation from officers who had come from operational areas. a free advertisement to those sections of the press which have made unfounded nllegations, based, it is said, on information obtained from high-ranking officers. T often wonder who is the person who speaks on behalf of the Royal Australian Air Force.

I fully appreciate that those honourable members who have raised these matters in thc House-were not, and could not be expected to be, aware of all the circumstances. It is unfortunate that their informants should have placed before tbem information in a form which cannot be regarded as other than misleading; it certainly is not in accordance with the facta. The information whicb I have now given to the House sliould remove any anxiety which may have existed in the minds of honourable generally.

Yesterday the honourable member for Balaclava said that no single defence arm-the Navy, the Army or the Air Force-coul d hope to win battles hy itself, but that a balanced force was necesassembly here. ?ai'y. Just as we must have a balanced force as a whole, so we must have a balanced Air Force, with machines suitable for various requirements. That is the way that we are proceeding. The plan may not suit the honourable member for Balaclava, but it is believed to be the best way to fulfil our part in the struggle. that fighter squadrons sliould remain in Australia? ing the suggestion that they are remaining in Australia, nor shall I give the percentage of squadrons serving outside Australia, despite the temptation to clo so. The published statements ou these are quite incorrect. I am convinced that the fighter squadrons which are being utilized outside Australia are being disposed to the best advantage by those whose responsibility it is to allocate them effort is being made to complete the depot to the various areas. The honourable inember for Balaclava also referred to the type of Merlin engine proposed to be built locally and indicated that it was not totally inadequate in all States, and of the latest type. I assure the House that the type whicb is being manufactured here is tbe 100 series, Mark 302, which is the latest Merlin engine for military aircraft, and is suitable for such aircraft as tbe Lancaster and the Mustang and the Mosquito. 120. tion furnished to me is that the type proposed to be produced locally is the latest Merlin engine for military aircraft, and that it fits in with our construction programme. The honourable member also referred to Mustang aircraft and said that the first of these machines would not be ready until after the war. I now inform him that the used to build houses. first of the Australian-built Mustangs will be flying within one week, and that member wishes to make charges against there is every reason to believe that the the Government in respect of housing, approved schedule of manufacture will be adhered to thereafter. built Lancasters would not be ready till after tlie war, and that the parts of Mustangs were being imported for regard to Mustangs is as I have stated. The honourable member said that. 200 engines for Lancaster aircraft were being imported and. would be assembled, in Australia. Tbe arrangement which has been entered into is a great compliment to Australia in that British manufacturers have asked us to make Rolls RoywMerlin engines. After tbe war Australia will be the only country outside Britain wbicb will be manufacturing such engines. The honourable member referred to a number of other matters to which I shall refer briefly, although they are not of great importance. Among such matters he mentioned the buildings at Tottenham. The buildings being constructed at Tottenham are for the purposes of the main air force stores depot in Victoria for war and post-war purposes. Every as quickly as possible. As honourable members know, storage facilities for tbe purposes of war departments have been that, accordingly, . makeshift arrangements have had to be resorted! to. That has caused considerable inconvenience and has been most uneconomical in the use of man-power. The construction of the Tottenham buildings will not only result in more effective control of stores, and storage, but will also enable a reduction of man-power to be made, as well as the release of some buildings for other purposes. I see no cause for criticism in regard to that project, nor can I see how the building of stores at Tottenham relates in any way to the printing of a paper which deals with equipment for personnel serving at the fighting front.",23,Curtin

74,Mr Drakeford,"If the honorableguth charges could be answered as satisfactorily as the charges already made havo been answered. At present, large quantities of stores are kept in temporary structures which are not satisfactory. I have dealt with the matters relating to my own department. The honourable member for Balaclava ;ilso dealt with a great many matters conAsI have indicated in my replies tonected with aircraft production. The Minister for that department is now, I >im glad to say, back in the House. If the honourable member thinks that these detailed matters are important enough, lie can raise thein with him and if he does details of the proposals are still the he will get a complete answer to every one of them. I do not propose to deal with them because they do not concern my department, and I have not been able to obtain any information which would 'be satisfactory to the honourable member or to any other honourable member who haa raised the subject. But I do agree with the honourable member for Balaclava that we should endeavour to carry on the aircraft industry in this country. Just how we shall be able to do that within our limitations has not yet been decided, but the honourable member need have no fear that this Government will fail to do everything necessary to keep it in operation. The honourable member also referred to surplus personnel. I do not know what that has to do with the provision of equipment. It is possible, however, that there are surplus men in some places. For months past, and even now, that matter has been given thorough attention. It would almost seem that the honourable gentleman is clairvoyant, so accurate is his anticipation of events. He has made a number of suggestions which I think he must 1 realize aro already being gone into and on which decisions are being made. I hope that the Air Force will at no time carry surplus personnel, because the manpower requirements of the country in other directions are so acute that surpluses in the services must be released as soon as possible. say something about the Fleet Air Arm which a lot of boys told me they want to join. Facilities exist for their training at Pearl Harbour. dealt with that matter on three or four occasions, but, if the honourable member requires it, I shall furnish a little more detail. Approaches have been made by the Royal Navy authorities here for a monthly quota of Royal Australian Air Force fighter pilots, particularly for Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm purposes. earlier questions on this matter, the Royal Australian Air Force has no facilities for the training of such personnel for deck landings and the like, whicb are obviously of vital importance. All subject of discussion between the Air Staff and thc Royal Navy representatives here, and every action will be taken to meet, as far as possible, the Royal Navy's requirements, provided the Royal Navy can undertake the conversion of the fighter pilots for Fleet Air Arm purposes. In tbe event of Royal Australian Air Force personnel being provided, it is desirable that they should retain theirAustralian identity, and no difficulty in that direction is anticipated. some one opposite can be satisfied, because the Opposition has set out on a campaign to create in the public mind the idea that the Government has failed in its duty;, but that has been completely disposed of. Every one in Australia with an independent mind will agree that the Opposition has completely failed in its attack and that tbe attack has no substance whatever. that it does in tbe honourable member'."" breast, but it is not likely to be realized. I have never listened to a debate in which so much noise has been made witb solittle substance behind it. The next time the Opposition decides to launch an attack on the Government it ought to see that there is powder in the gun as well as in the magazine, so that it shall not demonstrate to the people, as it has done on this occasion, that its hope of"" ever regaining the treasury-bench is soremote as not to cause us or the peopleany anxiety.",24,Curtin

It is tlie responsibility of the Australian Government to<clean out'New G-uihea as soon, as possible. These are many reasons for. such a campaign. The! first' is file clanger wliicli tlie Japanese constitute t'o Australia. I"" know i'f will Ho said' that they are isolated and' that a greatbody of water sepai-atbs New Guinea from tfemainland.

New Guinea must, be freed from the Japanese as rapidly, aa w.e. can : manage* to remove, the threat! to. o.ur. own safety and rehabilitate, the area. General Blarney has estimated that about, 250,0.00 Japanese troops still remain between the Philippines and Australia as a 1 disciplined,, organized and' armed force. Th. the arc. extending from Wewak to the SbTomon-Is-lands-through New Britain to NeAv Zealand, there is an estimated total 1 of S0,000 Japanese troops. They have l>een by-passed in the general advance, ft is indeed unfortunate that the term "" mopping up "" has been used to describe the operation of annihilating them. It was used by General MacArthur on seyeral occasions and it was repeated by the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), but it is an inept description. The 250,000 by-passed Japanese constitute armies which have to he dug out, and Australian forces should be made available to dig them out, particularly from 'New Guinea. If that is not to he our policy, we have too many men in uniform who have been idle far too long. ""We must resurvey the position and either employ those men in the way I have indicated or restore them to industries so sorely in need of them. Demobilization must start right away or we must set about the task with sufficient strength to annihilate the foe. I repeat that the Government cannot have it both Avays. It icannot keep our men in the forces in idleness and thereby keep them out of industry. They must be employed one way or the other. Our task is to clean up New Guinea and release our men imprisoned in Malaya and elsewhere as quickly ,as possible. That is our duty. Our men must do it. The Government itself, as I shall now show, has tacitly adtinitted that the task which confronts our forces is a minor one, and I consider that thc case with regard to the employment of our forces depends upon tlie stafeus of the campaign, according to the Government's interpretation. Tlie Government has decided that service in the campaign in the islands to the north shall not entitle a soldier to receive accept the assurances given to him by the a service ribbon. This is in marked contrast to the recognition of service by troops iu the Middle East and that accorded Allied personnel who serve in the South-West Pacific Area. Australian soldiers who serve in the 'battle areas to the north are not entitled to receive the 1939-43 Star. Apparently, such discrimination reflects the Government's real opinion of the importance of the campaign. For instance, a galley cook on a transport which has conveyed officers and men to New Guinea is entitled to wear the 1939-43 Star. But a member of the Australian Imperial Foroe on the same troopship may win the Victoria Cross, [43] the Distinguished Service Order, -or the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Military Medal, but if he has not heen in any -other theatre of war, he will not 'be entitled to a service ribbon. This discrimination has had a very bad psychological effect on the troops concerned. However, it reflects, apparently, the Government's real assessment of the importance of these operations. The uneasiness among many of our men due to long periods of idleness is not in the best interests-of the nation, or of the individuals themselves. The immediate Tole to be allotted to our troops should be clearly defined. Should they not be needed immediately for the purposes for which they enlisted and were trained and equipped, they should be demobilized, and used as quickly as possible to reinforce our dwindling manpower in industry. Last night the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) emphasized the seriousness of the position on our food front. He showed clearly that our food position is deteriorating at a dangerous rate, due principally to lack of man-power to produce sufficient food, not only for our own civilian population and fighting services, but also to meet our obligations to Allied forces and the Motherland. 1 have listened with the closest attention to the debate concerning the present (-quipment of our forces. As a member of live Advisory War CouncilI was -inured that the equipment position is satisfactory. Obviously, I , and my colleagues, must accept that assurance just as the Prime Minister himself must Government's advisers. However, after listening to this debate I am convinced that the position is not so satisfactory as such assurances would indicate; and I shall produce further evidence in support of that already produced by honourable members on this side. Parliament and the nation are indebted to the honourable members. I mentioned earlier for having ventilated the faets, and given to the Government an opportunity to clear up doubts on the matter. The press has been full of reports on the subject by war correspondents who have .been able to obtain information at first hand. Therefore, honourable members on this side have every justification for raising the matter in the House. In doing so, they carry out their duties as trustees for the people. Bearing in mind the sources of their information, they must give some credence to it. They conscientiously 'believe that that informaofficers in both this war and the last war. tion is true; otherwise they would not have referred to the subject. Therefore, it is unfair for Government supporters to say that members of the Opposition have brought forward these complaints merely with gaining They obtained their information from highly placed and responsible officers in the fighting services; and they have discharged their responsibility by ventilating such complaints. member suggest that the advisers to the Government are not responsible officers? that, in the light of the evidence produced in this debate, the equipment position is not so rosy as we were previously assured. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) must have entertained suspicions. Apparently he was not satisfied with the assurances given to liim, because he sent the Acting Minister for the Army (Senator Fraser) on a most urgent mission to report on the position. That action on the part of the Prime Minister is in itself some evidence of doubt in his own mind; otherwise he would not have sent the Acting Minister for the Army to the battle areas to ascertain the facts at first hand. Furthermore, the report of the Acting Minister for the Army also provides evidence that things are not as they should be, because it definitely admits lack of equipment, particularly heavy equipment, this shortage being attributed to lack of shipping. I shall say something about that aspect later. Various complaints have been made to me personally. I am not one of those who give credence to everything they hear. I insist upon being supplied, with concrete evidence, because it .is the experience of honourable members generally that many people who corns to them with complaints have no better evidence than hearsay. I do not propose to produce that kind of evidence. I realize that there are two sides to every question. However, I believe responsible officers, because no officer wants to see his men ill-equipped. That Ls his responsibility, and, indeed, we are fortunate in the quality of our .However, only this morning I received a letter from an officer whom I know particularly well.

As I am certain that all the right runts on your side, I am writing to put you in possession of facts which may not have come to your notice and whicli I feel the Australian people are entitled to know. T wish to make it quite clear that I make these statements quite openly-that I have no objection to being quoted-that I am prepared to substantiate any statement of fact that T. may make, that I am prepared to justify any opinion which I may express. This letter should reach you within one week from now. If it does not, it would be interesting to know the reason. This letter is dated the 18th AprilFirstly and without thc slightest doubt, the Australian Army as evidenced here is not well-equipped. 1 do not hold myself out as an expert in things military, but after five years or thereabouts of service in Libya. Egypt, Palestine, various parts of Australia, and now in New Guinea, I feci that 1 am justifled in expressing an opinion. Merely for the purpose of giving my military background, I can inform you that I have served successfully as a private, lance-corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant, lieutenant and now captain, with, inter alia., the 9th and (ith Australian Divisions. Clothing, &c -On the 28th February, a brigade in this area in contact with the enemy requisitioned for shirts, slacks and boots required to replace items worn out or destroyed, &c, in tliat month.

The result of this shortage is scandalous and a disgrace to Australia. I give you, out of a multitude of examples, two typical instances. This morning I was at a battalion head-quarters when a fighting patrol returned. One member of that patrol had on a shirt (the only one he has) which was ripped from the neck opening to the bottom. Both knees were out of his trousers, nnd the trousers were literally in rags. The padre iu the same battalion is on his last pair of trousers. He has no scat in them. Tent shelter halves small tents) were issued for t r i a l months ago-abou t six months. They were found to be not waterproof. They have not been replaced. Fancy sending to our troops in New Guinea tents that were not waterproof! The letter continuesI could go on with comments on gaiters, boots, socks, hats, but it would be only overstressing the obvious. Fighting Equipment -If you compare the war equipment table of an infantry battalion in .1.940 and in 1945 you w ill see that there have been additions. What would be of interest to you is the extent to which these additions have been supplied. The Minister for the Army may be able to tell you (neither I nor any one I know can) when and where flamethrowers have been issued to. and used by, Australian troops in action. They have been trained in their use. I have it on the statement of at least one battalion commander nnd other officers that they would be of inestimable value here and would result in a substantial saving of Australian life. Transport of Supplies, &c -In New Guinea, carriage to forward areas is dependent upon native carriers. carriers which can be employed is limited by the air transport available to supply the natives with food, &c. There are not sufficient aircraft transport (Kai bombers) available to permit of the employment of natives to the extent required. A responsible officer told mc that his company could have occupied a position without opposition ten days ago. The advance would have been tactically sound but he could not, in the circumstances obtaining here, get his supplies forward. To-day that position (a key one) was occupied after stubborn resistance for several days and after Australian casualties have been caused. For security reasons I probably cannot tell you how many K a i bombers we have. Tlie Army Minister can. Aircraft Support -It is trite and obvious to point out that ft modern army works in close (""O-operation with aircraft. Tlie aircraft we have here are obsolete in design-the y are not now in production-the y were designed for general reconnaissance aircraft-the y were not intended for, and unsuitable as, close support craft. We want close support here. They cannot give it to us. The crews are magnifiAsA p r il now cent and most co-operative. They have our deep and sincere sympathy. Supplies for Sick -Diseases common to, and prevalent in, this area require liquid diets, of which f r u it juices are a staple item. They should be on issue. There are none available for isMic. To-day two battalions bought from the canteen from their regimental funds f r u it juices to supply the advanced dressing stations.

I also have the greatest respect, after very close association with him:, for the Secretary of the Department of the Army, Mr Sinclair, who accompanied the Acting Minister on his visit to troops fighting ia the islands to the north of Australia. Those two gentlemen did a fine job, and deserve every credit fbr it. If any criticism is to be levelled, it must be in respect of the rapidity and scope of the inquiry which those two gentlemen undertook. Obviously in tlie time allotted' to them, they could not expect to examine every detail. That fact must be clear to honourable members from the letter which I read. My informant stated that the Acting Minister for the Army had not visited his sector. I am not criticizing the Acting Minister; I merely point out that on his hasty and hazardous trip; he could not possibly make the thorough investigation which, apparently, the complaints-1 have received warranted. The Acting Minister emphasized that the shortage of equipment was due to the shipping position. He saidThe amount of shipping has beeninadequate since the beginning of the war. This affects the ability to make it available in the areas where it is required. Tn respect of the provision of small craft the facts are that immediately on my return I consulted the ComrruiudeT-in-Chief on this question, and he advised me to the following effect:"" In the provision of the smaller types of watercraft for' transport within the operational areas, it should be noted that G-.H.Q. accepted a definite commitment for the provision of the necessary craft from US. resources, and this has been carried out until quite recently. Australian-produced small craft is now becoming available in great quantity, and is gradually relieving the US. craft in the area. The use of US. equipment in the 1 areas in whicliwe have relieved US. forces has alsobeen provided for under the arrangements for carryingout the Belief, and although an immediate shortage of Australian equipment may have been apparent, therequirements were foreseen and the administrative commitments accepted by G.H.Q."" I. consider that the quantity of small craft availaible is insufficient with the exception of New Britain wheTe they have ample small erarft to meet all requirements. The reason for the shortage of small craft is due to lack of shipping to convey it from the mainland to the operational areas, and not to the lack of provision of the small craft itself. Honourable members should note particularly that the lack of small craft was due to the lack of shipping to convey the small craft from the mainland of Australia .to the operational areas. The Acting Minister proceededA l l thc major difficulties that are being encountered by the higher command in thc conduct o£ operations, i u the provision of supplies and any matters affecting reasonable amenities to tlio troops ( which are a source of irritatio n to them-) can. be attributed to the shortage of shipping, which is a world-wide problem, and transport facilities from the mainland of Australia to these operational areas, and to a lesser extent, tlie absence of the relatively smaller type of craft which are essential to then transport them from the main base installations to the troops in the operational and advanced areas-. The Government has been constantly pressing on the highest plane to meet this shipping deficiency. Honourable members must agree that tbe cause of the shortages which the Acting Minister brought to the notice of the Government was the lack of shipping and delays in Australia in loading and unloading the available vessels, resulting from general inactivity on the waterfront. This matter is most serious. I have compiled a diary of industrial trouble asso ciated with the waterfront which is based on reports in the Sydney Morning Herald', as follows-:February1 -Bock dispute in Sydney.

April 20' -Becaus e of a dispute between two unions on the waterfront, the fitting out of a vessel to carry food to Australian troops' in forward areas has been held up. Naval ratings yesterday manned another ship on whicli wharf labourers had ceased work because of a dispute between, the Building Workers Indusstrial Union aaid. tlte Shipjoiners Union. Altogether, naval ratings manned three ships. On another ship, twelve men were dismissed for arriving late. Yesterday, the remainder of the men on that ship refused to start and the vessel was idle. Four ships are held up at Morts Dock as a result of a domestic dispute in the sub-branch of the Balmain Iron workers Union and 700 men were idle. April 21 -About 370 wharf labourers refused to work ships yesterday unless a foreman was stood down and 150 men who had been suspended from the job were reinstated. Naval ratings are still loading three ships and soldiers began work yesterday on another which contained service cargo. Morts Dock iron workers yesterday decided by 500 votes to seven to remain on strike u n t i l a suspended shop delegate was reinstated. Idle ships included a naval frigate. When the nation is at war, those conditions are scandalous. The Government must face this problem, and have a showdown, if necessary, with the men who are sabotaging our war effort and conducting themselves in a most lawless manner. Conditions of anarchy are prevailing on the waterfront, and are seriously retarding our war effort. Figures supplied to me to-day by the Commonwealth Statistician show that in 1942 there were seven disputes in the industrial group embracing shipping, wharf labouring, &c. These disputes involved 5,682 working people, and the number of working days lost was 3,325. In 1943, in the same group of industries, there were eleven, disputes, involving 6,268 workers, and a loss of 68,324 working days. Of that number 43,920 days were lost in the June quarter, but it is explained that that figure includes days lost through a dispute which commenced in the previous quarter. Last year, there were four disputes in the March quarter, involving 838 persons and a loss of 729 working days. In the June quarter four disputes occurred, 1,466 people were involved and 4,936 days were lost. In the September quarter there were three disputes involving 1,177 people, and a loss of 2,857 working days. The incomplete figures for the December quarter record three disputes involving 452 people, and a loss of 522 working days, and it is certain that when the final figures for that quarter come to hand, the position will be considerably worse. These statistics show clearly that the turmoil on the waterfront is not spasmodic, but is continual. It is time the Government forced a showdown. In that connection I urge .the Government to carry out a thorough investigation of the activities of Communists in this country. Suoh an investigation might get down to the real root cause of the trouble, and enable adequate remedial measures to be taken. The evidence that has 'been advanced in against the Japanese might develop into the course of this debate shows that the a war of attrition wbich we can ill discussion was amply justified. Letters afford. have been quoted alleging shortage of equipment, ancl reference has been made to the reports of war correspondents. I guarding this country against threatened believe that the investigation carried out invasion by the Japanese fell upon the by the Prime Minister's representative, shoulders of this Government. The Gothe Acting Minister for the Army, was not vernment accepted that responsibility, adequate. I admit that the inquiry was and I do not think there is a man or invaluable, and was well done, having woman in this country who would claim regard to the time factor arid the circumthat the Government failed in its duty stances in which it was carried out.

That task has been accomHouse. I move, therefore, the following plished. During the past four years this amendment:That the following words, be added to the motion:-""and House, immediate arrangements be made by of this administration. Mr Fadden. the Government for a committee, representative of all parties in the Parliament, to visit operational areas "". speak in this debate because in sentiment and outlook I am an Australian and because it is the duty of every Australian to do all in his power to oppose the fascist tendencies in this country. Damnable lying propaganda has come from the mouths of fascist-minded members of the Opposition, and I believe that these statements should be refuted in the strongest terms. Why the question of the disposition of our forces has been introduced into this debate I am at a loss to understand, because it has no bearing upon the major issue, namely, equipment. Our forces have been disposed according to the advice of military experts appointed for that very purpose, and we should be guided by the views of tbese strategists. I am prepared to accept the present disposition of Australian troops as being the best in the present circumstances. The Leader of the Opposition argued that Australian troops sbould be transferred to the main theatres of operations, thus by-passing completely the many thousands of Japanese in the islands to the north of this country. In my opinion if that were done, the war Late in 1941 the immense task of safecountry has been organized for production in a manner never before attempted. that, in the opinion of this Our security has been assured by the work",30,Curtin
93,Mr Hadley (Lilley) [12.17],"IYesterday the Minister for Transport t, Mr Ward) referred to the actions of certain Ministers of the previous governments who, when faced with the task of building up the defences of this country against the threat of the Axis nations, sat idly by, jeopardizing the security of' the Australian people. The allegations of shortages of equipment have been made mainly by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and the honourable member for New England( Mr for Wentworth and New England, Abbott). charges have been made solely with the intention of defaming the Government. Fortunately, as any one who has listened to this debate will realize, they have faijed miseraibly to achieve this objective. should be given to our troops to enable When the truth becomes known to the people of Australia they will realize that this "" stab in the back "" attack upon the Government has been made in association with the dirty, lying, filthy press of AusMinister for the Army (Senator Fraser) tralia. has no complaint against the press when it is supporting him. supported me. It is unfortunate that the Labour party has to carry on the Government of this country against the opposition of a hostile press. However, despite that opposition, the Labour party was successful at the last elections, and it would be interesting to know just how much more successful it would have been with a favorable press. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the war service of the honourable member for Wentworth or the honourable member for New England, both of whom I understand were at the last war, but I remind these gentlemen that tlie war in the Pacific to-day is vastly different from the conflict in which they were engaged, and quite different also from the present European war. ciples of war have been changed. country on which the last European war was fought was flat, such as that around Amiens, Pozieres and Mons. All that the soldiers had to do was to dig trenches in which they ate, slept and fought, and the terrain was such that the bringing up of heavy equipment presented no great difficulties. Conditions in New Guinea and Bougainville to-day are vastly different. Our men are fighting under the most damnable conditions ever encountered in the history of warfare. It is to the credit of the Australian forces that they have done a magnificent job' in these inhospitable territories, fighting an enemy considerably superior in numbers. Speeches of honourable members opposite, particularly those of the honourable members 1 am. satisfied that these savoured more of hypocrisy than any utterances to which I have ever listened. I should like to kuow what either of these gentlemen knows of junglefighting?What equipment does the Opposition suggest them to overcome the difficulties and hazards of jungle warfare? Certain criticism has been voiced of the report made to the Prime Minister by the Acting upon his return from an inspection of the northern battle areas. I admit that his visit was brief, but he met men who are in a better position to tell the facts about the situation in. the battle zone than arc the honourable members for Wentworth and New England. In raising this matter, those honourable gentlemen were not animated by a desire to do the right thing by the Army and the people of Austi'alia; their object was to stab the Government in the back. They were ably assisted in this by thc newspapers, which have always decried the Government. The lionorable member for New England said that he had received letters stating that the Army was short of certain equipment. Does the honourable gentleman know what equipment is needed by the Army? He may know something about the work on his sheep farm, but I remind him that he would not employ a shop-walker to tell him how to run his farm. Therefore, he would be well advised not to condemn our military strategy, which has been devised by experts. This debate was initiated by a shop-walker. If I wanted a man to milk cows I would not employ a man who was not an expert at that job. The Government must accept the advice of its military advisers, not the advice of armchair strategists such as honourable gentlemen opposite. The letters quoted",32,Curtin

That convinces me that tbe letters quoted by honourable gentlemen .opposite were faked. They have not produced reliable evidence to substantiate tbeir .statements. Those letters appeared to me .to have been written either by the bonorable members themselves or by persons outside Parliament in order to bolster this attack on the Government. The tragedy of this debate is that it has caused a great deal of mental strain to fathers and mothers of o.ur fighting men. Many of them now believe that their boys went into battle without adequate equipment. Any man wbo wilfully makes untrue statements which produce that effect is not worthy to be called an Australian. The 'Opposition has no chance of successfully attacking the Government's legislative programme. That is why it has made this unseemly assault upon the Government's prestige. Not one of the Government's legislative proposals could rightly be said to be not conducive to the social or economic welfare of the people. Honourable members opposite are ill advised in attacking the Government on the ground of its war effort, because it w-as the Labour party, with a mandate from the people, -which saved Australia from invasion.

It is peculiar that members' of the Opposition, who have no relatives in the services-and I do not think that they have any friends in the Army-shoul d have received complaints about equipment.

Actually these men have been loud in their praises of the Government and the equipment supplied totShem. Also they have told me that the food provided for them now is much better than the> food sutpplied in the early days of the war. When this debate commenced the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr order of the dayMenzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country parity ( Mr Fadden) did not want to become involved in it, because they knew that there was something false about the alleged complaints. Finally Ihe Loader of the Opposition spoke and supported the Government on the subject of army equipment, but did not support it on the question of the disposition of our troops. he did not know what the equipment position was. ported tlie Government on the equipment issue. The Leader of the Australian Country party supported the Government on the disposition of troops, but not on the equipment issue. The conflict of views disposes of thc substance of the complaints against thc Government. something wrong. wrong at all. I am satisfied that,, since the lead did not come from the leaders of the parties in Opposition, the debate is a sinister move to discredit the Government, initiated by a party member at the instigation! of somebody outside Parliament. equipment I refer honourable gentlemen to a statemen* made by the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-General Northcott, this week at theannual dinner of the Royal Society of St. George in Melbourne. He said'No matter what some people say, thc Australian Army is well, equipped, iu the highest spirits and doing a magnificent job. I hare just returned from a visit to all operational areas in which our troops are fighting. Our army is getting on witli thejob of winning the war. Should we take Che advice of this man, or the advice of the honourable members for Wentworth and Kew England? I alsodirect attention to a statement by Mr Arthur Mathers, a war correspondent on the staff of thc Australian Broadcasting Commission, who arrived here this morning from an operational base. for h i m what Mr Mathers said, referring to an Several hours before tlie Australian advance force rolled out from the Slater'B Knoll area,, tlie officer commanding the operation issued to all ranks an order of thc day which opened on the following note: ""Thc Jap has met with, a' serious setback in recent operations. Many of his leaders have been killed and he has suffered many casualties. TheJap still has the will to fight"". The order of the day went on in these terms: ""We have artillery, tanks and air force and all other weapons, but it is the infantry with their weapons who must destroy the Jap in the .final: kill "". This man has just returned from Bougainville, which is the seat of operalions in the Pacific area. No honourable member isjustified in challenging his statement. That order of the day showed tliat our forces have all the artillery, tanks', aircraft and other weapons that they need. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. by Lieutenant-General Northcott, one of the most distinguished soldiers Australia has ever produced, must be accepted in preference to those of any member of the Opposition.

112,Mr Hadley,"The statements made the decision to those who are in a position to consider and determine what is needed. The statements by Lieutenant General Northcott are a clear rebuttal of those of any member of the Opposition who charged with laxity the Governwho has served as a soldier in this war. ment or any persons responsible for the provision of equipment. Earlier, I made certain comments in respect of the link that binds the Opposage to which I refer was published elsesition and the Australian Associated Press. The Opposition has no ground for an attack on the Government in regard to either its legislation or the matter that is now before the House; therefore, it has allied itself with the Australian Associated Press with a view to defeating the Government by means of intrigue. A prominent person in the Australian newspaper world at the present ""McCormick""-Lieutenan t or Captain, I do not know which, Frank Packer. I have recollections, both very recent and of long standing, of the association of that gentleman with the press, and of his Fascist-mindedness. At all times, he has attempted to deprive the people of this country of their rights and liberties as Australian subjects. It would appear that he has had over the years a permanent pass-out check that has enabled him to leave any military area in which he was supposed to be serving. That privilege has been accorded to him for some reason that is unaccountable. He controls the Sydney Daily Telegraph, which has been in the forefront of a nonfrom Mr Fred Aldridge, but it was a military campaign planned to discredit the Government in the eyes of the electors. A section of the Opposition, and the Australian Associated Press, have joined forces in tbe organization of that campaign, the particular purpose of which is party political propanot to suit the purpose of the Governganda, designed to vilify and decry the achievements of the Government as well as to agitate and inflame the minds of the people against it. member know that Mr Packer is at present serving as a soldier in one of the No one will deny that the wear and tear islands north of Australia? redeem him in my estimation. Suppression is one of the weapons that have been used in this non-military campaign by this military officer. On Wednesday, the 21st March last, the Sydney Daily Telegraph suppressed an excellent message from a well-credentialled correspondent on Bougainville, Mr Fred Aldridge, His messages are always available to that newspaper, as it is one of a number of newspapers whicb be serves. Tbe meswhere on that day. It is to the credit of the Adelaide Advertiser that it was the only newspaper in Australia which gave any prominence to it. It published Mr Aldridge's reasoned opinion that the methods and equipment that were being used by the Australians amid the intense hardships of Bougainville were the only methods and equipment that could be used in the circumstances. Tbis opinion, time is that Australian from a man of tbe calibre of Mr Aldridge, is sufficient to convince me that, the statements of honourable members opposite have no justification, and that their arguments are unsound. After describing the prodigious feats of the Australian infantrymen and engineers, Mr Aldridge said, "" Their work can be done only this way, although it is the hard way "". That is the oninion of one of the best of those correspondents whom members of the Opposition are so eager to quote whenever any of their references can be twisted into an attack on the Government. On the 21st March, the date mentioned previously, the Sydney Daily Telegraph used a story story of battle, not of equipment. That indicates that this newspaper, in common with the Brisbane Courier-Mail and other metropolitan dailies, twist the communications that they receive from the battle areas, to suit their own purposes, ment in any way. The Sydney Daily Telegraph chose to suppress these statelivery man has f u l l equipment and ample clothing, although wear and tear through the conditions is terrific. on clothing is infinitely greater in the jungle areas of New Guinea than in civil life; yet in all instances, despite the heavy replacements that have had to be made, the Government, through the agency of",35,Curtin

MrI am perturbed about this matter beAldridge continuedAmmunition is never short, and weapons such as rifles and Bren, Owen and Vickers guns are adequate. He added that in the jungle the infantrymen would favour a carbine rather than a .303 weapon. It is possible that the average soldier considers that he has to carry too much equipment in warfare. There are parts of New Guinea in which the men have to crawl on their hands and knees, and it would not be possible for them to carry the equipment that has been suggested by some honourable members opposite. Mr Aldridge emphasized that the dropping of food and supplies from the air goes on continuously, but said, that treacherous weather sometimes prevents a drop from being made. An honourable member opposite laughs at that. He may be one of those who will wish to be included in the party that will be chosen to visit the New Guinea area if the amendment be carried. If he is, and I , too, am in the party, I shall be the first to "" drop "" him. [Extension of lime granted.] The report stated that the diet of the troops is simple, balanced and adequate. During the war this Government has attempted in all circumstances to meet fully the food requirements of the members of the forces in the Pacific Islands, and it can be truthfully said that it has invariably stood up to its obligations. Mr Aldridge further statedEven the most forward troops get fresh meat and food supplies at least three or four times a week. The stories told by press correspondents are subject to revision by the newspaper proprietors. The policy of the newspapers is determined by the proprietors, and therefore the war correspondents submit only reports wbicb are acceptable to the newspapers which they represent. It is of no use, therefore, for them to write stories favorable to the Government. Their reports are at the mercy of the newspaper proprietors, who bave been engaged in a campaign about equipment, which they must know will upset tbe morale of the troops and cause great mental distress to tbeir relatives and friends. cause thousands of parents in Australia bave sons wbo are fighting to-day for the rights and liberty of the people of this country, so that the invader may be kept from our shores. Those parents, particularly the mothers of the soldiers, have made many sacrifices economically and socially, and, in many cases, their loved ones have made the supreme sacrifice. It is lamentable that members of the Opposition sbould make statements in this House calculated to unnerve the relatives of the members of the fighting forces. It is cruel to say that our troops have not sufficient equipment to protect themselves against the onslaught of the Japanese. Such statements are a damnable disgrace to tbose wbo make them. On the 9th April, the Prime Minister released to the press a letter from a soldier saying that press statements on equipment were unfounded and malicious and were doing a great deal of harm. As far as can be discovered, that letter was not used by the newspapers. Although the Prime Minister declared that the remarks by certain correspondents were without foundation in fact, no publicity was given by the press to the Prime Minister's statement. Once again., tbe manner in wbich the press exercises its great power has been demonstrated. I have given crystal clear instances of tbe way in which messages from correspondents in the field are suppressed wben it suits the purposes of a political campaign. This means of attacking tbe Government had been chosen by. the newspapers-, but on its war administration the Government is immune from successful challenge. The people will have a final voice in the matter at the general elections next year, and I have no hesitation in saying that the administration of this Government during the war will result in the Labour party being returned to power, not merely as strong as it is at present, but even witb greater numbers. We are not always able to find out the extent of this suppression and distortion, because usually the collusion between the newspaper proprietors is better organized than it was on the 21st March last. At all times the newspapers have been organized against the Labour party, and the big, vested interests that any useful purpose would bo served are ahvays .trying to overthrow the present Government. It ill becomes Mr Henderson, the chairman of the Amsiraiian .Newspaper Proprietors Association, to impugn itbe courage of tbe Minister for Post-war Reconstruction as he has done. h? wa» opposed to 'compulsory military service even for the defence of Australia? about that, but I realize that .as the Minister for Post-""war Reconstruction baa n gallant record of .service in tbe last ""war, his .sympathies are 'entirely with those who are now serving with the Australian forces. Mr Henderson would not give recognition to the services ""rendered by the Minister or even to those of the Commander-in-'Chief and other leaders in the Australian Military Forces, politicians at the expense of the taxbnt would prefer to exploit, not only the soldiers, but also the civilian population, in the matter of tbe dividends and profits of newspaper companies.

I am more than satisfied Leader of the Opposition that he that the allegations advanced by a section eulogized General Sir Thomas Blarney. of the Opposition are part of a plan The honourable member for Bendigo was concocted with the newspaper proprietors also anxious to do the right thing by in order to discredit the Government. would not like to have to prove it. prove it.

I cannot see by agreeing to the amendment aad appointing a (parliamentary committee, whether representative 'of the Government, the Opposition or of all parties, to visit the islands to the north of AustraliaSuppose such a committee were to go, whom would it interview? It would have to interview the very people whom the Opposition is Jiow vilifying for their alleged failure to obtain proper equipment. There is no need to send a committee to the .north to find out wlat the position is there. We know what it is. We know that the troops are amply supplied with food and equipment. A parliamentary committee, in order to travel to tlie north, would have to be provided with transport that could be .more profitably u^ecl in carrying troops from the islands on leave. Such a trip would be no more than a jaunt for a few payers, and would serve no useful purpose.

Mr .ARCHIE 'CAMERON (Barker) [-2.40J I am sorry that I was not here last Tuesday to hear the beginning of this debate. It was one .of the lew occasions im the last ten years when I have missed a sitting of the House. However, I listened carefully tto .what was said yesterclay and to-day, and it seems to me that-only three ipoints of importance have been raised-tb e matter -of -equipment for tihe Australian forces:; the nature of the operations .on -which Australian forces are engaged; ancl the iposition of the Commander-in-Chief iof fhe Australian Military .Forces. IE propose to discuss chiefly the subject of .equipment. As for the manner in which OUT forces aue being employed, II h-are stated my views ""before, anil they are well known. I have always believed that dt is wery bad military -policy to -engage in side-shows when the main show is s*in undecided. Therefore, I say fhat the very best Australian army -should be used in whatever .theatre is judged hy tliose witli the .right to make a decision as the one in which the earliest decision against the Japanese is .likely .to be reached. Tho matter of equipment must necessarily be .closely related to the work u,pon which fhe forces are engaged. If our forces are to play a decisive part, they will require .a greater variety and quantity of equipment than if they are to be engaged in a secondary role. The Government has not (Stated that the Australian forces are at present engaged upon operations of primary importance associated with the main strategy of the war. Tn .proof of that, I turn to the statement of the .Acting Minister for the report quoted the following statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) to .him before he set out on his .mission:'The stage through which the Pacific War is now passing finds places such as New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and the Solomons having tlic strongest impact on our minds and emotions. 'Our thoughts are constantly with you. Y.our Goveiurment knows tlic obstacles in yaur patha tenacious -and ferocious enemy., a .difficult supply Jine and a shocking terrain.

In other words, the raven went out and the dove 'did aiot 'come back. And so, over the flood went Senator Eraser. I shall not quote letters in this chamber, iulthough I icould do so, but I have talked with numbers of -men since the House adjourned in March-me n 'who came home on leave from Aitape, J-acquinot Bay, Bougainville and other places in which Australian troops are engaged. In some instances, I talked witb them in the company of my colleague from iSouth Australia, Senator Mattner. I found great consistency in the stories >whic!i",38,Curtin
121,Mr Speaker,"Order! The hon OTthey told. During that part of the debate to which I have listened, there seemed to me to be too great a tendency to confound equipment with arms and munitions, and to make one glorious plum pudding of the lot. A man has his personal clothing, his personal equipment, his personal arms, and the ammunition which goes with those arms. Then the unit to which he is attached has its arms, especially if it is an infantry, artillery or engineers unit. There is both personal and transport equipment. So far as I know, tliere has been no condemnation of the arms supplied by the Government for Australian troops; the debate has been confined to equipment. In confirmation of what the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) read this morning, men from Aitape have told me within the last month that it was almost impossible to get clothing or boots at any price. Men have discussed with me and .Senator Mattner shortages in respect of barges, tractors, vehicles, ancl spare parts. A major of an engineering unit was reported in the press as having said that they could only carry on some of their operations by ""cannibalizing"" the equipment that they had. That meant that if they had two trucks, each with some defects, they would take spare parts out of one so that the other could continue to be used. That meant bhat they had only one serviceable vehicle, whereas, had they been supplied with a few spare parts, they would have had two vehicles. I am not a gunner and do not profess to know much about gunnery. Senator Mattner, however, is a gunner; indeed, he is one of the mos* distinguished gunners that Australia has produced. Men who serve the short 25-pounder gun, have spoken in the most condemnatory terms concerning it. They told us that that gun had to be withdrawn from service because it would not stand up to the conditions in which it was being used. It was intended to be a light weapon which could he taken where the heavy 25-pounder gun could not go. It has a similar base to the heavier gun, but I am told that it would not sit on its base. Gunners who had served the short 25-pounder said, that tbey could prove that the gun when fired had turned on its nose in the sand. Mr Archie They were then told that they must not fire it except when on its rubber wheels, and that they must first dig it in. These men said that tbey bad seen the gun bounce about 30 yards after it bad been fired, especially when using a heavy charge. Tbat is something wbich is either true or untrue. Certain artillery regiments either were armed with that gun or they were not so armed. By means -of a few discreet inquiries, tbe Acting Minister for the Army could discover the facts and report to this House the degree to whicb tbe short 25-pounder gun is used in the South-West Pacific Area. I remember the time when in parades in Melbourne and Sydney the 25-pounder gun was highly praised. Because of the risk associated with the short 25-pounder gun, I am told that no men will volunteer to serve it, although they are willing to serve the long 25-pounder gun. They say also that the light gun must be towed in any case, and that wherever it can be towed the long-barrelled 25-pounder gun could be towed by the same lorry. That is a point concerning wbich the Acting Minister for the Army might obtain information. I shall deal with the report of the Acting Minister for the Army, paragraph by paragraph, so far as it relates to certain matters. FirstI direct attention to the paragraph in the Prime Minister's letter to the troops which readsThe Acting Minister for the Army (Senator Fraser) has come to you at my request to ensure that what can be clone w ill be done. I a.sk that you do not hesitate to tell him f u l l y what he should know. That is a most significant paragraph, particularly as the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces had just previously reported to the Prime Minister in regard to equipment. What shortages of equipment did the Prime Minister have in mind when he wrote that paragraph? If he had no such shortages in mind, why was that paragraph inserted in the letter which his representative was asked to read to tbe troops? We really get down to business in paragraph 17 which, speaking of Jacquinot Bay, says. . . . Tliere was a native track over the Vamcron. mountain ranges, and construction of a road was under review, but this would be a major engineering problem of some magnitude and difficulty, and with whatever equipment could be made available would take a considerable time to organize and complete. The only purpose in constructing roads in the vicinity of Jacquinot Bay is to provide those main communications from which an attack on Eabaul can be launched. operations had to be undertaken in the high mountains of the island of New Britain before great, military progress was made there. I have talked with engineers who were there, some our own and some American. The Americans paid high tribute to the road^making capacity of Australian engineers with the equipment they had at their disposal. Whatever may be the military necessities of the island of New Britain in regard to roads, this paragraph, in Senator Fraser's own language, speaks of "" whatever equipment, could be mad'e available "". There is a definite qualification which is not explained in any subsequent paragraph. We go to paragraph 38The troops further away in the fighting along thc southern coast towards Gazelle Peninsula, were moving forward too rapidly to make heavy engineering use possible, even if desirable. His main problem was getting essential supplies to forward areas by small craft and not road construction. That shows that the important consideiation in that urea was not roads but small craft. I point to paragraphs 17 and 18 because of something to which 1 shall refer later. "" Mechanical Engineering Equipment"" we have paragraph 24There was a quantity of heavy engineering equipment available in the Bougainville area, which, taking the shipping problem both generally and locally into consideration, could not be improved upon. The meaning of that is that, the equipment there was not the maximum equipment that could have been used owing to the shipping position. The meaning is that the commander on the spot could have used more equipment had it been made available to him by the Commonwealth Government. There is no other meaning in the English language which that will bear. Then, turning to paragraph 31, I find one of the most amazing sentences in this important documentIn no place did I find among the fighting troops a contempt for their enemy. I have never been amongst fighting troops with any sense-and only sensible ones have I moved amongst-wh o had contempt for the enemy. The man with contempt for his enemy under active service conditions .usually does not live long enough to talk about it. How that Extensive road building "" beauty "" came to be incorporated in this report is beyond me. The Acting Minister for the Army deals with allegations concerning the absence of tanks, which he says are "" entirely unfounded "". I am not one of those who believe that tanks or armoured vehicles can be used in the jungle. For a long time. I have been one of those who have questioned the wisdom of keeping in training and under arms the armoured forces that we have in Australia to-day. I suppose the very pick of the old militia have gone into the armoured regiments of Australia, because they were originally the lighthorse regiments of Australia, and, speaking of that, I am not speaking as one who was ever a lighthorseman. into infantry battalions. have, but they have not been sent away. To my mind it is one of the worse things for the reputation of Australia that the Government should have seen fit to appoint its Minister in Moscow as a protector of Poland and yet be unrepresented in the ground-fighting in Europe. Under the heading There was a role which could have been carried out by the Australian armoured division. Its members would have been very glad to accept it if the Government had been prepared to give it to them. But some of the very best material Australia has got together in this war has not been outside Australia or seen a shot fired. hearted. and no thundering wonder! You cannot, keep strong active men in the best, fettle in camp year after year and expect, them to go through training, training and training with no active military operation to engage them or in prospect. That is one of the worse things a government can do to any man. The tank fighting of onr men has been",39,Curtin

125,Mr Archie Cameron,"Utterly,confined to Buna, Sattelberg, Finschhaven and Bougainville. I do not know of any other area.. The nature of the terrain in the South-West Pacific area does not lend itself easily to the employment of armoured vehicles. They require great open spaces. They can get over some obstacles but cannot deal effectively with country of the type there. Again, the report on the armour question does not cause me any undue alarm. The ships named in paragraph 43 were left there and did not unload for, I am told, three months. One man, a member of a barge crew, told me that he went up there in a specialist unit to find that it did not have its equipment with it. The equipment went somewhere else. So the unit was turned into a company for unloading ships. He told me that time and time again they went out with the American transport barges and that all that happened was argument between American and Australian officers as to what should be brought out of the ships first. Time after time they returned to tlie beach with as much as they left it with-nothing . From what I havo heard from men at Aitape about clothing, supplies, hospital supplies and hold-ups of shipping, there is something that the Government has to explain. I come to paragraphs 44, 45, 46 and 47 under the caption, "" Unbalanced Cargo Components"". There is not one word to show what is meant by the caption which does not bear any relationship to what the paragraphs say. I know of only one meaning in the Army of "" U n balanced Cargo Components"", and that is that you do not load a ship in . the order in which you want the cargo unloaded or that the troops> as happened at Aitape, go in one vessel and the armament in another, both to separate destinations. Men were put in with nothing to fight with. I leave that and pass to paragraph 51The mechanical engineering equipment in the bag. He called up the Commanderthis area was of good quality, but the unprecedented shipping difficulties that were enin-Chief to stress views which he has countered in this area held up the despatch not disclosed in this document. We are of certain of the equipment that was allocated given a paragraph dealing with what to it .

Archie Cameron. sponsibility, adequate engineer's equipment was not available in the Aitape area. In this matter,, the Government takes a very nice stand. This morning the Minister fbr Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) replying to a question said that the 'Government cannot be blamed for the drought. The Acting Minister for the Army says that the Government cannot ,be blamed for adverse winds at landing places. But drought and adverse winds are fairly frequent occurrences, and a Government should exercise foresight and make proper provision for that sort of thing. From paragraph 65 onwards we have the most amazing parts of this strange document. The Acting Minister for the Army is a member of a government, every member of which who has yet spoken in this debate, has assured us that there is nothing wrong, that the Opposition is engaged in a conspiracy with the press barons to produce a dreadful state of affairs by saying all sorts of foul things about Army administration. What does the Acting Minister say in paragraph 65 of his report. That paragraph readsImmediately on my return to Australia. I discussed with the Commander-in-Chief the question of heavy mechanical equipment and stressed my view in regard to the heavy engineering type. In addition to outlining the difficulties of shipping and sea and weather conditions at Aitape he furnished the following advice. . . . What view did the Acting Minister stress to the Commander-in-Chief? If the Acting Minister's statement is to be taken at its face value, namely, that everything was all right, what was his reason for calling up the Commander-inChief and stressing his view about heavy equipment at Aitape? On the face of it, the Acting Minister was not satisfied with the equipment he found despite what he has signed iu bis report; because in that paragraph he let the cat out of the Commander-in-Chief thought, but comment.

Those two document, our casualties on the scale paragraphs disclose a significant, vital of fighting to which our troops will be and unexplained discrepancy; but they committed will be very different from let the cat out of thc bag. There can what is disclosed in paragraph 74 of be no doulbt that the Acting Minister this report. was not satisfied with what he found up there.

Prime Minister. We are asked to take Tn paragraph 70, the Acting Minister call it a cake. I refuse to do so* I eulogizes the engineers. Such eulogy is reject the report. The strongest and unnecessary. A fair percentage of honormost telling facts disclosed in this debate able members on this side of the House were those set out in the letter written has a fair idea of the job of thc engineers by Captain Lee, wbicb was read by the in war, and particularly of what has -Leader of the Australian Country party been the role of the army engineer in ( Mr Fadden). The Government must thi? war. That role was set at the very answer the cbarges contained in that beginning of the war by the Germans letter. The Government cannot get out of in their invasions of Norway, Belgium, this difficulty by simply declaring that all Holland and France, and that has been is well. ' Too many men are now coming the role of the army engineer ever since. back from these areas, and disclosing The engineer is becoming more and more their grievances.

If he is captured, he out protective privilege. But despite what the Leader of the Opposition bas said, I believe that the appointment of General Blarney was the worse appointment made by the Menzies Government. It was also the most enduring, but that is Iby the way. I shall particularize on that matter when the occasion arises. We shall soon be obliged to reconstruct the administration of the Australian Army. Since 1942 the Army has been under a complete dictatorship. No man, since the days of Cromwell, has exercised power over an army so great as that which the present Commander-in-!Chief has exercised. I hope that anybody who exercised more power, did not exercise it to worse effect. I listened yesterday to an excellent speech by the honourable member for Elenty( Mr .Coles). I did not agree with any of his remarks, but it is only right that now and then, Frankenstein should have to explain why he supjports his demon, because, after all, it is Frankenthe better! I have a strong suspicion stein's own demon, and .as night follows day, the time will come when Frankenstein will wish to the Lord that, he had had nothing to do with that demon. In his speech, the honourable member for Henty disclosed a sad lack of knowledge of although they were starving, could still Japanese psychology and history. His attitude was that the Army could kill every Japanese soldier in the Solomons. New Guinea and New Britain. I know that the Japanese in New Ireland have not yet been touched, but as I left the Army about twelve months ago, I am not sure about the position in Santa Isabel and certain other islands in the Solomons. honourable member turned to this side of But my understanding of the conduct of war is that we do not go out for the express ipurpose of killing men. We conduct war in order to impose the will of our Government upon the enemy. Therefore, I am surprised that a man of the standing of the honourable member for Henty has not read a book entitled A Mr Archie Cameron. Greater than Napoleon. In fact, it would .benefit honourable members opposite to read it. At the very core of Japanese Army activity is the ibelief that no Japanese snould ever surrender. It is accounted one of the most important things in Japan that a man should never will lose caste. {Extension of time granted.] If he lives in countries where the Japanese have control-and this applies with particular force to Japanese who bave been taken prisoner in China and who went to Manchuria-h e must eease to use a Japanese name and the Japanese language, and must not marry a Japanese woman. He is just tolerated. The greatest insult whioh could be offered to Japan would be to empty into that country as many prisoners as we take. catch them. putting this contention in opposition to the theory that was advanced by the honourable member for Henty. Our objective in this war is victory, and to impose our will upon our enemies, not to gauge our reputation by the number of Japanese that we happen to kill. If . by any chance, we can call to our assistance such weapons as starvation, so much that when the history of the fighting around Buna, Gona and the beaches of Sanananda is written, it will be found that too many Australians were sent in against fanatical diehard Japanese, who. use machine guns. We should not fight our campaigns by that method. I advise the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Hadley) to read his speech carefully, and ponder over it for a little time. The honourable member took the place of a gentleman who has six sons in the fighting services in this war. But the the chamber and asked, "" How many sons have you fellows got in the Army?"". Let me tell him, and some of his friends, that during a part of the time, 'between 193 5 and 193.9, when we might have been married and raising families, we were otherwise engaged; and old rascals like myself, who live in the bush most of the",41,Curtin

""When the honourable member for Lilley asks honourable gentlemen on this 3ide of the House how many members of their families are on active service, he will find that they will not have to invent a family for some one who has not got one. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) told me a story about a former member of this House, Mr King O'Malley, who, speaking of a similar matter in the first world war, stated that he had sent all his wife's relations to the front. We have not done that. Some speeches of honourable members opposite, one in particular, were an offence to honourable gentlemen on this 3ide of the chamber. 1 listened to every word uttered by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) last night.

I am not fussy about names. I do not mind whether bonorable members refer to the ""British Empire"" or the "" British Commonwealth of Nations"", although I prefer the old name to the new one. New names and ""new orders"" arouse my suspicions. I have a great liking for the advice that President Kruger gave to the Boers when he sought refuge in Switzerland, "" Take the best from your past and build on that"". gentleman a member of the Liberal party? party"" a new name for the United Australia party? a very conservative person, and I am not at all ashamed of that title. As I stated on a former occasion, this is the fifth party to which I have belonged and I have not changed a bit. It is not the name, but what the man stands for that matters. I was brought up, to a certain extent, on the philosophy of Robert Burns, and one significant thing in his works has a vital bearing on this question. It isThe rank is but the guinea's stamp, The man's the gowd for a' that. We now hear much more about this bond of kinship-(thi s "" crimson thread ""from members of the Labour party than we heard in 1939 and 1940. What does it signify? It means that when a member of the British Empire is threatened, something more substantial than lip service will be accorded to that partner by the rest. In the words of Napoleon, it means that we have to disperse to live, but we have to unite to fight. Earlier in this war, it appeared that honourable gentlemen opposite had no such ideas. I watched their progress, from downright isolationism to the adoption of the attitude of the saviours of the country. After the If it had not been for the resignation of the former member for Corio, Mr Casey, I doubt whether they would bave decided to reinforce the Australian Imperial Force before tbe election in 1940. In that critical But it became politically expedient, in order to ensure the election of the present Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), for the right honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) to eat everything that member after member of his presentministry has vowed and declared from the Opposition benches, and assert that the Labour party, if returned, would reinforce the Australian Imperial Force. The Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward), when in Opposition, spoke on an amendment to the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Bill introduced by a former Minister for the the honourable Army, Mr Street. The honourable member for East Sydney, as he then was, said that if New Guinea had to be defended, not ""Liberal let it be defended by those who lived there.

There is, Jiowevex, one particular matter to wbicb T shall refer, and that is the bonorable member's criticism of General Hlamey. I -point out that General .Blarney held a -rery important position whilst a government >of which the honourable member was ja member was in office. I can. find no record of criticism of General Blarney by this very forthright honourable member for Barker during tbe regime of thatpd ministration. Blarney had been appointed before I /uttered tbe Cabinet. hrnior-ahle gentleman was a member of a cabinet wbich supported General Blarney. It was not nntil comparatively recently that the honourable member Taised his voice about General Blarney's eapacity to ;lo his job. The Leader of the Opposition said that this should not be a party matter. There is much to be said for having matters affecting the fighting forces of this country divorced from party politics, but I point out that any bitterness which has entered this debate, has been engendered by members of the Opposition, who found that in making these chaTges against the Government they bad the support of an anti-Labour press. I Teca'H that when I was a private member .of this House, I was approached on one occasion by .an Arany officer who was the officer /commanding a training camp. He told me a dreadful story about tbe type >of equipment that -was available ID train men who were to fight abroad.

Although we all recognize that it M the responsibility of the Leader <of the Opposition to voice the views of his supporters, I am not sure that all honourable members opposite aTe in agreement with what 'has been -done <on this occasion. Returning now to my story, the military officer who made representations to me whilst I was a private member of this chamber, ""was a gentleiwan whom I bad known !for a long time.

A t that time the honourable member for WaiT.iii'gah ( Mr Spender) was Minister for the Army and I went to him and asked him to interview this officer. The honourable member agreed to grant the orffiec-r an hour's interview.

134,Mr Chieley,"That is true, but tbethey have been used by the yellow presssome of it was not originally yellow, hut is becoming yellower every day-to belabor the ^Government. The Government does not suggest for a moment that in the war administration -and in the production of equipment, there are not some imperfections. Things do not always run smoothly, as any soldier or student of war knows; but when the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) was given an opportunity to produce the conclusive proof of which he had boasted, he started by quoting extracts from newspapers. Those extracts were the spearhead of his attack. authorities were certain war correspondents. I have no wish to reflect upon the courage or journalistic ability of war correspondents, but I point out that there are many people who have risked their lives more than war correspondents, but still cannot claim to be authorities on military strategy or military equipment. I know of one young journalist who, eighteen months after the expiry of his cadetship, was a ""famous"" war correspondent and strategist, employed by a big daily newspaper to tell generals how the war should be conducted. I -do not propose to reiterate what has been said by honourable members on this side of the House in regard to the equipment of Australian soldiers. That matter has been dealt with adequately. T point out, however, that the Commander-in-Chief, of the Allied Land Forces, South-West Pacific Area, General MacArthur, is a military man and has been a military man all bis working life. He was selected with the confidence of five nations to do this job. 'Uhe Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Eorces, General Blarney, was selected by a previous government, and his appointment was endorsed by this Government. He has a distinguished military record. I have not had an opportunity to converse with him personally as the Prime Minister( Mr there was a totally different story to tell. Curtin) and the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) have done, but I understand that he is a splendid soldier. I rlo not know anything of his other qualities. This House is concerned only with his ability as a soldier. During my membership of the Advisory War Council, I , and other members of that body have had an opportunity to question the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-General Northcott. He also is a distinguished soldier. I believe from my personal contact with him that he is a completely honest man. Members of the Government and of the Advisory War Oouncil, and everybody else who kuows him, do not question his honesty whatever they may think about his qualities as a soldier. I do not believe' that General MacArthur, General His Blarney, Lieutenant-General Northcott, or any of tbeir subordinates would allow men under their command to go out to fight inadequately equipped. Of course, we must pay regard to the varying conditions of war, such as shipping delays, adverse weather and other considerations. Any slight bitch in the working of the machinery of a great army can cause a temporary shortage of supplies. That is inevitable in war-time, and it has occurred on all fronts from time to time. I was rather amused by the Opposition's sudden outburst against General Blarney. Whatever the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) may have to say about the Minister for Transport ( M i . Ward), that honourable gentleman hit the nail on tbe head last night when he leferred to the attacks made on General Blarney. Not long ago he criticized the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell). but so far I bave listened in vain for any member of the Opposition to attack him on that ground. Also, I have not noticed anything in the daily press, particularly the metropolitan newspapers, in criticism of General Blarney for what he said about the Minister. Actually, the hearts of members of the Opposition were filled witjh gladness; tbe honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) was so puffed ont that h«« almost burst. But when General Blarney replied to allegations that he was unmindful of tbe welfare of his troops, We have heard nothing but the mostviolent and trenchant criticism of him during this debate. Having thrown brickbats at him, honourable gentlemen opposite consider that he should not throw any brickbats in return. It was all right for him to attack the Minister for Information, but when he gave the daily press and the Opposition a clout, they squealed to high heaven. tage of a war loan broadcast to make his statements? pleased with the remarks made by bim about tbe Minister for Information, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about him raising the subject of Army equipment in a war loan broadcast. From the point of view of bonorable members opposite be was full of virtue until he gave them and the daily press a figurative belt under the ear. The Government considers that it could not have bad better military advice than it has received. One of its chief advisers, General MacArthur, is one of the world's most renowned generals. I refer now to a suggestion made by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Guinea there will be a great loss of Spender) regarding the Government's attitude to the Advisory War Council. It is only fair to do so, because I inferred from the honourable gentleman's remarks that tlie Government bad sought to pass some of its responsibility fco tbe Advisory War Council. Tbat is not so. The Government is grateful for the impartial advice that it has received from the council. The Government accepts full responsibility for its decisions, and does not try to ""pass .tbe buck "" to the council. made that quite clear. because I received the impression that the honourable member for Warringah considered that the Government had been trying to dodge responsibility, whereas it had no intention of doing so. Tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) devoted his remarks almost entirely to the disposition of Australian troops in the in the habit of taking kicks withNew Guinea area. He omitted altogether any reference to tbe statement by tbe Prime Minister that, as part of the general strategy, two divisions of Australian troops had been made available to the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in the South-West Pacific Area for service in the Philippines if so required. Due to the success of the Philippines campaign, General MaoArthur did not find it necessary to employ Australian troops there. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there are two possible courses of action in the New Guinea area. One is to keep a fairly large army there as a holding force; the other is to try to clear the Japanese from that area without heavy casualties and without delay. I hare always favoured driving them from the New Guinea area as quickly as possible, without sustaining heavy casualties, for the simple reason that while we bave a large body of men tliere we are sadly in need of labour in Australia. The maintenance of a holding campaign employing a large body of troops, with reinforcements travelling to and fro in order to provide leave from the battlefront, involves a great many casualties from sickness as well as from enemy action. So long as we keep men in New man-power. I shall not pursue the subject further, except to ask whether, when talking about by-passing the Japanese in New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomons and leaving them to "" wither on the vine "", the Leader of the Opposition suggests that the Japanese forces in Borneo, Java, Malaya and Burma should also be left while our armies pass on to fight the enemy in their homeland? than 7,000 islands in tbe Philippines archipelago and General MacArthur is I am repeating it endeavouring to clear them out as far as possible. Except in the northern parts of Luzon and in Mindanao, he is endeavouring to clear out the enemy as his forces advance. It is a pity that members of the Opposition introduced bitterness and intolerance into this debate. The Minister for Transport is not out kicking back. Everybody is aware of that. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) made a speech which put his point of view tolerantly and temperately.

142,Mr Barnard (Bass) [3.55],"particularly £or children. Unquestionably the pictures that children see have a marked effect upon, their minds. Tbose who are entrusted with the care and training of children agree that visual education is preferable to education by oral instruction. Thc soundness of this contention is borne out pointedly by the excellent results obtained throughis a widower with three children, and out Australia at the Lady Gowrie Child Welfare Centres.. I have inspected many of them and can testify to their good work in most of the capital cities during the last five years. The value of visual education has a direct bearing on the importance of the kind of pictures exhibited before children. I have taken a deep interest in this matter for several years in my capacity as chairman of the Social Security Committee. The committee has had before it on many occasions, and in a variety of ways, the need for stricter control with regard to the things that children are taught by visual education. The problem is not easy of solution, but l i e Children's Welfare Association of Victoria realizes that the time has come when an attempt should be made to solve it. This could be done in several ways, but in the first instance there should be a stricter censorship of the pictures exhibited before young children. I do not know whether it is possible, as Lady Angliss has suggested, to do this by legislation. The Parliaments of the States may have some power in that direction, but it seems to me that a stricter censorship of films could be exercised by the Commonwealth authorities. The need for this action is obvious, and I hope that when the Government is somewhat freer than at present from the problems of war, it will endeavour to ensure that films of a better kind than many of those now exhibited shall be displayed to children.

This officer, who has nobody to look after them, has been ordered to vacate bis cottage by the 18th May. The furniturebelongs to him, but the Government owns the dwelling. On the 20th March, he was asked by the Allied Works Council to leave the premises,, and on the 10th April, he was ordered to vacate tbem. I should like to know how it comes about that the Government as a landlord is attempting to do to one of its own tenants things which axe prohibited under the Landlord and Tenant Regulations, provided the tenant pays the rent due in respect of the premises. I cannot imagine a worse case of hardship than that to which I now direct attention. The officer states in a letter to me that he is .anxious to take his three: children back to Adelaide as soon as he can get somebody to look after them. He had his mother taking care of them for three months, but, acting on medical advice, she left Alice Springs. The department concerned should be asked! to comply with the law which other people are expected to observe. I know that there is congestion at Alice Springs. I have on a previous occasion called theattention of tbe Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) to housing conditions there, but I d.o not press that point in public because I know there are certain things the Government just cannot do.

This man, VXS9106 Sergeant G. A. Sogers, 19th Machine Gun Battalion, had four and a half years' service before be was discharged on medical grounds. Before tlie war, he and bis father .used to grow about 1,000 acres of wheat, but after he enlisted thc father put on a share-farmer wbo has been growing from 300 acres to 350 acres each year. The son wishes to take up his former occupation as a wheat-farmer. He has applied for a superphosphate quota ancl has been refused. The agreement with the share-farmer has still a year to run and the authorities maintain that no quota can be provided for the discharged man. Had he remained home, as did many other farmers' sons in the district, he would have had a quota -himself. ber know whether he applied to the State Department of Agriculture? tlirough his .State member, Mr S.

No honourable member such an emergency. This man is entitled to consideration. He has seen a good deal of service and deserves well of his country.

149,Mr Rankin,"Well, this surely isOn the general subject of superphosphate, I remind the Minister that on two previous occasions I suggested that phosphatic rock should be imported from Trans-Jordania. I have a letter here from the representative of a company in Trans-J ordania stating that the company has a sample of rock at Haifa which it is prepared to send at its own expense to Australia to be treated by any company nominated by the Commonwealth Government. It is known that this rock is the richest to be found outside Nauru tsland, the yield from it being 72 per cent, or better. I cannot understand why we should import phospliatic rock of low quality from the borders of the Red Sea and North Africa, particularly as it is hard to treat in addition to being of low quality. have forced us to obtain phosphatic rock from places from which it could be -hipped. I refer are prepared to put the material on board ships at Akabah, which would avoid the heavy Suez Canal dues, provided that they are given a worthwhile contract. The House may not know that because of the possibility of the enemy occupation of Alexandria and Port Said, the British Government developed one of the best ports in the East at Akabah. Phosphatic rock can be put on board -.hips there at about half the price at which lower grade phosphatic rock can be obtained elsewhere. I do not hold the Minister responsible for the present state of affairs, because I realize that war conditions have had much to do with it, but I point out that this man has been discharged from the Army because of ill health after 4£ years' service. When I find that the British Phosphate Commission has sufficient influence to prevent the wrong impression which the unfair peroffer of the company to which I have referred from being accepted, I am inclined to wonder what is the reason. thing behind the offer to which the honourable member has mentioned. A t least, a long term contract is asked for. cost more from any other place than if shipped from Akabah. I ask the Minister to look into this matter in order to seewhat can be done. Minister the letter to which I havereferred, and also the communication from Colonel Campigli who was in charge of the Palestinian Railways, and knows the East well. He is a reliable man. war in the same regiment as I did, but, later, he joined the Palestinian RailwayeService. Mr Rogers lives in the Warracknabeal district, which is not in my electorate. I have a great regard for him and would like to help him. Last night the Minister for Transpon( Mr Ward), when referring to deficiencies of equipment in the Middle East, said that one reason for those deficiencieswas that certain ships were loaded with beer to the exclusion of other cargo because tlie Australian Amenities Officer,. Brigadier Cohen, was a director of a Melbourne brewery. I . know BrigadierCohen as a soldier with a distinguished record, and as a prominent citizen of Melbourne. He is an ex-member of the Victorian Parliament, and is a resident in my electorate. To-day I received a telegram in which Brigadier Cohen indicates that the Minister for Transport had maligned him. That, however, is not an uncommon habit in this Parliament. The telegram readsI was never Director of Amenities in the Middle East. Amenities is in the Department of the Adjutant General. It is not its function to supply beer. The supply of beer is in the hands of the Quartermaster General through the canteens. It is only fair that that telegram should appear in Hansard in order to correct any sonal attack by the Minister for Transport might have given. I hope that the Minister will make the amende honourable when the House resumes. On the 24th AprilI directed the following questions to the Acting Attorney General( Mr Beasley):1.

The reply which I received is unsatisfactory and amounts to an evasion. It reads1, 2 and 3. In the case oi briefs to members of the junior bar, returned soldiers are briefed very freely but it would involve a very lengthy research to ascertain the number of returned soldiers and non-returned soldiers, respectively, briefed by the Commonwealtli in the various States during the past three and one-half years. So far as the senior bar is concerned, regard is had primarily to the suitability of the particular counsel for tlie case involved. If the question has been asked with a view to eliciting -whether there has been any discrimination against returned soldiers, I can assure the honourable member that tliere has been no discrimination whatever. It is an exaggeration to say that A very lengthy research would be necessary to obtain the information, as the Minister would have only to consult the Crown Solicitor in each State to obtain it. I asked the questions because 3ome counsel believe that they have been overlooked in connection w it h government briefs. returned soldiers has been accepted by various governments, and there is now before the House a bill dealing with this subject. I ask the Minister to look into this matter again and to let me have a more satisfactory answer. I wish to know that the policy of preference to returned soldiers is being given effect, and I shall put the question on the notice-paper again. MT. HOLT (Fawkner) [ 4 . 2 3 ] to the notice of the 'Government the case been applied to men serving in tropical of men in specialist units in the areas. I understand that in the Army New Guinea area who have served attempts are made to give leave after in the tropics for more than two every eighteen months, on the basis of two years without having had any leave. days for each month of service. On the 2nd MarchI wrote to the The period of eighteen months has Ministerf o r the A r m y ( Mr Forde) been, presumably, taken as the l i m it . pointing out that men serving in the It 87 A . T .

Australia on the 16th March, 1943. That gives 30 days' leave for fifteen Since then they have served at Milne months' serviee. I have learned from Bay, Goodenough Island, Buna and Lae. such inquiries as I have been able to They have accrued leave totalling 58 days due to them. The answer of the Minister wasA continuous programme of leave is being implemented but there are various factors which make it impossible to grant leave with the regularity considered desirable. It has been possible in some cases to relieve complete units and return them to the mainland for leave and rehabilitation, but owing to operational requirements this has been possible only to a limited extent. This cannot be done in the case of many technical and static units owing to their special composition and duties. Wherever practicable in such cases relief of individual members is arranged. For obvious reasons it is necessary that definite limits be placed on the numbers who may be absent from a unit at the one time. Subject to those limits and to thc availability of transport, leave is being granted from the New Guinea area to the greatest possible extent. It is recognized that many are overdue for leave, and although it is not possible at present to effect any radical change in the situation, continual efforts are being made to reduce hardships to a minimum, and all available leave vacancies are allotted accordingly. This matter is causing so much concern to those interested in these men that I have received representations on it from the Prahran-Toorak District Sub-Branch of The policy of preference to the Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Fathers Association of Australia in which it supports the request of the parents with sons, and others with near relatives, serving in the unit. It is pointed out to me that the work is particularly strenuous and exacting, and that one man who was recently able to secure leave was, shortly after his return to Australia, admitted to the Heidelberg M i l it a r y Hospital suffering from a nervous breakdown. I direct the attention I bring of the Government to the policy that has is interesting to contrast this make thaii the Air Eorce seems to be. able to> arrange far more effectively than, does ihe Army for the regular taking of leave by men serving in tropical areas. There rs special recognition, too, by the! Air Force of the position of men who are likely to be placed und'er some special,, continuing, strain.. Eor instance, the limit, for aircrew is niue months-, and; leaveis granted at the rate of five days a quarter,, .pl'us ten days' tropical leave,, giving a total leave period of 25 days. I Itoave here, apa-ess reference with some bearing on this matter which strengthens the claim that these men should be relieved, as speedily as possible.

I understand that the 35 men were applied for by the graziers collectively. tomakeindividual applications ? that these gvaziers axe working through a councillor who is their spokesman in the matter. He is asking for 35 men to be made available, and these will be mutually allocated amongst the graziers. Last year, some soldiers were made available to graziers, and although only 75 per cent, of them were practical men, the graziers were glad to have their assistance. Of course, they are looking for men who can handle an axe; but should such men not be available they are only too pleased to have the assistance of others. I have received five telegrams this week with respect to this matter. That fact should indicate its urgency. These graziers do not want to lose the balance of their stock, and now that their last reserves of fodder have been exhausted, they must cut inulga. make a special plea to the Government men in uniform on the mainland. Lack to give further consideration to the of replacements cannot be the obstacle. question of leave for soldiers who have Thc matter can be rectified by the proper served in the New Guinea area for a organization of shipping, and reorganizalengthy period.

I again strongly urge went north I , and other honourable the Government to honour its obligation members, asked the Government not to tbese men, wbo are suffering a grave to send any young man to New injustice. Guinea until he was at least nineteen years of age and had twelve months' training. That request was conceded.. We also asked that men should be given regular leave 'after they had served for twelve months in tbe tropics. When I waa in Queensland recently, a number of irate wives and parents complained that tbeir husbands and sons bad been in New Guinea for were circulated:periods ranging from seventeen months to twenty months and bad not yet been given any leave. I cannot understand the reason for that. During the last war, soldiers serving in Erance were senting the Minister for Trade and entitled to leave in Great Britain, or Customs, upon noticeFrance, every six months; and the rigors of this war are no less severe than the Australia rigors of the last war. Therefore, I urge Ministers now in the chamber to bring this matter before Cabinet for special .consideration at the earliest possible opportunity. I am not satisfied that the Government is making sufficient effort to ensure the granting of regular leave to soldiers after service for considerable periods in the tropics. This mattter is vital. The war is far from over, and if these men do not receive regular leave they will become victims of neurosis, and the many maladies prevalent in the tropics. The Government should rectify the position in the interests of not only the men concerned, but also the nation. From time to time, tbe Government has said that the lack of shipping is the main obstacle. Shipping is a world problem; but it has become so acute in Australia because the Government fails to take proper steps to deal with tbe handling of ships on the waterfront. No one will deny that soldiers serving in the tropics are shouldering a greater burden than workers on the waterfront who are constantly delaying shipping by strikes. We should ensure regular leave to our soldiers in the interests of our war effort as a whole; and it should not be difficult to Question resolved in tlie affirmative.

B ANKING LEGISLATION : COMMUNICATIONS able member for New England( Mr. Abbott) referred to the reply which I gave on the 19th A p r i l last to a question, upon notice, relating to a communication addressed to rae on the 17th August, 1943, in. which a complaint was made that a Minister, in the course of a broadcast address, had made use of the contents of a certain letter and of its accompanying despatch to England, had been subject to censorship in the ordinary manner. It was suggested that a copy of these documents could have come into the possession of the Minister only through the Censorship Department. As the gravamen of the comiplaim touched on the means by which a copy of the documents had come into the hands of tlie Minister concerned, I referred the matter to him for report. The Minister assured me, as already indicated in my reply to the honourable member's question on the 19th April, 1945, that there was no truth in the allegation that he had obtained a copy of the documents in question from the Censorship Department and that he bad no knowledge that they had passed through censorship channels.

General MacArthur has The following additional information replied that the communiques to which reference is made are perfectly clear and completely accurate. He has pointed out that apparently tlie Aitape area has been confused with a sector below it where the Australian forces are now engaged in what might be termed Wewak area.

On matters relating to his responsibilities under this directive, I am in touch with General MacArthur, and I am always ready to consider the representations of any honourable member on a mil tier of importance and decide whether I should take it up with General MacArthur. I suggest to honourable members that this is the appropriate course that should be followed. 1030-43 STAB. Defence, upon notice1.
