Minister for External Affairs said that the Allies were in possession of approximately five-sixths of the Dutch oil reserves and that the remaining one-sixth had been rendered useless. In a broadcast at 7 o'clock last night it was stated that Germany had seized most of the Dutch oil reserves. As these two statements are at variance, can the Minister supply accurate information on the subject? Further, can he make a statement as to the truth or otherwise of the statement appearing in this morning's press that Germany has gained possession of approximately Â£26,000,000 of Dutch gold? -ber was not accurate in his reference to my statement yesterday. I then said that, official advice received by the Government was that of a quantity of 450,000 tons of oil in Holland, five-sixths had been destroyed and the other onensixth rendered unfit for use, before the Germans completed the occupation of north Holland. That is the official advice received by the Government, and I have no doubt that it is accurate. As to the report that the Germans have secured possession of Â£26,000,000 of Dutch gold, I have no information on the subject, but the Government has been informed that Dutch bullion was removed to England prior to the German occupation of Holland. Whether all of it had been removed, or whether Â£26,000,000 remained, I am 'unable to say. The Government has no information on that subject. External Affairs inform the House of the latest authoritative news regarding the movements, or likely decisions, of the Italian Government in relation to affairs in Europe? Can he say what the attitude of the United States of America is, and whether the Government has received any information in regard to this matter through its representative at Washington ? Further, can he say whether there are any means whereby members of this House can be informed more fully of international developments, and the attitude of the Government towards them? of the honourable member's question, the Government has been advised daring recent weeks of what, I think, may fairly be described' as the progressive deterioration of the attitude of the Italian Government towards the Allied governments. It has heen informed by the Australian Minister in Washington that, during the last 48 hours, President Roosevelt himself has directed a personal appeal to Signor Mussolini for the maintenance of peace. I am unable to. give to the honourable member any information whatever as to the effect of that appeal in the quarter to which it was directed. attitude of the United States of America,? orable member refers to the Government of the United States of America. The general and consistent attitude of the Government is to exert every effort that it properly can exert towards the maintenance of peace in both hemispheres. The honourable member asks whether it would not he possible for this Government to give more accurate' and intimate information to honourable members as to international relations generally.

The Government of the Netherlands is still intact, although at present it is domiciled in London. I take this opportunity to make it clear that the Government of the Netherlands has indicated to the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States of America and Japan that it desires and requires no interference or help from any outside power in the maintenance of the independence of the Netherlands East Indies. Each of those governments has replied that it concurs. That is a separate and considered policy of the governments of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, as well as of the United States of America and Japan. that they tendered in regard to Holland, which afterwards was invaded ? for External Affairs any information as to whether the Dutchfleet,which recently sailed for England, is to be stationed in the Netherlands East Indies, as this is a matter of vital importance to Australia ? the building of a road to the New Guinea the Dutch fleet has always been stationed in the Netherlands East Indies; only minor units have been in the home waters of the Netherlands.

The.Minister said that, out of consideration for the national safety, my request could not be granted. I now ask him whether he will reconsider his decision, and advise me in what way the national safety would be affected by granting my request. alter my previous decision in this matter, and I am sure that, upon reflection, the honourable gentleman will realize that it is most undesirable that the lists of such individuals should be given publicity in any way. congestion in the offices of the Defence Department, and the trouble which honourable members experience because of the growing number of requests by widowed parents of soldiers in the Australian Imperial Force for the same treatment as is given to married dependants, will the. Minister for' the Army take steps to ease the situation? I understand that officers of his department are awaiting a decision in this matter.

He objected first that Parliament did not sit long enough, that democracy was being deprived of its privilege of representation in Parliament, and he suggested that Parliament should sit for a longer period. Well, the proposal of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is that we should sit one extra day next week, and two extra days the week after. The honourable member complains in one breath that Parliament does not sit long enough iind, in the next, that it is proposed to sit too long. If this Parliament were made up of any considerable number of members following the leadership of the honourable member for Batman, it might be advisable to close it up altogether for the good of the Empire and the cause we have at heart. Statements have been made here during this week which must have shaken the faith of the electors in those responsible for them, members one would imagine that, the Empire, of which Australia is not an unimportant part, was merely going along its peaceful and accustomed way, instead of being engaged in a veritable death struggle. It is time that we awakened to the fact that we are at war. The present Government has upon it a greater responsibility than any preceding Commonwealth Government has had. The time of Ministers is fully occupied in the consideration of matters of great moment, and they should be given as much time ns possible for the performance of their duties, even if that meant the closing of .Parliament so that they might be able to concentrate on their work.

To that course I , as Leader of the Opposition, believing that the Opposition should not be muzzled and also that there should be the fullest possibility for consideration of government business, readily consented. When yesterday, in another part of this building, I intimated that consent to my colleagues, no objection was taken. That is an entirely different question from the closing of this Parliament. When a proposal is submitted to close this Parliament, which has not come before us at all honourable member will assure me that the Prime Minister has not expressed his intention to close this House, I shall be satisfied. member for Batman that my understanding is that the Government desires to sit one additional day next week in order that it might pass certain bills which, owing to the financial requirements of the Government, have now become a matter of urgency. should sit an extra day in order to deal with that programme in this Parliament without the use of the closure and the other devices to shorten debate than to refuse to consent to meet on Tuesday and thereby, perhaps, jeopardize the fullness of the debate. explain why we have been wasting time discussing an electoral bill?

I am opposed to the social, economic, and financial policy of this Government just as relentlessly, and I hope a little more -consistently, than the honourable member for West Sydney. ing on the grindstone! -do not need to be told what my duty is. The moment I cease to discharge my duty to the satisfaction of those who have appointed me as Leader of the Opposition, there will be no delay in the appointment of another Leader of the Opposition. AThen the Prime Minister does intimate that he desires to l if t this House, we should decide when and how this Parliament should meet. It will depend on the character of his statement. If the Prime Minister says that he desires a fortnight or three weeks for the purpose of carrying through the administrative tasks of the Government, which men of common sense must know is an inevitable part of government, I shall consider that proposal fully and weigh its merits, and then invite my colleagues to discuss with me what attitude we shall take. That position has not arisen to-day, and I ask the honourable member for If the Batman not to press this matter to a division. He has indicated his point of view, and when the proposal for a long adjournment of this House is put forward it can he raised again in debate. One thing to be considered is the reference that has been made to the convenience of honourable members in their constituencies. That may be important, but I remind honourable members that I have a constituency, which has within it I prefer that we as many people as those of other honourable members. I am not able to make any constituency engagements of any sort or description. That applies to a number of other representatives in this Parliament, and they, I venture to say, apart from political obligations to their electorates, are entitled now and again to Government have regard paid to their domestic desires. I have a family, too. I did not know that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) would raise this point upon this motion, but it seems to be that he is perfectly justified in doing so. I do not understand that I gave approval to the Government's truncation of the session. of the proposed lengthening of the sitting days for the next two weeks I took the proposal to be part of the speeding-up process, which takes place before a session comes to an end, and as the prelude to an early end of this session.

The stand taken by the honourable member for Batman is one which the people of Australia will thoroughly approve. It is one of which I thoroughly approve. Tn spite of the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr), and largely knowledge. If this House is to be lifted because of his remarks, the people of in a fortnight, after a sitting of only Australia will approve of the protest six weeks, I shall join in the protests entered by the honourable member for and vote against the adjournment, but Batman.

That business should be put through Parliament as speedily as possible and only then should we deal with routine business.

I reject the belief that this Parliament., after a long recess, should go into, recess again, having sat for only six weeks. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition agrees with that point of view. But I suggest that this motion should be carried, that we should sit four days next week to clear up the financial business, and that then we should come to grips with this mutter of an early recess. propose to vote against the motion. I congratulate the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) upon his very timely objection to the procedure proposed by the Government. It is not my intention to split straws. Any member of this House who in the light of the exhibition we have had during the last couple ot days, of extensive consideration being given to matters that are of no account, professes to believe that the House is to meet on Tuesday of next week simply for the purpose of expediting the passage of certain financial proposals of the Government,, and does not see in the proposal the first step towards the speeding up of business with the idetf of closing P'arlia-: ment next Friday week, is easily satisfied with the assurance of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). I am concerned, as are most honourable members,, with the way in which the Government is controlling the affairs of this country. We are given very little, opportunity to discuss its administration. It has often been suggested that we should follow the example of the House of Commons. We know that, during the war, that parliamentary institution has functioned more regularly than at any other period since the last war. Even though there is now a national government in Great Britain, and criticism of its activities is reduced to the minimum, the necessity is still realized for the Parliament to meet regularly and to have the last word, if it has any, in the conduct of the affairs of the country. Whether the Leader of the do too Opposition ( Mr Curtin) is satisfied or not with tlie assurance given by the Government does not concern me. What I am concerned about is the tendency in this country, particularly during the last couple of years, to establish a. bureaucracy in the Cabinet to govern the country by regulation, totally ignoring the wishes of Parliament. We shall not assist to break down that bureaucracy if we fall for such a suggestion as the Prime Minister has apparently made, that the purpose of the proposed extra sitting day is merely to expedite the transaction of certain government business. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has said that this is not the proper time to protest. With his knowledge of parliamentary procedure, the right honourable gentle man must know that when the Government finally decides to adjourn it will be a. little too late to voice a protest. If the desire be to keep the House in session, and to retain in the Parliament control of the nation's affairs, this is the only fitting time for the making of such a protest. join with other honourable members on this side of the House in protesting against the proposal of the Government to bring about an early cessation of the sittings of this Parliament.

80,Mr Pollard (Ballarat) [11.28],"the haven of recess at the end of this month. The statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), that the proposal is that the House shall meet on one additional day next week and on two additional days in the following week, presages the definite intention that this Parliament shall adjourn at the end of the month. The vote just taken is an illustration of an attempt to dominate Parliament by a Fascist reactionary government. . able member may not reflect upon a vote of the House. 1 have allowed a reasonably wide latitude in the discussion of the motion, but the honourable gentleman must be well aware that he is out of order in criticizing anything that has been done by the House, by a Minister or by a private member upon a motion which relates merely to the next sitting day. that this Government of Fascist tendencies is attempting to rush Parliament into recess in order to prevent freedom of speech before the Chair relates to the number of sitting days next week, and provides that the House, at its rising, shall adjourn until Tuesday next. The honourable member's remarks must be relevant to that motion. Mr Speaker, in suggesting that the proposed extra sitting day for next week is intended and, in fact, is deliberately designed to enable the Government to confine the whole of the debates to budgetary matters ? If the motion is agreed to it will may be in order, if he does not speak the be practically impossible for honourable members to obtain adequate time to demonstrate to the public that an effort is being made by the Government to deprive the people of many of the liberties which they are supposed to enjoy, and for the retention of which, indeed, the great world conflict is now raging. I am aware of many incidents which indicate that this Government, either consciously or unconsciously, is adopting the same tactics as Hitler adopted allow the honourable member to continue opportunity to have their grievances speaking in that strain. would not, sir. ever desire Parliament to sit on Tuesday? the Prime Minister that Parliament shall sit for one extra day next week and for two extra days in the following week is not acceptable to us, as it will give us an altogether inadequate opportunity to expose the intentions of the Administration. I believe that if the public is made aware of those intentions it will strongly disapprove of them. Only yesterday it was demonstrated in this House that one Minister, at any rate, was prepared to use every means in his power to prevent the ventilation in Parliament of the legitimate grievances of a public servant. Mr ""WABD -That is so. able member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) is out of order.

I am not so much concerned about the actual sitting days for next week and the following week, but I am very definitely concerned about the objective which the Prime Minister has in view.

Club of South Australia has communicated directly with me in connection with this matter, and my South Australian colleagues in the Cabinet have also mentioned it to me. The club is labouring under a misapprehension in regard to the actual position. On the outbreak of war it was decided to use the facilities of all aero clubs and civil flying schools for training Air Force recruits. The capacities of these schools varied from two or three pupils to twelve pupils; but as it has been found to he inefficient to train recruits in such small units, arrangements are now being made for the establishment of elementary flying training schools of greater capacity in the capital cities. It is hoped that aero clubs and civil flying schools, either individually or collectively, will submit to the Department of Air quotations for conducting these schools. Any aero club or other similar organization which has the necessary capacity and experience will be given an opportunity to submit an estimate. I assure the honourable member that the Department of Air appreciates very much the valuable work that has been done by aero clubs since the outbreak of war. was good enough to inform me a fortnight ago that he would consider my suggestion that the Government should",24,Pairs

Clause 13 (Directions for postal voting)of the Australian Labour party-non Communist) [12.25] -As with most other clauses, I rise on this clause to obtain from the Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr Nock) advice as to the need for the change that is suggested. The committee would be helped a great deal if the Minister, at the outset, would explain the reasons which have prompted these proposed changes in the electoral law. I., too, should like the Minister to tell the committee just what this clause proposes to do. What sort of directions for postal voting are to be given? Postal voting facilities exist to-day. What improvement of those facilities does this clause intend? At various times, borderline tactics have been employed in the use of the postal voting machinery and the cominittee^would be well advised to act carefully in dealing with this clause. ister) [12.27] -This clause is a formal clause consequential on clause 16 which contains the proposal that postal votes be accepted if received within seven days after the close of the poll, provided that the returning officer is satisfied by the postmark on the envelope or otherwise that the vote was recorded and that the envelope containing the ballot-papei was posted before the close of the poll. of the Australian Labour party-non Communist) [12.28] -What would happen if the postmark .were not discernible? That frequently is the case. How then would the divisional returning officer satisfy his mind that the postal vote complied with the law? ster) [12.30] -If the postmark be obliterated, or be not clear to the returning officer, he would be entitled to have regard to circumstantial evidence. For example, if there were only the one mail from a given locality on a certain date, and the letter reached him by that mail, that evidence should be considered by him. The matter is one for his discretion. tion to accept testimony by scrutineers on behalf of the candidate? Clause agreed to. Clause 14 agreed to.

A good deal of time is thus saved, because the Minister has not then to address himself to many of theclauses -with respect to which no explanation or information is needed, because honourable members, are thoroughly familiar with them.

Will Nock) explain what is meant by "" delivered"" ? that "" posted"" implies its having been placed in the post office and stamped. I am not altogether satisfied with the Assistant Minister's explanation in regard to the obliteration of the postmark. Is there any possibility of an elector who votes by post being deprived of his vote because of either faulty or dirty rubber stamping? A t times, many envelopes have the postmark blurred in the .post office and it is hard to' tell where they are from , particularly when they come from country post offices, which have not the best of stamping machinery and consequently are not to blame. I take it that the meaning of "" delivered "" is, that either an elector himself, or an individual on his behalf, must deliver the postal ballot paper to a registrar. If it were delivered to a returning officer, that gentleman would know that he had received it before polling day. I s it intended that the postal ballot-paper must be delivered to a registrar, and that he must certify that fact although he posts it after polling day, and that in such circumstances the vote would be formal? ter) the postal ballot-paper must be delivered prior to the close of the poll. registrar or to the returning officer before the close of the poll. If posted, it could be posted before the close of the poll and be valid if it reached the returning officer within seven days of that event. -The Assistant Minister's explanation sustains my objection. An elector could deliver a postal vote to a registrar in an area in which possibly there would be little means of scrutineering it , and that officer could keep it in his possession. There is not strict departmental control over the registrar, because in nine cases out of ten he may not be a full-time servant of the Electoral Department, The Assistant Minister has said that, so long as this officer stated that he had received the postal vote prior to the close of the r poll, it would not matter whether he rethe Assistant .

If they do not do so they may get into trouble. happen in the case of a presiding officer who, while not forwarding the postal votes forthwith, yet forwarded them within the stipulated seven days? The voteswould still be valid. Presiding officers, like other persons in the' community, have their political opinions. In outback areas a station-owner may be the presiding officer, and his politics may be well known, as may, also, the politics uf the relatively few electors who vote at that particular pollingbooth. WhatE desire is that the nature of the postal votes recorded at remote polling places shall be made known to the interested parties forthwith, and shall not be left, without some check, in the possession of the presiding officers. There should be a scrutinyof such votes after the close of the poll. T. hope that the amendment will not be accepted. ( Mr Nock) is even contemplating accepting it, I ask him how he would suggest that the provision of the principal act which precludes the counting of any votes at a polling place other than the head-quarters of a subdivision may be overcome? I believe that the provision that there should he no disclosure of the particulars of polling at subsidiary polling places was inserted in the Electoral Act years ago by a Labour government. Under our existing system, which has been in force for many years, all ballot-papers must be sent to the headquarters of a subdivision to be counted. It would therefore seem to be impracticable to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) without making a vital alteration of our counting system. The provision limiting the counting of votes in this way was made in order to prevent the details of polling at small and remote polling places from being published. As the honourable member himself has pointed out, it often happens that a station owner place, and we have known of workers iii such places being victimized for having voted against the desires of the station owner. The Assistant Minister has .explained that under the regulations, postal votes delivered at a polling place must immediately be placed in the ballot box. It would not be possible, therefore, for a presiding officer to hold such votes for a period up to seven days. I am definitely opposed to the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney, and would offer the strongest objection to any alteration of the existing system which would permit votes to be counted at small and remote polling booths. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has put very clearly the arguments against the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), and I agree with his view. What he has said would apply to a number of small polling places in my own electorate. There is another difficulty in accepting the amendment. Section 96 of the principal act providesA t the scrutiny the divisional returning officer shall produce all applications for postal vote certificates and postal ballot-papers, and If the Assistant Minister shall produce unopened all envelopes containing postal votes received up to the close of the poll, and shall{a) compare the signature of the elector on each postal vote certificate with the signature of the same elector on the application for the certificate and allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures;",31,Commonwealth Electoral

At present, an elector who desires to record a postal vote must make an application for a postal voting-paper on the prescribed form. This is sent to the appropriate divisional returning officer, who returns the paper to the applicant. The recording of the vote must then he witnessed by a Justice of the Peace. The returning officer finally compares the signature on the application form with the signature on the postal ballot-paper. Eor this reason, all postal votes must be returned to the divisional returning officer for counting. Under this proposal, presiding officers in remote who are not permanent officials of the places will be allowed to count postal votes. counted only at the 'head office. many candidates do not have any scrutineers at all, so that there is no one to check the presiding officer when he counts the postal votes. them, and it is not proposed that he shall do so. tion, I have no more to say. trust that the amendment will not be accepted.

That section does provide for the delivery of postal votes to the presiding officer, but only in exceptional cases, where there is a last minute delivery and insufficient time for the vote to reach the divisional returning officer. Only in those circumstances can an authorized witness deliver a vote to a presiding officer. The votes are placed in boxes, and the whole procedure is hedged around with safeguards, the chief of which is that no one but the divisional returning officer may open the envelopes. Section 96 provides that only the divisional returning officer may open them, after he has produced them unopened to the scrutineers. Upon the postal votes being opened, the divisional returning officer may have to make certain decisions. It seems to me that greater suspicion would be associated with postal voting if presiding officers electoral department, as are divisional returning officers, were authorized to open votes. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said that the presiding officer should be allowed to open postal ballot-papers because he cannot be trusted to hold them. If he cannot be trusted to hold them, he certainly should' not be allowed to open them and make a provisional decisionupon theim The divisional returning officer is much more familiar with the act, and is far more likely to be fair and impartial in dealing with these matters than is a presiding officer who, possibly, has been engaged for the day and is probably partisan in his outlook.

Ballot-boxes from small polling booths are brought to one centre, where they are counted. The postal vote, and its envelope, become free and detached from the ballot-box. That must be so, or else the count of the ordinary votes could not take place by the presiding officer at the counting centre. The counting centre may be a town like Inverell, where, perhaps, the ballot-boxes from six or seven small poliing booths are counted. When those boxes come in they are opened, and the postal votes taken out. Postal votes may lie on the table while in the custody of the presiding officer who is counting the votes at Inverell. Why should not the scrutineers, who deal with ordinary votes, scrutinize postal votes also, and thereby make clear what the postal vote for that centre is, instead of leaving such votes in the possession of some person who may retain them for seven' days, or such period as will enable them to reach the divisional returning officer for the district within seven days of polling day?

My amendment deals only with the counting of the votes. The Assistant Minister says that the postal votes are placed in the box, and the inference is that they are safe thereafter; but I point out that, although they go into the box, they come out of it later.

222,Mr Beasley,"I make no charge.""postal votes be counted when tlie primary votes are counted. Scrutineers should be able to satisfy themselves that rhe count of postal votes is known to all who are interested. By altering the existing legislation to meet conditions in remote places, we make it possible for presiding officers to hold postal votes too long. It is not sufficient that they may be liable to punishment for a breach of the regulations. The point is that votes which have been -detained are valid so long as they reach the divisional returning officer within seven days. I cannot see what the period of seven days has to do with the presiding officer at all. Section 96, if these amendments were made, would read as follows:At tlie scrutiny tlio divisional returning officer shall produce all applications for postal vote certificates and postal ballot-papers, and shall produce' unopened all envelopes containing postal votes reccjved up to the end of seven days immediately succeeding the close of the poll by him or 'received -up--to the close of the poll by any other divisional returning officer or any assistant returning officer or presiding officer in pursuance of sub-section 2 of section !)2 of f-his act and shallft seems to rue that the period of seven days -applies to articles received through the post by the divisional returning officer. A voter can post his postal ballot-paper so that -the officer will receive it seven days before the poll closes, but, in order that the person whose postal ballot paper cannot -reach the divisional returning officer in time may yet be protected, it may be delivered to the presiding officer on the polling day. Therefore, I cannot see where the seven days' delay that has been mentioned by honourable members is iikely to occur. is made for a delay of seven days. of a presiding officer. addressed to the divisional returning officer, who is the only man entitled to open them. not reach the district returning officer within seven days but does reach the pre-s-ding officer on polling day, the vote is still valid irrespective of the irregularity. long as it reaches the presiding officer on the day on which the poll closes. As far as its validity is in question it does -not matter whether or not he sends it on to the district returning officer. The result of an election may turn upon this point. A presiding officer's mistakes cannot invalidate a vote; his duty, according to the regulations, is to forward a vote to the.divisional returning officer. Tho amendment proposing a delay of seven days, relates merely to anything which is sent to the divisional returning officer through the post. The act makes an exception of clemency for the person who cannot lodge his vote in time, so that i i will be valid so long as he is able to deliver it to the presiding officer on polling day. It would be a great mistake to lend any countenance to the proposal that presiding officers should open postal ballot papers. -Question putThat the paragraph proposed to be inserted The committee divided.

[2.56] -The clause proposes a drastic change of the existing system. I believe, that honourable members will agree with me that the Assistant Minister( Mr the Government's amendment and, unless Nock) has failed to state any good reason why a change should be made. He has merely said that the clause proposes a : fairer' method of placing names on the ballot-paper. In what way is the present method unfair? Many members of Parliament whose names begin with letters near the end of the alphabet would prefer that their names should remain in their usual positions on the ballot-papers because, under the present system, electors know where to look for the names of the candidates whom they support. Senate ballot papers are usually long and, if the 1Government's proposal were implemented, electors would be obliged to go to a great deal of trouble to find the names of their candidates. At present they know exactly where to look for the name of a candidate beginning with "" S "" or "" W "". Interested voters would not record their votes merelyby, marking the ballot-paper from begin1 ning to end in alphabetical order. The object of any amendment of the electoral law should be to make voting more readily understandable to disinterested people^ and tocreate greater interest. According to the Government's proposed amendment, the nameof a candidate, beginning with, say, "" P "" mightoften appear, at. the head of theballotpaper, followed by an "" A , "" "",B-'-'-..or "" B"". -' ....

So. far the, Minister has failed toprove, that anydefinite, advantage will be derived from, he does give such proof, honourable mem:bers should vote against the clause.

The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) showed remarkahle imaginative powers when he said that this bill had been introduced for the purpose of giving to the Government an advantage at the elections.

The honourable member said that good reason would have to be shown for the need for the change proposed in this clause before he would support it. The mere fact that there is to-day in pre-selection ballots a premium on the candidates whose names begin with the letter "" A "" is itself good and sufficient reason for altering the system in order that the man whose name begins with "" W "", "" Y or any letter other than "" A "" will have just as good a chance as the man whose name begins with "" A "" . This clause provides a good way of getting out of the difficulty, although there is still an element of chance and of slight advantage in that one group will occupy the left-hand section of the ballot-paper, the second group the middle section and the third group the righthand section. There may be an advantage to the party which is fortunate enough in the ballot to get the left-hand section, because we are accustomed to writing and reading from left to right, but the advantage will be less than now when the names are placed vertically.

No more degrading suggestion has ever been made in any parliament than that the returning officer should be asked to place names in a box and draw for positions, the fortunate ones being placed on the left-hand side and those less fortunate somewhere else. Nothing more degrading conld be brought into this Parliament. Why not put legislation into a hat and draw it out? That would be .just as logical as this proposal, which is an insult to the intelliing will be possible under the proposed gence of the people. I marvel at the temerity of the Government in asking us fo agree to the drawing of lots to -determine where men shall have their names placed on the ballot-pa.per. The present practice has been in operation for fifteen years, and was not questioned until in New South Wales-so it is alleged-the deliberate attempt was made to select four candidates whose names commenced, with A "". I remind honourable members that that was the first time there had been such an-occurrence, and it may be the last. Because the Government alleges that something which happened in New South Wales might happen everywhere else, it brings forward this proposal. I want to know why a man whose name begins with A "" should have that name put in -a hat, so that it may not appear at the top of the ballot-paper. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley( Mr quently, it is resorting to a new method Rosevear) that in everyday life the alphabet is followed when information is being sought. I do not believe that the top of the ballot-paper offers the enormous advantage suggested by honourable members. The majority of the electors know who their candidates are. A certain number of them may go from the top to the bottom of the ballot-paper. 1 challenge contradiction of I be statement that some electors vote 1, 2, 3, for all of the groups, believing them all to be the same. It is illogical, unfair, and made to confuse the people and to destroy degrading to put names in a-hat and draw then:! to determine the positions they shall occupy on the ballot-paper. It is worthy only of a government of this kind. do not think there was any need for this amendment. I believe that it would be wrong to draw names out of a box. We should continue the present custom, which has been in existence for many years. No doubt the Government became scared because the Labour party has in the Senate fifteen men who do not have to stand for election on the next occasion. Had the reverse been the case, I do not think that any alteration would have been proposed. On one occasion in Denison my opponent, whose name was McPhee. was placed ahead of me on the ballot paper. I objected that "" M a l i "" came before "" He "" , but was ruled out by the returning officer. I consider that schemsystem. Honourable members probably know that there is a game called "" crow"", which is played to trap the simple or the unwary. A number of pieces of paper arc placed in a hat, and the member of the party who withdraws the piece on which is written the word "" crow "" has to shout drinks. The simple man is given first draw-, and as every piece of paper placed in the hat has the word "" crow "" written on it, he naturally is the victim. Gambling provides opportunities for cheating. We are not acting democratically in changing a system that has been in existence for many years. The reason for the proposal of the Government is that there was a definite swing to Labour at the last Senate elections. The Government has to win every Senate seat contested at the next elections in order to maintain its majority in that chamber. Consefor the election of candidates. The alteration of the form of the ballot-paper is wrong, because it will confuse women voters especially. Those whose names commence, with. "" A "" should not be interfered with. Adam's name began with that letter, and Adam was the first man. This is a stupid proposal introduced solely because the Government, parties were overwhelmingly defeated at the last Senate elections.

We should think more of the prestige of Parliament. This is a vicious and villainous attempt to impair the dignity of Parliament. [Quorum formed.] find the real reason for the introduction of this bill in the clause now before us. The Government parties have harboured the idea that the Labour party of New South Wales, by selecting for the last Senate elections four candidates whose surnames began with the letter "" A "" , obtained an unfair advantage. In my opinion, it is a purely mythical advantage. Among the 75 members of the House of Representatives, only one has a surname beginning with "" A "" , while (line have surnames beginning with "" S "". 1. have no doubt at all that the names of those nine members appeared last on the ballot-paper, but it was not detrimental to them. I am opposed to the proposal that the names of the various groups of candidates should be placed in the box and the box shaken before the names are drawn to determine their position on the ballot-paper. That procedure is entirely unworthy. I am also opposed to the appearance of the names of the political parties on the ballot-paper. We should not recognize political parties on our ballot-papers. What is to happen to independent system? Apparently they are to be classified in one group, and if the independent group should be drawn out of the box first when the order of parties is being determined, the names in that group will go on the left-hand side of the proposed horizontal ballot-paper. An independent candidate should not be forced to have his name grouped with that of other independent candidates. If the names are to be drawn out of a box, the independents should be regarded as individuals and not as a group, and if the name of an independent should be drawn out first, his name, as an individual, should go on the left-hand side of the ballot-paper with the other names following in the order in which they are drawn. reasonable and unfair to group all independents together, for their policies might be very different. The adoption of these methods in the election of members of a democratic parliament is entirely undesirable, and I can see no reason why we should depart from the procedure which has served us well for 40 years. reason why this proposal is before us is that honourable members of the Labour party who sit on the cross benches opposite have shown a remarkable capacity, and some degree of duplicity, in selecting certain persons as Senate candidates. ment parties selected Captain Aarons. the honourable member belongs approve of the adoption of lottery systems of this kind ? us solely because of an unexampled demonstration of trickery by the ruling authorities of the New South Wales Labour party prior to the last Senate election. Apparently they scoured the country in order to find a sufficient number of individuals whose surnames began with the letter "" A "" to serve them as candidates for the Senate. We have not had any difficulties of this kind in elections for the House of Representatives. I recollect, however, that on one occasion a person named Gosling was chosen as a candidate. candidates under this Isnow another person named Gander. subsequently withdrawn and the name Donovan substituted. There is, however, no fair grounds for comparing the House of Representatives ballot-paper witb that of the Senate, for we rarely have more than three candidates for one seat in the House of Representatives election, whereas in the Senate the number of candidates may rise as high as a dozen or more. I shall go so far as to say that probably 25 per cent, of the people do .not know who their Senate representatives are. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Reid( Mr Gander) took care to give the 1,500 aged men in institutions in his electorate a duplicate ballot-paper to ensure that they would It is, at any rate, quite unvote as he desired.

It can be established, therefore, that we can build ships in a It is not suggested, surely, that reasonable time, and at a reasonable cost. ship-construction Every week we allow to go by without until that dock is built. taking action makes the situation more of replacing serious.

Therefore, it will become our duty more and more to make up the deficiency.

That with it, very little is is due to two or three factors, among shipbuilding. which is the agreement between the Commonwealth and the company which has build ships. That has been taken charge of the Cockatoo Island long ago. The question is, Dockyard. long it will take us to Only Â£1,000,000 of the total of a freighter of , say, 10,000 Â£3,000,000 proposed to be expended in New South Wales on the construction of a new dock would be required to make the existing facilities in Victoria adequate to cope with the largest vessels that are likely to be built in Australia, at any rate for the next decade. Therefore, It is also I ask that a part of the Â£3,000,000 be expended in Victoria, not experimentally, but in the certainty of developing Auswhere costs have been tralia's shipbuilding operations rapidly arising out and efficiently by immediately bringing the docking facilities right up to date. Victorian, firms have tlie docking facilities and most of the plant necessary for the construction of a modern vessel of 10,000 tons dead weight. Probably a larger crane would be the only new equipment required. Experts agree that a vessel of that size could be constructed in nine months, and that three such vessels could be built in' two years, each operation reducing the average time of construction as well as the cost. This would be a remarkable feat in normal conditions, and obviously it would be more difficult of achievement in time of war, but even so it demonstrates how urgent the matter is. Et is necessary, therefore, that the Government should take action now in order that our shipbuilding. programme may not suffer in the future. It would not be too pessimistic to predict that the Government will experience all kinds of difficulties if it does not take definite action now to provide shipping tonnage for exports of foodstuffs and the transport of men, if necessary, to the other side of the world. Investigations have been made already to determine how the work could be distributed among Victorian firms. Neither in this country nor anywhere else can a vessel be constructed expeditiously at one central depot. Vessels must be built in Australia, as the Queen Mary was built in Great Britain, and as aeroplanes are built in the United States of America, by canvassing engineering workshops in order to distribute amongst them various parts of the construction work. Preliminary canvassing has already heen carried out in Victoria. The firms which have been selected have intimated the quantity of work they could undertake for the construction and equipment of a complete vessel. The hull could be built at WiUiamstown dockyard or some other dockyard in Port Phillip, and the remainder of the work could be rationed among various engineering firms. Although the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in New South Wales is an excellent one, it cannot keep pace with the requirements of the country. attack. shifts are being worked there, and some men are working more than one shift daily. That does not make for the maximum of efficiency. In any case the dock is not capable of dealing with the future shipbuilding programme. When I met a member of the Government and a naval architect in Melbourne recently the question was raised as to whether engineering workshops in Victoria were capable of constructing engines and other parts of a modern vessel. As fortune would have it, I was accompanied by Mr Aird, manager of J. Thompson and Company, Castlemaine, who was able to prove conclusively that his firm had already built the class of engine that would be required, and had even supplied some equipment for the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. All that is necessary now is for the Government to decide when a start should be made with construction work. I realize that Cabinet is faced with many delicate problems but this, also, is an important war problem. In any case it will take a long time to build modern vessels, and the longer the Government delays, the longer it will be before new vessels can be launched. The position becomes more dangerous with every day that passes. W6 have not even repaired and maintained existing craft in good order, and, as the years go by, we shall lose ground, and the shortage of vessels will become increasingly acute. 1 ask the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to bring this matter before Cabinet in order to make a definite decision upon it as soon as possible, for, when peace is declared, work must be found for those now on war service. a number of occasions in this HouseI have expressed criticism of the high cost of constructing houses in Canberra. The matter has become more urgent now because, in the near future, several more Commonwealth departments will be moved to Canberra. When the headquarters staffs of the Postal Department and the defence services, and a number of patent officers, are brought to this city, hundreds of additional houses will be required for them. According to what I can learn, the transfers will involve three or It is also vulnerable to four thousand people, who will probably require 700 or 800 houses.

294,Mr Stacey (Adelaide) [4.17],"OnHouse plans and specifications of types of houses that are built in Adelaide in the form of semi-detached pairs, at a cost of Â£900 for each pair. I have asked more than once that a scheme for building houses of this kind should be introduced in Canberra, suggest that the work could be done as cheaply as in Adelaide, because freight factors would necessarily affect the final cost. Last year I was told that 200 houses -wore to be built in Canberra, and I .again submitted these plans, and had discussions with architects and valuators, who assured me that this type of house would not cost more than Â£1,100 a pair in Canberra. I had previously told the then Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) that I intended to move the adjournment of this House in order to discuss that matter, but after being given this assurance by departmental officers I allowed the matter to drop. I was amazed to learn later, however, that the cost of erecting such houses in Canberra had been estimated at Â£1,600 a pair, not Â£1,100, as I had been informed previously. These facts show the necessity for a. thorough investigation. -I appeal to the Prime Minister( Mr of his health, which I greatly regret. Menzies) to endeavour to arrange for the Minister for the Interior to inspect the houses in Adelaide, which are let at a rental of 12s. 6d. a week. Many workmen in Canberra receive wages no higher than those paid in Adelaide, and I am sure that, owing to the high rents of houses in Canberra, and -the bus fares that have to be paid, the lower-paid men here suffei hardship. Shortly before the late Prime Minister died, he and I inspected the houses in Adelaide, and he was greatly impressed by them. He told me that he would do all in his power to have cottages of a similar kind erected in Canberra. What has been done in other States could be done in this Territory, and, as hundreds of additional houses will have to be erected, if all Commonwealth Departments are to function from the Seat of Government, it should be possible to save hundreds of thousands of pounds. Shortly after the outbreak of war the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made a declaration on the subject of the censorship which filled some of us, at least, with the hope that that function would be administered on a more reasonable, not to -sav more indulgent, scale than during the last war. I pointed out that, as the war went on, this matter would, for all pracalthough I do not tical purposes, pass out of the hands of the Prime Minister, and a rigorous administration of the censorship would rates and other occur as usual. I regret to say that my prophecy has been more than fulfilled. Recently, I addressed a question to the Minister in charge of censorship with regard to a publication known as Soviets 'To-day. I was not a reader of that journal, .although I do not close my mind to pub. lieations of that or of any other kind which are not, in their nature, obviously -objectionable. Nor do I think that even my most unreasonable opponents would suggest that I have any association with the doctrine of communism. I am, however, deeply interested in the liberty of the subject. I addressed a question to the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister in charge of censorship, who is absent from the House a good deal, owing, I understand, to the unsatisfactory state However, the Prime Minister said that he would make inquiries and provide me with an answer. My question, related to Soviets To-day, and I pointed out that this publication was not really censored, but, in effect, was suppressed. The whole of the matter in it, whether it related to the war or not, merely from the fact that it related to the Soviet Republic, was sufficient in the mind of the censor to justify its censorship and suppression. In reply to my question, "" Upon what principle was this matter wholly suppressed?"", the Prime Minister saidThe whole of the copy submitted for the issue of 22nd A p r i l of Soviets To-day related to Russia, and so came within, the prohibition issued by the censorship that certain newspapers should not refer to neutral countries, including Russia. The matter was therefore deleted. If this publication will observe censorship conditions in the same spirit as Australian newspapers generally are doing, it will have no difficulty with censorship. We have ample proof of the reasons .why it is very easy for the daily press, at least, to comply with censorship conditions; but I ask the Prime Minister whether he could imagine a -more petulant or more",46,Imperial Force Control The Commonwealth Railways
295,Mr Brennan (Batman) [4.22],"prejudiced attitude than that disclosed by this answer to my question. Not every newspaper that refers to Eussia has that matter censored or excised, although that would be pitiful enough, but the fact is that certain newspapers only may not refer to Eussia. It seems to me to be perfectly obvious that, the censorship is directed to the suppression, of the newspaper to which I have referred, by this indirect method which has never been approved by this chamber, and which can have no possible relationship to the successful or safe prosecution of the war. We are prepared to accept the inevitable, namely, that nothing must be published .which gives to the enemy information it is thought the enemy should not have. We are prepared to accept the further condition that we must not publish anything which tends to hearten the enemy or to depress our own people. I do not say that that is to be wholly commended, but most people are prepared, to accept it without grumbling. However, we find that a particular newspaper is chosen, because of some political leanings which its editor and management are supposed to have, and it issaid of it that it may not say anything to the advantage, or in praise, of the Soviet Republic, that it must not refer to what that country is doing for the health or education of the people, or to what, as an experiment in socialism, as some people think, is being practised there, and that it must not even mention Russia. repeat that I cannot find anything to describe such an attitude on the part of the Government other, than that it is petulant and prejudiced and deliberately unfair to certain citizens. I refer again to the final paragraph of the answer to my qtiestionI f this publication will observe censorship conditions in the same spirit as Australian newspapers generally arc doingi t will have no difficulty with the censorship: Censorship conditions! My complaint is that the censorship conditions are not equal and are not applied equally to allpublications, but are applied with prejudice to certain newspapers, because their views are aimarently unpalatable to the honourable gentleman whohas the administration of the censorship. That cannot be too strongly condemned, and, frankly, I am surprised. I have serious political differences with the Prime Minister-the y will stand or await solution as may he-but , generally, although I am opposed to the right honourable gentleman in policy, having regard to his own point of view, it has always appeared to me that he has undertaken his duties with moderation and without unfair discrimination. I refer also to World Peace, another publication. World Peacehad an article on conscription and historical referenced to it. It is all cut out simply, apparently, because the journal is World Peace. The whole publication, like Soviets To-Day. is practically suppressed by a back-door method. I do not associate myself with .all of the matter that has been excised.. I have not even read it-'that is not my responsibility-bu t I have read certain parts for the excision of which I can find no excuse whatever. I have received a letter from Mr G. K . Peel; national secretary of the League for Peace and Democracy, in which the concluding paragraph isAs you will see from the material enclosed, we are not even allowed to give facts about the humanitarian achievements of a great doctor in China or facts about the laststruggle against conscription. Surely one would have though that, in view of the declared position of both parties against conscription, historical references to that matter would have been permissible. A Mr Campbell' has forwarded to me a. letter which I find a little I amusing. It contains the typewritten script of a well-known poem by 'the well known Australian author, Henry Lawson.

298,Mr Pollard (Eallarat) [ 4 . 3 4 ],"or well-trained artisans now employed in our engineering eslablishments and docks, an opportunity to engage in ihis industrj which is so essential to the Allied cause. I also wish to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bminan). I am not a Communist, nor am I a member of the Communist party. The only political party to which 1. belong is the Australian Labour party. I believe that if this country acts true to form and fights Hitlerism in an endeavour to retain liberty, those who have conscientious convictions should have the right to express them. The censorship as at present conducted is absurd, and has reached a stage when it can be said that there is a vendetta against certain newspapers and journals. RecentlyI delivered a speech in this chamber which was published in Hansard and in which I criticized a member of the Government. Hansard is circulated throughout the Commonwealth, and if what 1 then said was fit and proper to be published in Hansard, surely there is no reason why it should not appear in any other journal. When an attempt was made to publish it in the Tribune, it was completely censored. Surely that is going beyond what may be regarded as impartiality and fair play. I do not think that any one wili accuse me of saying anything in this' House which could be regarded as being of material assistance to the enemy or injurious to the cause of the Allies. The censorship policy which the Government has adopted may some day reacfr. against those who are now its supporters in this chamber. I can imagine the attitude which the honourable member I'or Batman, if Minister for Information, might, feel inclined to adopt towards the views of any honourable member now sitting opposite. It does not need a wide stretch of imagination to conceive of such a position arising. Why should the Minister for Information be the only judge as to whether the spoken or written word is detrimental to the cause of the Allies? I realize that there should be some system of censorship in the national interest, but it is time that the Minister for Information adopted a more reasonable policy. Apparently his action is supported by the Prime Minister, because complaints such as I am now making [37] have been made for some considerable time. I have no interest in the policy of the Tribune, or any other Communist newspaper; but as an educated individual [ believe that even in time of war we should have the right to read the opinions of others on world-wide problems. The rights which the Labour party exercise to-day are being exercised, not because of any tender feelings which honourable members opposite may have towards us, but because throughout the ages we have fought and obtained those rights by sheer force of weight and by virtue of the cause which we espouse. I suppose a system of censorship prevents the enemy from receiving information which may be detrimental to Great Britain and its Allies, but I cannot understand why a speech which was published in Hansard and circulated throughout Australia cannot appear in any other newspaper. The speech of the Minister for Commerce could also be used to show that he did not believe in the cause for which the Allies are fighting. I trust that the Prime Minister will take immediate step* to ensure that there shall be reasonable liberty for the expression of thought, even during the present strife. support the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) and the"" honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) with respect to the importance of the shipbuilding industry. AlthoughI cannot throw a great deal of light upon this important subject, it must be admitted that the shipbuilding industry is of vital importance to Australia. I understand that the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited is commencing the construction of ships at Whyalla, on Spencer's Gulf, in South Australia. I have also received from Port Pirie a request that ships be built there. Spencer's Gulf provides a natural protection for the carrying on of works; because of its geographical situation, attack by an enemy would be almost impossible. There is, further, the unfortunate situation that our primary products, which provide 92 per cent, of our exports, and pay for the whole of our imports, in addition to our other overseas costs, are not moving away from our shores speedily enough, but are",49,Imperial Force Control The Commonwealth Railways
299,Mr Mchugh (Wakefield) [4.49],"Iaccumulating throughout Australia. Millions of bushels of wheat, millions of gallons of wine, and thousands of tons of fruit are being held up. One of the principal reasons why the Government cannot make a second payment to the wheat growers is that it cannot export the wheat and receive payment for it. We have had placed before us this afternoon the most unfortunate position of Great Britain in regard to its shipbuilding programme. 1 endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), and supplement them by an appeal to the Government, which doubtless realizes the very grave position in which the Allies are placed. I have no illusions in regard to this colossal struggle. It is most importsuch an offer at a bankrupt price, the Broken ant that we should feed our allies with primary products, which we have in abundance. Great Britain gave, shipbuilding contracts to Norway and other countries, which are now held by the enemy. Apart from finance and man-power, the most important matter in this war. at the moment is to approve of a vigorous and extensive programme of shipbuilding. The Labour party would have the work carried out by the nation., for the benefit of the nation. If the Government will not itself embark upon the undertaking, it. should at least approve of plans that will enable the programme to be speeded up. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has clearly shown., not one hour should be lost, have no desire unduly to harass the Government in regard to the wheat industry, but the position is so very critical to thousands of men engaged in that industry that I am again constrained to raise the matter on the motion for the adournment of tlie House this afternoon. Every mail that i receive brings me further evidence of the straitened circumstances of the wheat-growers. Their morale is rapidly deteriorating. statement, I that I have received to-day, some cognizance of which I hope will be taken by the Prime Minister( Mr steel magnates and armament firms know no Menzies), hecause it will indicate to him and the Government the psychology that is developing among the wheat-growers of Australia. This is not an isolated case; I have met men in many areas of the wheat belt who are giving expression to similar views. The letter makes the following statements:If tlio wheat-grower has any backbone at all, or any dignity left, he cannot fail to rebel against such intolerable conditions, such rank injustice and such economic tyranny. Where is this much boasted democratic freedom, that allows even the possibility of such a deal as will bo handed out by this Government-appointed Wheat Acquisition Board with one solitary wheat-grower included? No other section of the community would tolerate it for a moment. Labour docs not hesitate to strike for its rights, even in war-time-e.g. , Darwin defence works, and the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited would unconditionally and emphatically refuse such terms as cited above. If the Government persisted in H ill Proprietary Company Limited would close down immediately. I pass on to another statementI might also mention that Mr Menzies pro mised satisfaction by August, and that lie would not leave it t ill October or November, a.nd I may as well also mention that only yesterday Lord Halifax informed us that B r i tain WJIS fighting a war (which may involve millions of lives and hundreds of millions of pounds) against German Huns on account of the disregard of pledged words (so that it is apparent to Australian wheat-growers that all Huns do not reside in Germany) and I say that if that is sufficient ground for a war in Europe, then we have often had equally good grounds for a war in Australia. The writer goes on to sayBefore long the wheat-grower will enlist to escape voluntarily; he w ill be free of the tyranny of wheat-growing, he w i ll be fighting tor freedom, he w ill take a well-earned holiday on certain pay, food and lodgings supplied gratis, in the front trenches in Europe, ho, will have escaped from the much boasted British justice asexemplified in Australia, which demands of the farmer a much higher standard of patriotism than from other classes of the community, demands that he should produce and sell his goods at a loss, after working long hours, taking all the risks with the elements, in producing the necessities of life, while the remainder of the community demands shorter hom-s, a higher standard of livin g and costs of production or services plus a profit. ,What is patriotism?

The Federal Government has done, and is, therefore, still continuing to do, its best the facts to which I have referred and to avoid being dubbed unpatriotic on that score. L"" think I have quoted sufficient from this lengthy letter to indicate to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) the attitude of mind that is developing among some of tbe wheat-growers of Australia who are in a desperate plight. This industry has been declining for many years. The wheat-growers looked to this Government for .some years to take some definite steps to improve the position, but very little has been done. The urgent need at the moment, I point out to the Prime Minister, is the payment of another advance in respect of the wheat in the No. 2 Wheat Pool. Unless some action in this regard be taken, I venture to say that at the forthcoming general elections, despite all the flag-waving and special pleading on that score, the wheat-growers will endeavour to elect a .different .government in the hope that their conditions may bo improved. I sincerely trust that within the next week or two another payment will be made in respect of the No. 2 Wheat Pool. should have had no occasion to speak to-day had a letter which I forwarded to the former Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr John Lawson) last December been given the consideration to which it was entitled. The subject to which it referred was fuel-oil supplies, which, honourable members will appreciate, is of considerable significance to wheat-growers. Fuel-oil is essential to modern power-tractors. As honourable members know, the diesel engine plays an important part in farming life to-day. I point out that between December, 1937, and December, 1939, when the letter to which I have referred was written, four increases of price were made in respect of fuel-oil. During the Spanish war the price rose 10s. a ton in two rises of 5s. each; later there was a further rise of Â£1 a ton. The increase of 10s. a ton which caused my constituent to write to ino came into force on the 29th December, 1939. Fuel-oil which, in 1937, was Â£5 a ton at Fremantle is now Â£7 15s. a ton. The letter which I forwarded to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and which he returned to me with his compliments but no other comment, recites points out the difficulty which these price increases are causing to farmers. My correspondent saidPractically all the fuel-oil used in Australia comes from Borneo, so where is the extra cost? We can understand, of course, that some shipping difficulties may be facing the producers and shippers at present, but I can see no justification whatsoever for such a heavy increase as has occurred. [ urge that this whole subject be referred to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner (Professor 'Copland) for immediate inquiry and report. I shall bring the subject under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs again by letter, and trust that some adequate explanation will be forthcoming in respect of the increases, or that action will be taken to reduce the price of this commodity to a reasonable figure.",51,Imperial Force Control The Commonwealth Railways

Honourable members will realize that I do not pretend to be familiar with tlie detailed work of the censors, and it will be understood that I am not able, at this stage, to give any reason for the deletions to which specific attention has been directed, though I have no doubt that an adequate reason will be forthcoming. When I received the communication from the honourable member for BourkeI had every intention to discuss the matter personally with my colleague who is responsible for the censorship. As honourable members know, it has not been possible during the last few days to confer with the Minister for Information ( Sir Henry Gullett) because, unfortunately, he has been indisposed. I have brought the cases to his attention, and I propose as .soon as possible to discuss the matter with in Australia.

From the time that the troops sailed from their Australian port, their ships have been guarded by British, French and Australian warships. It should be mentioned, too, that the Royal Australian A ir Force watched over the convoy for long stages of the voyage.

Whether agreeably with the appropriation of part of the war-time increment on gold it is proposed to apply the same principle to :copper, zinc, and lead; if not, will he state the reasons for the discrimination? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. The prices of the commodities mentioned, excluding gold, are subject to the vagaries of world supply and demand. On the other hand there is no world demand for the purchase of gold and its price for all general purposes is fixed by the Government of the United States of America only. So far as Australia is concerned the price of gold was increased merely as the result of the variation of the exchange rate between London and New York. The profits arising from trading in commodities such as copper, zinc and lead are subject to taxation either in the hands of companies or individuals and it is not proposed to alter this system. The increase of the price of gold was of a different character and accordingly the tax on gold bears a direct relationship to the war increase of its price. It is not proposed to alter the principle of the gold tax. honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) addressed a question to me regarding the effect of the Capital Issues Regulations as regards the limitation of interest both future issues. In reply, I desire to inform the honourable member that the regulations as at present framed do not directly impose any limitation upon the rate of interest except in respect of .advances made by banks, existing mortgages or charges which may be renewed, and unsecured loans and deposits. They form part of the Government's constructive programme for consolidating the economic and financial resources of the country. Amongst the various objects which the Government has in view is the maintenance of low interest rates. As one of the means of securing this end, it is provided in the Capital Issues Regulations that all persons desiring to raise capital or to issue securities for borrowed money outside certain specified limits, shall first secure my consent. This consent may be granted subject to such conditions as it is found necessary ro impose. A usual requirement is that the interest payable on a fixed interest bearing security shall be in conformity with the standard which it is thought should apply to that class of security. Limitations have, therefore, been imposed in certain cases. This policy has been attended with some measure of success. The rates of interest payable on loans raised by local authorities and some governmental bodies have been definitely lowered. There has been some resistance to a general lowering of interest rates on mortgages, because certain lending institutions have, I know, been endeavouring to increase their rates, and the statistical evidence shows that the average rate of",54,Censorship Compensation Able Member F O R Cook Mr Sheehan
