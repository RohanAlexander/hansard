28,Mr Pratten,"On 28th March,gret that my first act as the newly appointed Leader of the Opposition must be to support a Government bill, but I promise to make amends later. to give effect, as the Minister for Markets( Mr Paterson) explained when introducing it, to the wishes of the States that are producing dried fruits, and as such it meets with the support, I think, of all honourable members. A situation arose in the fruit-growing districts that has been explained on many previous occasions. We have had for some time a surplus of dried fruits because of the extension of soldier settlements. About 80 per cent, of those fruits has to be exported because the Australian market absorbs only 20 per cent, of the production. is profitable while the export market is unprofitable, and to ensure a fair proportion of each grower's pack being exported, the States set up boards to control the marketing of dried fruits both in Australia and abroad. Everything progressed satisfactorily in the States concerned-South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. Those States fixed quotas for export, and legislated to provide for the confiscation of supplies should that be needed to regulate the market. But an appeal in South Australia to the High Court alleging the unconstitutionality of the action of the States was made and upheld. The arrangement come to by the States was quite reasonable. As SO per cent, of our dried fruits has to be exported, it would obviously be unfair to allow some growers to market the whole 'of their produce in Australia, thus forcing others to export more than their fair proportion to the unprofitable market abroad. Some growers have asked why there should be any interference with the marketing of their produce, but I would point out to them that there has for many years been interference in the form of a high protective tariff, which has considerably benefited the growers of dried fruits in this country. I claim therefore, that it is reasonable to ensure by legislation to each grower his fair share of the profitable Australian market. I do not anticipate any opposition to the bill from honourable members. The Development and Migration Commission made an investigation into the industry, and in its report it urged that the Commonwealth Thi3 is a simple measure and States should co-operate in passing legislation to give power to boards to regulate the marketing of dried fruits in Australia and abroad. The only question is whether the Minister for Markets and the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) are satisfied that there is constitutional power to do what we are now proceeding to do under this measure. I do not pretend to be a constitutional authority, but I have more than a doubt on the subject. It would be a mistake to pass legislation only to have it challenged, because we can be well assured that the gentlemen who tested the law .in South Australia will The Australian market test it again against the Commonwealth Government. We should make sure that we have the power to carry out the provisions of this 'measure. It has beeu made manifest on numerous occasions that the Commonwealth Parliament has not the power to enact much of the legislation required in the interests of the people of Australia. If there is a doubt about the constitutionality of this measure, we should frankly say so and ask for an extension of our powers. Hitherto the State authorities have been opposed to extending the powers of the Commonwealth, but in this case the State authorities have asked for our assistance. The Commonwealth Parliament is severely handicapped through lack of constitutional power in regard to this and other matters. The straightforward and most satisfactory course to pursue would be for the Government to make reasonably sure of the constitutional position, and if it believes that we have not the power to pass legislation of this description, to admit it. It should then ask the people to clothe it with greater power. It is unsatisfactory for us to have to defend our legislation in the law courts. Ministers are responsible for the introduction of legislation, and, as I believe that if a measure of this description could be constitutionally administered it would be beneficial to the industry, I intend to support the bill.",16,Paterson
29,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [2.45],"I reappreciate the novel method the Government has adopted to deal with the difficult subject of interstate trade. I trust that this bill will be passed, and that it will have the desired effect on the dried fruits industry. My main purpose in participating in the debate is to ask the Minister for Markets( Mr Paterson) a question in relation to the butter industry. Great difficulty is experienced in the interstate marketing of butter. Arrangements have been completed for the orderly marketing of our butter and cheese with the States, and by means of the Dairy Export Control Board overseas. Conditions in interstate markets are often chaotic. The local market is undermined for our producers by reason of butter from one State being sent to another State to meet periods of excess production in one State and temporary shortage in another. This .has a particularly detrimental effect upon the Queensland butter industry. The situation there at present is that we are forced to export overseas a box of butter for every box that we obtain from another State. As the price realized for butter oversea is considerably less than that realized for butter sold locally, our producers are consequently at a considerable disadvantage when butter is imported into Queensland from another State. The price of butter is lower oversea in consequence of the competition which we have to face from foreign producers. As a matter of fact, the price obtained for butter sold overseas has a considerable effect upon the price of butter locally. What this industry needs is an organization to ensure orderly marketing of butter and cheese sold interstate. should like the Minister for Markets to give me an assurance that if the Government finds this a successful method of dealing with interstate trade in the dried fruits industry, it will apply it to the butter industry, if invited to do so by the butter and cheese organizations in the Commonwealth. I am not prepared to discuss this subject at length, but I approve of the introduction of the bill. The history of the dried fruits industry has been very interesting. Although there was a protective duty [101] years ago, the lack of organization among the growers rendered it ineffective. The growers, acting upon the individualistic principle of "" every man for himself,"" grew their fruit and hawked it around while the buyers stood off, played one grower against another, and eventually bought the fruit for prices far below its real value. The industry passed from that phase when the Australian Dried Fruits Association was formed, and became probably the best example of organized primary industry that we have. Although the association has always been supported by an overwhelming majority of the fruit-growers, a section of them, known as outsiders, did not participate in its operations. To obtain an advantage for themselves, they were prepared to sacrifice the interests of their fellow-growers. It is well known that the Australian price for dried fruits is usually higher than the price oversea, and the outsiders have consistently exploited the local market and refused to take their share in the export trade. We had during the war an interesting illustration of the rapacity of these persons. For a time the price of dried fruits oversea was higher than the price in Australia. I take this opportunity of saying that it is to the credit of the local dried fruits industry that prices were not increased here during the war as they might have been. The growers, by voluntary action, kept the price in Australia down to about £80 per ton, while the price oversea reached as high as £120 per ton. The outsiders deserve no credit for this, for just as they endeavour to sell the whole of their products locally while the price is higher I in Australia, so they endeavoured to ex""port the whole of their output while the price was higher oversea. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has said, there is great necessity for complete federal control of this industry. I recognize that the Government has only limited powers in this regard. When we were discussing the referendum proposals prior to the last election, I urged the Government to seek an increase in its power over primary industries, but unfortunately it did not do so: I urge now that at the earliest possible opportunity it should request the people",17,Paterson

The growers have to contend with not only uncertainty of prices in the world's markets, but also uncertainty in climatic conditions. On the other hand, their costs of production are fixed. A grower with 10 acres of orchard has to dispose of 8 acres of his crop in the world's markets; but he is compelled to pay Arbitration Court awards, not only to the fruitpickers but also to the men employed to do ploughing, pruning, and all other work connected with the whole orchard. The grower receives a guaranteed price for the 2 acres of his fruit that is marketed locally; but he has to take what he can get for that from the remaining 8 acres. That seems to me most unfair. At a recent deputation I asked the Minister for Markets what would be the position of the grower if, after he had had the benefit of the work of the Export Control Board, and all the Government advertising and other assistance, he still received less for his fruit than the cost of production. The Minister replied that he would have to "" face the music."" That, I think, was a rather callous statement, and the growers of dried fruits rather resent it. They would not complain so much if similar treatment was accorded other industries in their requests for assistance. If it be,the policy of the Government to tell these growers, who are compelled to market 80 per cent, of their crop in competition with the produce of the cheap labour of Mediterranean countries and who pay the highest ocean freights and the highest production costs in the world, that they have to "" face the music,"" it is anything but fair. ister is calling the tune. tunes. dered grower scarcely knows where he this and similar legislation in recent years stands.

Returned The old system of individual marketing has gone for all time. On every hand there is a clamour for compulsory pools. Whatever may be said regarding voluntary co-operation, it is undeniable that it is beyond the power of any human being to evolve a system of marketing, whether it be of dried fruits, wheat, butter, or any other product, that will be accepted voluntarily by every person engaged in the industry. The sooner we face that fact, the better. There is an urgent necessity for complete federal control and the scrapping of the system under which five or six State acts of Parliament are superimposed upon Federal acts. I again stress the point that has been repeatedly made by returned soldier settlers, the Australian Dried Fruits Association, and others who are engaged in the industry, that an immediate investigation should be made into the claim for the payment of an export bounty upon dried fruits sufficient to wipe out the difference that now exists between the cost of production and the prices which are received in the markets of the world. The bill has my wholehearted support. agree with some of the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), and disagree with others. This bill has been introduced with the object of assisting in the disposal of the dried fruits produced in the States of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government proposes that no grower in any of those States shall sell his product in another State. this action, because I am totally opposed to government interference with any industry. asked for by the States. but I contend that they should rely upon enable all primary industries duction.

As the honourable member for Wimmera has said, it costs £120 to produce £100 worth of dried fruits. Awards of the Arbitration Court and other conditions which have been imposed by'different governments have had the effect of raising the cost of production. Before the Minister for Markets( Mr Paterson) gained his present position, he initiated a voluntary butter pool, which increased the price of butter to the consumer by 3d. a lb. The cost of living is continually advancing, and the natural result is an upward trend in the wages bill. One is led to wonder where all this will end. The honourable member for Wimmera has advocated the payment of a bounty to the dried-fruits growers. I agree with him that if the Government, the cost of production the growers should be assisted by way of a bounty. I have in my electorate the dried apple industry, the condition of which was brought to the notice of the Development and Migration Commission. The chairman of the commission sent his officers to Tasmania to investigate the industry, and subsequently paid a personal visit during which he obtained all the information which was available regarding the cost of production, and the prices obtained in London. At a meeting which he held with representatives of the growers he said "" Do you think that if we were to assist you this industry could be made to pay?"" I was present at the meeting, and I answered that it could be made to pay if it were assisted as had been the canned fruit, the dried fruit, tbe butter, aud many other industries. At the present time only Tasmanian dried applies are being marketed in Australia, aaid the Government expert has stated that they are as good as the dried applies which are produced in any other part of the world. Yet the Development and Migration Commission have stated that they cannot see their way to recommend to Mr Seabrook. the Government the granting of a bounty of Id. or 2d. a lb.!

He is discussing a recommendation of the Development and Migration Commission. ing to show the difference between the dried fruits that are produced in Tasmania and those that are produced in other parts of Australia. only with trade and commerce with other countries and among the States in certain specified dried fruits. a bounty be paid with respect to the dried apples that are produced in Tasmania. I cannot see why I should be debarred from bringing that matter before the Minister. member may show how the bill can be extended to other industries. and Migration Commission has refused by legislation, increases to recommend a bounty for this industry, and says that it cannot be stabilized, but it has never been given a fair trial.' In regard to the bill itself, as I do not believe in Government interference with private industry, I shall on principle vote against the second reading. -The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) seems inclined to conduct a vigorous campaign on behalf of the apple industry, but he offered a good deal of opposition to a proposal for a compulsory pool, which would have helped the industry considerably. This bill embodies the principle of compulsion. It is amusing to find the Government, which on occasions has held up its hands in holy horror at proposals for compulsion, now introducing that very principle in this bill, which, in effect, tells the producers of dried fruits how and where they shall dispose of their produce. I believe in what is proposed, but it is another instance of the many inconsistencies of the Government. We have been told that this legislation is necessary because some individual or individuals challenged the legality of a State Government's operations in this field, and I agree with the Leader of the",20,Paterson

51,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [3.21].,"Opposition that interested individuals will probably endeavour to upset Commonwealth legislation on the subject also. I hope that a test case will be taken to the High Court. I do not presume to anticipate the judgment of the highest tribunal in the land on a point of constitutional law, but, having regard to the present personnel of the High Court bench, and expressions of opinion by eminent lawyers, I believe that legislation by this Parliament upon this and other specific matters will be held to be constitutional. No doubt ""the Minister will assure us that the Government is strenuously endeavoring to induce the British people to take increasing quantities of our exportable products. We all are aware of the obstacles that confront us, Spain, Italy, Greece and other southern European countries are amongst the greatest suppliers of dried fruits to the United Kingdom, and their products are able to compete successfully against Australian products, mainly because of the cheaj) labour they employ, and partly because of the considerable amount of British capital invested in their industries. We shall have little hope of making headway in the markets of the United Kingdom, until the British Government is prepared to grant-as it has often professed itself willing to dosuch protection to Empire products as will almost exclude the commodities of .our cheap labour competitors. It is true that the Old Country gives us a generous measure of assistance in connection with most of our exportable products; the British market is our best, but it is also per cent, of our products in Ausa very fine market for foreign countries in which lower standards of living and longer hours of labour prevail. We desire for our fruit-growers and other rural producers, reasonable hours of labour and a fair return for their energies, but we shall have little chance of extending the dried fruits industry, and also maintaining those conditions unless we hold in the British market. Having regard to the fact that Britain requires annually £400,000,000 worth of foodstuffs in excess of what she produces, it is obvious that the finest market open to us is that among the 45,000,000 people of our own kith and kin in the United Kingdom. Whilst we are grateful for what the Old Country is doing to foster the sale of our primary products, we believe that much more could be done. Australia buys £70,000,000 worth of British goods each year, and, in view of that generous support of British workmen and industries, it is fair to ask the people in the United Kingdom to give a greater measure of patronage to our primary products. In regard to wool, we need no assistance. It is true that some growers are hinting that the day is not far distant when a bounty on wool exports will be necessary, but that view is unduly pessimistic. All tbe information one can gain is to the effect that competitors with Australian wool producers are far behind them in regard to both quantity and quality, and I am confident that for many years to come our wool-growers have little to fear from the competition of other parts of the world. The dried-fruits industry is in a different category. A few years ago it was remarkably prosperous, and was regarded as almost a close corporation. The producers at Mildura, Benmark, and other centres, were able to dictate the prices to be paid by Australian consumers, and the output was not much more than sufficient to meet the local demand; but in recent years the industry has expanded considerably. Many returned soldiers were told of the wonderful successes achieved at the irrigation settlements, and were encouraged by Commonwealth and State Governments to engage in the production of dried fruits. The result has been that instead of selling 80 tralia, and exporting the balance, the local market is able to absorb only 20 per cent, of the present increased production, leaving SO per cent, to be sold abroad. That position is. very serious. Whether the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) would relieve the producers of dried fruits, I cannot say; but I am can obtain a greater footstrongly of the opinion that unless, through the good offices of the British Government we can induce the people in the United Kingdom to give us greater tariff assistance, there will be little opportunity to extend our trade in these commodities. I hope that the Ministry will continue to negotiate with the Imperial Government for better conditions, so that at DO distant date the British dried fruits there, the position of the market, which is now almost flooded with me products of the cheap-labour countries bordering the Mediterranean, will be almost monopolized by Australian fruits. If we could induce the British Parliament to place an embargo on the imports from cheap-labour countries, Australia could easily dispose of the whole of its surplus dried fruits in the United Kingdom. Great Britain opposed to the principle of granting preference to dominion products ? party in British politics which is trying to get at the kernel of this matter. I do not say that the British Labour party as a whole has adopted this policy, but certainly some of its most prominent members believe that Great Britain should no longer -encourage the production of foodstuffs for its market by cheap labour, and under conditions that are not ""in conformity with advanced sociological opinion. Groom) -Order! This bill deals primarily with overseas and interstate trade in certain dried fruits, and the honourable member is not in order in comparing the policies of rival political parties in the United Kingdom. British market will be the salvation of our dried-fruits industry. The Australian market is already well supplied at reasonable prices. The effect of this bill will be because the Minister, in his second-readto make every grower accept a fair proportion of the less profitable export trade. That is fair, and the principle will be approved by 95 per cent, of the growers. But others, in the absence of compelling legislation, would refuse to take the risk of competition in the overseas market, and would endeavour to dispose of the whole of their products in the more favorable home market. Because of tha possibility of a selfish minority acting in this way, compulsion is necessary. It is the right thing to do. By that compulsion there is an opportunity for a fair deal being given to the producers of dried fruits. I believe that the honourable member for Wimmera will agree that unless we make greater inroads into the British market and dispose of more of our industry here will become very perilous indeed. , greater percentage of the products of Great Britain, that country will take more of ours. that Great Britain requires to import a considerable quantity of food-stuffs every year. export to pay for its imports. must import food-stuffs. The balance of trade is considerably in its favour, and therefore it should be prepared to absorb periodically the whole of our dried fruits. Unfortunately, we have as our competitors a considerable number of British capitalists, who have invested in the dried fruits industries of foreign countries, and are making huge profits because of the employment of cheap labour. Notwithstanding that, there should be a big effort made by us to obtain a greater share of the British market, and to receive more consideration from Great Britain because therein, to a great extent, lies the salvation of our dried fruits industry. I support the bill, and I hope that under its provisions the growers will benefit more than they anticipate at present.

In addition, the inquiries regarding dried fruits generally were made by the honourable John Gunn, a former Labour Premier of South Australia. I know that gentleman, and am aware that he is a man of ability, but there is no reason why I should be governed by his views on the dried fruits industry, since they are likely to be largely affected by his socialistic opinions, which are well known. During the last four years a considerable number of acts relating to dried fruits have been passed by one parliament or another. The Commonwealth Control Board was established in 1924, and the State Governments commenced to appoint boards in the same year. This bill has been introduced, apparently, to overcome a difficulty that has' arisen under the operation of a series of acts of parliament, and, as I have said before, it is understood that a more far-reaching bill will be introduced later, giving effect to the recommendation of the Development and Migration Commission to eliminate a great many of the packing sheds. I mention these things to show that with the establishment and growth of control boards, compulsion gets closer and closer, and government control of the industry becomes greater and greater, until, as the Minister said in his second-reading speech, the chain is complete. I should think that by the time the chain is complete the unfortunate victim will be throttled. At any rate, we are approaching what appears to me to be an entirely untenable position. I disagree entirely with the statement' of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) that there has been constant satisfaction with the boards of control. He is entitled to speak for his own district; but there are other districts in which dried fruits are produced, and my own belief is that boards of control are becoming the reverse of popular. At times I live in a district which is producing a considerable quantity of dried fruit, and I know that during the last few years, while the works of the board of control nave been increasing, the dissatisfaction of the producers has been growing. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook), the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Bodgers), and myself, when legislation dealing with the control of fresh fruits was before this House last year, expressed our opposition to the proposal, and the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) suggested by , interjection that Tasmania would very likely reject the proposal altogether.' Generally, it was assumed by honourable members that the pool would be accepted with avidity by the fresh fruit producers. However, the vote was heavily against the establishment of a control board for the apple and pear industry. posal was rejected by a considerable majority. That indicates that in this country there is great doubt whether these control boards serve the purposes for which they are established. One reason for that is that since the boards have been operating regulations have been framed very freely. I have constantly received regulations relating to the dried fruits industry, and however intelligible or otherwise they may be to me, I am certain that to many of the growers they are perfectly unintelligible. The provisions of the bill appear to be somewhat drastic. For a breach of clause 3 there is to be a fine of £100, or imprisonment for six months. That is a fairly heavy punishment to give any man who carries his dried fruits out of one State to another, although he may live just at the border, without getting a formal licence issued by what is called a "" prescribed authority."" Sub-clause 3 of that clause provides that any dried fruits which have been, or are in process of being, carried in contravention of this measure shall be forfeited to the King. I read that sub-clause as having a retrospective effect, and applying to any dried fruits that have been carried from one State to another before the passing of this legislation, which, in consequence, will be forfeited to the King. In that event that provision will operate in the case which has been determined by the court, and determined in such",23,Paterson

The point has been raised whether the provisions of this b ill are constitutional. The Ministeri n introducing the measure The honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers) said by interjection "" There cannot be uniformity if the industry does not exist in all the States. The Minister replied "" There can be uniformity of a kind, I think, to satisfy the provisions of section 99."" That seems to indicate that there is good reason to doubt whether a measure of this description can be legally administered. It appears inevitable that if the. bill is passed its validity w ill be tested in the court. . The fact that different quotas of sultanas for home sale have been'laid down for different States must also be taken into tionality of the measure.

The Minister also saidPolls have been taken not only throughout the Commonwealth in connection with the Commonwealth export control board but by If such muddles do each of the State boards, and these show that a substantial majority of the producers are in favour of the scheme.

The Minister also saidThe control proposed to be exercised in this way will be undertaken substantially by which the Minister desires to make the producers themselves. I venture to question the accuracy of that statement. If honourable members will refer to the principal act they will see that it provided for the setting up of a federal board of seven members, one of whom was to be elected by the Governor General as the representative of the Commonwealth Government, three by the growers of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, one by the growers of Western Australia, and the remaining two, who were to be men of commercial experience, were to be appointed by the Governor General. growers. think that a provision of that kind appears in the act. fact. be the case; but there is nothing to that effect in the act. Since the Minister takes the point, I ask him who were the producers that requested that two gentlemen of commercial experience should be appointed? I do not know who the two commercial appointees are, and I am not making any attack upon them. ablest commercial men in Melbourne, and men of very high standing. the better; but what producers asked that they should be appointed ? There was no general power in the producers to request such an appointment. may be satisfied that the board represents the wishes of the producers, but it is by no means clear that, as a whole, it represents the producers. Although four of its members are definitely appointed by the fruit-growers, the remaining three may never have grown any fruit. The Minister also saidThis industry is very -efficiently organized for the purposes of marketing. Seeing that it has such a big measure of Government control behind it, it would be indeed strange if it we're not strongly organized. I regard this bill as an additional, though by no means the most important link, in the chain complete. I know a little about the dried fruits industry, and something of the difficulties which it has experienced for several years, but I do not regard the general system of Government control to which it is being subjected at present as being likely ultimately to benefit it or the growers and, therefore, like the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) I consider that the bill should be opposed.

At a this legislation. In order to appreciate the power Company versus the State of New South this Parliament has to deal with Wales, reported in volume 21 of Comthis matter, it is necessary to examine monwealth Law Reports, at page 357, section 92 of the Constitution. orable members are aware that one of declared that all stock and meat in New the objects of federation was to remove South Wales should become and remain, customs barriers between the States, and subject of the Act, and be "" held for the thus introduce a system of interstate freepurposes of, and kept, for the disposal of trade within the Commonwealth.'

On the imposition of uniform duties of trade commerce and intercourse empowered the State authorities to aclater date, the case of Foggitt Jones and Honwas decided. A New South Wales Act aid of the supplies for His Majesty's armies in the present war."" It further provided that "" forthwith, upon the making of any order in writing under the hand of the Minister, all stock and meat mentioned in such order shall cease to be the property of the then owner or owners thereof, and shall become and remain the absolute property of His Majesty."" There were also consequential provisions. It was held by four justices of the High Court, a fifth justice expressing a doubt, of disposition, it was held to be that this act, in so far as it purported to authorize the Government of New South ""Wales to prevent the interstate carriage of meat and stock, was an interference with interstate trade and commerce, and was invalid as being an infringement of section 92 of the Constitution. The next case arose under a Queensland Act, and in almost identical circumstances. That was the case of Duncan versus the State of Queensland and another, reported in volume 22 of the Commonwealth Law Report, page 556. The Queensland Act was substantially in the same terms as the New South Wales Act, which, as I have said, was held to be invalid. The Queensland Act was held by five justices to be valid, though two justices were of opinion that it was invalid, and the decision in the Foggitt Jones case was therefore overruled. It was held that, although the Queensland Act Undoubtedly interfered with and prevented the interstate transport of meat, and stock, yet the act was not invalid, because the Government had the power to deal with the incidents of property in goods. One of the incidents of property was the power to send or sell interstate, and. it was able, by aptly framed legislation, to denude the owner of this attribute of property, and authorize the acquisition by and vesting in the State of the right to prevent the owner from sending his goods across the border. cases to which I have referred arose under State, not under federal, legislation, and the consideration of their validity was not in any way associated with the defence power of the Commonwealth. war purposes. passed for war purposes; but I have indicated the reasoning upon which the decisions were based. In the last case, there was a distinction between dealing with the rights of property and dealing with the rights of trade. If a State likes to legislate with respect to even a single incident of property, that able to do so by withdrawing commodities from the sphere of trade. In 1920, the case of W. and A. McArthur Limited versus the State of Queensland and others was decided. It is reported in 28 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 530. This case arose under a Queensland price-fixing act which' made it an offence to sell any commodity for a price other than that fixed in pursuance of that legislation. McArthur and Company, a well-known Sydney company, carried -on business io Queensland through travellers, who sold at prices in excess of those fixed by the Queensland legislation. Some of the contracts were made between Sydney and Brisbane, and some involved the transport of goods from Sydney to Brisbane in satisfaction of contracts. Accordingly, the question of interference with interstate trade was raised. In this case, four justices, two others dissenting, held that the Foggit Jones case had been wrongly over-ruled, and had been rightly decided. Certain of the justices also held that the last case to which I have referred-Duncan versus the State of Queensland-whic h had overruled the Foggit Jones case, had been wrongly decided. Therefore the position now is that by majorities varying in degree and extent, the Foggit Jones case was first decided and then over-ruled by the Duncan case. Then Duncan's case was over-ruled, and the Foggit Jones case was reinstated. Honourable members will, accordingly, realize that I am speaking on sure ground when I say that it is certain that there is a considerable degree of uncertainty about the legal position, but so long as the last decision is maintained as being the law-and , apparently, the law is settled by the latest decision, and by the",26,Paterson

In that case it was held, to put it shortly, that a State had no power to fix the .price of interstate sales. Dealing with the words "" absolutely free,"" in section 92, the majority justices saidThe .primary meaning of these words used as they are with reference to governmental control, is that the subject matter of which they are predicated is to be "" absolutely free "" us, notwithstanding dicta in previous cases, fro m all governmental control by every governmental' authority to whom the command contained in the section is addressed. There is, therefore, to be no governmental authority exercised, over interstate trade and commerce, by any governmental authority to whom section 92 is addressed. It is necessary in order to follow the reasons upon which the decision is based to consider another provision of the Constitution. provides that interstate trade shall be absolutely free, but it also provides under section 51 that this Parliament shall have power to legislate with respect to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. Honourable members will, therefore, at once see what the problem was that presented itself to the high court. How can interstate trade and commerce at once be absolutely free, and at the same time a subject for legislation by the. Commonwealth Parliament ? Most legislation imposes some form of restriction. It is conceivable, however, that legislation may not impose any form of restriction or restraint. Legislation may be entirely empowering and permissive; but even such legislation generally imposes a restraint upon acts outside the power and beyond the permission contemplated by the legislation. It is, therefore, very difficult to formulate in one's mind a coherent system of ideas that will leave acts of trade and commerce at once absolutely free, and also as full a subject for legislation by the Commonwealth as are the other subjects mentioned in section 51 of the Constitution. A solution of the difficulty was discovered by the High Court in the McArthur case, and it is upon the principle enunciated by the High Court in that decision that the bill now presented to the House relies. The High Court decided that section 92 was a prohibition Mr Latham. addressed not to the Commonwealth, or the Commonwealth Parliament, but to the States and to State activities. At page 556 of the report, in the majority judgment, the inquiry "" Is the Commonwealth bound by section 92?"" is answered in the following way:The present case has involved a closer examination of this question than any previous occasion upon which the courthas considered it. The result has been to convince that the true office of section 92 is to protect interstate trade against State interference and not to affect the legislative power of the Commonwealth. That is the latest and the ruling decision upon this matter. At the time when it was given it occasioned very great surprise to many persons who were interested in the subject. If honourable members are sufficiently interested in the conflict of opinions they will find them The Constitution not only expressed in the arguments used by counsel before the court, which include some highly admirable arguments of my own. with those which the Attorney-General is now using? mitting arguments; but merely expounding the law as contained in the judgment of the court. I hope that I have indicated clearly to honourable members the basis of that decision. It is difficult to see in what way this Parliament could legislate with respect to interstate trade if that trade were to be absolutely free in the sense that it was free from interference, control or regulation by this Parliament. The law so expounded entitles this Parliament to legislate upon the subject of interstate trade. In order to illustrate the position J may say that under the decision to which I have just referred, it is, apparently, within the power of this Parliament again to impose border duties in Australia, provided there is no discrimination against, and no preference to, any State or part of a State. were uniform. been drawn between "" uniformity"" and ""no preference,"" though possibly they amount substantially to the same thing.

Before the decision in the McArthur case I venture to think that this legislation would not have been suggested; but after that decision had been given the position was entirely changed from what it had been understood to be, not only among legislators and the public generally, but also among members of the legal profession who were particularly interested in this subject. This bill is founded upon the entirely proper assumption, which this Parliament is entitled to make, that the law, as expounded in the McArthur case, sets out the true position, so that this Parliament is entitled to legislate with respect to the carriage of dried fruits from one State to another when that carriage falls under the head of trade and commerce among the States; that it is within the power of this Parliament to require a licence to be taken out as a condition precedent to such transport being allowed, and that penalties can be imposed for a breach of the conditions of the licence and upon the act of carrying without a licence. tion still apply? Constitution readsThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law-or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. That is a very difficult provision to interpret. It has been examined in the High Court, I think, on only two occasions. They were in connection with differentiating awards made by the Arbitration Court, and in the Cameron case, under the income tax law. In the case that arose under the Arbitration Act a distinction was drawn between conditions which were imposed by the law itself and those which arose out of the different circumstances to which the law was applied. I do not feel able to give with respect to that section information along the lines that I have endeavoured to follow in relation to section 92. In the case of the latter I have sought to place before the House a connected and coherent account of the development of judicial opinion, and to show that -we have reached a stage at which the law is clear. I agree that this legislation must be carefully administered and that the regulations made under the act must be so framed as not to' contravene section 99 of the Constitution. So far as I can see, the bill does not in any way infringe that section. It is perfectly general in its terms, and does not discriminate between States or parts of States, or give preference to any State or part thereof. for the Commonwealth to take the action proposed by the bill without the concurrence or in defiance of the wishes of a State? such action as this were taken witnout the concurrence of the States it would be a "" one-legged horse.""

This tricate nature of the subject, honourable members were entitled to an exposition of the legal questions involved. wish first of all to congratulate the Minister( Mr Paterson) upon his complete and very desirable reversal of form. Dried Fruits Control Board was The other day he introduced to this House a bill that was almost unanimously disapproved of by the growers in an industry which is closely allied to the dried has quoted various judgments of the High fruits industry. To-day he is in charge of a bill which has the almost unanimous approval of the growers of dried fruits. Reference was made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) to the desirability of Great Britain making such greater provision in her preferences as would lead to her importing more of our dried fruits and other products. I remind that honourable ""member that we enjoy our present preferences in spite of, not because of, any interest which was taken in the Australian primary producer by the Labour Government in Great Britain. The honourable memreferred to the polls that have been taken in connection with the marketing of fresh fruits. There is a distinct difference between that case and this. relation to apple and pear control resulted in a defeat of the proposals, the principles of this bill, and the control of the dried fruits industry, have received the approval of a large majority of the growers oh several occasions. and in other ways. There has been a good deal of trouble, if I may so term it, in connection with the dried fruits industry; but the operations of the Dried Fruits Control Board have now reached a stage at which the growers are receiving great benefit. When the board first took control of the industry some mistakes were made, as was only to be expected; but as the result of experience during the first year of its operations, when, for instance, fruit was held too long in London and had to be sold at a loss, the position is now much better. There has been a good deal of post-war It is easy to be wise after the event; and planting, for which this Parliament ancl the board has undoubtedly profited by the experience, and during the last two years there has been an improvement in prices obtained by the growers as the result of measure has been introduced to make completely effective the legislation passed by State governments, and had it not been for a rather unfortunate case in South Australia, there would probably have been no necessity for it. Up to that time the operating effectively. We have just had a long exposition of the law from the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), who Court, which seems to have expressed conflicting opinions. Apparently the High Court has now reached a decision, and we are endeavoring to legislate in the direction in. which the court has ruled. The High Court judgment is interesting in that it proves that the States can effectively control this industry simply by commandeering, by purchasing, the whole of the dried fruits in their respective States. But that is a very cumbersome arrangement, and this legislation seems likely to operate more effectively in the interests of the fruit-growers. I am interested in the measure because I believe it will be of benefit to the growers. consumers ? Whereas the polls taken in same position as now; they pay Australian parity for that portion of the crop which tbey consume. That is only fair, because this Parliament has imposed upon the primary producers some very heavy handicaps in the matter of customs duties, that the profits on the Australian sales will be more equitably distributed. a unique position, inasmuch as 1 represent growers in the old and new fruit growing areas, and also in the non-irrigated and irrigated areas. In the past there has been a sharp difference of opinion between those engaged in fruit growing in the old and new areas, and in the non-irrigated and irrigated lands. the Parliaments of the States, in connection with their repatriation policies, have been largely responsible.

96,Mr Parsons,"Yes. I hold ratherfortunate position, because practically the whole of their crops were disposed of in the Australian market, and had the natural protection of the overseas freight to Australia, as well as a low duty. The position was then completely reversed. The growers on old-established areas found that they were losing their old markets and were being deprived of their livelihood. Naturally, they fought hard against the suggestion of control, and would not become associated with organizations such as the Australian Dried Fruits Association. Generally speaking, those engaged in fruit-growing on the non-irrigated areas and on the older settlements do not now continue their opposition. I took up the matter with an organization of growers in South Australia, which had not come into the control scheme, and which pointed out to me that approximately 600 to 800 tons of currants were coming from Western Australia and were being sold at about i d . a lb. cheaper than the price fixed by the growers in Australia. They maintained that the position was unfair, that the whole of the control should be removed, and that they should sell on the Australian market at any price that they could get. I pointed out that if a few hundred tons of currants coming from Western Australia affected them adversely, the position would be worse if the whole of the Australian fruit crop was thrown on the Australian market. I said that if that were done I doubted very much whether they would get Id. a lbfor their product, and although at the outset they did not agree with my contention, after a certain amount of discussion they admitted that I was right. measure would not have received my benediction had it been framed with the intention of placing the industry under government control, as I believe the more governments keep out of business the better it is for the country. The bill, however, provides for the appointment of a board, the majority of the members of which will consist of growers elected by the growers, who will control their own business. . From what I know of the growers .engaged in this industry I can say that they are quite capable of controlling the business, which they thoroughly understand. I am glad that the Minister( Mr Paterson) believes in relying upon the growers in this instance, and trust that he will see the light in this connection in relation to other similar legislation. As the growers are almost unanimous, the measure should receive the support of the House. When the growers are not in agreement on the question of the control of an industry Parliament should be very careful; but when we find as we do in this instance that approximately 95 per cent, of those to be affected are in favour of it, we should not have any doubt. I support the bill, and trust that it will bring to the growers, and to the country generally, those advantages which we confidently anticipate. AlthoughI intend to support the bill I am not interested in the phase of it to which the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) referred. We can grow fruit equal to that produced in any country in the world, and I believe that those engaged in the industry will see that it is successfully sold in the markets of the world. It has sometimes been said thatAustralian growers have been somewhat careless in their packing methods, and have not taken the trouble to make their product sufficiently attractive to enable it to be readily saleable at satisfactory prices on the overseas markets or to ensure continuity of supply. Although the honourable member for Angas is opposed to government control of the industry, and believes that those engaged in fruit production should be able to conduct their own business, he must admit that when they require assistance they come to the Government very quickly. During the This debate reference has been made to the judgment of the High Court, but I do not know ' why Parliament should be bothered with the decisions of that court. As governments introduce legislation which in their opinion is in the interests of the people. Parliament should not be concerned with the decisions of the High Court. Is not Parliament supreme ? Are we not here to deal with great questions affecting the nation? Certain individuals who feei that they will be detrimentally affected by legislation passed by Parliament endeavour, by raising technicalities and quibbles, to move the High Court to upset what Parliament has done. The",31,Paterson
97,Mr West (East. Sydney) [4.45],"will of the people, however, is expressed through their Parliament, which should not be influenced by decisions of the High Court. Parliament is the highest tribunal in the land, and is not responsible to the High Court. We are capable of interpreting the Constitution. Parliament passes measures which it believes are in the interests of the people, but there are some who wish to thwart the will of desire to go to the High Court we have no power to stop them. The Australian Constitution is founded upon that of America. I was a member of the Federation League, and with the late Sir Edmund Barton, R. E. O'Connor and others took a prominent part in the activities that preceded the union. We adopted the American Constitution as a model in order to commend federation to the Australian people. Because it was the only way in which we could get the union we accepted some principles with which we did not agree.

Attorney General quoted certain constitutional cases. The honourable member for East Sydney is now discussing matters which are extraneous to the bill. Attorney-General's opinion. He is not the first lawyer I have tackled; the practical experience of laymen often upsets the theories of legal minds. If this legislation is declared ultra vires the people who are adversely affected will work with greater zeal for an amendment of the Constitution. It is always very difficult to get the people to understand what is involved in a proposed amendment of the Constitution. This legislation will serve to illustrate one of the purposes for which increased power is required by the Commonwealth Parliament. When a lot of legal questions are put on a referendum ballot-paper, the devil himself cannot tell what they mean, but a simple issue like that contained in this bill can be understood by the people. If some crank seeks to stifle the aspirations of the National Parliament by having this legislation declared invalid, I shall energetically support its reference to the people by referendum. Nobody in the community fights more strongly 'for his own interests than does the man on the land, and if this proposal is successfully challenged, the rural producers will be ready to help to induce the people to Parliament. If such persons give greater powers to this Parliament. The High Court has always been composed of men for whom I have had the highest respect, but the Justices who sit on the bench to-day have a wider vision than had their predecessors. It is for this Parliament to legislate as it thinks proper, and I am confident that the High Court as at present constituted will take a broad view of the Constitution. sideration of this bill involves two questions, (1) whether it is proper for the House to pass such legislation, and (2) whether it has power to do so. In regard to say much. The bill merely extends a principle that is already in operation. I ao not believe that it is proper to pass legislation of this kind, which gives consideration to only sectional interests, without due regard to the effect upon the remainder of the community. This legislation seems to have been drafted with a view to promoting the interests of the producers only, and with complete disregard of the interests of the great mass of the consumers. However, I have expressed my opinion to that effect on other occasions, and I do not propose to say more on the subject now. In regard to the legislative competency of this Parliament a layman hesitates to express an opinion, but I listened with the greatest care and appreciation to the lucid statement by the Attorney-General. He put the facts so clearly that even one ignorant of legal principles could thoroughly understand their meaning. It will certainly be a shock to many people who are not lawyers to learn that the Constitution is not what they thought it was, and that it would be possible for this Parliament to impose border duties against a State. I do not anticipate that such a thing wouldever be done, but the High Court has decided",32,Paterson

I cannot see how regulations can be made under this bill without discriminating in that way, but perhaps the Attorney-General's ingenuity will overcome the difficulty. The kernel of this legislation, however, will be found not in the bill, but in the regulations to be made thereunder. seemed to have some doubt as to the meaning of section 99, and said that it would be very diffcult to operate this proposed legislation without infringing that provision of the Constitution. Whether or not it is being infringed we cannot say until the regulations have been framed and tested. Therefore we are asked to vote on this bill more or less in the dark. If the House agrees with the principle involved it may pass the bill, but the matter will not end there. It seems to me extraordinary that we should legislate in such a way that the real power will be contained in the regulations to be drafted and put into operation by the Government. after regulations have been made will be to test ality before the court. Whatever may be the desires of this Parliament, the decision of constitutional issues does not rest with it. If the regulations to be made under this legislation are thought to contravene section 99, I have no doubt a test case will be taken to the High Court by whose decision this Parliament will be bound. The court has already declared that the constitutional provision relating to freedom of interstate trade means that such trade shall be free only of restrictions by any State Parliament and not by the Commonwealth Parliament. Any restriction on trade, whether by the Federal or the State authority, will be equally objectionareas could be quoted almost indefinitely. able to the people. The purpose of this legislation is to prevent the free marketing of goods from one State to another, and it opens up an extraordinary vista of possibilities. The honourable member for Fremantle spoke of surplus hams in New South Wales being sold in Western Australia at prices very much lower than prevailed in the State of origin; in other words, the market in New South Wales was maintained by dumping in Western Australia. The same practice has been followed in connection with jam and other manufactured commodities. That cannot be prevented, and I consider .that it should not be prevented. Curiously enough, the reverse position exists with regard to dried fruits. Western Australia, having a surplus of dried fruits, sends that surplus to South AusThe Attorney-General tralia, where the growers of that commodity are in arms against the importation. If the growers of the one product have a right to protection against competition from the growers in other states, the growers of other products have an equal right to similar protection. But such a procedure merely prevents the consumer obtaining the benefits of commercial competition. I am entirely against the object of this bill. Its legal aspect was clearly stated by the Attorney General( Mr Latham) and all that we can do is to leave it to the honourable gentleman to puzzle out how he can make regulations under it which will not be an infringement of section 99, and leave The only step possible those interested to defend their rights as ordinary traders of the community by the constitution""appeal to the High Court. I am pleased that the Government has introduced this bill. There is need for greater government supervision in order to give the growers of dried fruits a chance of success. Not only is there the sympathetic aspect that many of our returned soldiers have gone on the land and engaged in this industry, but there is also the fact that large areas in the different States, particularly in Western Australia, have been planted with vines. On the Murray River vines have been planted especially for participation in the dried fruits industry, and similar activities in otherFrom a health point of view the consumption of dried raisins ranks very high indeed, and for that reason, if for noother, we should endeavour to assist the industry in every possible way.

If a reliable firm could show the Government that it had a chance to open up trade in the East it should be the duty of the Government to assist to pay the expenses of the representatives of that firm in the endeavour to open and build up our trade in new centres. I have in mind a Chinese resident of Australia, MrH . Louey Pang, who is performing a great service to this country by exploiting our dried fruits in the East. Mr Pang has resided in Australia for something like 35 years and he is held in high repute in commercial circles in Melbourne. He took something like 200 tons of our dried fruits to the East, and I understand from a letter that I have received from him that the whole of that consignment has been disposed of. If Mr Pang were given the opportunity to advertise Australian -dried fruits to only a fraction of the extent that American dried fruits are advertised in the East, I am confident that ""his efforts would result in the placing of large quantities of our dried fruits in that market.

The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) appeared to think that the object of this bill was to harass interstate trading and render it more difficult. The bill certainly deals with the regulation of interstate trading, but it is not designed for that purpose alone. Its main object is to insure that each grower of dried fruits shall export his fair share of that product and enjoy his fair share of the generally more profitable market within Australia. It is merely a means to that end. As the of operations. The .Commonwealth Government cannot constitutionally lay down, directly, an export quota which must be followed, it proposes to use this power of inter-; state regulation to bring about the same results, by making it a condition that before interstate trading can be .indulged in the export quota must be observed.

The Eighth Assembly of the League opened in an atmosphere of dissatisfaction, disappointment, and general discouragement. There were several reasons for that. The first was the failure of the Three-Power Naval Conference, which had so recently been held at Geneva, to arrive at any agreement on the subject of naval disarmament. It will be remembered that the President of the United States of America invited that conference to assemble and that a difficulty arose with respect to the size and armament of cruisers, which was not solved before the conference terminated. That was one element which produced, as I have said, a feeling of disappointment and discouragement at the opening of the Eighth Assembly. Further, there were the difficulties that had presented themselves to the Preparatory Disarmament Commission of the League, which had been endeavouring to draw up a scheme that would be acceptable to the States members of the League for general disarmament in relation to land, air and sea. When that commission came down to details, and considered the actual requirements of a definite treaty or agreement on the subject, it was found very difficult to obtain any great measure of assent. There was again the feeling on the part of some of the smaller States, openly expressed at the beginning of the conference, that the Powers, including particularly those referred to as the Locarno Powers, had taken it upon themselves to settle matters by a procedure which was not along League lines. They had met for the purpose of discussing important matters of interest to the civilized world, but of particular and special interest to themselves, and some objection was taken to these separate conversations upon the ground that the effect of them was to diminish the importance of the League. At the meeting of the Assembly, however, assurances were given that satisfied the Assembly as a whole that there was no intention to prejudice in any way the importance of the League, but that practical considerations made it necessary for the Powers, between whom specific questions arose, to meer for the purpose of discussing them. The Locarno agreement itself had been filed in the offices of the League, and it was recognized that that agreement had made a greater practical contribution to security in Europe, and, therefore, to the diminution of the danger of war, than anything that had happened since the Treaty of Peace. All who were present at the Eighth Assembly of the League agree that the discussions were remarkably frank, and that the result was that the feeling of uneasiness to which I have referred, and which manifested itself at the opening gathering, had completely disappeared when the Assembly separated. In that respect the Eighth Assembly was a distinct success. The Eighth Assembly, like its predc eessprs, and for the same reason, devoted a considerable part of its time to the question of security and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful methods. It is quite normal that each Assembly should place this matter, together with the closely allied subject of disarmament, in the forefront of its discussions. , One of the principal objects for which the League was founded was the organization of peace and pacific relations, so as to render as difficult as possible recourse to arms for the settlement of international disputes. It is on this ground that at each assembly of the League so much attention is given to what may be called the machinery side of security, in an endeavour to arrive at greater methods and means acceptable to the nations for enabling them to meet for the purpose of discussing problems of security or to provide other machinery for the determination of questions affecting security. We, in Australia, should, and I think we do, fully realize that there exists within the League a strong feeling that no avenues should be left unexplored which might in any way tend to make more efficient the existing means for the peaceful settlement of disputes which inevitably arise between nations or for providing new methods for dealing with these questions. Accordingly every year proposals for improving the state of security of the nations are brought, before the League. The existence of the Locarno treaties, and the almost universal recognition of the valuable results that have followed from them, have had the effect of stimulating inquiry towards the discovery of some general form of agreement between the nations, capable of adaptation to particular circumstances, which may result in the application of the Locarno principles to wider areas, in the world. At the Eighth Assembly of the League a movement made itself very clearly felt for strengthening all the existing methods of preserving peace between the nations and for making recourse to war more difficult and onerous than ever. During the early stages of the Assembly there was a considerable amount of discussion upon the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which had succeeded the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee of the previous year. It was proposed by the Netherlands delegation that the Protocol discussion should be re-opened, but this course was deprecated by the British delegation, and by one of the authors of the Protocol, M . Politis, of Greece. Our own first representative also expressed the view that it would be unwise to revive the discussion of the Protocol itself at that juncture. The Polish delegation, however, proposed a motion with the object of prohibiting all wars of aggression. This was unanimously adopted by the Assembly, and may therefore be regarded as representing the considered judgment of thu nations represented. It is not out of place for me to remark the nations that are commonly regarded as the great Powers of the world, and which are members of the League, were represented at this Assembly by their Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Ministers of the great Powers are busy men, who carry heavy responsibilities, and they would not attend the meetings at Geneva unless they considered them important and significant. in increasing numbers Foreign Ministers are finding themselves, almost as a matter of course, at Geneva in September, is in itself a tribute to the good work which the League is doing. The motion carried at the instance of the Polish delegation cannot be said to add anything to Mr Latham. the Covenant, or to alter the machinery of the League, or the obligations which already rest upon the members of it, but it is important as expressing the unanimous sentiment of the nations. It reads as follows:"" The Assembly, "" Recognizing the solidarity which unites the community of nations: "" Being inspired by a firm desire for the maintenance of general peace: "" Being convinced tnat a war, of aggression can never serve as a means of settling international disputes and is, in consequence, an international crime: "" Considering that a solemn renunication of all wars of aggression would tend to create an atmosphere of general confidence calculated to facilitate the progress of the work undertaken with a view to disarmament: "" Declares: , "" (1) That all wars of aggression are,, and shall always be prohibited. "" (2) That every pacific means must be' ! employed to settle disputes of every description, which may arise between States. "" The Assembly declares that the States-members of the League are under an obligation to conform to these principles."" The motion serves to keep before the minds of the governments and peoples of the world that there is a strong feeling; against aggressive warfare which is every year developing and crystallizing. tions carried at previous Assemblies? motion is expressed in more detail, and is more definite than those to which the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has referred. firmatory resolution. and emphatic, and indicates the real mind.! of the nations. It shows, as I have said,, that the feeling against, and condemnation of, aggressive warfare is increasing..

It also provided that all legal disputes, including disputes in which the parties were in conflict as to their respective rights, should be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice. It provided, further, that the Permanent Court of International Justice should have the -duty and power of determining whether or .not a dispute fell within the class of legal disputes. With regard to other than legal disputes the draft convention provided that the procedure to be followed should be that the parties concerned should by agreement appoint a committee of arbitrators. If they failed to agree upon such a committee the -Council of the League should, by majority if necessary, settle all points remainand extent of the reparation to be made ing in suspense, constitute the committee -of arbitrators, and settle the number, personnel and powers of the committee. The draft convention also included a provision that the parties undertook to accept and carry out in good faith any award that was made. That is what is generally -described as an "" all in "" arbitration agreement. After examining the proposal, the First Committee, which deals with all juridical matters, formed the -opinion that it required detailed investigation and reported that it did not consider itself to be ih a position to consider the matter in detail at that Assembly. It recommended the Assembly to consider the drafting of a general convention for compulsory arbitration. Assembly carried a motion in which it recommended the progressive extension of arbitration by means of special or -collective agreements, including agreements not only between States which were members of; the League, but between States which were and States which were not members of it. I may say in passing that about 80 arbitration treaties have been registered with the League since -the war. Investigation is proceeding on the subject of arbitration, and it is possible that some form of treaty will be devised which may be considered suitable for adaptation and moulding to meet'-special cases'; Honourable members will recognize that there already exists. the statute constituting a permanent Court of International Justice, and that in that statute there is an optional clause. I refer to clause 36, which is so described because it is optional for States which adhere to the statute to adopt this particular clause or not, as they think proper. A State which accepts the clause is absolutely bound to submit to arbitration certain classes of disputes, which are recognized as being suitable as a general rule for determination by a legal tribunal. These are, firstly, disputes which involve the interpretation of a treaty; secondly, any question of international law; thirdly, the determination of any fact which if established would be a breach of international obligation, and lastly, the nature for breach of an international obligation. Those may not be the precise words of the statute, but they are substantially accurate. The question of the adoption of the optional clause of this statute was discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1926. Honourable members will recollect that a reference is made to it in the rpport of that Conference. Several nations have accepted the clause, and are, therefore, bound to compulsory arbitration in the cases to which it refers; but none of the great Powers have, to my knowledge, absolutely and unconditionally accepted it. The Imperial Conference decided that the question was of such fundamental imThe portance that it required further consideration and examination. It was agreed that no part of the Empire should take independent action in connection with it, but that there should be full consideration before anything was done. The Commou : wealth Government is now engaged iu a consideration of this subject, and particularly of the optional clause.

118,Mr Mann,And upon treaties.,41,League Of Nations Report Of Australian Delegation To Eighth Assembly
119,Mr Latham,"That is what I am refor the purpose of saying that these particular problems are now receiving the -careful consideration of the Government. It is hoped that it may be possible to arrive at a solution of them which will enable Australia to join with other parts of the Empii^e in some degree of adherence to the clause with reservations. One final point I mention in connection with this optional clause is that it is unlikely that any part of the Empire would desire that disputes between it and any other part of the Empire, if they should, unfortunately, arise, should be referred to a court of justice sitting at The Hague, instead of being determined by discussion between the leaders of the Governments of the two Dominions concerned, by a decision of the Imperial Conference, or, if a legal issue arises, by a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. difficulty which arose between India, and South Africa, with regard to Indians in Natal and the Transvaal, an adjustment was reached by discussion between the representatives of India and those of South Africa. It is very unlikely that any such conclusion would have been reached by the arbitrament of a court consisting of foreign jurists. The nature of the matter at issue was such that it could not be determined by any court. In the same way the determination of a question arising out of the fixing of the boundary between Ulster and the Irish Free State was remitted to and decided by a special committee of the Privy Council. When Canada and Newfoundland had a dispute as to the ownership of Labrador, that dispute was determined by the judicial committee of the Privy Council, with the result that a large area, containing many millions of acres, was adjudged to belong to Newfoundland and not to Canada, although part of the mainland of North America. That decision has been accepted by Canada, and Newfoundland is no longer an island, but has quite a considerable continental domain. We have, therefore, within the Empire means of settling our differences, and it is unlikely that any 'part of it would desire that those differences should go to a court largely representing foreign nations and sitting in Europe. There seems to be not the slightest necessity for the adoption of any such procedure in relation to matters which arise between the various parts of our Empire. at settling disputes within the Empire failed, what could be done? deal with such a contingency as a hypothetical question. I should like now to say a few words on the subject of disarmament, which was one of the fundamental questions set down for consideration at the Eighth Assembly of the League of Nations. Up to the present I have dealt with arbitration and the allied subject of security. The situation in regard to disarmament when the Assembly met was that tbe Preparatory Commission, which had been set up to prepare the programme In the recent for an international disarmament conference, had progressed so far at its third session in March and April last as to draw up the provisional text of a draft convention, which was to be the basis of discussion at a proposed disarmament conference. Owing to inherent difficulties the text did not cover all the points on military, naval and air armaments that had been discussed, and the commission accordingly was obliged to confine itself to indicating the points on which unanimity had been reached, and the reservations submitted by the various delegations on behalf of the powers which they represented. The text drawn up by the commission is divided into five chapters, dealing with effectives, material, budgetary expenditure, chemical warfare, and miscellaneous provisions. That text was first of all forwarded to the Council of the League, and was discussed to a considerable extent. The Eighth Assembly considered a number of proposals in regard to disarmament, but, as I have already said, there was a considerable degree of disappointment at what was felt to be the lack of active progress in the matter. The resolutions carried were1. That the work of the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament should be pressed on in order that the proposed disarmament conference might meet at a reasonably early date. 2. That a sub-committee on arbitration and security should be set up complementary to the Preparatory Disarmament Commission.",41,League Of Nations Report Of Australian Delegation To Eighth Assembly
120,Mr Charlton,Supposing all efforts,42,League Of Nations Report Of Australian Delegation To Eighth Assembly
121,Mr Latham,"I am not prepared to3. That all wars of aggression are and shall always be prohibited, &c. I have already referred to that resolution. The reason for setting up a subcommittee on arbitration and security was that it was found impossible to make any progress in regard to disarmament unless the nations could feel that they had a reasonable or satisfactory degree of security. Theni t was discovered, as on other occasions, that it was impossible to give the nations security unless some reliable method of dealing with disputes, other than by war, was provided. The Preparatory Disarmament Commission has held two sessions, one in year, and the other in March of this year. At both sessions Russia was represented for the first time, and proposals were put forward by its representatives. first session was for the total abolition of all land, naval, and air forces. Their second proposal, at the March meeting, was for a proportionate reduction of the forces of all nations. A German proposal has been made for more detailed statistics of armaments under the provisions of Article8 of the Covenant of the League, which provides for the interchange of information as to armaments. At both sessions endeavours were made to reconcile the different opinions of the various nations in order to arrive at a unanimous draft convention. That work is still proceeding, but has not yet reached fore, already provides a large measure any practical result. The Security December and set up three sub-committees to deal with the three phases of its work-first, arbitration agreements; secondly, security thirdly, machinery to enable the States, members of the League, to perform their obligations. since held another meeting at which a British memorandum on arbitration and security was read setting out the views of the British Government on the distinction between justiciable and non-justiciable disputes, and generally upon the subject of arbitration. The British memorandum also urged the view that it is more likely that general security will be furthered by the conclusion of specific agreements relating to different regions where actual difficulties exist than by the Mr Latham. adhesion of all States to some one general form of agreement guaranteeing or professing to guarantee the safety of other States. One of the difficulties of this subject is that it is a poor service to the cause of peace to enter into agreements, that are not understood to be real and significant by the people of the countries whom they affect. An agreement in general terms, signed by a large number of nations, is not likely to be as well supported by the people of any specific country as a regional agreement dealing with the problems that present themselves to the people of that country November and December last and its immediate neighbours. In saying that, I am endeavouring to interpret the view of the British Government. The Security Committee had before it a memorandum prepared by Dr. Benes and the Their proposal at the rapporteurs of the three sub-committees that were appointed. Taking the first important point covered by this memorandum, much emphasis was placed upon the fact that the Covenant of the League of Nations already affords a large measure of security, and, if applied, will prevent war in the large majority of cases. It is quite true that the legal mind can detect in the covenant the gaps and fissures to which reference is often made; but, from the practical point of view, a war would seldom slip through-if I may use the phrase-by reason of one of those gaps or fissures. The Covenant itself, thereof security. The second point notable Committee met in in this memorandum is the expression of opinion from different sources that special agreements dealing with specific subjects may advantageously agreements; and be adopted. If real collective agreements can be made, well and good; but, if not, then special treaties' dealing with particuThe committee has lar regions are desirable. The committee was unanimous as to the need for regional security agreements; but there is the division of views, which I have sought to indicate, between those who want an all-round treaty to which'all the nations will be a party, and those who think that existing practical problems should be attacked, and, if possible, settled one by one, as in the case of Locarno. The committee has prepared a series of model treaties relating to the subjects of international arbitration and security, which are to receive further consideration. There are one or two smaller matters which were raised at the Eighth Assembly to which I propose to refer. In 1926, the Government of Finland submitted a proposal for establishing a fund that might be used to support States that were the victims of unjust aggression, and to enable them to provide themselves with means of defence. That subject was referred to the Finance Committee of the League, which has reported that the only practicable scheme would be not to create a sort of international war chest, but to adopt a plan by which the credit of a State, which might otherwise find difficulty in raising necessary loans, might be strengthened by an international system of financial guarantee. That subject is receiving further consideration as being one of the necessary preliminaries to disarmament, so that if a State disarms, and is unjustly attacked, it will at least have the necessary finance and credit with which to defend itself a thorny subject out of which great One of the most important activities of the League, the least spectacular, is the work being done in the direction of the codification of international law. I have already referred this evening to the difficulties that arise in determining the substance of international law, as well as in applying it when discovered. The cause of many of the difficulties that are holding back some of the nations from agreeing to a greater measure of arbitration accept at the present time is the uncertainty of international law. If international law is codified, in proportion to its codification, it will 'become easier for the nations to accept the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice. Progress is gradually being made in this direction, but it is naturally slow. The work is of a technical character, it is uninteresting to the public generally, and much of it is unintelligible to them. But progress has been made, and five subjects have already been accepted as suitable for codification. Three of these matters are being put in hand, and the preparatory work is being undertaken in connection with them. A committee of the League is dealing with this subject, and I am glad to be able to say that our Australian representative, Professor Harrison Moore, has been asked to act as the British representative on the committee on account of his wide knowledge and experience of international law. It is hoped that the first codification conference will be held in 1929, and, if it takes place, I trust that it will be possible for Australia to be effectively represented at it. The subjects with which this conference will deal are nationality, territorial waters and the responsibility of States for damage done in their territory to the persons or property of foreigners. Those are three important subjects, and are just the type of matters out of which international difficulties and disputes arise. If progress can be made by establishing a universally accepted system of law on those subjects, it will be worth a great deal. Two other matters which the Commonwealth amongst other countries has agreed to be ready for codification arc diplomatic privileges and immunities international difficulties arise, because it affects national prestige-and the matter of piracy,, which is still prevalent in certain waters. Other subjects are also under consideration in relation to the possibility of codification. I draw attention to the fact that a British dominion, Canada, has been elected to the Council of the League. That is a recognition of the status of the Dominions in the League, and I am sure than they are prepared to that most of us will welcome this recognition of the service that Canada is able to render. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. recent International Economic Conference resulted in certain resolutions 'dealing with commerce, industry and agriculture, being brought before the Assembly. The Assembly endorsed the resolutions of the Conference, and recommended them to the favorable consideration of all the governments interested. As this matter has been dealt with in a separate report submitted for the Australian representatives to the Conference by it3 leader, Sir David Gordon, I do not propose to deal particularly with it, other than by inviting the attention of honourable members to the remarks of the first",42,League Of Nations Report Of Australian Delegation To Eighth Assembly
122,Mr Latham,"The work of the Australian delegate, Sir George Pearce, particularly his reference to the restrictions upon trade by the prohibition of exports and imports, licences and tariffs. Speakingi n the Assembly, Sir George Pearces a i d Australia was in a somewhat different position in the economic sphere from most of the countries represented at the Assembly. Many of those countries had had centuries in which to develop and expand their primary and secondary industries, and in which to build up those accumulations of capital so necessary for the development of a country. Australia had had for the greater part of it less than a century in which to develop, and, we could not reconcile it with our view of national growth that we should be satisfied with being merely "" hewers of wood and drawers of water"" for older and more economically advanced nations. We had learned during the Great War how necessary it was that we should be able to supply ourselves with certain essentials of national life and security. Freedom of trade and immigration must be conditioned by something approaching equality of standards of living and of economic status. Whilst welcoming the results of the conference, and promising that they would receive that earnest consideration that was their due, Australia must reserve the power to safeguard her national and economic life, as was recognized in the Covenant of the League as the right of all nations. It w ill be seen that while Sir George Pearce expressed the appreciation of Australia of the work done, he, at the same time, invited the attention of the representatives of the other nations to the special circumstances of Australia as a young country. He pointed out that Australia was in a less developed state than that of most of the other countries represented, and therefore a different economic policy from that applicable to more developed territories could be justified in her case. Among other matters brought the Assembly was a proposal for the creation of an international relief board, the object being to make for the relief of communities by disaster, such as earthquakes, famines and epidemics. A conference held in July, 1927, drew up a draft convention for the establishment national relief union, and suggested that an initial fund be formed tions from the governments with the League in proportion to their contributions that further funds be raised by voluntary contributions, both by governments Mr Latham. and individuals, as well as by existing relief agencies. It was proposed that an international relief union be established under a convention to be submitted for the approval of the nations concerned. It is obvious that many difficulties would arise in the administration of such a fund. The whole matter will receive further consideration when the definite proposals are received by the Government. The Finnish delegation raised the question of alcoholism, to which it is fitting that I should make some reference. Many of the delegates thought 1 that the notice given was too short; others that the proposal made was rather indefinite. It was proposed that the smuggling of alcohol should be treated on an international basis by means of a general convention, and that the health committee of the League should deal with the subject of alcoholism. The Government considered that the smuggling of alcohol was a matter for the nations concerned, and that it would be wiser to allow each nation to administer its own laws on the subject. While recognizing the importance of the subject, the Government considered that the control of alcohol was outside the scope of the Covenant, which, while containing specific provisions as to the supply of alcohol in mandated territories, makes no other reference to the subject. Honourable members are aware that the prohibition and the control of alcohol, and allied questions are among the most controversial subjects which enter into political life. The Government held that, notwithstanding their importance, it would be a mistake for the League to enter into before an arena in which the dispute is so keen, and, at times, so bitter, as it is upon these subjects. The League has a great deal oi provision international work to do; and it would overtaken be a misfortune if , by interesting itself floods, in matters of such a controversial nature, it gave rise to the suspicion that it associated itself with either one side or anof an interother. The decision of the Government does not mean that it regards the subby.contribuject of alcoholism as unimportant, but connected that some subjects can be more effectively and satisfactorily dealt with as domestic to the League itself, and affairs than if handled upon an international basis. Were the League of Nations to support a particular view on the question of alcoholism, its action document be printed; but the discussion might be keenly resented in some quarters. can take place in connection with the reThe Government, therefore, felt that on port of the Eighth Assembly. such a subject it was better for the League to remain silent at present.

According to Hansard of the 3rd March, 1927, that honourable senator statedAs the industry is conducted at present it is an absolute menace to the British Empire. . . . I am aware that some ppople will suggest that I am exaggerating the danger, but after a careful study of the industry in all its aspects I honestly*helieve that both as regards the prestige and trade of the Empire, as well as the moral well-being of its peoples, the film industry as conducted abroad is a menace. On the 11th August, 1926, the honourable senator is reported to have saidThe picture business is in the grip of foreign combines. Senator Guthrie availed himself of the opportunity to give evidence before the commission, but he failed to substantiate either of those charges. Numerous misleading statements that he made regarding the refusal of picture houses in Australia to screen Empire pictures were effectively rebutted by witnesses representing Australian picture houses. tion of American films that enters Australia? cent. grip, is it not? not blame Americaf o r that.

But it must be confessed that there is a good deal of loose talk regarding anti-British propaganda in American films. We must realize that the films are made in America primarily' for the American market of 120,000,000 people. Films that are made in England, Australia or Germany, naturally have some propaganda value, unintentional though it-be, in favour of those countries.

If it had been made in America certain fanatics in Australia would have said that it was intentional anti-British propaganda. It was nothing proporof the kind. Senator Guthrie also referred to the alleged great American combine that was operating in Australia. I had heard so much respecting this foreig't combine that I commenced the investigation in the f u l l belief that we should be able to discover a huge American octopus having a straugle-hold on the industry in Australia; but after a very careful and searching investigation we found that (he only combine was Australian in its comI blame them for misposition, consisting of Union Theatres Limited and Hoyts Limited, which control respectively 42 and 116 of the principle picture theatres in Australia.

The evidence of the representatives of the American distributing houses, which are really branch companies in Australia of a parent company in America, all went to show that the Australian combine hud the American distributing companies in the palm of its hand, and frequently was able to dictate the prices to be paid for films. That places a different aspect on the matter mentioned by Senator Guthrie.

142,Mr Pabkhill,"I s the honourable memany combine; I am directing attention to misleading statements made by certain gentlemen who have a sort of hysteria for Empire films, and who believe that practically every film produced outside the Empire is anti-British in sentiment. Senator Guthrie also said that he knew that between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 is sent to America every year for the purchase of films. As a member of the royal commission on the moving picture industry, I had opportunity to obtain authentic evidence on this point, and found that the total amount remitted to America for this purpose was about £800,000 a year. that amount? The whole matter is sub judice. In pre-war days Germany and France led in the matter of film production, but during the war these nations were engaged in other directions, and it was then that America came into the film business, and consequently made rapid progress. American producers were able to obtain the services of the best artists from practically every country in the world. They were also able to obtain the services of the their exhibition in Australia gives embest directors of film production, whose films were readily bought up in every country. ducers developed the industry to such an extent that with the assistance of a cosmopolitan collection of artists, actors and actresses, their pictures were eagerly sought. These productions soon became of a high standard, and to-day the motion picture industry in America is the eighth largest industry in that country. According to the Department of Commerce of the United States of America the following industries are of greater imnot be able to obtain supplies. In these portance than the motion picture producing industry:-Iron and steel products; manufacture of textiles machinery; chemicals; meat packing; automotive and lumber. It has been freely stated in American picture journals that the film business is the third largest industry in America; but, as the Department of Commerce states, it is not the third but the eighth. The investments in the business in America total approximately 1,500,000,000 dollars or £300,000,000 sterling and 300,000 people are employed in its various branches. No fewer than 50,000 people are occupied in producing American films. The weekly attendances at picture theatres in America total 50,000,000; and £155,000,000 is paid for admission every year. As there are 20,500 picture theatres in America, honourable members Avill see the great extent to which the industry has been developed in that country. Honourable members will have some idea of the difficulty confronting Australia, and indeed the Empire, in fighting the American film industry when I say that America produces 95 per cent, of the pictures exhibited in the picture theatres of Great Britain. Practically 95 per cent, of the pictures shown all over the world are produced in the United States of America. member says there is no combine. all kinds in America. The producers in that country have practically a monopoly of the market, because they produce all that the world requires. There is no American combine in the film business in Australia.

The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) interjects that a good deal of what America produces in this direction is of an inferior quality; but that can also be said of the productions of other countries.

We should, therefore, not jeopardize the interest of the picturetheatre business, which, as I have said, employs 20,000 persons in Australia. The American branch companies engaged in importation and distribution to Australia for exhibition purposes include the following:1'amous Lasky Film Service Limited, First National Pictures (Australia) Limited, Fox Film Corporation (Australia) Limited, Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Limited, United Artists (Australia) Limited, Universal Film Manufacturing Company (Australia) Limited. All of those "" pup"" companies representing American houses have representatives on what is known as the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia, a trade association, of which Sir Victor Wilson is president, and whose duties are primarily to safeguard the interests of the American importing companies. All the evidence tendered to the commission disclosed that there is keen competition to-day amongst these rival companies, and that some of the methods adopted in order to secure business are, one must admit, questionable.. engaged in the business in Australia are very keen and are out to beat the other fellow if they can, which disproves the statement that there is a huge combine. These companies pay fabulous salaries to their Australian managers, some of whom receive more than the Prime Minister, or the Minister for Trade and Customs. They also receive liberal expenses. They are paid more than three times the allowance granted to members of the Federal Parliament.

I suggest that he should read the report of the commission. I have stated that no American film combine operates in Australia. the quota system came in for a great deal of discussion before the commission. A ll the importing companies, with the exception of those exclusively engaged in importing British pictures, opposed both an Australian and an Empire quota. They want absolute freedom to exploit the Australian market. The attitude of the showmen, with the exception of thos""j in Queensland, is against a quota. Mr of "" For the Term of His Natural Life"" Albert Edward Huckerby, General Secretary of the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees' Association, Melbourne, said that he' represented 20,000 employees in the picture-show business, and that he was not opposed to a reasonable quota. At the same time he urged that nothing should be done by the Commonwealth Government that would seriously interfere with the profits In made by the picture houses of Australia, lest large numbers of employees in his union should be turned out of work. Mr be forced to go to picture shows for entertainment. Many thousands of people prefer to go elsewhere for their entertainment. Being an ardent protectionist and a. believer in the doctrine of preference to everything Australian, I started' out on the investigations of the commission firmly of the opinion that Australian films were not receiving a fair deal, and I were boycotted by an American combine. My opinion was influenced by what I had read in the newspapers and by what I had been told by people who ject. Some newspapers, and responsible men such as Senator Guthrie, claimed that there was an absolute bar against all Australian films imposed by the picture houses, allegedly because of the influence of American interests. AfterI had heard the evidence I changed that opinion somewhat. I discovered that not one penny of American money is invested in any picture house in Australia to-day. That statement is based on a careful perusal of many balance-sheets and on evidence from all quarters. The commission soon found that a good Australian picture had no difficulty in obtaining a showing in Australia. The proprietors of picture houses stated that all that they The contentious subject of wished to do was to sell entertainment to the public and, provided that they were offered a good Australian-made picture that would produce a profit, they would readily show it. They intimated that they, very naturally, preferred to have absolute freedom to buy in the world's market and obtain the best films offering, without government interference. fare? wonderful success in Australia.

Both of those companies stated that they did not want any quota; that they would have no difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory release in Australia for any picture that they produced, as their pictures were of a high standard. In order to attain that standard they brought to Australia an expert American producer, and "" leads "" to take the princiducers in Australia do not. realize that pal parts. Mr Raymond Longford, who is regarded as the outstanding Australian producer, was of the opinion that the most effective method of encouraging Australian picture production was the establishment of an Empire quota in which would be included pictures made in anj part of the Empire. He said that he would have no difficulty in getting any of his products included in the Empire quota. He felt confident that Australia could produce pictures of as high a standard as any imported from England; that a natural feeling of patriotism which existed among Australian showmen would influence them to consider Australian films favourably. Other small producers, many of them inexperienced, wanted a separate Australian quota. I viewed a large number of their pictures, and while many of them indicated great promise, I can quite understand the hesitancy of picture showmen about giving them a long run in their theatres. There are, approximately, 1,250 picture showmen in Australia, and although large profits are made by the two great picture combinesUnion Theatres and Hoyt's Limitedmany of the smaller men are making little more than bare wages. That applies particularly to showmen in the country centres of Queensland, ""Western Australia, and Tasmania, from whom we took evidence. While admitting that I am an out-and-out protectionist, desirous of boosting the Australian article at all times, I believe that, when dealing with the picture industry, a Government must be careful about compelling showmen to show Australian pictures if the public do not wish to see them. ment force a person to look at an Australian picture any more than force him to wear an Australian hat ? remark of the honourable member for Fawkner. Any quota legislation must be reasonable and of such a nature that it will not inflict hardship on the picture houses of Australia. If a picture is not up to standard people will not go to see it, and picture houses would have to close and pay off their employees if compelled to show unsuitable productions. Unfortunately, some of the inexperienced picture profact. That is why, after considering all the evidence, I support the recommendations of the commission1. That, subject to reciprocal arrangements being entered into by the Commonwealth Government with other parts of the Empire, an Empire quota be introduced. 2. (a) That, in every picture theatre in Australia, other than "" long-run"" theatres, there shall be screened during the first year of the quota period, feature films of Empire origin to the extent of 5 per cent, of the total number of feature films exhibited in such theatre during the year, with a minimum of ten such feature films. (5) That the quota of feature films of Empire origin for the second year shall be 10 per cent., and 15 per cent, for the third year. 3. That in the case of "" long-run "" theatres, there shall be screened each year during the quota period a number of feature films of Empire origin at least equal to 5 per cent: of the average number of feature films usually screened in such theatre each year, with a minimum of one. 4. That quota films be feature films only, and shall not include news gazettes, scenic pictures, advertisements, educational films, industrial films, or scientific films. 5. That the quota be in force for three years, subject to review before the expiration of that period. If warranted, the term should be extended. 6. That, subject to the fulfilment of the condition of recommendation No. 1 above, the first quota year shall commence on the 1st January, 1929. The report also urges that due notice shall be given so that there may be ample time in which to produce Australian made pictures or to import pictures from other parts of the Empire. A very necessary recommendation is made in the report that every film which it is desired to include in the quota shall first be submitted to the appeal board for determination as to whether it is of the required standard of merit. If some such provision did not exist a number of unscrupulous company promoters would",51,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission
166,Mr Maxwell,Why should a Govern,52,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission
167,Mr Forde,"There is wisdom in thetour the country inducing people to invest capital in mushroom companies for the purpose of producing films. Those companies would probably have inexperienced staffs, and would produce inferior films, expecting them to be shown by picture showmen under the provisions of the quota legislation. Such a provision would safeguard the interests of picture showmen in Australia. As the average number of feature films that each picture house shows yearly is 200, 5 per cent, would represent a quota of ten films per annum. It is evident that the proposed quota is reasonable, and, if insisted on will give a certain moral support to the Australian producer who is deserving of assistance. In a town where there are three picture shows 30 Empire films would be shown in a year. mond Longford, said that an Empire quota such as has been recommended by the royal commission, would suit him and other Australian producers. I recognize, however, that to enable the Commonwealth to introduce legislation to enforce the quota it will be necessary to obtain specific powers from the States as recommended by the commission. Australia should become a picture-producing country. It has many natural advantages, including an ideal climate. and our men and women have proved themselves capable in all walks of life throughout the world. come leaders in athletics, science, art and literature, and there is no reason why our people should not be successful as pictureproducers. To-day some of the outstanding personalities, including producers and artists, in the film business in America are Australians. These have been drawn to America because of the huge salaries that are paid there, and we could not expect them to come here to produce films unless they were given a reasonable measure of encouragement. I also subscribe to the following recommendation of the royal commission:] . That, subject to recommendations by the Appeal Board(o.)

Mr Forde. moral standard, contain humour, but not containing propaganda whicli might be prejudicial to international relations or likely to promote ill-feeling with other countries. (6) The award shall be, in order of merit-first , £5,000; second, £2,500; third, £1,500. (c) An award of merit of £500 be given for the best film scenario each year, written in Australia by a resident Australian citizen, provided that such scenario is up to a standard approved by the Appeal Board. (d) An award of merit of £500 be given each year under similar conditions for the best film scenario containing Australian sentiment. 2. That the awards recommended above be made during the currency of the quota system, viz., three years, and be open to extension, if necessary. The 3. That the Appeal Board may withhold a recommendation for an award of merit for any year should productions or scenarios submitted not attain the requisite merit deemed necessary by the Appeal Board to enable it to make such recommendation. The last paragraph of the recommendation is very necessary, because the encouragement of inferior films would damage Australian production instead of assisting it. picture been shown in other countries?

Women's organizations throughout Australia placed before the royal commission convincing evidence of the need for a woman representative on . the Commonwealth Censorship Board. Women play an important part in the home. They mould the character of the future generation. About 80 per cent, of those who visit picture shows to-day consist of women, girls and children. The most frequent patrons of picture shows are girls and boys of adolescent age, and for that reason the censorship should be effective and strict, although not so rigid as to preclude the screening of films of a reasonable type. tain evidence respecting the intellectual Wallace, and I am glad that he has been standard of films? ing, the intellectual standard of pictures the evidence which was submitted to the is not high.

To censor films satisfactorily a person requires special qualifications, such as a wide knowledge of humanity, and a good knowledge of art, literature and drama. Persons with these qualifications are not easily found, but Mr O'Reilly has discharged his onerous duties creditably. I can quite understand that his subordinate officers, who might be called upon to censor films during his absence on leave, would not be able easily to maintain the high standards which he has set.

180,Mr Eorde,"In Mr W. CresswellThe imposition of an additional duty of -Jd. per lineal foot on films imported under the general tariff is, in my opinion, justifiable. The industry can well afford to pay this impost, and, seeing that the revenue from it, which will amount to about £44,000 per annum, will be used to improve the standard of pictures and stimulate the production of films in Australia, there should be no objection to it. The adoption of the recommendations of the commission will involve an expenditure of about £20,000 per annum, so that the increased tax will meet the 'proposed new expenditure. As the extra tax will involve those who attend picture shows in Australia in an additional expenditure of only one-tenth of a penny per head it should not cause any outcry. shows are a luxury, and therefore may rightly be called upon to bear some measure of taxation. The motion picture industry of Australia -has up to date escaped very lightly in this regard. I trust that the Government will take early steps to arrange a conference between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States with the object of introducing uniform legislation in regard to this industry, and particularly to provide for the sole Commonwealth censorship of films. It is also desirable that the cided that it might be as well to earliest possible steps shall be taken to give effect to the proposal of the commission to grant awards of merit to locally produced pictures. . I trust that the States will by their active co-operation make it practicable for the Government to introduce without delay legislation to provide for a quota system in Australia. It is also highly desirable that the Cominto account in discharging the onerous monwealth and the States shall co-operate to encourage the use of suitable educational pictures in the schools of Australia. At the Maroubra Public School, in New South Wales, a special room and equipment have been provided for the showing of educational films, and the results have been highly satisfactory. Educational films are also shown regularly at a number of other important schools throughout Australia. Numerous educational films are available to illustrate production methods in the pottery, iron and steel, sugar,cotton and other important Australian industries, as well as industries in other parts of the world. The members of the commission were quite satisfied that educational films could be used in the schools with most beneficial results,, particularly in the country districts of Australia. In the not distant future Australia should be producing pictures of a high order, worthy of comparison with the best produced overseas. Given a stricter censorship of motion pictures, and a gradual improvement of the standard of films, such as must follow the adoption of the recommendations of the commission and the co-operation of the Commonwealth and State authorities, we should soon have reason for gratification by the edifying nature of the pictures screened in the film houses throughout Australia. This Entertainments such as picture would be all to the advantage of the generation of Australians which is now growing up. view of the Government having intimated that it had decided to ask my co-operation when placing the report before the State Governments to assist it in giving effect to certain recommendations which the commission has made. I did not intend to participate in this debate; but on second thoughts I have deelaborate certain parts of the report. First of all I must express my personal thanks to my brother commissioners for the invaluable assistance they rendered to me throughout the whole of our proceedings. Very early in our investigations it became apparent that the commissioners did not intend to take party considerations duties which had been placed upon them. They realized that they had a difficult task in hand, and entered upon their work in a spirit which deserves every praise. I think I may say without exaggeration that the report which has been presented is worthwhile. The Government has itself shown that it is so, for it has almost adopted our recommendations in to to. Those that have not been altogether adopted involve considerations which affect the State governments. But I trust that the day is not distant when I shall be able to say that the whole of our proposals have been adopted.",55,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission
181,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [9.27],"I nI must compliment the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) upon the manner in which he has during the last few years discharged his obligations in relation to the censorship of motion pictures. The members of the commission have seen many pictures in the course of their inquiries, and have realized the difficulties with which the Minister was faced. I have made investigations at Hollywood on three or four occasions when I have visited the United States of America, and I know the difficulties which a censor has to meet. One morning in Melbourne we were present at the private screening of a film which had been banned by the censor. Personally I wondered why it had not been passed. For the life of me I could not see why the censors had banned it, yet they were unanimously of opinion that it should be banned, whilst I , as chairman of the comattended pictures on week nights were mission, thought that the film should be released. On the other hand, I have seen many films, and so have my brother commissioners, which should not have been released; but when we made inquiry to find out why they had been released we came up against the crux of the whole problem. evidence by Professor Wallace, and has been repeated in a report by Mr answer was, "" We suggest a regulation O'Reilly on a film recently exhibited in Sydney. particular film may contain some very doubtful incidents, such as a super-sex appeal treated rather roughly, if it is of a highly artistic or dramatic nature the censors will pass it. If honorpictures at night. We had almost able members will look at the report of the commission they will find that we dealt specificially with that problem, and stated that we were not in accord with that particular view of film censorship. In comparison with the very large number of feature films released for exhibition, over 700 each year, the leakages are few, but these few may have a very detrimental effect upon the people of our community, and ought not to be passed. That really sums up the position in regard to the censorship and these leakages. The report of the chief censor tabled should transfer to the Commonwealth the to-day contains a division headed, power to legislate in certain directions "" Victorian Act and Classification"" in regard to the film industry. The Mr Marks. There is a film act in Victoria which the State has asked the Commonwealth to administer. This report states that 25 per cent, of the feature films released for exhibition in Victoria were marked, ""Unsuitable for children,"" and the censors' comment is as follows:We are of opinion that it would be better, once a classification of adult and children's films is made and sufficiently announced, a procedure which we strongly endorse, the responsibility for allowing their children to see films marked as unsuitable for them should be thrown upon the parents of the community. When the commission made its recommendation on this point it had not seen that report, but it came to the same conclusion. We had a great deal of evidence on the matter. We were told by many witnesses that they were worried about the effect of films upon children, and that hundreds of youngsters who unfit for school next day because they then were suffering from watery eyes, were listless, and their brains were tired. A lady professor of education who came before us in Adelaide expressed that opinion. She was asked, ""Are you really worried about It was given in this?"" She replied, ""We are."" She was asked, "" What do you suggest ?"" Her that will prevent children from going to It is that, although a picture shows from Monday to Friday."" We investigated this particular matter very thoroughly, and we saw that there were many difficulties in the way of restraining young people from attending unanimous evidence that there was in Australia a lack of parental control, and that the parents did not really mind their children going to see anything at a picture show. We had to meet this difficulty, and have done so by suggesting a grading system by a censorship board. I ask honourable members, the press, and the public to read our report on this point carefully, and note the reasons which actuated us in making that recommendation. I want the press also to read carefully that portion of the report of the. commission which suggests that the States trade throughout the Commonwealth is unanimous in asking for one control; but unless the Commonwealth is given the necessary power it cannot legislate in the desired direction to promote Australian production. We have advocated a quota of 5 per cent, for the first year of Empire films in which Australian films would come, but without the requisite power the Commonwealth can do nothing in the matter other than perhaps legislate by means of regulations under the Customs Acta back-door method. advocated that a contract for the hirin g of films should not extend beyond twelve months, but without the necessary power we cannot impose Those are only two important matters of many in regard to which the Commonwealth is practically powerless. The Americans are pretty smart peopleI have a great admiration for them-and if the Commonwealth has not the power to legislate in the direction required, they w ill see that no films other than American are shown in Australia and, in consequence, Australian production w ill be postponed for years, and perhaps for ever. They w ill , no doubt, offer contracts to Australian showmen so advantageous in terms for the supply of first grade films,'not for one or two years, but for three, four or five years, that they w ill block out for those periods and, perpass legislation giving the Commonwealth the haps, as I say, for ever, the screening of films produced in Australia. That difficulty can be overcome if the States w ill only see the need for giving control to the Commonwealth. I do not know that the States can have any prejudice against Commonwealth control at the present time. The commission has recommended to them the right to have a film reviewed by the Appeal Board. There are local boards in New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia. The New South Wales board does not really to any major degree function, but the boards in do, and the people of those States would not like to give up their rights of censorship unless the Commonwealth censorshij} is what they would like it to be. But when they read the report of the commission they w ill see that our recommendation is to have not one censor, but threetwo men and, what the States want, a woman, each of whom w ill have a separate projection room. In any case of doubt, a film can be put on one side for subsequent review by the whole consorship board. If there is still doubt, the film can go on to the Appeal Boardf o r review, and even when a picture has been released and is being exhibited in the theatres it may still, at the request of a State Minister, be sent back to the Appeal Board for review. Those provisions We have should satisfy the States as regard the censorship and induce them to grant the request of the commission that the Commonwealth should have power to legisthat restriction. late on certain matters. The points we seek to establish are set out on page 26 of our report under the heading "" Conclusion."" We sayIn making the various recommendations contained in this report your commissioners are aware that there are several phases of tlie industry in which the Commonwealth's powers are limited by the Constitution, and that to embody these recommendations in a legislative enactment it will be necessary for the Commonwealth Government to approach the various States with a request that under placitum (xxxvii) of section 51 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, the States should, by legislation, refer the matter to and confer the necessary powers on the Commonwealth. From their investigations your commissioners believe that there would be little difficulty in inducing the States to sole power to control-(ft ) the censorship of all finis exhibited for profit and also of all films produced in Australia, providing provision was made for a State Minister to demand a review by the Appeal Board of any film, the exhibition of which was deemed objectionable. If the States gave the Commonwealth power to legislate in this direction they would still have the right to ask for the review of any objectionable film. A t present the Commonwealth Censorship can deal only with imported films, or exported films. It cannot deal with a film made in Australia for exhibition in Australia. It Tasmania and South Australia is necessary for the Commonwealth to have the power to do this(6) All advertisements, posters, and printed matter relating to the exhibition for profit of motion pictures. A t present we can, under our customs regulations, deal with all printed matter coming into Australia, but we cannot control matter printed or copied in Australia. ""We -want the Commonwealth to have that power(o) the registration of all distributors of films and of exhibitors showing for profit: We must have some control over the exhibitor in the matter of the quota. If we are to enforce exhibitors to show 5 per cent, of Empire films in the first year, we must have power to impose a penalty on those who do not obey that instruction. (<Z) the limiting of contracts for the renting or hiring of films; I have already dealt with that matter. The commission advises limiting the period to twelve, monthsand also the necessary power to compel the exhibition of the quota of Empire film3 recommended by your commission in this report. In otlier words we are asking for Commonwealth power to control the production, distribution and exhibition of moving pictures. rest of the report of the commission dealing with the encouragement lian production is not worth the paper on which it is written. I am firmly of opinion that the Government, acting so rapidly as it did by increasing the duty on the very day on which , the report of the commission was tabled, will annoy the importers. men, who will do what they can to block anything further being done to restrict the showing of American films in Australia. When the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Eorde) was speaking I interjected that, without films coming in, our picture shows must close. We owe a debt of gratitude to America for sending to us some wonderful films -The King of Kings, which will be screened to-morrow night in Sydney for the first time in Australia is, I think, the greatest film we have ever seen. At the same time, we want to see Australian films on the screen, and if the Commonwealth does not get this power to enforce the quota the Americans will be found encouraging the exhibitors to enter into very long contracts with them, making Australian ifr. Marks. pictures on Australian screens. I hope the States w ill see that this is a genuine and sincere request by the members of this Parliament who drew up this report that they should help towards Australian production by granting what the trade throughout Australia was unanimous in asking us to give them-on e uniform control by the Commonwealth. We hope the States w ill help us in that direction. The industry badly wants Commonwealth control. In the Melbourne press the other day I noticed a statement attributed to the Premier of Victoria, in which he expressed satisfaction with the working of the Victorian Act-unde r the control of the Commonwealth, of course, it is working well-and also the hope that the other States might be in duced to follow the example of Victoria. I am quite sure that when he made that statement he could not have had the report before him. I have endeavoured to obtain a second copy of it , but without sucWithout this power the cess.

Perhaps the Minister may see a way out of the difficulty. American that I arranged to have 100 copies ready for honourable members on Tuesday. of them ? I endeavoured to discover what bricks were likely to be thrown at the commission in consequence of its recommendations. So far, the press of Australia generally has not had a chance to express its opinion on the report; but I notice that the Sydney Daily Telegraph had a small leader on the subject. Although its opening comments were rather eulogistic, it concluded by saying that it was absurd to thus put an industry in a cast-iron jacket.

185,Mr Marks,"Then what has becomehas been most lenient in its recommendations regarding the showmen. It suggests that they be required to show 5 per cent, of the available Empire films in the first year. If I were a showman, and there were very few quota films available, why should I be compelled to exhibit a similar film to that being shown by a rival theatre a short distance away? That phase and others have been dealt with in the report. not attempt to hold a ""big stick"" over anybody. An exhibitor, if he is dissatisfied, may go to the Appeal Board, and, with a man like Professor Wallace as chairman, he would be sure to obtain relief if he had a good case. No less than 241 persons, representing every branch of the industry, came before the commission, and said, "" Strengthen the censorship, because 110,000,000 visits to picture shows are made in Australia annually, and what the. people see on the screen has a greater effect upon their minds than what they read. You are apt to make or mar a nation by the class of pictures shown to them."" We have recommended that the censorship be strengthened by relieving the one censor of a task that is impossible of accomplishment. Imagine the brain-wearying work of a man endeavouring to censor four or five long feature films daily from Monday till Friday! That the work is too strenuous for one man is the reason why leakages occur. Therefore, the commission advocates the appointment of three paid censors-tw o men and a woman. Then the distributor was highly dissatisfied with the censorship. One leading showman came to me personally-h e should not have done so, but I was naturally anxious to learn all I could-and said, "" I cannot carry on my business. I have had about twelve films censored in the last fortnight or three weeks."" I replied, "" There must be something seriously wrong with the pictures you are getting, if Mr O'Reilly has turned them down."" When I heard the other side of the story I foundthat the censor was justified in rejecting them. On page 6 of his report for 1927 tabled to-day, at the end of the paragraph dealing with the efficiency of the censors' ip, Mr O'Reilly statesIf any change is contemplated, it will be necessary to see to it that the censor's authority is not frittered away. It would be better to have no censorship at all than a censorship whose decisions are not respected. So the censor himself has asked for further power. The commission proposes that it should be given to him, and that two others should be appointed to assist him. The commission, when in Adelaide, questioned the suitability of certain films for public exhibition, and on returning to Melbourne we saw queues of people waitThe commission does ing to see a picture to which exception had been taken. Some of them were filthy films, and we endeavoured to discover how they had come to be released. Professor Wallace said that he had not seen them at all. We learned that some of them had been passed by the lantern operator. When we inquired why this person had censored a certain film, the explanation given was that the censor himself could not possibly get through the work, and the exhibitors were waiting for it. When we had the lantern operator before us he said that, after further consideration of the matter, he would not pass the film if he saw it again. He realized that the picture made an ultra sex appeal, and should not be allowed on the screen. With a woman on the board with two men, they will get through the work more expeditiously and more satisfactorily than in the past. act separately or conjointly? have a doubt regarding a film, they will put it on one side, and the doubtful pictures will be reviewed by the board of three. If there is still.a doubt, the matter can go to the appeal board. With these progressive stages, I do not think that there will be as much trouble in the future as has occurred in the past. I asked one of the largest film importers if he would be satisfied with that arrangement, and he replied, ""Undoubtedly; that is what we want."" The importers are not satisfied with an appeal to the Minister concerning a rejected or severely cut film, but prefer an appeal board. The commission advocated a board of five; but the Government has seen fit-and I make no complaint against its decision-to limit the board to two men and a woman. I",59,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission
186,Mr Fenton,Will the three censors,60,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission
187,Mr Marks,"Separately . If theyagree with the honourable member for Capricornia that the women of Australia put up an unanswerable case in their claim for representation on the board. Men like Sir James Barrett, the eminent Melbourne surgeon, and other leading citizens, favoured the inclusion of a woman; and even Professor Wallace, when the question was put to him, said he saw no objection to it, if the right woman were appointed. said he would agree to that, if he had a voice in choosing the woman. that the Government will select the right person. I am sure that my fellow commissioners will join me in that hope. If the woman makes the slightest mistake, she will have the American film interests up in arms at once. She will need to be of strong character, so that those interests cannot affect her judgment. The honourable member for Capricornia has already dealt with the subject of the boycott of British films. It may be interesting to know how the reports on that matter found their way into"" the pres3 in Australia and London. The commission had . before it copies of cables published in the British press, stating that British films taken to Australia could not be shown there. What actually occurred was that one or two Englishmen saw a chance of making money by buying British films in London for a few hundred pounds, and malting thousands of pounds out of them by taking them to Australia. In one instance, for a British film for which they paid about £700, they asked one exhibitor to pay £400 a week for its exhibition in one theatre, and some hundreds of pounds for its release in the suburbs. When the picture showmen refused to accept films on such conditions, these ""carpet-bag"" men sent long articles to the press, in which they referred to the boycott of British films. The result was that the people of Australia were misled into be^ lieving that there was in reality a boycott of such films. Mr Raymond Longford, an Australian who has produced some wonderfully good films in Australia, including "" The Sentimental Bloke,"" made the same complaint about the difficulty in getting Australian films exhibited; but when the commission, under its powers, called upon witnesses to produce their books of account and other documents, it found that practically every film produced in Australia had been shown both by Union Theatres Limited and Hoyt's in their chain of theatres throughout Australia. The commission found no evidence of an American combine. On the contrary, it is satisfied that no American money is invested in Australian picture theatres. It is true that with about 95 per cent, of the films shown in Australia being of American origin, the American picture producers control the Australian screen; but that is not conclusive evidence of an American combine. Until about twelve months ago scarcely any films, other than. American, were available in Australia. America dominates the picture industry; but there is no evidence that American producers are exercising a strangle-hold upon it. Exhibitors are glad to get American films; otherwise, their theatres would have to be closed. made for American films compare with the amounts charged for British films? showmen have paid almost twice as much for British and Australian films as for American films of equal quality. In some cases they have done so notwithstanding that the Australian or British films have not been great box office attractions. In recommending the quota system the commission proposes that for a film to be regarded as of British origin 75 per cent, of the money spent on its production must be paid to natural born' or naturalized British subjects. The commission is agreeable to the introduction of one foreign star or producer to each picture. Personally, I should prefer that both a star and a producer from abroad be introduced, in order that the whole of the business may be learned. Unless an accomplished star from whom they can learn is available in Australia, aspirants for film fame will have to go abroad to acquire proper training. I hope that the commission's recommendations in relation to awards of merit will speedily be approved. It seems to be the only way to meet a difficult situation. Some of the witnesses who",60,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission

190,Mr Fenton,Ho w do the charges,61,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission
191,Mr Marks,"Many Australianappeared before the commission advocated the establishment of a national studio, or studios. Apart from the question of cost-it was estimated that approximately £150,000 would be required for the purpose-man y difficulties would arise. Chief among them would probably be the situation of the studios. Canberra was suggested as a suitable situation; but if a national studio were established at the national capital, a producer in ""Western Australia would be at a disadvantage compared with a producer in Sydney. The expense of conveying the east from Western Australia to Canberra would make the cost of the picture too great. Other witnesses favoured the establishment of schools of cinematography at the several universities; still others advocated various methods of training Australians in the production of pictures. The commission, however, is ' of the opinion that the granting of awards of merit together with the Empire quota is the most effective way of establishing the film-producing industry in this country. By such means the production of good films and of stories suitable for filming would be encouraged. Where considered desirable, the Appeal Board should have the power to call upon experts for advice. Only this evening I received a telegram from a friend of mine, who is one of Australia's largest suburban picture exhibitors. He deplored the proposed increase in duty because, he said, it will be passed on. on! I have a copy of the contract which Australian exhibitors have to sign with the American distributing companies, and it provides that should the duty be increased at any time, the showman must pay the difference. He, in turn, may endeavour to pass on the extra cost to the public; but as, according to the figures given by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) it will amount to only 3s. 4d. a performance, it is too small to cause any worry, and there will be no excuse for passing it on to the public. The report states why the commission ad vocated the increased duty. Additional expenditure will be involved in connection with the awards of merit, and the 'enlargement of the censorship staff. The salaries of the censors also should be increased. Mr O'Beilly has been performing his duties for the ""marvellous"" salary of £600 a year. It is nothing short of a tragedy that a man who is censoring pictures seen by 110,000,000 people, and is thus indirectly charged with the responsibility of moulding the character of the nation, should receive only £600 a year. I trust that the Government will see that the three censors are paid an adequate salary. Additional funds wall also be required for the provision of appropriate premises, with three projection rooms, the fitting up of which will cost, in each case, £750; a proper room for the display of the huge advertisements and posters that are used in the industry; and accommodation such as will obviate the risk of fire. A further avenue of expenditure may be the installing of the cinema in the schools of Australia. America has raised that branch of the industry to a high state of proficiency. At the Maroubra, New South Wales, public school, 20,000 feet of film are shown to the scholars every week. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will endeavour to assist the States financially to put the cinema into the schools. It is a wonderfully efficient instrument for educating the scholars. The Maroubra public school was an eyeopener to us. Every class in rotation views, daily, films relating to the subjects upon which they have had lessons during the day, and the examinations Of course, it will be passed prove that wonderful results have accrued. The Commonwealth Government might assist with a film library of educational films gathered from all parts of the world, which could be made available to the schools for a nominal feeThe extra duty was recommended, also as an additional measure of preference to the Motherland. For the reasons that I have stated, I had no hesitation in joining with my brother commissioners in making that recommendation. Before criticism is offered of the report, based on the references to it that have appeared in the newspapers, I ask that every word be read, because the first page has a bearing on the last. It is one story dealing with the people's greatest form of amusement, and it deserves the most serious consideration. I ask the States to keep an open mind on the question until the Minister, and, I hope, I also, can place before them the exact position. It will then be realized that this is a sincere non-party gesture from this Parliament to the Parliaments of the States, in the hope that they will help us to obtain what the trade throughout Australia has asked for, namely, a uniform law. Such a measure could then be introduced in this House, governing the whole of the industry. Australian production will be fostered by the introduction of the quota of Empire films, the limitation of contracts, and the adoption of the other recommendations in the report. As the report is a unanimous one, and apparently, has received the f u ll approval of the Government, and, I hope, of honourable members generally, I should not have spoken on this matter but that the speech delivered by the Minten) on Tuesday, led me to believe that there might be a false impression of the intentions of the commissioners when they framed the report, particularly in regard to increasing the powers of the Commonwealth. May I preface my remarks by stating that one cannot fail to realize the enormous importance of the films to the people of Australia. At the present time it is their greatest source of amusement, as the attendances throughout Australia amply prove. It must also be realized that no greater power exists for propaganda purposes, and the building up of a national sentiment. It gives to the people of Australia an acquaintance with those who live in every other part of the world. It depicts lif"". in Japan, China, Alaska, and other countries; and must, consequently, tend to broaden the opinions of the people generally. There is an old saying, that trade follows the flag. The evidence which was placed before the commission left no room for doubt that, to a very large extent, trade follows the cinema. The screening of American pictures in South America has had a pronounced influence upon the people of that country, and has tended to the building up of American as against European trade. Then again, there is the educational influence, of which the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) has already spoken. The cinema is undoubtedly an instrument for either good or evil. A most important aspect is the censorship. Children have very retentive memories; therefore they must witness only the best class of picture. There is an old Chinese proverb which says that one picture conveys to the mind as much as does the reading of 20,000 words on the same subject. While that may be a slightexaggeration, there is not the least doubt that what people see has, in many cases, a far greater influence upon their minds than what they read. Parliament must not be led astray in the slightest degree in connection with what the commission has recommended, particularly in the matter of granting additional powers to the Commonwealth. It is not desired that there should be an amendment of the Constitution as forecast by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) yesterday, and if that impression is gathered by the States, great difficulties may arise. If the Minister will clearly state the powers the commission requires, I do not think there will be any great difficulty in providing fairly efficient control of the cinema industry of Australia. The moving picture industry is of great importance, and can not be efficiently administered without further powers being granted by the States. I strongly urge the Government to introduce legislation covering the film industry, which is too important to be controlled by regulations. Greater powers are required, and sub-section 37 of section 51 of the Constitution provides -that:The Parliament shall subject to this Constitution have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . . . matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter is referred or which afterwards adopts the law. The States should be approached with the object of inducing them to pass legislation giving the Commonwealth the specific powers required, many of which are necessary if effect",61,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission

193,Ister For Trade And Customs ( Mr Prat,"is to be given to the recommendations of the commission. The commission suggested, for instance, that the distributors and exhibitors of imported pictures should be registered as they are under the British act; but we have not the power under the Constitution to insist upon that. Additional powers will be required also in connection with the quota system, and in controlling the class of entertainments provided for children. I do not think there will be the slightest difficulty, provided a specific request is made to the States. They would have the right to revoke the power conferred if they so desired; but that would not be likely if the Federal censorship was sound and efficient. The honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr Marks) referred to the recommendation that a' State Minister should have the right to demand from the appeal board the review of any picture which was deemed obiectionable and also to apply to an appeal board to review any picture released by the censor. The right to appeal to an appeal board to review a picture was demanded by numerous witnesses, who in many cases were most emphatic that some change was required, particularly in connection with the class of pictures shown to children. They strongly contended that greater attention must be paid to this phase of the business. I am sure that unless the States were satisfied that the censorship would be improved, there would be great difficulty in inducing them to give complete control to the Commonwealth. The commission has recommended the appointment of a censorship board, upon which there should be a woman. The success of such a board will depend largely upon the qualifications of the persons appointed. Care should be taken to secure the services of a broad minded woman-no t one of those always looking for trouble-wh o has had a wide experience of life, and preferably one who has reared a family. Such a woman would be preferable to a spinster, who might have other qualifications, but would not be so suitable as one of the type I have mentioned. In the States the commission visited there were expressions of dissatisfaction with the censorship as it has been conducted in the past. I do not think there were any complaints against the department, the Minister controlling, it, or the censor. The members of the commission were fully conversant with the difficulties with which the department has been confronted in the past, but in Tasmania and South Australia, the local censorship boards have turned down picture after picture approved by the censor, and have refused to allow them to be shown. last ten years? rect in saying it was in the last three years. Numerous women witnesses, who emphasized the necessity of a strict censorship board, did not wish to give up the right of the local board to reject pictures. years ago the censorship required some alteration. the Minister who, as well as the censor, has done good work. I am not making any complaints, as I know the difficulties the department is up against. I realize, however, the enormous importance of the cinema, its effects for good and also evil particularly upon children, if pictures are immoral. I wish to again impress upon the Minister the fact that the women of Australia will not agree to losing control unless assured that a strong censorship board will be appointed, and one which will pass only the best class of pictures. Many complaints were made by women's organizations. In Victoria and New South Wales there are special leagues known as Good Film Leagues, who pay officials to inspect and report on films. In South Australia they spoke of forming a similar league, their objective being the showing of a better class of film. From the outset of the inquiry there was a strong demand for the quota system for the building up of an Australian industry. Some witnesses advocated a quota of 25 per cent., and others demanded a quota of 50 per cent, of Australian and British films. I do not think that there is a single agent of a British picture producer in Australia to-day,",63,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission

197,Mr Gregory,"I am not criticizingand but few Australian pictures suitable for tbe exhibitor are available. British producers have made marvellous efforts during the last two years to win back the trade that they lost during the war, and science is helping them to combat the unfavorable climatic conditions with which they have to contend. The commission realized that a quota of anything like 25 per cent, would be quite unworkable, and ultimately agreed to begin with a quota of 5 per cent, of Empire pictures, to be increased gradually as desired. As the Commonwealth is to be called upon to provide a considerable amount of money for awards of merit and other monetary encouragement to the industry, I am glad that common sense prevailed, and that the Government imposed an additional ^d. a foot on films under the general tariff, which creased revenue of something £35,000 per annum. sion recommended that awards of £5,000, £2,500, and £1,500 should be given for meritorious pictures of Australian production, need not be given unless the Board of Appeal is satisfied that the pictures are really of merit. A lady, Mrs. Macdonald, when giving evidence in Adelaide, urged that awards of merit should be made each year for the best films produced in Australia-pictures national sentiments, be of high moral standard, and contain humour, but not might be prejudical to international relations or likely to promote ill feeling with other countries. Such a suggestion, emanating from a lady, indicates that our womenfolk can bring intelligence and common sense to bear on national problems. I readily agreed to the duty of 2d. a foot, because I realized that as the commission was recommending increased expenditure, particularly for prizes for Australian productions, it should suggest the ways and means. Moreover, this method was recommended rather than the provision of a high quota which would seriously embarass exhibitors and perpetuate the Government policy of indiscriminate protection, which, in this Mr Gregory. case, could not be passed on and would cause many showmen' to close their theatres. The commission also recommended the granting of bonuses not only for the best pictures, but to clever writers who produced scenarios of value. The chairman of the commission mentioned the specific value of the educational films. In California special arrangements are made to hire out educational films to schools, literary institutions, or any one desiring to lecture on practically any subject. Mr Gibson has imported over 1,000 such films into Australia on all subjects. The commission felt that the Government should endeavour to assist the States in introducing the educational film into schools, as it is generally admitted that the mind retains better what is seen than what is heard. The subject of the Performing Rights should bring in an inAssociation did not receive exhaustive like treatment because it was before the law The commiscourts, and the commission did not wish to deal with a matter that was sub judice. That association has made many impudent and arrogant demands, and it is but those prizes time that we had some amendment of our copyright laws. Only recently the Italian Government has amended its copyright laws in certain directions, and I wondered why it was able to do so when we had not that power. Without any alteration of our Constituwhich would build up tion I believe that the Commonwealth, by proper representation to the States, could obtain their co-operation in this containing propaganda which matter. Victoria has already granted certain powers to the Commonwealth, and I feel confident that if suitable representations were made to the other States they would readily assist this Government to deal with the problem. At present there is no control over posters produced in Australia, some of which are as lewd as any that are imported. Such things should come under one uniform control. I ask the Minister for an assurance that the censorship board will be such that the women of Australia can be assured that the pictures screened in future will be of a cleaner and better type than some of those that have appeared in the past. adjourned.
