Of A Message From His Excellency The Go","verner-General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. NEW HEBRIDES. clear and informative explanation given yesterday by the Minister of External Affairs in reference to the control of the position to give a speedy delivery. I , New Hebrides, I ask the honourable gentleman if the Government is pressing on the Imperial Government the necessity of having the Commonwealth directly represented at any future Convention by which it is proposed to vary the terms of offer, and at the same time called for the present protectorate, or to frame new conditions and terms for the control of the islands! able member that the expediency of the Commonwealth being not only consulted, but also, if possible, represented, was communicated by despatch to the Imperial Government about six weeks ago, and that the despatches that have passed between us and the Colonial Office have been based, not on mere conjecture, but on a full knowledge of the position communicated to us by the Imperial Government. day's Argus that the Department of Home Affairs has accepted tenders for four engines, of which two are to be delivered at Kalgoorlie, and the other two at Port Augusta. The successful tenderer is an importing, not a manufacturing, firm, and I , therefore, ask the Honorary Minister whether the engines are to be manufactured in Australia, and, if so, what are the conditions in regard to subletting ? will readily understand, in the organization of a big railway construction work like the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, it is necessary to look a considerable distance ahead with a view to providing adequate locomotive power for extended construction. The further the line is pushed from its base, the greater the number of locomotives and.the supply of rolling-stock required to maintain supplies for continuous construction. Some time ago it was recommended to me by the Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways that it was essential to obtain more engines very quickly. I accordingly had all the manufacturers of locomotives in Australia approached, to ascertain whether they could manufacture the engines, and all, without a single exception, replied that they were not in a therefore, decided to invite quotations for quick supply from oversea firms, and the American Baldwin Company, represented here by Newell and Co., made the most satisfactory offer. We accepted this tenders locally for the other locomotives that we require. which I referred are to be imported ! not imported the work would have to stop. Minister at what date the Government turned down the tender of Walkers Limited, Maryborough, Queensland, for engines suitable for the Oodnadatta line!",12,Setup

I ask the Minister if he has inquired into the truth of these statements, and, if so, with whab result? was good enough to inform me before lunch that he would ask the question. DirectlyI heard of the press statement referred to, I had inquiries made, and the following wire has been received from the Acting Supervising Engineer at the Kalgoorlie end of the line:Clearing contractor states he is doing clearing on day labour, same wages and hours as ourselves. He is paying for firewood by the cord. Similar arrangement as followed by cutting contractors on all wood tramways, and is paying is. more. Understand State Government obtains our sleepers on same system. tried day labour, and one man took ten days to cut 54 cords. If we abandon present system firewood will cost 50 per cent. more. It is obvious that the newspaper statement is without foundation. In reply to a question that was asked yesterday about the carrying out of the work at the western end of the line with day labour, I desire to say that the work so far arranged on the small contract system is as follows: Clearing. . . 29 miles at ^25 per mile; cutting and stacking firewood, 100 cords at 15s. 6d. per cord; side drains, at 4s. per lmeal chain (quantity of work not specified); cuttings, gd. per cubic yard (quantity not specified); formation, 12s. to 16s. per lineal chain (quantity not specified); cleaning out well at Cardonia, £2. per square foot (total quantity 25 feet); boring at Dingo Rock, at 5s. per foot; rock lank sinking at Dingo Rock, 6s. per cubic yard for first 200 cubic yards, 3s. per cubic vard for next 150 cubic yards; tank sinking at Jumania, 6s. per cubic yard (total quantity 50 cubic yards); erection of telegraph line by piecework also in hand Minister if it is the intention of the Government, the policy of letting work by contract having been adopted, to maintain the staffs now at Melbourne, Port Augusta, and Kalgoorlie? system of piece-work or small contracts, and it is not the intention of the Government to maintain staffs in excess of the requirements. A t the present juncture I I can let the honourable am not in a position to say that the staff which we have is excessive, but the matter will be kept in view in connection with any change of system. the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether it is the intention of the Government to use the new engines for ballasting purposes and general construction work on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway? engines we have already, as far as possible, on ballast work.

Probably any Australian engineering firm, if paid a little extra to meet the cost of extending its establishment or employing its men overtime, could have got the engines manufactured sufficiently early. I am afraid this Ministry has fallen into the same fix as the Victorian Ministry. As years go on, and the railway traffic increases, the responsible officials should know what extra engines will be needed to cope with the increased production of the country. Certainly, they should not be out in their calculations to the extent of sixty or eighty engines, as they have been in the case of Victoria, whereby the people of this State have had to pay about £70,000 more than they would otherwise have had to pay. It is evident that the people of Australia will have to pay more for the locomotives now needed for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line than they ought to pay. But this is not a singular case. The same sort of thing takes place in the Defence Department. Either because of the neglect of officials, or because of the failure of the Government to provide the money asked for, orders are kept back so long that material, when wanted, is wanted in a hurry, and has either to be imported, or costs more than it would cost under ordinary circumstances. We are importing much more than we should import, either because the Government does not provide the money that is needed, or because the officials cannot see far enough ahead. words regarding our position in defence matters. It is generally known that I have not been in favour of the excessive expenditure on defence that has been incurred, or to which we are committed. Certainly, if we are to spend money on defence, we should see that there is as little waste as possible. Under the present system there is an enormous waste. That waste will have to be reduced. Of course, in the running of any business some waste is inevitable, but the waste to which I refer is not of that nature, and should be stopped. have to take into serious consideration the possibility of reducing her defence expenditure both immediataly and for the future. Mr Mathews. notice the urgent member indicate in what directions the reduction can be effected ? tions in expenditure must be looked for in the reduction of the establishment itself Our Army must be up to date, and it would be useless to have one branch of the service without other branches. For instance, having infantry we must have artillery, mounted infantry, ambulance corps, commissariat, and engineers. These arms of tbe service are inter-dependent-on e being impossible without the others. Further, munitions of war and stores have to be provided, and provision must be made for the quicker production of material in war time. But by the time the young fellows who have just passed into the National Guard reach the age of twentysix years, our Army will be far larger than is needed, and I think that a reduction in its strength could be effected with advantage. The larger the number to be trained, clothed, and equipped, tlie larger the expense of the system, and, under present arrangements, the strength of the forces must increase. The Australian Army will be enormous by the time that the young men of to-day who are twenty have reached the age of twenty-six years. member revise ""Lord Kitchener's scheme generally 1 ""yes,"" I should be charged with pitting my military knowledge against that of Lord Kitchener, which, of course, I do not do.

WhatI suggest is that there should be created some body to which every branch of the Service could go to have a grievance remedied. A.t the piesent time, if anything tfoes Wrong, for instance, with the Stores Branch, the Minister knows nothing about it.. A supplier of stores, or a man working in that branch, who desires the redress of some grievance, cannot readily reach the Minister.

In some cases, twelve months have elapsed before questions which.

I said at the outset that I was not deajing with this matter from a party stand-point, and, that being so, the honourable member's interjection was quite beside the mark. Let us consider for a moment the position in regard to the Commonwealth Saddle and Harness Pactory. penditure that has inflated the cost of Lord Kitchener's scheme. at this stage to discuss the question of whether it was right or wrong to establish such factories. The Harness Factory comes into competition with private firms, who naturally think that the requirements of the Department should be obtained from outside. But I ask honourable members to sst aside for the time being all party considerations, and to view this matter from a proper stand-point, so tliat without any bias whatever we may come to an honest conclusion as to which is I am aware cf that. the better system. Having spent a lifetime in the clothing trade, I am able to speak with authority in regard to the work turned out by the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and 1 do not hesitate to say that it has proved an unqualified success. It is quite true that certain contractors have manufactured clothing for less than the Government factory has done, but the quality of the goods produced by the Commonwealth factory is 100 per cent, better, so that the apparently dearer system must prove cheaper in the long run. A system of per cent, better in quality? The report of the factory does not bear out that statement. better in quality. When the present manager of the Clothing Factory was appointed, I did not think that he was fit for the job, and I said so. I am satisfied now, however, that he understands his On work, and I am quite willing to admit that I was wrong. The output of the factory is immeasurably superior to anything of the kind ever produced in any private establishment in the world. compares quality with quality and prices with prices. sciously biased, because I favour GovernT h e honourable ment factories; but I can honestly say that the clothing produced at the Commonwealth factory is turned out in a better condition ""than that produced by any private contractor The employees also receive better wages, and work under healthier conditions. I have gone to the trouble of comparing goods supplied by private firms with those supplied by the factory, and have found just as mucb difference between the goods supplied by different firms as there is between the output of the Government factory and that It is unnecessary of private establishments. I do not say that all goods simnlied by private firms were inferior. Reference has been made to certain garments that were manufactured by a private firm at a certain price.

When his tender was accepted, I expressed the opinion that it was too low, but he made a start with the work, and, after manufacturing a certain quantity of clothing, gave up the contract. Government factory, and undoubtedly cost more. Thet r u th is that this contractor, adopting cumstances, a Governmenb Small Arms the cunning method followed by many men in such circumstances, made up the smaller sizes, in which less material was used than would be required for tlie larger-sized garments, and as soon as he had to supply the larger sizes he relinquished his contract. We do not wish T to see that sort of thing perpetuated. The history of all the wars in which Great Britain has engaged proves conclusively that the material supplied by private contractors to the British Army and Navy has always been detrimental to their efficiency. We have all heard of the bayonets that bent as soon as they vvere used, of the boots that wore out in a week, of the clothing that dropped to pieces, and of the bad food supplied by contractors. ciently maintained in the field unless it is well fed and well clothed; and the fact that the British Army has succeeded, despite these disadvantages, is but a tribute to the skill of its officers, and the determination and tenacity of purpose of its men. Private contractors have done much to sap their efficiency. We hear almost every week of contractors in various countries being fined or im prisoned for frauds in connection with army and navy contracts-for robbing the nation by supplying defective material. Small Arms Pactory, the success of which inusfc undoubtedly depend on its management. I have read in the press lately a good many statements in regard to its present time, only about 500 rifles have been turned out at the Small Arms Pactory, and this at enormous expenditure. This may not be g o o d b u t it is better that we should pay for our experience, if it means that in time of need we shall be self-contained, so far as the supply of arms is concerned. The letter in to-day's Argus points out that this factory could easily be run, from a commercial point of view, by a private firm. That is quite true, but commercialism does not always mean efficiency to a nation. In any case, the Government would be foolish to hand over the manufacture of our rifles to any privato firm. There might be an arrangement made for the supply of arms in time of war, or impending war, and the contractors might be penalized for any The work was finished by tbe breaches of their contract; but a money penalty would be a poor substitute for arms But what was the reason? in the hour of need. Under all tlie cirPactory is necessary to the people of Ausbralia. If that factory, however, is not properly conducted, we shall, of course, have to take into consideration the advisability of removing the man who is responsible for its conduct. Every inquiry ought to be made in order to ascertain whether the shortcomings are the faul t of the manager, or are due to lack of experience on the part of the employees, or any shortcomings in the machinery of the factory. The officials of the Defence Department have not attained that standard which is necessary, and there should be a thorough sifting of the whole position by a Committee. Por instance, stores, from the defence point of view, are just as important as arms, whether An army cannot be effilarge or small-stores , in short, are as the blood to the body. Then there is the question of the commissariat; and in this connection it may be pointed out that, in the case of every camp of over a week, up to the present, except the last camp, there has been a breakdown. quire manufactories to manufacture all the food we require for the Defence Forces? proper Department to make proper arB u t let me get back to the rangements for the supply of proper food. good food than good clothes. alleged inefficiency. U p to the member knows quite well that clothes and boots are an essential, though not quite so essential, perhaps, as food itself. I shall be told, no doubt, that the system contemplates all such matters as those to which I have called attention; but, if that be so, we can only regard the system as heaving broken down.

But we have a Military Board and a Naval Board, and while the military side seems to be still uuder some sort of control, the naval section appears to have managed to get away from the supervision of the central body, and to "" run the show on their own.""

I blame no Ministry or Government for the present position of affairs. B ut we have gained certain experience lately, and I am now making these suggestions, not to the Government as a Government, but to Ministers as managers of the Defence Department. If the system is too large for the present method of control, a Cabinet Committee, or some outside Committee, might be appointed to take the matter in hand. Another suggestion I desire to make is that next session we have in this House a Defence Minister w it h more responsibility than has the present representative of the Department. As I have said on former occasions, I do not blame the Honorary Minister, whoever he may be, for he is the victim of the system; but until some change of the kind is made, there will never be in this House that criticism and discussion necessary in the case of an enormous spending Department like that of Defence. I desire to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Y a r r a in regard to the engines that have been obtained for the transcontinental railway. It would have been an easy matter to telephone for the papers that were necessary to give us all the information we desired, and this should have been done in Government Dea matter so important. This is not a party question by any means, because all honourable members for years past have been favourably disposed to the construction of this line. It remained for the late Government, however, to be the first In the to undertake any decisive operations, and follow up their words by deeds. It has been proved to the satisfaction of most keen critics that at the Newport Railway Workshops there can be built, by means of day labour, with our own workmen and a considerable portion of Australian material, engines at a cheaper rate than that at which they can be obtained from In the much-abused Postal other parts of the world. The Honorary Minister said that the New South WalesP class engines were, in size and strength, equal to some of the largest on the Victorian railways. I am in a position to I strongly say that that information is not at all correct. The largest engines in Victoria, which are used for heavy goods and express traffic, are considerably heavier than any engine on the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge of the New South Wales railways. Those large engines, at Newport, cost to construct about £56 per ton, and, as the engines and tender weigh 78 tons, the total cost of building what are really the heaviest engines made south of the line is, in a State factory, under State Socialism, £4,368.

In other words, are we to pay nearly sideration for Australian workmen, and £1,000 more for an engine not nearly of the class of the biggest engines on the Vicright under cover of the privileges of the torian railways? this policy is that we are depriving our Australian workmen of this particular work. given already by the Honorary Minister, as it will be given by the Attorney-General and other members of the Ministry, is that because these engines were required at an early date, we had to send away from Australia to have them made; but that excuseI can characterize it as nothing else-is not satisfactory to me, afc any rate. fessed to be very pronounced so far as Protectionist principles are concerned, and the one dominant note in both parties during the last contest was that, wherever practicable, goods required for the Commonwealth Government for use in the Commonwealth should be obtained and manufactured in ' Australia, and the present step is a very serious departure from that policy. The Commonwealth Government are following the bad lead of Victoriai n this respect. The taxpayers of Victoria are paying £68,000 for forty DD class engines for the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge more than the same engines would have cost if made in the Newport workshops; or, approximately, £1,700 more per engine is given to the American manufacturer. I "" understand that when the DD class engines of Victoria are compared' with the P class in New South Wales there is not much difference in regard to haulage' power. It would seem that the present occupants of the Treasury bench do not give a fig for Australian industries, or Australian workmen. ways than one. member for Melbourne Ports has supplemented previous complaints about sending out of Australia for waggons required for military purposes. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that if we require a new type of waggon it is necessary to import oneonly, and then allow some of our local workmen to have the pattern and make the rest for us. In the constituency of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports we have already had waggons of a similar type manufactured, and it is understood that they have been' turned out to the satisfaction of the officers of the Department. I hope the present Government will have some confor Australian employers, too. It is not The worse feature of House to say anything derogatory to a firm, but when a Melbourne firm tenders for the supply of engines that are'to be I know the reply that has been built by a big constructing firm in Americai t must be apparent that the firm is getting its commission,, so here again we have the middleman coming in , buying from the Baldwin Company in America engines which are not nearly of the strength of the A2 engines, the largest in use on the Victorian railways, not nearly so large, and not nearly so The Government progood for haulage purposes. Yet the Commonwealth Government, which is supposed to protect Australian employers and employees, sends away to the United States of America and pays £1,000 more per engine for engines not nearly so good as those that can be made locally. Again, in the case of the Victorian Government, the forty DD class engines to which I have referred could have been manufactured at a cost of £3,200 each i u Victoria, but the Government sent away for them. Whatever thc present Government do in legislative or administrative action, their supporters will have to bear the brunt of it in the country, and I know that some of them will have fairl y knotty questions put to them, and because of actions of which the Ministers have been guilty. Apparently, with the present Administration, it is a case of government of contractors by the contractors for the contractors. Ministers are always looking after contractors. They have a deep anxiety on their account. Everywhere they are rushing into contracts and breaking up organThey are showing it in more ized factories such as the Saddlery To-day the honourable Factory, the Clothing Factory, and other factories we have, of course, leaving alone the Cordite Factory, because they know that cordite cannot be manufactured elsewhere. But I maintain it is just as competent for the Government to manufacture saddlery, clothing, and boots for the soldiers, as to manufacture the cordite which is to be placed in the cartridges the soldiers use if they go into action. The factories to which I have referred have been established on a good basis, each showing its own balance-sheet. The last balance-sheet from the Clothing Factory has shown that we have been able to turn out clothing at a much cheaper' rate than that afc which the contractors had previously been able to do it , and that the quality of the work was far and away superior to that of the contractors. Yet here we rush away to contractorsand foreign contractors at that-and pay £1,000 more for an engine than it could be manufactured for in Victoria, and all on the score that the work is required to be done hurriedly. This seems to be a standing excuse that some officers make. I do not accuse all ollieers, because I believe there nre some loyal Australians at the head of our Government Departments, but there are some who seem to have a particular leaning toward men outside Australia. Affairs tells us that he is advised by his omcers that these engines are required at a fairly early data, °and that there were no engineering firms iu Australia who were prepared tc tender to supply them in the required time. That is the excuse that is always given, but it is not satisfactory to me, and it should not be satisfactory to the people of Australia. MrW . H . IRVINE is it not a good excuse ? MrW . H . IRVINE -Then you would postpone indefinitely the building of the transcontinental railway? ment remained in office, and these engines were required, they would not have dreamed of sending out or Australia to have them manufactured. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Then you mean that they would not have got them at-all. have given local manufacturers an earlier opportunity of tendering. According to the Honorary Minister, tlie officers of the Department have said that it is necessary to have these engines in three montlis or three and a half months. action earlier? The present Ministry have been in office close on five months, and they must have known of this requirement, otherwise the oflicers controlling the transcontinental railway have been sadly blind to construction requirements. Perhaps they have been waiting for the verdict of the Government as to whether they should engage in the expenditure. Possibly the Government have been putting these officers off, in the same way as they have been putting others off. Whetheri t is from a burning desire to put so manv Australians out of employment, or whether it is that they desire to save money during this financial year, so as to finish the year with a thumping surplus, the fact remains that the Government are not carrying on works in some directions, while they are spending money lavishly in others. The other day they brought out a wireless expert at a fee of £2,000. I have not had an opportunity of glancing at the papers in connection with this matter, but I see that the expert has practically endorsed what the previous Government and their wireless expert did. I believe it has been The Assistant Minister of Home found that the Balsillie wireless system is not an infringement on the Marconi system, and that it is so good, if press reports are to be believed, that tbe present Postmaster-General has already communicated with the British Government offering them the improved system that our man has brought out in Australia. Yet the present Government must bring out an expert, and pay him £2,000, and But if it is true, they must have a Federal Capital expert, and pay him a considerable sum, and they must have an expert for the Naval Bases, and pay him a considerable sumI suppose £6,000 w ill not pay the whole of the expenses when the bill is finally totted up. In this direction the Government are spending money, but, apparently, they are saving it in other directions, but by depriving bread-winners of families of employment they had been enjoying under the previous Administration. Then, in this matter, we are I believe they would sending out of Australia for four engines for the transcontinental railway construction. H ad the officers of the Department been up-to-date and f u l ly equipped in respect to their requirements, they would have given the order for these engines previously.

If we are always to have in power a Government who, on the slightest provocation, send orders out of Australia, it will mean that thousands of our best engineers will be uiiimployed, while those in other countries will be well employed and receive Australian money for carrying out our work. To put it plainly, I hope the Government will come to their senses, and realize that we have people in Australia who can do the work just as well as foreigners, and I hope they will not allow their Free Trade proclivities to have so much weight with them. I can do no more in this matter. I do not know whether the press will take note of it, but I should say that the Protectionist press ought to say something for the prolection of Australian employers and Australian employees, and that we should not allow this amount of work to go out of Australia. Seeing that we are so heavily I axed in respect to defence, surely we require all the money we can gather into our pockets, and how can we expect to be a self-reliant people when a considerable ortion of the work that can be done E ere better and cheaper than elsewhere is sent out of the country ? However, I shall have a word to say with regard to the sugar business. know thab almost exclusively Queensland folk, with the exception of the honourable member for Yarra, have had a monopoly in dealing with this question, but I wish to speak in regard to the Sugar Cultivation Act passed by the Queensland Government. Certain regulations have been drawn up under that Act, and I shall read portion of section 3, which is as follows: Any person not otherwise entitled to exemption under the foregoing provisions of this regulation, whom by reason of(«) The subsistence between the nation to I shall seriously consider, if ever the which such person belongs and thc United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland of a treaty conferring is still employed on the cane-fields of most favoured nation rights, or (A) such person's long residence within Queensland or the Commonwealth, or [c) such person having a lawful wife or familv residing within Queensland, or (d) any other circumstances satisfactory to the Secretary of Agriculture. These regulations are supposed to guide the Queensland Government aud the employers of labour on the sugar cane-fields as to how labour shall be employed, but sub-section d, I claim, means the opening of a door once more to allowing coloured alien labour to be employed on the sugar canc-fields of Queensland. Whether the Denham Government had this in mind in framing these regulations I do not know, but it seems to me that, this will be tlio result. Let me quote from the Cairns Times of the Sth November, 1913, which journal saysSub-section (d), in our opinion, is quite enough, without the others, to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to defy and override the most vital principle of the Act, and thus it makes an absolute farce of the measure. At time of writing (Wednesday, 5th), fifty-eight applications for exemption under ihe regulations have been received at the Cairns C.P.S. office, and ere long, no doubt, about 500 of the coloured aliens in this district will have made similar applications; and it is quite possible that the Secretary for Agriculture may grant each and every one of those coloured aliens exemption certificates, and thus absolutely nullif y the White Australia principle of the Act, which is, in fact, the soul of the measure, so to speak. It is a very serious thing that the State Government have passed such a measure and such regulations as to make this kind of thing possible. All I can say as an out-and-out Protectionist is that I know the people of Australia are paying a considerable sum to make the sugar industry of Queensland a white industry, but if I by the Queensland Act and regulations it is permissible for a considerable number of alien coloured labour to be employed, we shall have to revise our opinion and to consider whether the sugar industry should be granted the protection it now enjoys from the National Parliament. That is a fair question. protection. was given to foster the White Australia policy. As a Protectionist, question comes before the House, and if a considerable portion of coloured labour Queensland, whether it is worthwhile to protect the industry any further. It is about time the sugar-growers of Queensland took that matter into consideration.

I hope the Attorney-General will convey to the Minister of Trade and Customs the information that I have just quoted, so that serious inquiries may be made at once as to whether the white labour conditions of the sugar industry are being violated. I hope the sugar growers will take warning from one who is prepared to fight to the last ditch for Protection as a national policy for all classes of the community.

[4.47] -The remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong regarding the working of the defence system deserve the serious consideration of Ministers. There are two sides to this very important question. Undoubtedly the drilling of our senior and junior cadets is already improving the physique of our lads, and the effect will be still more marked a little later. Apart altogether from its efliciency f cr the defence of the Commonwealth, the good results that are being obtained from our defence system in this direction must not be overlooked. It has been remarked, too, by critics that the young Australian shows a tendency to disregard restraint, and lacks discipline, and That lad if there is anything that will correct these faults it is undoubtedly the training that is being given to our cadets. The scheme outlined by Lord Kitchener, as I understand it , had for its object the creation of a Defence Porcei n Australia to be equal in efficiency to the standing armies of Europe, and he thought that such a force could be brought into existence only by commencing the training of our lads at a very early age. There is no doubt that what we learn in our younger days retains a hold upon us for the rest pf our lives. It is easier for us to learn in our youth than in later years, and it is obvious that there is a great deal of truth in the view expressed by Lord Kitchener. We should, therefore, pause before indulging in any sweeping condemnation of a system which has a beneficial effect on the physique of the youth of the country, and must ultimately give us a Defence Force of real value.

It is certainly very attenuated, and the sooner the present difficulty is adjusted the better.

I think this will happen, and, therefore, I desire to call attention to what it means. as I say, I were to write to the Government next February or March, and call the attention of the Prime Minister to the matter, I should be politely informed that the Government had decided to do so-and-so, and that that was an end of the matter. word against Sir William Creswell, whom I have known for many years, and whom I believe' to be an able and efficient officer, of long experience and training in the Royal Navy, and as one of the South Australian naval officers. But I object to naval men having to do with the mercantile marine, and I have expressed this opinion more than once. am not going to say that if this appointment be made we shall have any occurrence of an outrageous character' on the part of ship-masters or other officers in the mercantile marine on the Australian coast, but there is not any one of those men who will not feel that the wrong man has been placed in the position. I do nob hold a brief for any person, but I think that the House is entitled to be very emphatic in this matter, and to take care to express its opinion before the event happens, because it is very difficult to supersede an officer after he has been once appointed. not in any way be exceeding its rights if we indicate to the Government the desirability of weighing the suggestion I am should be a man connected with and knowing marine. should have the confidence of those engaged in our coastal trade, in order that, as far as possible, there may be an absence of friction. that there must be friction to a certain extent; but we should take care not to leave any ground for complaint on the part of ship-masters or ship-owners. There is a very great difference between the training and every-day work of an ordinary Board of Trade ship-master, and the training and work of an officer in the Royal Navy. What would be said if , for instance, an able soldier like Major-General Kirkpatrick [129] were to be appointed Postmaster General? I do not suppose that that gentleman would care about the post, but some people might ask what reason there was for supposing that he would not do the duties very efficiently. Major-General Kirkpatrick might, of course, make a If, very good Postmaster-General, but, at the same time, the chances are very much to the contrary. His splendid military training, and the position to which he has attained, only show that, while his opinions in one walk of life may be worth a great deal, they may be worth very I am not going to say one little in another direction. Personally, I regard the rumours to which I have referred as feelers put out by the Government; and, if they are realized, the appointment w ill , in my humble judgment, prove very unsatisfactory. I have been very much dissatisfied with the administration of the Naval Boardi n another conI nexion. I am not going to criticise particular actions here and there, but merely refer to the general lines ou which the Board has acted. Before the new defence scheme was brought into effect, each State had some sort of naval defence plan. C do not suggest that the defence then provided was the best, but it was the best that could be provided for the money. The meu in the old naval brigades voluntarily undertook the work, and were quite willing to give up their Saturday afternoons to their training. In South Australia we had the 1'rotector, manned by volunteers, during the China War, and The House will they left a very satisfactory record of their work in connection with the British expedition. WhatI wish to refer to particularly now is the treatment of apmaking. Whoever is appointed plications for employment, and promotion by members of these old naval brigades, thoroughly the mercantile by the Naval Board. Such applications It is highly desirable that he are always "" turned down,"" and several instances have occurred in my own State. When I asked a question regarding one of these cases, the answer I got was that Of course, we know the most efficient and suitable person had been appointed. Such an answer is on a par with that of the doctor who, when he was asked what was the cause of the death of one of his patients, replied that he had died from want of breath, aud it does not "" cut much ice."" When I find that men of the stamp to which I have referred never get any recognition at all from the Naval Board, to what conclusion can I come except that there is a prejudice against those mena prejudice which I do not think either Parliament or the country desires to see exercised 1 I do not wish honourable members to understand me as saying that these meu of the old naval brigades are as efficient and up-to-date as those who have recently come out from the Old Country, but I do say that many of those men are quite competent for any small office or promotion that may offer, and they should not be refused on the ground that they are not part of the new system. days there was a possibility of the members'of these brigades passing certain examinations, and not being overlooked; and I hope that such will be the case at present.

They all in reply thanked us for having approached them in this way, and all had to decline undertaking the work. In no case did they state the time in which it could be done. All the replies are not in similar terms. The Clyde Company replied' as followsReferring again to your letter of the ioth inpany to British specifications was apstant, re eight "" P "" class locomotives, we have been looking into the matter thoroughly, and we are extremely sorry to say that it is extremely impossible for us nt the present moment lo undertake the contract. We arc so controlled by the want of boileimakeis, that it is of the greatest difficulty in getting work out of the shop. If we could only get more men of that class, there is no doubt whatever we could have undertaken these locomotives. I believe the position they took up was a fair one. because there has been an enormous demand upon locomotive development, especially in New South Wales, where the Government, which belongs to the same party as my honourable friends opposite, have recently allotted a tender for a considerable number of locomotives to be imported. In view of the fact that the Australian manufacturers were not in a position to make an offer, I took immediate steps to secure competitive offers from foreign firms doing business in Australia. The following offers were received:-R . W . Cameron tendered on behalf of the American Locomotive Company of Americaf o r a total of £19,516, the engines to be shipped in four months; but this tender was not recommended by Mr Deane, for technical reasons. Newell and Company, for the Baldwin Locomotive Works, America, put in two tenders, one for the American standard of engine, the other for the British standard of engine, the American to be shipped in nine weeks. gine will last out two of the Baldwin engines. standard engine of the Baldwin Locomotive Company, the four engines to be shipped in fifteen weeks.

Robert Stephenson and Company, England, offered to deliver in twelve months, and the North British Locomotive Company, of Glasgow, offered delivery in eleven months. They were also obviously out of court on the question of time, so that, in the circumstances, the recommendation of tlie E n gineer-in-Chief for the delivery of locomotives by the Baldwin Locomotive Comproved. They are to be consigned, of course, to the Minister of Home Affairs, and come in free of duty, as is invariably the case with goods for use by the Commonwealth; b u t in this case no question of protection enters into the matter, as the local firms were not in a position to do the work. Newell and Company's offer is for £5,260 for each engine, delivered at Kalgoorlie, and £4,844 delivered at Port Augusta, freight included. The estimated cost of erection is £ 1 0 0 in each in stance.

Clyde Engineering Company Limited, New South Wales. Walkers Limited, Maryborough, Queensland. F . S. Barbat and Sons Limited, Ipswich, Queensland, and Jas.

I accordingly recommend that competitive offers be invited from the representatives of British and AmericanW e accepted the British firms. On that fact becoming known, it was decided immediately to set about procuring Adams and the engines. The American Company's offer was for delivery in fifteen weeks at the works in America.

Tbe people of Queensland are very concerned about the establishment of the Beef Trusti n the State, knowing the evils that it has wrought in other countries, and the difficulty of rooting it out. Government proposes, I understand, to impose a duty of £ 3 or £4 a head on killings for export by any company which exceed 3,000 head of cattle a week, and if this Government intimated to the Beef Trust that something of the same kind would be done here, it might not extend its operations so widely. It is feared that when the trust takes control of the Bibooka Meat Works, behind Cairns, the price of meat will increase rapidly, and already a big increase has taken place, many of the local butchers finding it necessary to sell their businesses, and give up altogether, because they are satisfied that the price of cattle will be increased to such an extent that they will be unable to compete against the trust in the purchase of f a t stock. The works of the trust are so situated that, with the aid of the Queensland railway system, it w ill be able to drain to them the whole of the fat stock of the State, and that of the northern part of New South Wales. The meat works behind Cairns will be able to deal with all the cattle iu the northern part of the State, right up to the Gulf country, and if the works are not as elaborate as may be thought necessary, they can be added to. The works at Alligator Creek will deal with the whole of the cattle in the north-western part of Queensland. There are one or two other meat works in that part of the State, but as in Argentina, the trust will offer such prices for cattle that all competitors will be driven out of the field. Armour and Company, and Swift and Company, in the Argentine, gave prices for cattle that the other companies could not compete against without losing £ 3 or £ 4 a head on the deal. panies were also undersold upon the Loudon market. trust would have taken entire possession of the Argentine had not the Government stepped in . There are ten or a dozen meat companies operating in Queensland, but before the Beef Trust has been operating for twelve months, I do not think it will have any competitor. A p parently, this Government is not very anxious for the suppression of the trust, but, like the Queensland Government, is ready to receive it with open arms. Mr. Denham has told the people of .Queensland that he is pleased that the trust has established itself in the State, and that he is giving it every assistance.

Having regard to what the Beef Trust has done in America, and to the operations of trusts at election times in that country, we have every reason to conclude, from Mr Denham's refusal to give the names of those who subscribed the £4,000, that some people who are trying to curry favour with the State Government subscribed the money for a purpose -well known to many. ber"" any other evidence? dence. any more ? ber describe as evidence the information he' has just given us? been convicted on much lighter evidence in the Courts before to-day in the nature of evidence. to convince the honourable member, b u t I and many people in Queensland are thoroughly convinced about this matter.

They do not intend to bother very much about the English market. They w ill supply American people with Australian meat to the great detriment of the people of the Commonwealth. W it h in a very short time the people of Australia will not be able to use much meat. The price of meat will be so high that but few people will be able to obtain it . The family of the average working man at the present time consumes from 10s. to 12s. worth of meat per week. A few years hence a working man will not be able to buy one day's supply of meat for that amount. It is all very well for the Government to treat It is not the only this matter lightly, but in the course of a few years they w ill deeply regret their inaction. It was the fear of the Beef Trust establishing itself in Queensland that led to the people of that State voting solidly for the Labour party, and in favour of the referenda questions, at tlie last general elections.

313,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta,"Tuesday's Age the Prime Minister is reported to have said that, although the Government have been in power for a limited time only, they have saved £1,000,000. I would like to know where this saving has been effected, and I trust tliat, before this debate is finished, the Prime Minister will give us details of it . I have looked around to t r y to find out where savings have been made. There are some alleged savings. In tlie same speech the Prime Minister is reported to have 6aid that the Government had saved £126,000 in connection with not procuring some rolling-stock that had been ordered by the previous Government. peculiar line of reasoning. money can be claimed to have been saved, we have to assume that the rolling-stock which would have been procured would be worth' nothing. such a ridiculous tiling as that £126,000 could be saved on that transaction. have previously stated very f u l l y what led up to the superseding of the agreement that was entered into with the South Australian Government by the late Minister of External Affairs, the honourable member for Barrier. I have shown the extortionate rates, that were being charged by the South Australian Government at Port Augusta, and I have pointed out that the Sonth Australian Commissioner of Railways. w.ould not allow the Commonwealth to have a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge roadway ou to the wharf, and that, consequently, the Commonwealth had to handle all their material twice; and, when we come to think that something like 200,000 tons of material had to be handled, and that the Commissioner of Railwaysi n South Australia refused to allow us the right to construct a roadway on the wharf, it meant, as the Minister of External Affairs thoroughly knows, a very serious addition to the cost of. handling material for the East-West railway. It was that which led up to the late Minister of External Affairs giving notice to the South Australian Government of the termination of tlie agreement. fact that we were being charged 12s. per day for rolling-stock, whereas private contractors were being charged 2s. 6d. per day. to the. fact that, although they had a. money. capacity of 12 to 15 tons, on the truck*; belonging to the Victorian Governmententering the State of South Australia* the charge is only 3s. per day, yet we werebeing charged 12s. per day for trucks of . a capacity of 5 to 8 tons. That led up to the absolute necessity for the late M in ister of External Affairs to give notice of the termination of the agreement. Therehad to be twelve months' notice given, and the honourable member for Barrier took advantage of that, and gave the necessary notice. It was because that notice was in existence that the present Minister of External Affairs was enabled to make a new agreement with the ComI t is a missioner of Railwaysi n South Australia. Before this I do not know the whole of the details of this agreement, but, from what the M in ister has told me, I understand that it . is a very satisfactory one. A t any rate, it . We cannot imagine is a much-improved agreement to t h a t which was in existence previously. But I the order for rolling-stock to the value of £126,000 was given by the late Government because neither the South Australian Government nor the Commissioner of Public Worksi n South Australia, nor ' the Commissioner of Railways, wouldtreat with the Labour Government. They took up a dog-in-the-manger attitude, and.' would in no way meet the representatives of the Commonwealth to make a more suitable arrangement for the work a t Port Augusta; and, as the Government of South Australia refused to sell or loan the Commonwealth any rolling-stock,. itbecame absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth to be ready with their* own rolling-stock on the 31st December of this year-the date of the termination of the agreement with South Australia. This was to cost the £126,000-' which .the Prime Minister referred to the other night as being one of the savings effected by his Government. I think it is very unfair for the Prime Minister to make these statements when he ought to be in a position to know that there is-a very pronounced qualification to this statement. Even assuming that we had bought the rolling-stock at a cost of I have already, referred to the £126,000, we, at least, would have had the rolling-stock as an asset representing-, the £126,000: bought it .",43,Chapman Wa S It Not

In the Age of the 6th of this month, the following appearsBEEF TRUST INLONDON . MICH COMMISSIONER'S VIEWS. TlieHigh Commissioner for Australia, Sir George Reid, is under no illusions as to the effect of the operations of the Beef Trust, whether in America, the Argentine, London, or Australia. He views the possibility of the trust obtaining control in Australia with alarm, and he warns pastoralists of the need for the utmost caution in entertaining trust offers. In the course of an interview on Monday, Sir George .Reid said, in reply to questions, "" The effect ef all that I have learnt of the operations of the Beef Trust, which for the purpose of this No doubt, all the question may be called the American Beef Trust, is that the danger from it is increasing. The trust companies are quietly and steadily endeavouring to undermine all their competitors. To do this they often sell their meat below current quotations, incurring temporary losses cheerfully as long as they can beat the rival off the field. They are prepared to give any amount of money in order to secure tenancies business of any of the stalls at Smithfield Meat Market in London. I cannot say of my personal honourable knowledge, but I was told on good authority is that one of the American companies offered to pay ;£S,ooo for the weekly tenancy of a stall which would be considered a very small shop. This action obviously had a motive beyond ordinary business. "" The men most interested in the Australian trade as buyers from the pastoralists and exporters to Great Britain are very nervous concerning the .outlook in Australia, and in London. They say that a dead set is being made upon them. They are particularly nervous over the recent development of the Swifts in Australia. I can quite understand their anxiety. From all I could learn in the United States, speaking generally, the Beef Trust control of the trade began with the offer to cattle raisers of higher than ordinary prices. In this way the trust companies curried favour most effectually with the meat raisers. When, however, they had secured an enormous preponderance of control in the trade, the companies in the Beef Trust altered their policy entirely. There was no longer a generous treatment of the meat raiser. Quite thc opposite. The meat raiser found not only lower prices, but the trust so fortified in To-day, there are a number of the markets that even if the stock raiser tried to do business with rival firms it was almost impossible to do so. In a thousand and oneways the trust was found to have fortified itself against rivalry, and to have control of meat supplies right from the cattle market to the meat eater. The probability is that the same trade principles will be applied by the trust in Australia. The trust will be mure than liberal to the pastoralists, some of whom may have come to think that the Australian buyers I find that the have not given them all lhat they desired in the way of price. The pastoralists may be disposed to accept the opportunity of making more money. But, if the trust manages to knock out the AusI should like the tralian buyers, the pastoralists will find they will have to pay back in future lower prices Sir every penny of the enhanced price obtained when the trust first came on the scene. These trusts are not out to benefit any but themselves. They are out to crush any one who competes with them, and once in command to get as much as they can. You may say that the motive of gain is common to men who are not in trusts. But there is a considerable difference between the legitimate competition of men in business and the supreme control of a trade in all its branches by a selfish trust like the Beef Trust. When a trust gives a favour you may be sure that you or some one else will have to pay for it -and a good deal added to."" Turning to the Imperial aspect of the Beef Trust's operations, Sir George Reid said :"" From the Imperial, and from the naval and military points of view, the position is f ; : l ! of interest. If the Empire were at nnv time brought within reach of war, or in danger of",45,Chapman Wa S It Not

They would be able to levy what prices they chose to the Navy and Army for supplies, I think, therefore, it would be a calamity if they were allowed to become the sole meat authorities of the world. There is no despotism in the world worse than lhat of the trusts. in trade does not slacken for profits; it seems rather to increase the appetite for even greater profits. I don't want to say that every monopoly is a curse. That would be an extreme thing to say, because occasionally monopolies may not be a curse. But, speaking of the American Beef Trust, there cannot be much hesitation, for you have the benefit of knowing its working in the United Statesthe home of trusts. "" If the pastoralists create a situation which leaves these trusts masters of the field, they will have to pay back all that they are ever likely to get out of them, more than they think they would get from Australian buyers-and still remain at the mercy of the trusts. It is a superficial thing to say that the moment the Beef Trust shows its claws the pastoralist will go to some one else and sell his cattle or sheep. Once the trust gets Ihe power it seeks it has a thousand and one ways of keeping it, and controlling the supplies of meat from the plains of the 'Never Never' to the stalls at Smithfield Market. People must not imagine that the agents of these trusts confine their energies to getting the pastoralists' meat. Their energies are just as much directed to -getting power at the markets' end. If the pastoralist who broke with the trust got his meat to London, he would find that his battle was only beginning. He would find the trust ready to drop hundreds of thousands in order to hold the position. If the trust would spend a lot of money to secure control, it stands to reason it would spend great sums in maintaining. Anything like trust control of the food of the poorest of the people is very repulsive to one.""

B ill providing for the transfer of the Territory was presented, the present Prime Minister asked when the Government proposed to pass a B ill providing for the administration of the Territory, and he complained that the Government had no definite plan for its settlement and development. When the preseut Leader of the Opposition made his last financial statement in this House, some twelve months ago, the present Treasurer, in referring to the Northern Territory, saidI want to get something for the expenditure. I wish to know that the Government are going to do something with the Territory. Up to the present time. I am not aware that they have done anything except to make some appointments. . . . The Government should have had a definite policy in regard to this immense territory. It is nearly two years since we took it over, but no progress has yet been made with its development. What is the use of providing a small sum for a railway survey to the Katherine River? . . . Boldness based on knowledge and experience is the only plan for developing a great country. We ought to have been at work already in regard to this matter. I think we might reasonably ask what the present Government propose to Those who are familiar with the history of the Territory know that when we took it over we were confronted with many difficulties. Liberal party had talked of taking it over. sary to do so: that the problem of developing the Territory was too big for T h a t is what Mr Prank South Australia, and that it should be transferred to the Commonwealth. But it remained for the Labour party on sucI am saying it about ceeding to office to take over the Territory. When we did so we found that The honorvery little work had been done tliere for some years. The Government of South Australia, not knowing when the transfer would take place, had done, and rightly done, but very little. H a d they expended large sums of money on certain lines of development they might have acted unfairly to the Commonwealth. It it is on record in was quite possible that the policy pursued by them would not meet with the approval of the Federal Parliament, and, I would like to see it . therefore, they did but little. All the No . The honourable memspade work had to be done by the Labour Government. A number of officers who had been employed by the South Australian Government were naturally withdrawn from the Territory immediately after its transfer to the Commonwealth, and it remained for us to create certain Departments, and make certain appointAs far back as ments. Notwithstanding these difficulties with which we were confronted we were criticised. by honourable members opposite, who said we were doing very little. The present Prime Minister was continually chiding us, and newspapers throughout Australia were also attacking us, because we did not do more in the way of developmental work. I venture to assert, however, that the present Government has enjoyed advantages in regard to the Territory that we did not possess when we took it over. Wheni t came into office the Departments necessarjr to its development had already been established, and oflicers had been appointed. Some of the men appointed by us may not have been, in the opinion of some honourable members, the best that could be chosen for the position. That, however, is a matter of opinion. The fact remains that the present Government have not done any work that we were not doing or did not contemplate. In his policy speech at Parramatta, the present Prime Minister said that if the Liberal party came into power they would proceed with the development of the Northern Terrido. tory on vigorous lines, the inference being that we were not doing so. If the present Government intended to carry out the promises made on the huntings, For a number of years the then it seems to me that the Treasurer should have foreshadowed in his Budget They had said that it was necesstatement an active policy of development.

The Prime Minister and his party may not have f u l l power in the matter of legislation, but the honourable gentleman could have placed on the Estimates whatever sums he thought necessary to provide for the proper development of the Territory, and the policy of the Government in this regard could have been announced in the Treasurer's financial statement. however, that the Government have done absolutely nothing that was not. being done before they took office, I think I may say that they belong to the class of politicians who are prepared to promise a good deal when in Opposition, b u t who, when in office, are not ready to perform much. what they have done in the Northern Territory, and by the promises they made when on the hustings in regard to the saving of interest on the big debt that we took over with the Territory, then it seems to me that we have a right to speak of them as being mere time-servers -as men who are prodigal in promise, but niggardly in action. of my charge against the Government in respect of their inaction in the development of the Northern Territory is that they have not gone on more rapidly w i th the construction of the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine Biver.

The statement to which I have referred is recorded in Hansard, and I say that it was the intention of the late Government to go on with that railway. We called for tenders for its construction. They were received in the middle of June, but, as I understand the matter, the present Minister of External Affairs turned them down, on the ground i h a t no B ill had been passed authorizing Amongst the construction of the railway. In ordinary circumstances, I should say that his action was justifiable; but I regard this as a case of emergency. I could have understood the action of the present Government if they had decided on some other route, or had come to the conclusion that a line should not be constructed from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. Buti n the Loan BiH submitted by the present Government they made provision for the borrowing of money for the construction of a line from Pine Creek to representing the Katherine River, and on the business-paper of this House there is an Order of the Day iu charge of the Minister of D i d the honourable External Affairs for the second reading of a B ill to authorize the construction of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River.

That charge was hurled against us from every Liberal platform. It was said that our legislation had made the cost of living higher, and that we had caused the necessities of life to be dearer. I suppose most honourable members will admit that the price of commodities and the necessaries of life sometimes depends upon forces quite outside of anything within the power of any political party. There are some natural forces> more powerful than anj human effort. No ; I am not disappolitical party, Liberal or Labour, is able Every one should know what to baffle Nature, or overthrow the decrees of Providence. We may have two or three seasons of drought in succession, and this would make the commodities and necessities of life dearer. We might have prosperous seasons in which wealth might be pouring into the country, and when wealth might be better distributed, so that the purchasing power of every man might be greater, and then the commodities and necessities of life might become dearer, and the cost of living higher. I take it there is another way in which we, as a Parliament, have power to increase the cost of liviug, and that is by excessive taxation. I admit that if a Government taxes people unjustly, and squanders money unwisely, the cost of living may be increased. I expect that was the accusation that was hurled against us during the last election, but it seems to me that the Budget presented by the Treasurer is a long denial of that propaganda of mendacity that was entered into by tbe Liberals during the last election. No taxes have been remitted, and services COOK I suppose you that have been instituted are still to be carried on, so that either the Liberal party, during the last general election, placed false issues before the people, or else, in the hour of victory, they are false to the promises they made upon the hustings. Considering the Budget as a whole, whilst there are some things in it with which we do not quite agree, what strikes one most is the number of things that were once denounced by the present Ministerial party. We find in the Budget the land tax, which the Treasurer once called a forced levy on 14,000 people. Nevertheless, it is still there. The maternity bonus is still there, During the general although the present Prime Minister called it a huge joke, and also said it meant grinding the people into the ground with taxation. I suppose that, for all that, it will be continued. The Commonwealth notes are still being issued, although I heard the honourable member for Calare say in this House that one reason why there was a stringency of money was because the Commonwealth Bauk was issuing its own notes.

Although we were defeated on the hustings, they are carrying out our programme, and we have every reason to be proud that so many of our principles appear, f u l l of life and activity, in the Budget now submitted. Minister) .[9.53] I should like to congratulate the honourable member for Barrier on the fact that he is almost as leisurely in Opposition criticism as he was at one time in Ministerial office. We have heard a good deal from him about what it was necessary for the Government to do in the Northern Territory and elsewhere, but he wants us to do in a few months what he failed to achieve during years of office. I do not want to criticise his administration in the spirit of the criticisms that it has taken him about an hour to pour upon our heads, but I should like briefly to refer to the criticism of one of the supporters of his He had then been two and a-half years in office. The critic was one of his own colleagues in the Labour party, whom the honourable member for Adelaide declared in the New England electorate, at the last election, was a very loyal and valued supporter of the Labour movement; yet, when moving the adjournment of the House to protest against what was being done in the Northern Territory, he said, as recorded in Hansard on 25th October, 1912I t is with some regret I take this step, but I am forced to do so by the action of the Minister of External Affairs himself. I bave been approaching the Minister on this matter for some time, and, although I have given him ample opportunity to fix the whole business up, he has refused to do so. This Labour critic, Mr Prank Foster, M.P., then went on to sayI submit this letter, which comes with the stamp of the Amalgamated Workers Association This letter was not a Liberal concoction.

493,Mr Kelly (Wentworth,"Honoraryregarding the results of the administration, of the honourable member, who now realizes that the Northern Territory is a -danger point instead of the bed of roses upon which he had been reclining for about tliree yearsAt a general meeting of the members of this Association, held here on the 2nd instant, the following resolution was unanimously carried, protesting against the employment of Asiatics in thc various Government Departments of the Northern Territory, viz. :Domestics employed at Government House, -employees in Railway Department ancl Hospital, also a Chinaman employed in printing the Government GaselU. Kindly do your utmost to rectify this anomaly. We arc writing for co-operatiori from BrokenH ill Trades Hall Council, also writing the Minister of External Affairs. Yours fraternally, AI.F. H . HlLDER, . Hon. The Committee which has just listened to all tliese criticisms as to the activity that ought to have actuated us in our three or four months of office w ill be really amazed to find that one of the honourable member's ex-colleagues in the Labour party formed so valuable a conclusion as to the f r u it s of the honourable member's administration after two and a-half years of experience. I desire to put on record the facts as I see them regarding the Oodnadatta railway. spoke as if no saving was made by our making a i arrangement with the State of South Australia to operate that service for us, but when honourable members hear the facts, and realize the conditions, they w ill see that a saving of £ 12G,000 has been effected by a very business-like and simple arrangement. A l though the Port Augusta wharf and the Oodnadatta to Port Augusta railway were taken over under the Northern Territory Agreement, which was concluded by Mr Deakin when Prime Mnister, and passed into law by honourable members opposite during their term of office, they promptly proposed to lease out the wharf, although they must have known they were going to build a transcontinental railway very shortly. B y so doing they exposed the Commonwealth in the construction of the transcontinental railway to the cost of the double handling of all the goods that they landed on that wharf. As soon as the railway started, the Commonwealth railway officials drew the attention of this statesman to the muddle into which they were thrown, and strongly urged h i m to get control of that wharf at all costs. Obviously if you have to handle several hundred thousand tons of material you must have your own trucks of your own gauge going down to your own wharf, and taking those goods straight up to the rail head. If they have to be landed from the slings into small carriages on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and then transferred a mile or two outside the town on to other trucks on another gauge for transmission to the rail head, you will have a break there which is going to be as inconvenient as it is expensive. For that reason these gentlemen were asked to get out of the mess they had got themselves into by Secretary. leasing out the wharf. How did they propose to do that? It was uot by coming to a common-sense business arrangement with the State which would have enabled us to keep the wharf, while allowing the State at our cost to operate the Oodnadatta railway. They proposed to get out of their own muddle by operating both the railway and the wharf. Now, let us see exactly what the proposition meant. The Oodnadatta-Port Augusta railway is built on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. As honourable members know, South Australia has two gauges operating, one of 5 f t . The honourable member 3 in . , and the otber of 3 f t . 6 in . This particular line is a part of the 3-ft. 6-in. system, l t is a part of that system which is busily used for a portion of .the year only. I think I am right in saying that occasionally, when the cattle and the stock are going down, they have as many as six trains a week going over the line. But for the rest of the year for a period varying from six to nine months-ther e is only one passenger train a fortnight going over the line to Oodnadatta. In other words, a good deal of rolling-stock is wanted during the busy season, and practically none for the rest of the year. What can South Australia do ? It has the whole control of its 3-ft. 6-in. system; it can throw its rolling-stock into that place at the time the line is busy. It can take its rolling-stock away from the balance of this system, and so without purchasing hew stock simply arrange its stock and move it as the freight requirements demand. It can itself quite cheaply, comparatively speaking, operate this line. rolling-stock, but its staff of men.",60,Fenton Le T The Farmers Get R I D South Australian Government That I T
494,Mr Richar D Foster,"Not only itshas at its command the whole resources of the Quorn office and its 3-ft. 6-in. system. to take over this line which is used only for some months of the year to any appreciable extent? would have to stock up for the whole of the year with our own material to its f u l l requirements. men, resources, and every single thing must be stocked for the whole year, although we would only require this aid for a short period. We were faced with that problem when we got into office. of the first papers I saw was a paper calling for tenders for the supply of rolling stock at a cost of £126,000 to operate the line. I submit, was prefectly right. We said that the State Government and the Federal Government are alike, acting as the trustees of the Australian people; and where, by co-operation and harmonious working together, the State and the Federation can effect economies, it is the duty of both parties to come together. Acting upon that principle, we approached South Australia, and pointed outthat the requirements of Commonwealth construction necessitated our getting the control of the Port Augusta wharf to save double handling of our own goods consigned to the rail head. that. economy required that the State, at our cost, should work the railway for us with its additional resources that do not have to be added to for particular periods. That is the whole thing in a nutshell. The State fell in with us. to approach the State reasonably, not with the suspicion which was indicated in every word which the honourable member uttered about Mr' But l er vernment of South Australia prepared to extend that spirit of co-operation to the Labour Government of the Commonwealth ? doubt in the world that the State Government would gladly have done so. slightest doubt that they would never have dreamed of doing so. cion that stops honourable gentlemen from doing their simple duty in that way. Had they approached the Government of the The State State, I have not the slightest doubt in the world, since they have asked the question, that the State Government would What would it mean if we started have inmiediatsly realized the mutual advantage of some such proposition as that, and would have done exactly what the It would mean that we Liberal Government have done. It never struck them so to do. I honestly believe that they overlooked the straight way out Not only material, but of the difficulty, just as they were blind to the danger of handing over the control of the Port Augusta wharf when they handed out the lease just before they started to build the railway. One There is another point which makes it still clearer that the purchase of the £126,000 worth of rolling-stock would have been sheer waste. By the time we What the present Government did, have the transcontinental railway completed we hope to have a general movement going on throughout Australia for conversion to a uniform gauge. Could we, in common reason, hang back from our own duty to convert the Oodnadatta line in company with the conversion which we would .be asking South Australia and the other States to undertake ? And the moment that we convert this 3-ft. 6-in. lineto the 4-ft. 8 i in. gauge to set an example to Australia, that moment the £126,000 worth of rolling-stock would become useless for Commonwealth purposes. We went further than to a 4-ft. 8 i in. gauge there will not be We said tliat the necessities of much of it left . man is a pessimist.

I think it is only fair to the officer to say that. Mr Deane addressed this minute to the Secretary to the Department of Home AffairsWith reference to the attached papers (yr. R. 13.1714), I beg to say that in connection with the eight extra steam locomotives, with tenders, wbich are required for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway, I had proceeded with the preparation of the specification and plans so as to be in a position to call for tenders, as instructed by the late Minister in his minute of the 3rd May, 1913Much time has elapsed since then, but the delay is entirely owing to the difficulty I had in obtaining a certified copy of the specification and plans from the New South Wales Railway Department. I mentioned this matter to the Minister yesterday, as he was anxious that whatever was done, the early delivery of these locomotives should be secured. To call for tenders in the usual way means the expenditure of more time than is absolutely necessary. Time would be saved if quotations were asked for as on the previous occasion, and it is presumed that if it is given out that British and American tenderers wil l receive due consideration the same firms will tender as before. A still quicker delivery could be secured if negotiations were started at once with Messrs. R. Towns and Company, the Sydney representatives of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, to supply these engines at the same terms, and on the same conditions, as they previously tendered. I believe an arrangement could be made by which at least four of the locomotives could be shipped by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in four months' time. I shall be glad to know what the Minister desires .me to do. No further time can be lost; and if the Minister so wishes, I can open up negotiations with Messrs. R. Towns and Company, or can send letters round to the same firms who tendered before, asking for quotations at an early date.

Then the Government woke up to the necessity for communicating with certain firms who do this particular class of work. They forwarded communications to five of them. Incidentally, I may mention that one firm in Victoria, to which I have referred on the public platform, speaking of the profits which, according to their own prospectus, they were makingI refer to Thompson's, of Castlemaine-and which holds a contract for the supply of forty locomotives to the order of the Victorian Government, did not receive this communication at a l l . local firms should be approached. were approached was that of Barbat, of Ipswich.
