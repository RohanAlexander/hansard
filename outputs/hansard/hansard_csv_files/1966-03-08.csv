There have been only 17 Prime Ministers over 65 years. It has been on the average a long time between Prime Ministers. One lasted only seven days, another nine days and anotner nineteen days. So the occupancy of the office is rather greater than the average would suggest. Of course, we do not propose to allow the present Prime Minister to hold his position for 16 years or even 16 months if we can prevent it. Today we come to praise the new Caesar, not to bury him. We are turning history upside down. We will bury his policies as soon as we can. But while he occupies the high, honourable and great position of Prime Minister of Australia, he can be assured of the courtesy of this side of the House and its co-operation in the discharge of the business of the Parliament. The parliamentary institution is our great part, Sir, I share with him the regard for safeguard against tyranny of all kinds. If this institution.

It was indeed a very great shock and a matter of profound distress to us all that Mr ing figures of the new nations of the ComShastri should have been taken so suddenly from this world. History will, I am sure, record Mr Shastri as one of the great men of India. He will take his place in the records beside that of Mr Nehru. It was my fortune to have had discussions and negotiations with him just several weeks before he died, meeting him then for the first time. He was a man of very small stature, a frail man, but clearly a man of great strength of character who was perfectly clear in the things that he stood for and the things he wished to resist. He served not only his country, and his fellow countrymen well but he also served the world well in meeting the responsibilities he carried during his period of office. I am sure many people felt that it would be extremely difficult for India to find somecountry's federal politics when the Nigerian one to fill the shoes of Mr Nehru. In his short period of responsibility Mr Shastri certainly did this. All his public life he demonstrated a capacity for understanding the point of view of the other person as well as for propounding his own point of view. His character revealed him as a man capable of settling issues by reasonable compromise. The great crowning point of his career was his achievement, in conjunction with Ayub Khan, of peace and a new measure of stability in relations between India and Pakistan.

Our Commonwealth of Nations sustained another heavy blowa blow felt throughout the world-wit h the tragic death by massacre in January of one of Africa's foremost statesmen, Sir Abubakar Balewa, Prime Minister of Nigeria. Sir Abubakar had shown himself to be one of the outstandmonwealth. I know that he enjoyed a very high regard among his fellow Commonwealth Prime Ministers. I have frequently heard Sir Robert Menzies and my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck), speak of him in the highest terms from their own contacts with him at conferences. His death came at a high point in his career, shortly after he had been personally presiding at the conference of Prime Ministers held at Lagos, the capital of his own country. The Commonwealth looked to Sir Abubakar as a moderating influence in a troubled continent. Calm and dignified in demeanour, he was widely acknowledged as a man of integrity, fairness, courage and sound judgment. Sir Abubakar entered his Federation was established and in 1952 he was its first Minister of Works. His reputation grew steadily, and by 1957 he was Ohief Minister. He played a large part in the formation of a national government and it was as Prime Minister on Nigeria's Independence Day in 1960 that he received the constitutional instruments from Princess Alexandra. In the same year he was knighted and in 1961 he became a member of the Privy Council. Sir Abubakar had a firm belief in the leader, clear minded, sagacious, tolerant, and just.

That any man, particularly a man of such distinction as Sir Abubakar Balewa, should have been so cruelly butchered by his own people is a terrible reflection on those responsible for the deed and is a reminder to all of us that the veneer of civilisation is very thin in certain parts of the world, lt is of no use for us to try to establish that we are better than are those responsible for this foul deed.

The Parliament is the poorer for the passbers. We are the mourners of a friendship which, I believe, touched every member of the Parliament. There can rarely have been a member of the Parliament in either House who was more popular or held more deeply in affection and respect than Shane Paltridge was. He was one of the Government's ablest Ministers and his loss takes from us a colleague whom we remember with respect and deep affection. He was more than a parliamentary colleague to many of us; be was more than just a personal friend. He was a truly remarkable man whose abilities took him to high offices in the land he loved so well.

15,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Prim eParliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Committee. During the period up to 19SS he was active in these capacities as well as in his general parliamentary service, but in that year he was promoted to the Ministry. His first portfolio, in which he quickly demonstrated his administrative abilities, was that of Shipping and Transport. He held that post from September 1955 to February 1960. He will be best remembered, perhaps, by most for the sterling work he performed as Minister for Civil Aviation between 1956 and 1964. He spared no effort to give Australia a standard of civil aviation measuring up to the best in the world. He made a first hand study of airline operations in many countries and negotiated important international air agreements for Australia. During his term as Minister for Defence he conducted-as those of us who sat with him at the time remember vividlya searching review of our defence programme and of the nation's defence needs. He was Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1959 to 1964 when he became Leader of the Government and, as a consequence, a member of the Senate Standing Orders Committee. The defence portfolio came to him in April 1964. As Minister for Defence he went to South-East Asia and the United States of America last year, visiting Australian forces in the field and negotiating defence contracts. At various times in his career Sir Shane Paltridge acted for the Minister for Labour and National Service, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Civil Aviation and the Treasurer. The death of a man wilh such talents as an administrator and with such breadth of experience at a time when the best years of service seemed clearly to lie ahead of him is a tragic loss to this country. We can regard ourselves as fortunate to have had the benefit of his wise counsel in Cabinet for so many years. He devoted much of his life to public service and during his paradministration of several important portliamentary career gave unstintingly of his time, his energy and his great abilities. The award of a knighthood by Her Majesty the Queen in the New Year Honours List was a well deserved recognition of his service to Australia. He served his country well in the Second World War as a gunner with the 2/7th Australian Field Regiment. That is in outline a recital of a great career of public servicea distinguished, a successful career-'bu t as we reflect on it today our minds will tend to dwell increasingly on what we recall of a very remarkable man-hi s warm personal qualities and the loyalty and depth of friendship that he accorded to all his colleagues. Those of us who were privileged to know him require no verbal tribute to keep our memories of him fresh and green. The contribution that he made to his country will have a lasting memorial in the gratitude of his fellow Australians. He will be sadly missed, of course, by his many friends in his native Western Australia, where he had come to be one of the leading figures of his own community. But it is the members of his own family, who are well known to so many of us in the two Houses of the Parliament, who have suffered the most grievous loss. Those of us who were at the funeral ceremony will recall the calm and courageous dignity with which his widow and his two daughters comported themselves in their sadness. Our deepest sympathy goes to them. Through the years we shall recall the richness of our friendship with a man who found a place in the hearts of all of us. the Opposition) -Senato r Sir Shane Paltridge certainly did serve his country well in war and peace. He died too young. He lived in an important period in Australian history. He was privileged to hold ministerial rank in that period. He was a kindly, affable and friendly man who usually wore a smile and seldom wore a scowl. He sought to ingratiate himself with all whom he met and all whom he knew. His political beliefs were definite, but he was not so positive a party man that he would refuse to consider other points of view. I believe that therein lay some of the reason for the success that he achieved during his folios. I was shocked when I learned that he was so near death, because I had seen him in Canberra only a few months earlier and there seemed to be no evidence then that his end was so near.

22,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"^Leade r ofcolleagues I am sadly happy that the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) has taken the opportunity to pay tribute to the memory or Albert Victor Thompson. He was one of the old, traditional Labour men. He was born in Port Adelaide in 1886 and died at almost the age of 79. After receiving his primary education, he was engaged in general farming and dairy farming for 13 years. Then he became a foundation member of the Carters and Drivers Union. He worked as a member of that union at a time when the working week extended over 48 hours and men worked in their own time for an hour to prepare their horses before going out for the day's work. Bert Thompson knew much of the rigour of labouring life at the beginning of this century. But in spite of all his tribulations the iron never entered his soul. He was a really good citizen who lived according to the parable of the coin. He rendered unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's. He identified himself quite early in life with the Salvation Army and it happened, as happened with the Methodist founders of the British Labour Party, who -were preachers, that he preached his religious beliefs on Sundays and at street corners and then on other occasions he preached his political beliefs. He always spoke and behaved, as the Prime Minister has said, with great dignity and great decorum. Bert Thompson, despite his early setbacks, became an authority on public finance. Though he never claimed to have mastered it, he understood it. He served on the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament for more than 10 years. But even before that he had been appointed by the Curtin Government a member of the Commonwealth Housing Commission. He made his own real contribution to the work of that Commission and its findings were accepted on both sides of the Parliament and became the basis of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreements which still operate in thc Australian States. As we all knew, Bert Thompson was one of the kindliest men who ever entered this Parliament. I never heard him say an ill word of anybody and I never heard anybody say an ill word against him. I join with the Prime Minister in offering, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, sympathy to a wonderful helpmate who is now his widow and to the devoted children, grandchildren and others who presented to us an example of the way in which a family clan can be built around the life and times of one man. Trade and Industry) Mr Speaker, I wish to associate the Australian Country Party with the expressions of sympathy at the death of Albert Victor Thompson. He, as we all know, clearly stood out as a man of great integrity and great sincerity. By any standards he was clearly a good man and I am sure that his memory entitles him to the respect of the Parliament, his party and the community in general. He served the Australian Labour Party and the Australian public for a long time-1 7 years as a member of this House and 16 years in the South Australian Parliament. He served at all times with distinction and a complete consistency of attitude that was one of the notable features of his political attitudes and utterances. Mr Thompson was a man whom we regarded as having had a full and useful life. He went from us holding our warm respect for all that he meant here and to the community at large. I associate my Party with the expressions of sympathy to his widow and family. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and the Deputy my brief but sincere tribute to the late Albert Victor Thompson whose long period of public service, both State and Federal, was so outstanding. Mr Thompson was a man of the highest possible moral and religious character. He was loved and respected by us who were fortunate enough to know him. His approach to life was based on honesty and tolerance. I cannot recall his uttering a nasty word in all the years I knew him, nor can I recall a bad word directed at him. In the city of Port Adelaide and the surrounding districts the name of Bert Thompson is loved and respected by people in every walk of life. I join with the previous speakers in tendering sincere sympathy to Mrs. Thompson and her family.",20,Death Of Mr Albert Victor Thompson

25,Prime Minister ( Mr Mcewen) And To Offer,"I too would like to say a few words about Albert Victor Thompson. I knew him all my life. My earliest memories of him go back to an occasion at the Largs Bay Public School when I was aged 10 and when he entered first into public life and was introduced to a gathering there. Eight years later be became the member for Semaphore in the South Australian House of Assembly. He resigned years later to enter the Federal Parliament. My late father was proud to call him a personal friend. My father, as leader of an independent group in the Port Adelaide City Council, for many years as Mayor, often was politically apparently opposed to A. V. Thompson, but this in no way dimmed the respect and regard in which my father held him. Indeed, I grew to know that A. V. Thompson's word was his bond, that he was a big man and that he had a big heart, a big spirit and bigness of character and outlook. He was too big for petty or negative ways. In Federal politics A. V. Thompson's work and his worldly wisdom brought him affection and also on occasions envy and perhaps antagonism. I regret that he retired from this House immediately prior to the election at which I became a member of it. After 33 years of parliamentary service, hefinallyleft the vocation which he loved and in which he had served so well. As one who was a constituent for a large number of years and as the son of one of his friends, I pay this personal tribute to his memory. I also wish to offer a tribute to the late Mr place is always improved by men of his . Thompson, not as a fellow member of the same party, but as one who had the privilege of working with him on a parliamentary committee. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) referred to Mr Bert Thompson was a genius for detail. Thompson's outstanding service on the Public Accounts Committee. My remarks will be related to that service. Mr Thompson's voice was a strong one indeed in this chamber, not only in its tremendous volume, which none of us will ever forget, but in the intensity with which he was glad to raise it in the interests of the parliamentary institution. Because of his service on the Public Accounts Committee, when that Committee presented to the Parliament its 66th report, just after Mr Thompson -retired from the service of the House, it saidAlbert Victor Thompson was a dedicated member of the Committee. He advocated constantly the value of its work in respect of the preservation of the rights of Parliament. As a foundation Committee member, from 25th September 1952, he continued to serve until his retirement from the House of Representatives at the end of the Twenty-fourth Parliament. He was appointed Vict-Chairman on 22nd March 195(5 He continued in that position until the time of his retirementand in this capacity contributed distinguished and valuable leadership. On behalf of the many senators and members who were associated with this parliamentary colleague, who sat with him as a member of the important Accounts Committee, I am happy indeed to pay these few words of tribute and to associate myself with the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) and other leaders in our genuine expressions of sympathy. associate myself with the motion which is before the House and which pays a wonderful tribute to Bert Thompson who came into the Parliament at the same general election as myself. Bert Thompson was a sincere and genuine parliamentarian. I could not think of Bert in any other field of employment or in other field of activity. He seemed to me to be what I would call the perfect parliamentarian in his attitudes to his comrades in this place, in his electoral work, in his intense regard for detail and in his complete sincerity in all he did. Above all, he was a sincere Christian. I feel that this calibre who come with his beliefs and basic faith to a Parliament with all its problems, its challenges and its tests of character. It may not be known to all honourable members, that when he drove his motor car most weeks between Adelaide and Canberra he kept a detailed record of his petrol consumption on each trip. He recorded even changes of tyres. This is an interesting facet of his life and it was symbolic of the way he regarded all his work. He did things to a pattern and with a purpose. I pay a tribute also to his amazing general knowledge. Have we ever had",21,Death Of Mr Albert Victor Thompson

Is this treatment contrary to the rules for field punishment? If so, what action is being taken against the officer responsible for ordering such punishment? relevant information relating to this matter has not yet reached Australia from our Command in South Vietnam. The court martial that arose as a result of Gunner O'Neill's refusal to obey commands occurred last week and messages have been sent forward so that the full proceedings will arrive in Australia as soon as possible. I ask honourable members to bear in mind the circumstances of the theatre of operations. It is not easy, from the ease of security of Australia, to appreciate the situation in Vietnam. able member may wish to visit Vietnam to see for himself. There is one point that I should -like to emphasise. The original charge against Gunner O'Neill was that of being absent without leave when he was rostered for operational guard duty. This is regarded as a most serious offence. When he was discovered after this particular incident he opted, after discussions with his Commanding Officer, to take the C.O.'s punishment instead of insisting on a court martial for that offence. The C.O.'s award involved field punishment for 21 days. This required the soldier to wear field uniform instead of his being able to go around more lightly clad. It involved also the loss of privileges, such as that of using the canteens, protective work at another point on the during this time. It also involved half an hour each day either cleaning' out the storm drains or drilling. Gunner O'Neill refused to undertake this field punishment, though he had opted to take the field punishment instead of being court martialled for his initial extremely serious offence of absence without leave from operational guard duty. The full proceedings of the court martial will arrive in Australia as soon as possible, and the matter will be fully examined then. Until this incident there had been no cause for our battalion in Vietnam to need a normal place of detention. This incident has demonstrated the need for it and instructions have already been issued so that suitable facilities may be provided for detention purposes. I think that is all I should say at this stage, having regard to the fact that full information about this matter has not yet reached Australia. representing the Minister for Works a question.

I am bound to say that in view of the reciprocal interests of ourselves and the United States of America in the Vietnam business and in the defence of South East Asia it would be a good thing if there were reciprocity in the supply of arms and equipment. This is a matter which I had the pleasure of discussing with Mr are few, if any, instances of articles being Robert McNamara last year. We had undertakings from him that Australian traders would be admitted to a fair share of the production required for the defence effort in South East Asia and these undertakings are being carried out.

Has the Government considered the introduction, with the co-operation of the States, of measures-temporary , if need be-to discourage price increases associated with the changeover to decimal currency? In view of the publicity given to price increases, could the Decimal Currency Board give similar publicity to any price reduction resulting from the conversion to decimals? Is the prime reason why the Decimal Currency Board is not doing this that there cheaper when priced in dollars and cents? I have had frequent consultations with the Decimal Currency Board in order to try, to the maximum of our capacity, to ensure that prices do not rise as a result of the changeover to decimal currency. The Board has reported to me that it has tried, to the limit of its capacity, to keep prices down. many cases, it is beyond its capacity to do so, as it is beyond the capacity of most people to do so. But what the Decimal Currency Board has done is to report to me that there have been many cases of a reduction of prices, as there have been many other cases also of an unjustifiable increase in prices. and cigarettes were a classical example where there had been a significant reduction in price. degree of seriousness with which honourable members opposite view this question.

We have devoted a good deal of attention to the drought situation persisting over large areas of the Commonwealth and the problems arising from the ramifications of the drought. Before commenting on these matters, I would like the House to know that the Government will be inviting it-o n two occasions I shall mention-to give recognition to the distinguished public and parliamentary services of my predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies. Sir Robert established a remarkable record of more than 18 years of leadership as Prime Minister, more than double the previous record length of service in this office. Tomorrow, I shall present a resolution to the House enabling us to place on Parliamentary record our appreciation of his many years of service. On 17th March, the Government will be holding a Parliamentary dinner in honour of Sir Robert and Dame Pattie. I also mention the Government's decision to defer, until the next Parliament, the referendum on the two proposals to amend the Constitution which were passed by both Houses of Parliament towards the end of last year. We would have preferred to let the question of deferment stand until such time as we could have benefit of parliamentary discussion and decision concerning it. But this course was not open to us because, as matters stood, the Chief Electoral Officer would have been required under the provisions of the Act to post the arguments for and against the proposals to some 6,000,000 voters before the end of February. Therefore, in practical terms, it was necessary for us to make and announce the decision before we met the Parliament. In pursuance of this decision, we will recommend to the Governor General in Council that he should not issue the writ provided for in section 5 of the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act. We remain strongly in support of both proposals. But we are a new Government and, inevitably, much occupied not only with the very many important and pressing matters arising at home and abroad, but with other matters which beset a new Government. A referendum campaign would be an extra and lengthy commitment. In these circumstances, and because there is no urgency about either of the proposals becoming law this year, we believe that it would be better to defer the holding of the referendum. However, we intend, early in the life of the next Parliament, to introduce the necessary legislation to enable a referendum to be held on the proposal to break the nexus between the two Houses of Parliament. We will also then give a general indication of our intentions in relation to the distribution proposals which would be made should the referendum prove successful. We intend, at the same time, to present also the proposal relating to Aborigines. This proposal has been supported by all political parties, and there was indeed no negative case prepared for circulation to the electors. Any delay in passing the referendum in relation to the counting of Aborigines will have no adverse practical result because, in fact, the Commonwealth Statistician does count the Aboriginal natives in the community and makes the figure public. The provision in the Constitution does not amount to an impediment against this counting. Nor does it prevent Aborigines voting; many of them do. We, nevertheless, believe that the provision should be taken out of the Constitution. It is outmoded and misleading, and gives unwarranted cause for criticism both inside and outside Australia by people unaware of the actual situation. As I said when announcing our decision to recommend a deferment, we are sensitive to the fact that the Parliament has supported in both Houses the referendum legislation which the Menzies Government presented. We believe, however, that members in both Houses will recognise the reasons which have influenced us, and will approve our decision to defer the proposals for the time being. The deferment is being made with a view to strengthening, rather than weakening, the prospect of success for the two proposals. I turn now to aspects of foreign affairs and defence with which we have been dealing over recent weeks. In our first month of office, we had visits from Mr Denis Healey, the British Minister of Defence, Mr Hubert Humphrey, Vice-President of the United States, and His Excellency Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, Prime Minister of Thailand. Each of these discussions was of importance for Australia. Each of them required considerable preparation and close consultation with our civilian and military advisers. Mr Denis Healey, the British Minister of Defence, visited us for four days from Monday, 31st January. The talks, although occurring within the first week of our taking office, were most timely. They were held at a time when the United Kingdom Government was coming to major long term decisions, subsequently incorporated in the White Paper on defence recently presented to the United Kingdom Parliament. Mr Healey had been set the task of framing a defence programme which would contain British expenditure on defence in 1970 within the equivalent in that year of £2,000 million sterling today. This task called for some drastic adjustments. One of the possibilities coming under public discussion in Britain was a withdrawal of British forces east of Suez. Mr Healey made it clear to us that his Government did not hold any views on these lines. But the general proposition had found support amongst highly placed parliamentarians on both sides of politics. The United Kingdom Government decided-in our view, very wisely-that it would continue to maintain a global role in world affairs and that as part of this role it would continue to maintain substantial forces in South East Asia. The Canberra talks were of tremendous value in enabling us to make a frank exchange of views. Mr Healey made it clear to us, in direct but friendly fashion, that if British troops had to leave Singapore, then either they would have to be accommodated in base facilities on the Australian mainland or they would have to go home. For our part, we were willing to plan against the contingency that Singapore might become untenable at some future point of time and have now put in hand a study, at the Service level, of various possirespective activities in South East Asia. bilities and their feasibility. However, we emphasised strongly the need for a continued British presence in South East Asia, and we affirmed that the bases in Singapore and Malaysia, in which we share and to which we have made substantial contribution, should be retained for as long as possible. The British presence on the mainland of Asia provides an essential stabilising and moderating influence, and aid to morale. British departure from the scene could have disastrous consequences. We are gratified that the United Kingdom Government has confirmed, in the White Paper, its firm intention to continue to maintain the bases in Singapore and Malaysia so long as the Governments of Singapore and Malaysia make this possible on "" acceptable conditions"". For Australia this is a most significant and welcome decision. Mr Dean Eyre, the New Zealand Minister for Defence, participated in all the discussions with Mr Healey. This Government wishes to increase its co-operation with New Zealand in defence matters and, indeed, in all other matters of mutual interest. The ANZAC tradition was forged between us in another great struggle fought by the forces of freedom to resist aggression. The grim events in Vietnam and Indonesia's ill-conceived confrontation of Malaysia have brought us closely in association again. Our discussions revealed complete identity of view between our two Governments. It is worth recording that the British Government carried out its recent defence review in a way which was, we believe, unique in British history. It was probably the first time the British Government has ever tried to look so far ahead in planning its foreign and defence policyMr Healey's talks with us ranged over the period from the 1970's to the 1990's-and it is also the first occasion on which the United Kingdom has consulted so closely with its allies before final recommendations were adopted by the Cabinet. Arising from the Canberra talks, jt was agreed with the representatives of Britain and New Zealand that consultations will continue at ministerial level. We felt that there should be discussions between ourselves-that is, the three Governments-and United States representatives on our These should not be confined to political and defence matters. We all are involved in military action in one area or another but we all are also participating in programmes of economic and social aid in the area. It would be of great advantage to develop the widest possible agreement on policy aspects and to see how far our activities can be co-ordinated. It was of great advantage to us to receive a visit from Vice-President Humphrey and Governor Harriman so soon after the defence discussions with Mr Healey. The Vice-President was with us on 18th and 19th February. This is only the second occasion on which a Vice-President of the United States has visited Australia. Mr Humphrey came to us after a rapid tour embracing a number of the key countries of South East Asia. He was able to bring us a complete account of the talks between President Johnson and Prime Minister Ky of South Vietnam. We found our own assessment of the situation there, based on information reaching us from our own sources, to be very much in line with that conveyed by Vice-President Humphrey to us. In his public statements in Australia he brought out compellingly the critical and fundamental character of the struggle in South Vietnam. We had earlier told him we applauded the initiatives advanced by Prime Minister Ky and President Johnson for a vigorous programme of economic and social reform. We all recognise that there is far more to the problem of South Vietnam than the checking of the Communists by military means. There is a need for reconstruction and rehabilitation. There is a need for an effective national administration pressing on with desired reforms and the improvement of standards. Most of the people of South Vietnam live in villages and hamlets. Many of these have suffered the ravages of terrorist activities for years. First, the affected areas must be cleared of the enemy and made secure against Vietcong reinfiltration. The next phase is the establishment of effective administration so that the benefits of modern services can be brought to scattered rural communities. So many leaders have been murdered that the Government of South Vietnam has launched an extensive, but concentrated, programme of training. It aims to produce as quickly as possible successive teams of people who will return to the ravaged areas as leaders in various activities of significance to the local communities. They include people trained in the business of administration and government, and in health and rural development; they include also teachers and personnel trained to undertake such rehabilitation tasks as the building of homes, schools, roads and hospitals. Already hundreds of these teams are operating and the South Vietnamese Government plans to have many more available by the end of 1966. The Government is planning in this way for the progressive rebuilding of the social fabric of the community. Australians are assisting in this valuable work. I speak, in particular, of our surgical teams, which are providing medical help in a country which has far too few trained doctors serving the community of 14 million people. Australians are also helping as advisers in agriculture and road building. I pay tribute, also, Mr Speaker, to the contributions made by Australian forces in the area. Since 1962, we have had military advisers with the South Vietnamese forces. These are highly trained and dedicated men, who at great risk, and in some cases casualty, to themselves, have stood beside their South Vietnamese counterparts in the field. Since 1964, a flight of Royal Australian Air Force Caribou aircraft has been used in a great variety of ways for general transport purposes, and to bring supplies quickly to meet emergency needs. Last year Australia committed the First Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment to Vietnam, which was subsequently expanded to a battalion group. The Battalion has to great effect and purpose been conducting operations from its base at Bien Hoa, and has earned praise and respect from our South Vietnamese and American allies. Vice President Humphrey made particular reference during his visit here to the high value placed on the Australian contingent, both in their role as fighting men and their conduct generally amongst the Vietnamese people. The Vice-President spoke of the overall prospects in terms of what he described as "" restrained optimism"". The information we and the Americans have is that the tide of war is turning in our favour. Progress is being made in rescuing new areas, in clearing them of Vietcong and in preparing them for orderly civil governnient. The critical nature of the conflict in South Vietnam has not been fully recognised by all, and this certainly includes many members of the Opposition. We are told that we over-simplify the issue there. It is more accurate to say that our critics overcomplicate it. We still hear from some representatives of the Opposition that this is a civil war and that we have no good cause for participation. This view runs against all the information and advice reaching us. The discovery by our own forces of extensive headquarters and military facilities in close vicinity to Saigon illustrates the long-term planning and the years of preparation with outside assistance which lie behind the activities of the Vietcong. This is no civil war. It is the principal present manifestation of the expansionist activities of Communist China. These activities are channelled through, and directed from, Hanoi. All the countries in South East Asia are facing the threat of Communist China's expansion in one form or another. In Laos, for example, there is fighting between Chinese-supplied Pathet Lao-o r Communist forces-and the forces of the Government. The Prime Minister of Thailand and the senior Ministerial colleagues who accompanied him gave us a graphic account of increasing Communist subversion, infiltration, and terrorist activities threatening that country. In India there have been direct attacks by troops of the Communist Chinese Army across the Indian border. Honourable members will see in these and other countries the manifestation, in one form or another, of externally-directed Communist aggression. We were able to discuss all these matters fully and frankly with the Prime Minister of Thailand and his distinguished Ministers in Canberra recently. We shared a common view of the situation in Vietnam and agreed about the incessant and widespread nature of Communist pressures in South East Asia. The Thai Government, let it be said, has a proud record of domestic achievement. It is a responsible Government which has committed the services and facilities of government and administration to the goals of economic and social progress in the spread of education, health and medical facilities and social services generally. Its record of ecopolitical systems other than its own. nomic advance is impressive. National in* come has been increasing at an annual rate of seven per cent, for the past decade. Agricultural production is currently increasing annually at about 6.3 per cent. This is a country under Communist pressure. It is a country that we are glad to have as an ally and we look forward to the multiplication of our interests and associations. IN SOUTH VIETNAM The war in South Vietnam has many brutal aspects. What has been far too little perceived is the systematic destruction of leaders in the villages and hamlets in which most of the population of South Vietnam lives. The Communists deliberately eliminate any elements in village communities who might hold out some hope of effectively rebuilding their community. In the last two years, more than 3,000 local officials and civilians have been murdered. The leaders include teachers, medical workers, leaders in politics and administration, and technical experts of one kind and another. We can all picture the mental anguish and physical distress caused by this systematic butchery and the dislocation it brings to the life of the community where it occurs. AH this is what Communism in Asia means. It does not stand for peaceful political and economic change. In the words of a leading Communist military theoreticianGeneral Giap of North Vietnam"" armed struggle and political struggle are very closely co-ordinated "". Of South Vietnam he says, "" armed struggle has budded forth from political struggle."" Communism in Asia is the politics of brutality, the politics of disruption, tbe politics of the exploitation of backwardness. Its highest form is the ""people's war"". That is to say, the brutality and viciousness of guerrilla warfare practised against an entire population-men , women and children alike. A study of North Vietnam's pronouncements in respect of South Vietnam reveals the complete rejection of peaceful co-existence. Its language is the language of power, of protracted struggle, of repression, and it shows no disposition to tolerate the existence of neighbouring social and Neither we, nor our allies, are in South battalion group arid associated headquarters Vietnam for territorial gain or colonial and Royal Australian Air Force personnel. power.

Our capacity to increase expenditure on defence and foreign aid will depend on the success of our efforts to ensure that our own economy is soundly based and continues to develop rapidly in stable conditions. I now turn to our latest survey of the economy. This Government retains the same broad economic objectives which, successfully pursued by Governments led by Sir Robert Menzies, resulted in the greatest era of economic development in Australia's history. Our slogan of ""growth with stability "" will continue to guide us. We shall of demand and unemployment. The Governaim at the highest practicable level of national development and growth of industry. A policy of full employment has been successfully conducted with remarkably littlefluctuationthroughout our years of office. It remains in the forefront of economic policy. Our national growth has been associated with a programme of immigration on the large scale. This will be continued at the highest level we find it practicable to sustain. The inflow of people has been accompanied by an inflow of finance, estimated at $24 million, is being capital responding to a climate favorable provided by the savings banks for housing to enterprise, skill and initiative. honourable member's urging to me after the approach applies to other sectors-subjec t last Budget.

Its extent is the more remarkable because the Governments in the two Queensland has been a great misfortune in principal source countries from which this many ways. Most of all, it has been a misinvestment comes-the United Kingdom fortune for the producers in the drought and the United States of America-hav e areas. They have suffered heavy losses and both imposed some restraints on external investment. The combination of favorable growth prospects and stable economic and political conditions are proving strongly attractive. Australia finds 90 per cent, of its capital investment from its own savings, but our rate of growth has been greatly assisted by the savings of others who bring new industry, new techniques, new equipment and new skills to us. Within the past fortnight, we have had discussions with representatives of industry and commerce andfinance.These have been followed by discussions in the Cabinet. It is clear that the measures adopted in last year's Budget succeeded in bringing about a better balance between supply and demand in the economy.

96,Mr Harold Holt,"Well, a jolt is defence and for developments of a kind thats great deal ot personal hardship. Our sympathy goes to them as we join our hope to theirs for early relief. The drought has been a misfortune for the industries which serve the rural producers, such as the makers of agricultural machinery. It has been a misfortune for the economy because it has brought a heavy cut in rural output. We have felt the effects in exports for this financial year and we will possibly feel it still more heavily in exports for 1966-67. The Commonwealth Government and its agencies have, from the start, viewed the drought as a national problem. The first requirement is that of assistance while the drought is still on. The provision of finance national interest that, so far as finance is for this purpose rests largely with the tradnecessary and can help to keep down ing banks and, from all the information I have, they have done an excellent job.,They have been assisted in this by the Reserve Bank which has seen t'o it that there was no policy restraint on their ability to lend for the purpose and that they had the liquid resources to support their customers all through the drought areas. The Commonwealth Government has backed the State Governments with finance in all the relief measures they have found necessary., It has done this by grants and advances to enable the State Budgets to carry the costs of drought relief and to make loans to drought affected producers on easy terms. In fact it has assisted the States on a quite unprewider need for increased capital investment cedented scale to carry out drought relief measures. ... Unfortunately, the drought has not passed even in Queensland, where there have been rains, and in New South Wales it is worsening. The Commonwealth will continue to assist the States tofinancetheir drought relief measures as far as necessary and for as long as necessary. Where rains have fallen, and the restocking of properties vary in detail and emphasis, they all conhas become possible, a need for restocking finance has arisen and is expected to grow as and when the drought is relieved. Here again, the provision of finance will largely be a matter for. the trading banks..The Reserve Bank will support them in this to the' full extent. The Commonwealth Development Bank has also been lending for the purpose and the Government will ensure that it has the resources to continue doing sb. i.;There will, however, be producers who, flor one reason or another, cannot get adequjte bank finance for resrocking. The Premier of New South Wales has written to me about this. He has proposed that the system of loans the State is making to producers for relief purposes should be extended, with necessary adaptation, for restocking purposes. Under this system, loans are made up to certain limits at low rates of interest and with provision for a deferred repayment period. I have advised the Premier of New South Wales and also the Premier of Queensland that the Commonwealth is prepared, for this purpose, to extend the support it has been giving to the State for other drought measures. Obviously, it is only sensible and very much in the drought losses and get farms and stations back into full production as the drought lifts, it should be made available. The need to sustain and increase rural production for domestic requirements and for exports is as important today as it has ever been in our history. The drought itself has demonstrated a need for more investment in rural industries to strengthen them in various ways against a recurrence of drought from which we have had the good fortune to be relatively free over a long period. This need for drought mitigation work merges into a in the rural industries. On the one hand, we will need more and more rural output to provide exports. On the other hand, the scope exists for progressively increasing rural output in a variety of ways, all of which require increased capital expenditure on farms. -We have had a great many opinions as to where the main need lies and, while they verge in a requirement for improved facilities to provide longer term rural development finance on a term loan basis. We are convinced, however, that the need is not so much for any radical innovations or new machinery as for improvement and extension of facilities .which have already proved their worth, r The Commonwealth Development Bank, established in .1960, has already made a valuable contribution towards meeting the needs for developmentfinanceby rural and btner industries. However, we believe that the special problems of the farmer would be better served if there were facilities exclusively devoted to his credit needs. Accordingly, the Government has under consideration the establishment of a separate Rural Division within the Commonwealth Development Bank. Legislation will be required for this. The Government believes it is desirable to provide the farmer with greater access to medium and long term capital for development purposes through his own private bank. The term loan funds, introduced in 1962, already go some way towards meeting this purpose. The Government now proposes to consult with the trading banks with a view to establishing farm loan funds separate from the existing term loan arrangement. The funds would provide finance for medium and long term development purposes including the purchase of land and measures for drought recovery and mitigation of future droughts. Subject to suitable arrangements being made with the banks, it is envisaged that a sum of $50 million will be available for these farm loan funds. This will be in addition to the arrangements now being made by the Reserve Bank to increase existing term loan funds by $20 million. So, from those two sources a total of $70 million, most of which will be for rural purposes, will be available. able gentleman knows, there has always been a preferred rate of interest for rural borrowers. It is contemplated that overdraft lending to farmers will continue as before. In addition, the trading banks will, we hope, be lending from the new funds on a long term basis on reasonable terms and conditions. 1 hope to be able to make arrangeand myself to discuss these matters with the Reserve Bank and the trading banks in the near future. The Government is exploring an insurance scheme to cover loans made from the farm loan funds of the banks. Tbis will be done in order to ensure that this kind of lending is not unduly restricted by security considerations where projects otherwise offer excellent prospects of success. From the national standpoint, action in this area is directed initially to the building up of our export capabilities, whicn are one of the great key requisites for ensuring continued growth. As such, it is to be seen as part of a many sided programme embracing not only assistance, direct and indirect, to exporting industries, but all that goes to the discovery and development of resources, such as mineral exploration, oil search, water conservation, road, rail and port improvements, scientific research and extension services, in fact, most of the main branches of developmental work. One of the most encouraging facts about exports in recent years has been their increasing diversification. Rural exports still predominate, and will do so for many a day to come. But they are being increasingly and most opportunely supplemented by exports of minerals and of manufactures. One of the main topics discussed with industry representatives last week was that of export incentives for manufactures. It was the unanimous view that the scheme introduced in 1962 had yielded excellent results; The Export Development Council told us that it was making a general review of the subject, on which it would be reporting to us. It asked that certain features of the existing scheme which had come to be regarded as anomalous should be removed, and we have undertaken to consider this. It strongly recommended that the Government should give an assurance that export incentives will be continued after the present legislation expires next year. It is certainly the general intention of the Government that this should be done. Industry representatives also urged upon us most strongly the need for encouraging the pursuit of research and development in manufacturing industry. The Government has been impressed by these views and is considering various proposals for assistance to industry in this field. Our approach to development generally, and northern development in particular, will continue to be both vigorous and comprehensive. Achievements to date have been very much more impressive than published criticisms would suggest. When account is taken of current and proposed work, the total of public and private investment for northern Australia is in the vicinity of",39,Economic Affairs

99,Ments For The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon),"$2,000 million. The Government will maintain close co-operation with State Governments for development purposes. The planning and construction of public developmental projects are primarily matters for State Governments. The Commonwealth Government has assisted the States to undertake a variety of projects by means of special grants and loans. We recognise, however, that while our activities can sometimes trigger off worthwhile developments, or act in aid of the development undertakings of others, the major contribution will be made by private enterprise and the initiative of private investors. A recent example of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States towards development was the announcement by the Minister for National Development ( Mr central Queensland. In addition, considerFairbairn) on 24th February that the Commonwealth and State Governments have agreed that Australia should increase its rate $130 million. In this case, the Government of softwood planting from the present 40,000 acres a year to 75,000 acres for the next 35 years. The programme recommended will meet Australia's most urgent 'needs in the foreseeable future. Imports of timber and other forestry products now cost Australia more than $200 million a year. This cost could treble by the end of the century if we fail to increase our planting rate. The Commonwealth Government has offered the States about $20 million in long term loans over the next five years to help lift the planting rate in the Government softwood plantations. These loans will be interest free for the first 10 years. Commonwealth-State co-operation led to the formation some four years ago of the Australian Water Resources Council. Thanks principally to the provision of Commonwealth funds of about $5.5 million, expenditure on the investigation of water resources will increase by 60 per cent, in the $41.5 million towards the construction and three years to 1966-67. A further expansion of this work in the succeeding three years is being discussed by Commonwealth and State officers in Canberra this week. Examples of this co-operation are too numerous for me to list them all here, but I mention the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments in 1-962 to develop 4 i million acres of land for beef production in the brigalow belt of central Queensland, F1198/66 -JJ -12 } with the Commonwealth providing $14.5 million to finance the scheme. Despite severe drought conditions in 1964 and 1965, good progress has been made in development of the area and, as recently as last Friday, I talked in Canberra with the Premier of Queensland about a similar scheme for a further area of nearly six million acres in central Queensland. Expansion in the mining industry has been the most spectacular development in the north in the post-war period. New industries have been established at a number of places-bauxit e development at Weipa and Gove, manganese at Groote Eylandt, iron ore on the north-west of Western Australia, and at two centres in the Northern Territory, and coal at two centres in able expansion has taken place at Mount Isa, involving private investment of some has made this development feasible by providing $34.5 million towards the cost of reconstruction of the railway to Townsville. In the case of the bauxite deposits at Gove in the Northern Territory, the Government has negotiated arrangements for development of the field by a company with 50 per cent. Australian equity and with conditions requiring establishment of a plant on the site to process bauxite into alumina. The Commonwealth Government through its financial assistance in connection with the beef cattle roads has made an enormous contribution to the development of better road transport facilities throughout Northern Australia leading to a larger turn-off of cattle. Drought effects were alleviated by movement over these roads to better pastures. Since 1961-62, approval has been given for assistance totalling up-grading of roads for cattle transport in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The sugar industry which supports the bulk of the population in the north of Queensland has gone through a phase of expansion since 1950 with acreage and output both increasing by approximately 100 per cent. This expansion has been made possible by the successful negotiations of the Government which have enabled it to establish markets at home and abroad to absorb the increased output. Development of the industry over the past 15 years has led to substantial growth of cities and towns of the peoples of Asia can point to cultures on the north Queensland coast and to development and modernisation of harbour and transport facilities.

It is, at the same time, important that there should be a clearer understanding in Asia of our policy, and the reasons for it It is certainly not based on any false notion of superiority. We are fully aware that many dating back centuries before those of Western Europe. But, in these modern times, every country reserves to itself the right to decide what the composition of its population of standards and of national characteristics and to the maintenance of the essential strength from its unity and a community life problems. All countries in South East Asia maintain restrictions against immigration to policy has been firmly established since the supported. But it has been the wish of the Government, as it would be of the comadministered with a spirit of humanity and Following our most recent review, the made with advantage to enable more flexibility in administration. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Opperman) will Honourable members will realise, from The legislation being prepared will cover a wide and important range of subjects. Some of them are complex measures which will require much drafting and consultation, such as the shipping provisions for the trade practices legislation, and measures relating to copyright and off-shore petroleum. In relation to off-shore petroleum we have had a remarkable instance of effective Commonwealth and State co-operation in the arrangements reached after the discussions which have occurred. There is also the comprehensive review of the defence legislation. Other subjects will reflect our immediate preoccupations at home and abroad, such as the legislation seeking approval of our decision to join the Asian Development Bank, and legislation in regard to drought relief. I am sure that all honourable members will welcome our proposal to give full voting rights to the member for the Australian Capital Territory. This is a matter which I shall leave until tomorrow, when my colleague, the Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony), will be making a statement on it. My fellow Australians will find reflected in what I have said tonight lhe change of orientation which marks Australia's situation in this second half of the 20th century. We find ourselves playing an active and not uninfluential part in the world community, but we have become increasingly involved in the affairs of Asia. We have found our external responsibilities increasing as we have increased our population and economic strength. Others expect us to play an increasing part in military assistance, in international aid and in diplomatic discussion. We are all conscious of a heightened influence on our community life from a quickening spirit of nationalism. We see dangers ahead, but they seem to occupy far less of the horizon than happier vistas of national growth. We have the good fortune to live together in a true democracy. We breathe the air of freedom. We do not always succeed in doing so, but we have learned to co-operate effectively at all levels of Government, and in the relations between Government and industry. We are confident that our greatest years have yet to be. chagrin of the honourable gentleman opposite. I hope that he and his colleagues will be able to eradicate the repression under which they suffer. It is a privilege for all members of this Government to have the opportunity, through their Ministries, to make a contribution towards Australia's progress.

House that at the inaugural meeting of the Legislative Council for the Territory of Nauru on 31st January, I presented, on behalf of the Parliament, a chair for the Council President. The Council passed the following Resolution of thanksWe, the Members of the Legislative Council for the Territory of Nauru in Council assembled, express our thanks to the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia for the gift of a President's Chair which they have presented to this Council to mark the inauguration of this legislature. LOAN (AIRLINES EQUIPMENT) BILL 1966. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr McMahon, and read a first time. Second Reading. [9.59] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to a borrowing by the Commonwealth of up to SUS54 million from a group of commercial banks in the United States to assist in the financing of jet aircraft and related equipment being purchased by Qantas Empire Airways Ltd. and the Australian National Airlines Commission. It is the largest private borrowing so far arranged by the Commonwealth on behalf of Qantas and Trans-Australia Airlines. Each drawing from the loan will be made in the name of the Commonwealth and will be initially paid into the Loan Fund, prior to being advanced to Qantas or T.A.A. Accordingly, the Bill appropriates the Loan Fund to enable the proceeds of the loan to be passed on to Qantas and T.A.A. It also appropriates the Consolidated Revenue Fund to permit the Commonwealth to meet interest payments, repayments of principal, and other charges associated with the borrowing. As the two airlines will pay to the Commonwealth all of the funds necessary to meet these payments, the loan will involve no net cost to the Commonwealth itself.",44,Bills Returned From The Senate
103,Mr Speaker,I desire to inform the,45,Presentation Of President S Chair To Legislative Council
104,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Treasurer )The borrowing will assist Qantas to purchase three, four or five additional Boeing 707-338C jets. T.A.A. will use its share of the loan to assist in the purchase of one additional Boeing 727 and three Douglas DC9's. The amount of the loan will be reduced by $14 million if Qantas decides to buy only three new Boeings or by $7 million if it decides to purchase four. The new aircraft will increase the Qantas fleet of 707's to 22, 23 or 24 and will increase T.A.A.'s jet fleet to four Boeing 727's and three Douglas DC9's. The arrangements for the borrowing are similar to those approved by Parliament in November 1964 when the Commonwealth borrowed $US30 million on behalf of Qantas and T.A.A. The full proceeds of the loan will be made available to the two airlines on terms and conditions to be determined by myself as Treasurer, but these terms and conditions will be the same as those under which the Commonwealth -itself will borrow the money from the United States banks. As the airlines will be required to meet all charges under the loan agreement, the Commonwealth will therefore assume the function of an intermediary only in these arrangements. Prior to the present loan, aircraft borrowings arranged by the Commonwealth with United States commercial banks since 1956 totalled $US115.4 million, of which $US64.4 million has yet to be repaid. In addition, the International Bank and the Export-Import Bank have lent $US 39.2 million for aircraft purchases of which SUS12.4 million is still outstanding. From these borrowings SUS132.2 million has been advanced to Qantas and SUS22.4 million to T.A.A. Following sound commercial practice, the loans are repayable over the expected liSe of the aircraft and during the period that they are making a substantial contribution to the finances of the two airlines. Qantas of course earns more than enough overseas currency to cover the foreign exchange costs of the loans. Australia is a net importer of capital, and at the present time we are running a balance of payments deficit which is interest will become payable at an initial expected to continue into next year. It has rate of 5 per cent, for a period up to 21 been the Government's continuing policy to months. After this all drawings will be conarrange overseas finance for a large prosolidated into a single loan which will be portion of the cost of new aircraft purchased by its two airlines. The major part of the present loan will not be drawn until the latter part of 1966 and early 1967 and there are obvious advantages in taking steps now to ensure that funds are readily available to meet known future contractual commitments of this nature. In a growing economy such as ours it is inevitable that there will be a continuously increasing demand for imports of materials, capital equipment and other items which must be obtained from abroad. It is also inevitable that there will be periods such as the present when our foreign currency receipts from exports, capital inflow and so on will be insufficient to prevent some decline in our international reserves. The Government therefore believes that it should take advantage of whatever opportunities arise to borrow overseas at reasonable rates of interest in order to strengthen our reserves or to arrest the rate at which they are declining. The operation of the United States interest equalisation tax has placed difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth continuing its series of public loans on the New York market. Our most recent public dollar loans in May and November last year were floated predominantly in Europe. However, as I shall explain later, the tax does not apply to private borrowings of the type which we have been able to arrange with United States commercial banks. The loan covered by this Bill is being made by a group of nine United States commercial banks. These are listed in Section1 of the loan agreement which is annexed as the Schedule to the Bill. The two airlines will request the Commonwealth to make drawings on the loan when payments for the new aircraft are required by the manufacturers. Drawings are due to commence before the end of this month and are to be completed before 31st December 1967. A commitment fee of one-half of 1 per cent, is payable on undrawn amounts of the loan. As each section of the loan is drawn, repayable in 14 approximately equal halfyearly instalments over the period June 1968 to December 1974. The earliest instalments, those due in June and December 1968, will carry interest at the rate ol 5 i per cent., and this will rise in steps up to a maximum of Si per cent, for the portion of the loan repayable in 1974. The average interest cost over the full period of the borrowing is slightly less than Si per cent. In general the loan agreement annexed to the bill follows the form of the November 1964 agreement. Perhaps I. should bring section 8 of the Agreement to the attention of honourable members. This contains an undertaking by the Commonwealth that the proceeds of the loan will be used for the purchase of property manufactured in the United States. This undertaking creates no difficulties for us and, in fact, the total cost of the aircraft concerned will be greater than the amount borrowed. Under the provisions of the interest equalisation tax legislation, the United States President is authorised to extend the application of the tax to certain commercial bank loans if, in his view, the acquisition of oversea debt obligations by commercial banks has materially impaired the effectiveness of the tax. However, the legislation specifically exempts commercial bank loans from the tax if at least 85 per cent, of the amount of the loan is attributable to the sale of property manufactured or produced in the United States. Thus the borrowing will not be subject to the interest equalisation tax. Commercial bank lending abroad is subject also to guidelines which have been issued by the Federal Reserve system to reinforce the measures to improve the United States balance of payments, of which the interest equalisation tax forms a part. Each commercial bank was requested to restrict its foreign credits outstanding duroperate from Hth February 1966 while the ing 1965 to an amount not in excess of 105 per cent, of the amount outstanding at 31st December 1964. As the present loan came within these restrictions, some banks which had participated in Australian aircraft loans in the past found themselves unable to do so on this occasion, and the lending group contains a number of names which are new to these loans. In December 1965 the Federal Reserve the Customs Tariff 1966, pick up the tariff issued a new set of guidelines for banks and proposals introduced into the House since other financial institutions to follow during 1966. Each bank was requested to restrain any expansion in foreign credits during ihe year to an amount not exceeding 109 per cent, of the December 1964 total, so that the permitted expansion in 1966 will be even less than that permitted in 1965. The terms and conditions of the loan have been approved by the Australian Loan Council and the amount of the loan will be additional to the Commonwealth's loan programme of $A102 million for housing which was approved at the June 1965 Loan Council meeting.

If so, what was the amount sought and raised? 3. How was the money distributed and what amounts were distributed? 4. Was the general public invited to subscribe to the loan? 5. If not, who were the subscribers and what were the respective amounts subscribed? orable member's questions are as follows1. The Commonwealth has not raised a loan in the currentfinancialyear specifically for housing. 2. 3. 4. and 5. Subscriptions to Commonwealth loans in Australia are invited from the public and proceeds are normally used to finance the borrowing programmes approved each year by the Australian Loan Council. The borrowing programmes approved by the Loan Council include amounts for housing, Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Thus an important part of the proceeds of the two subscribed by the public, will be used to finance also of borrowings raised overseas for general purposes, are allocated between the Commonwealth and the States as necessary to finance the Loan Council borrowing programmes and redemptions of The two public loans raised in Australia during Freight on Butter.

112,Mr Mcewen,"The answers to the honoutlined by the honourable member. The position is as follows: General freight increases of 6.6% were recently negotiated between the shipowners and the Federal Exporters Oversea Transport Coinmi»ee which acted on behalf of all exporters. Subsequently the Australian Dairy Produce Board claimed that in the case of butter this increase should be off-set to some extent by savings which it claimed resulted from the introduction of a new type of packaging some eight years ago. 2. The Dairy Board has now reached an arrangement with the shipping companies for the settlement of this claim and shipments are now proceeding normally. Thus the problem to which the honourable member referred has been resolved. 3. The increase is not 10% but 6.6%. If this were applied fully the increase could amount to 9d. per box, or 30s. per ton, making a total freight charge of £24 10s. 4. The cost varies from port to port and from shipment to shipment, and is in the region of £2 10s. to £4 per ton dependent upon delays and overtime.
