That is facturing parts of CSIRO is no bad thing what we are doing-unlike the Whitlam years necessarily for primary industries. If they and the 25 per cent across the board cut, emphasise their work, put emphasis on value which really had a bad effect because the adding, that adds value to our primary execonomy was not expanding. So we have put ports, our resource exports. I make the point in place these measures that really bring that if there is additional money spent on about a restructuring and are broadening our service industries, this is no bad thing. If we base, and because we are able to lower levels get better transport, better financial services of protection we are lowering costs. Because and better services as a whole, this is no bad of all these measures we are getting fundathing. SoI am bringing out the linkages and mental restructuring and are enabled to pass the complementarities. on the benefits of cuts in tariffs.
