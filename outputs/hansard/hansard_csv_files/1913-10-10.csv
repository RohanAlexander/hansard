When does the Treasurer propose to introduce a scheme of social insurance? 2. Will the social insurance scheme be compulsory, and under what section in the Commonwealth Constitution is power given to make any person contribute to such a scheme? 3. Does the Government propose to pass a law to submit to referendum the amendment of the Constitution providing for power to establish a contributory system of social insurance? orable member's questions are1. The preparation of a scheme involves a great deal of research, inquiry, and consideration, and is being pursued with due expedition. The date cannot at present be stated. 2. Whether the scheme will be compulsory is necessarily one of the matters under consideration. It is not thought desirable for Ministers to express opinions on legal questions or on a question that, while the scheme is not complete, would be hypothetical. 3. Such submission must depend on whether it is deemed to be necessary or not. A t the present stage, there is nothing to show that such submission will be imperative. Minister, upon noticeWith reference to the following statement of the Prime Minister on 24th September, when speaking of the visit of Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, "" So far as I recollect, he wants a fee of 4,700 guineas, which will include the work of his own staff in preparing plans and reports after Ms return home.

There is, however, in the Trust Fund an amount available for the Fleet of £702,432, which has to be deducted, and consequently honourable members are now asked to vote' only £3,268,569. the Estimates will show how this sum is made up. There is £300,000 to be paid for the Fleet, £1,122,768 for works under the Department of Home Affairs, a further amount of £1,079,700 under the Postmaster-General's Department, £4,860 under £692,311 under the Defence Department, and £68,930 under the Department of External Affairs. amounts which the Government ask Parliament to vote under the heads of Departments, because the Department of Home Affairs, for example, does work for the Defence, Postal, and other Departments. I find that for the Postmaster-General's Department the estimated expenditure for the current year is £1,350,113, as against an estimated expenditure for last year of £1,152,275, and an actual expenditure of £1,086,615.

The estimate last year was £27,150, while the actual expenditure was £37,448. The totals, therefore are Estimate for this year, £3,268,569; estimate for last year, £2,789,092, and the actual expenditure Reference to page 232 of last year, £2,628,274. In regard to the Postal Department, honourable members will see in the report of my Budget speech and also in the Budget-papers that the whole expenditure from all sources this year is estimated at £7,150,275, as against £6,284,053 for 1912-13, so that the Treasurer's Department, we propose to spend £866,222 more than was spent last year. The Post Office expenditure provided for on these Estimates I have' abstracted the is £1,350,113. We also propose to spend £595,000 from loan funds and the balance of the Special Works Account, available from last year, £15,897.

The States were in exactly the same position on this question as if the people had carried the referendum, with the exception that the Financial Agreement was not made a permanent provision of the Constitution.

116,Mr Burchell (Fremantle) [11.20].,"Naval Base, still, on the broad lines of defence, I should like to know from the Treasurer where the expected expenditure is provided for on the Estimates or in the Budget-papers. On page 265 of the Estimates for additions to new works and naval works under the control of the Department of DefenceI see an item of £98,000 for naval works, including labour and material, and an item of £112,000 for machinery and plant. Whether they are the two items which will cover the expenditure on Naval Bases or not I do not know. Sir JOH N FORREST -Yes, they are. £200,000 £172,000 was expended, and in these Estimates we are asked to vote £210,000. That sum, I take*-' it , will cover not .only the two Naval BasesI have mentioned, bu t also other naval works. I should like to get from the Treasurer or the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a definite statement as to the estimated expenditure on those Naval Bases. If I remember rightly, when the Estimates were under discussion last year, according to Hansard a definite statement was made regarding the amount to be expended on the different Naval Bases, and I think that similar information ought to be furnished on this occasion. There is another matter regarding which I am seeking information from a purely parochial stand-point. On page 257 of these Estimates provision is made for the expenditure of £5,392 on "" wireless telegraph station, Fremantle."" wish to know whether that is an addition to the Applecross wireless station, or whether any further wireless station is to be erected in the Fremantle division?

The Minister has just informed us that the Department is going to expend something like £244,000 more this year. During the time. I have been a member of the HouseI have been accustomed to hear a statement of that kind, b u t somehow or other the money does not happen to get expended in the country districts. The practice has been to concentrate expenditure on the big capitals and suburbs and overlook altogether the country districts.

That is playing with country people.

I spoke of my expeiience in the House, and that of course applies to the Government I supported. The day has arrived when the Government should give instructions that country facilities in the way of telephone and telegraph lines should be provided as early as I possible. It is all very well for the House to vote large sums for that purpose, but if the bulk of the money is expended in thickly congested areas, that is an injustice to the people who are living in-the more scattered and remote parts of the Commonwealth.

When I say that I do not approve of borrowing for these purposes, I may be to ld that a precedent was set by the late Government in connection with the purchase of the post-office site at Perth. In this case, however, we find"" that it is proposed to borrow a large sum for such a work as the undergrounding of wires. That is a work which you canEstimates not realize upon, and I am opposed toborrowing for such a purpose. These wires after a certain time will have toand be renewed, and once we initiate the system we shall go on borrowing for such works for all time. The Postal Department should be allowed to stand on itsown footing; it should be worked by itself, and should provide for its ownexpenditure. The Government, however, instead of dealing with it in a business like way, are introducing a system of borrowing for postal works, and the in terest on the money raised, instead of being debited to the Department itself, will be a charge on the Federal revenue,, and will have to be borne by the taxpayers generally. A system of this kind: once initiated will grow. The Department should pay interest on money borrowed for postal undertakings. Theresidents of big centres of population will receive the chief benefit from this expenditure, whilst the poorman in tlie country w ill have to payinterest on the borrowed money. A block of land is rarely purchased for postal' purposes in country districts. Land required for such a purpose is generally acquired from the State, and where it is necessary to purchase a block in a. country district the price is so low a» to be hardly worth mentioning. In almost any part of the country a blockcan be obtained for a few pounds. That being so, this £170,000 will be utilized' that for tlie most part in buying valuableproperty in big centres, while the interest, will be charged against the general spend the money. revenue.

Unless such an order °is given we shall find next year that we are still face to face w i th the position that confronts us to-day. A f t e r a Treasurer has carefully considered his Estimates, applied the pruning knife, and submitted them to Parliament, the works for which they provide should be carried out at once.

If the last Minister shook it up, it has gone to sleep again. Perhaps the present Minister will do more, and take less credit to himself for what is done. A large number of country telephone lines should be put in hand, if for no other reason than tc make cross country connexions to relieve the strain on the main lines. In many cases messages have to be transmitted over a distance of 200 miles, in a roundabout manner, to pass between places not more than 30 or 40 miles apart. The erection of cross country lines would make this unnecessary, and would prevent the blocking of business which now often occurs. I ask the Government to see that matters are dealt with in a more business-like way, and to push on with the public works-particularly the telephone constructions that are needed-in the country districts. seems to me a pity that the discussion on these Estimates cannot be confined to one F o r nearly the whole subject at a time.

But if it was wrong for the Fisher Government to place upon the Estimates a sum of £110,000 to be expended upon the Capital, and to actually spend upon it £137,000, it must be I desire to point out doubly wrong for the present Government to expend £285,000. ber favour a referendum upon the question of the advisableness of doing away with the Federal Capital?

There were cases quarantined at Colmslie, in Queensland, and in Sydney, and Port Darwin, and we had a measles outbreak in Melbourne-the Irishman case. Again, the position of the Naval Basei n Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, was not settled. There was a doubt as to whether we would be able to go to Woodman's PointI t is doubtful whether we shall not have to go to Albany for the principal quarantine station if we cannot get a suitable place in or near Fremantle, having only a small sub-station at Fremantle. If quarantine is effective, it does hot matter whether the station is within 3 miles or 4 miles of the city or is 40 miles away. London. for Moreton will see the reason why tlie money was not all spent last year. We were hnng up on account of small-pox outbreaks, which prevented the work going on at the quarantine stations in Queensland, New South Wales, and Port Darwin; and we were prevented from carrying out works in Western Australia on account of the location of the Naval Base. Dr. Norris, in the last page of liis report, speaks of "" quarantine machinery well distributed on national lines,"" and he lays out a proj>er scheme of having first, second, and third-class stations, the first class stations to be capable of housing 1,000 patients eachI believe Sydney is to have accommodation for 1,100-and the smaller stations, such as Port Dardid not spend win, are to have accommodation down to eight persons. One of the complaints last And small-pox came in . year was that provision was not made at Port Darwin, Townsville, Thursday Is-, land, and Brisbane for small-pox patients, and that the latter had to be brought all the way to Sydney. The lionorable member for North Sydney complained in the House that these cases were a menace to the people of Sydney, and that it was It is considerably more necessary to construct these works further north. The work at Townsville is now you did not spend going on, and the Colmslie station, near Brisbane, is being erected on a site obtained from the State Government. I wish to know now from the present M in ister what is proposed to be done. In the £40,000 they* put on the Estimates this year, I believe Ministers are not allowing enough to protect the people of Australia, l t is most important that we should have effective quarantine. I trust there w ill be an explanation as to why there is such a small sum provided. [12.30] I agree with the honourable member for Hunter that there is great reason to complain about the way in for the quarantine station. which the requirements in the matter of country post-offices are attended to.

I am not going to condemn the Government absolutely in this matter.

It appears to me that they should have proceeded with considerably more vigour in isolating the cases and the contacts in those portions of Sydney where the population is very congested, and the housing accommodation is a disgrace to a city in Australia. This might be excused and pardoned if it occurred in the older countries of the world, b u t in a new couutry it is simply scandalous. up to the Government of New South Wales to do considerably more than they have yet done in stamping out the disease. I , as one of the city members, was surprised this morning to hear the line of argument pursued by certain country members. It is wrong that men who represent country districts in a National Parliament should t r y to bring about ill feeling between the country and the city. Some of our honourable friends have said that it was time that a Country party was formed in the House to make the Government do their duty.

Where is he ? liament we should always be animated by a desire to benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. All that the honourable member for Hunter is out for is to get telephones and telegraph wires for his electorate. He neglects all other parts of the Commonwealth, whereas I take a broad national view. If the honourable member would look at a l l matters from a national stand-point, he would not concentrate his eyes upon the Hunter electorate. The same remark applies to the honourable member for In d i . He complained that the present Government have not been able to do in four months all the things that he requires to be done in In d i . He complained, too, about having received only an acknowledgment of communications respecting certain It may be that tlie New South cases. And he asserted that the city is receiving all the benefits-the advance of science, the comforts of civilization, telephones, telegrams, and so forth . I have looked through the Estimates in vain for an indication tliat one work is going to be erected in the whole of South Sydney, but I cannot find a trace of an item. Some honourable members say that the cities are getting the whole of the plums, but I can assure them that we in the city are not getting anything like a proportion It is of the revenue which we contribute. The honourable member for In d i went so f a r as to say that the country keeps the city. That is the sort of stuff which country members give to country people when they ever have to deliver speeches in the farmyards.

Does the honourable member think we should first take over the Department, and then appoint an officer to take charge of it ? to appoint a man to this position u n t i l the Department was ready to make a start. The honourable member for Grey referred to the proposed vote of £285,000 for the Pederal Territory as money to be spent in New South Wales. able member for Ballarat wil l agree with the honourable member for Grey. Victorians always talk of expenditure on the Pederal Territory as money being spent in New South Wales. That, however, is not the case. We have 900 square miles of territory which, for the most^part, has beeu given to the Commonwealth by the State of New South Wales, and every penny spent on that territory is enhancing the property of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, provision should be made for ,the spending of £1,000,000 rather than £285,000. A million could be well spent up there. It would have the effect of increasing the population, and so increasing the revenue of the Territory, which in time w ill be self-supporting. I shall have to speak in parables to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and therefore, by way of a parable, let me point out that if the pioneer legislators of New South Wales and Victoria had displayed the foresight exhibited by this Parliament in regard to the Pederal Territory, and had declared that all lands in and around Melbourne and Sydney, within a radius of 15 miles of a certain It is intended to point, should be permanently reserved from sale, it would not have been necesT h e y have been taken sary for either State to raise money on the London market.

I hope the Minister will consider the advisableness of increasing the proposed vote. No item in these Estimates w ill give a better return.

287,Mr Kendell,"I support what theI entirely endorse the remarks of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat in regard to the need for telephonic communication in the country. In my own electoral division tliere are quite a number of mining centres, and a considerable number of men who reside on selections. Tliese people undertook the hard pioneering work, and I hold that those who go out into remote mining areas make it easy for those who come after them. They receive very little assistance, and many of them remain in these outlying portions of the country for the greater part of their lives. If there is one portion of the Commonwealth which requires to be carefully handled with a view to promoting settlement there, it is the Gulf portion. After all, there are opportunities in the Gulf country, and that is the oue portion of Australia above all others which, from a defence point of view, requires protection. We should encourage settlement there by every means in our power. I regret to say that in some parts of the Gulf country population is decreasing. serious attention. When the honourable member for Corio spoke of young men who ride 10 or 12 miles to get the result of a football match, and who, if the telephone were available, would probably, stay at home, tlierewas a good deal of wisdom iu his suggestion. In the mining centres one never knows when an accident will happen. had to be conveyed 60 or 70 miles in order to receive medical attention. I have known of a man having to be carried 30 miles along a road in order to meet a doctor. In these circumstances, the Government should endeavour to give these outlying districts as much telephonic communication as possible. The constituency which I represent is nearly four times the size of Victoria. Ifc embraces an area of 333,000 square miles, and there are people scattered all through it. There are some parts of it where telephonic communication could be easily and cheaply established. But when a request is made for the erection of a line, the departmental estimate is usually out of all proportion to the value of the work. happens that the people interested are prepared to undertake the work for one-third of the departmental estimate! I am glad to say that, during the recent election campaign, I was able, through the medium of privately-erected lines, to get into communication by telephone with my wife, who happened to be in Hughenden, 180 miles distant. I had to establish connection through a number of sheep stations. Most bf tliese lines are erected along the boundary fences of the runs. member must have been a long way from a big city. side the nearest town was Hughenden, and on the south side the nearest town was Muttaburra. These cheap lines are of considerable value to the general public. A thousand and one things may happen in such remote areas, and it is extremely convenient to be able to get into communication with some distant centre by means of tliese privately-erected lines. I hope that^the Government will grant as much telephonic communication as possible in all parts of Australia. If they do that, they will be doing good. A t the same time, I strongly object to the expenditure upon the Federal Capital being deThis is a matter which requires creased for that purpose. I would like to see the expenditure upon the Capital twice as much as it is at present, because I hold that we shall never have Federation in the true sense of the word until this Parliament is located in its own home. It is so long since I had the pleasure of I have known men who have hearing my own voice in this chamberowing to a monopoly of the public speaking by the Opposition-that I began to doubt whetlier I had not lost the faculty of speech. The honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Kennedy have supplied me with two excellent texts upon which to hang the remarks that I propose to make. One of them commented on the very incomplete and extravagant methods which are adopted in tliis country in carrying out our public works, while the other drew particular attention to the great need that exists for -telephone communication iu the rural areas, and to the apparent hesitation on the part of the Government to supply that need.

The work was delayed for so many months -that the proprietors of the race-course at last resolved to carry it out themselves.' They had appealed to the Department again and again, and, although the Department had done nothing, it was asking the modest sum of £480 to carry out -the work. I repeat that it was so long in taking steps to do anything, that the proprietors of the race-course erected the line themselves. Taking Government material for the purpose, they carried it out for 25 per cent, of the price that the Government were demanding.

We then pass on to "" Special conditions and in structions,"" which occupy three more pages. In order to give the Committee an idea of the sort of microscopic details which are contained in this paper, I quote the following: Cut a notch about 1 foot from the ground -with a £-in. chisel so as to start the auger easily; bore a hole in pole (or strut), using a j in. auger, In other boring in a downward direction to a depth of at least 18 inches, keeping the auger in a position in line with centre of pole (or strut), thus boring across the pole, (or strut), and striking the heart of same thereby.

307,Mr Beucesmith,"I do not careyears' management of the biggest spending Department in New South Walesthe Works Department-and during my term of office many millions of pounds were spent. I found that the Department, in the few years preceding my advent, had so r u n toseed in the way indicated by the contract which I have just quoted, that I obtained one of the most practical accountants in Australia to devote some weeks to the Department to see where the work was overlapping; whetlier it was being properly done, and whether the men were f it for their positions. He was to report generally to me on the best means of putting that Department on the footing that a great business establishment would occupy if it were being managed on economical lines. That led to a great many changes, but did a great deal of good, because it prevented certain officers from trespassing beyond their domain, and prevented the work from overlapping, and also prevented a great waste of public money in carrying out works in an unbusiness-like way. Altogether, it practically ventilated the Department, because it got r i d of what is constantly growing up i u public departments. When a man is engaged with a private firm, he knows that his particular department will be criticised at the end of the year on the work it has done, and on the cost of the work ; and it is in his interests to manage the work in such a way that at the end of the year the department will show a creditable result. On the other hand, in a public department, an officer has certain duties to do; no one ever estimates the cost, with a view to showing at the end of the year how it will compare with the work of other people; and the consequence is that, very often, the work is done with so much red-tape that it will lead to the result indicated by the case which the honourable member for In d i has brought under my notice. I heartily endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy with regard to telephones. Tliere seems to be an impression in the minds of Ministers that telephones are only required for such things as were mentioned by one lionorable member-communicatin g the results of cricket matches or races. have had a great many cases brought under my notice where it was a Y o u have never had any. matter of' life or death to have I had three telephone communication. Now that the wires are erected along fences, the work can be done so cheaply that there should not be any part of the country where there is a settlement of population that is not supplied with ""this great convenience. A telephone creates business. It conduces very much to the commercial activity of the country. I wish now to say a word about the prevalent idea that these things ought all to be done out of revenue. Telephones are a revenue-producing, investment. In many cases public telephones return an extravagant profit on the capital laid out on them. I waa speaking the other day to an American expert, and he told me that, in the public companies in the United States, the proprietors were so anxious to have telephones erected for the public that if a new telephone was ordered to-day it would be erected to-morrow. this country, expecting a telephone to be put up the day after it was ordered. I should expect it to be done on the same day next year. Yet there is a profit standing out. We are told over and over again by the Department that they only keep in hand sufficient material for a certain time. They do not hold large stocks, and if demands happen to come from different parts of the country for these conveniences, and the stock is exhausted, to have to wait unti l they import more is not business. The interest on a very large stock of material, out of which the public could be supplied with telephone conveniences, would not be great, and there is no reason why there should not be a large stock on hand to anticipate very large orders. I do not agree with the principle that tliese works must necessarily be constructed out of revenue. I have had answers to requests from my constituency, where certain telephones were required, to say that the money was uot available. We required a little sum of money to put up a public telephone in a public place in a thickly-populated suburb of Sydney, and we were told, in this great country of ours, that there was not the inoney "" available "" for that particular telephone, or for a number of others. I There should be no hesitation ingetting that money out of loan funds, because telephone construction comes properly",39,Ibvine I T Is Going To Tuency I Am Very Anxious To Assist I N The

311,Mr Bbuce Smith,"Imagine, i nunder the category of loan expenditure. It is not only a permanent work if it is properly managed from year to year, but it is revenue-producing, and the sooner the Government arrive at the conclusion that works o.f that sort should be done out of loan money, or that they can borrow money for the purpose if they do not have it now, the better it will be for this counthe arbiter in any matter in dispute. try. Governments, and I urged on the present Treasurer eight years ago, that he should utilize loan moneys to build post-offices. In the first place, we buy the land, which is a permanent asset. The mere fact of establishing a post-office on the site gives it an increment which it will maintain for all time; it is of a permanent character; and the moment a building is erected it produces more than sufficient revenue to pay interest on tlie loan. I remember the Government spending in one year no less than £900,000 out of revenue on post-offices. It is a wrong principle. have quoted to thc House more than once a most able little treatise from one of the annual pamphlets of the Tasmanian Statistician, in which he lays down with proper accuracy the distinction between loan -expenditure and revenue expenditure. We know that, in other parts of the world, this practice of paying for permanent or revenue-producing assets out of revenue is considered absolutely wrong. These works sliould be built out of loan money. The asset passes down to posterity; the loan .should pass down to posterity-. If the work is of a perishing character, and yet produces revenue, it is the .duty of the -Government to maintain it , just as they maintain a railway to-day, and to simply charge each generation with the interest on the expenditure, while conferring on each generation the benefit which the establishment of the work brings with it . The telephone system is in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition. Telephones should be distributed throughout the country, and if the Government have not enough money for them, they should borrow, or take the money out of loau funds for the purpose. I say, further, that the arrangements in connection with these contracts should be carried out in a thoroughly practical manner. Cani t be supposed for a moment that, if a private firm were to employ an architect to prepare a specification to carry out a little work of, say, 15 miles of telephone, he would have twenty or t h i r t y pages of conditions, which, possibly, the country contractor would have to read, and submit himself to, and which, probably, lie could not understand if he had to do it ? A practical architect will make out a simple set of specifications, and if he be a well-known man the contractor will be perfectly satisfied that he should be For years I have urged on previous Under the system adopted by the Post and Telegraph Department, not ouly do we find twenty-five or t h i r t y pages of addenda laid down in black and white, and in the most technical terms; but if the slightest dispute arises, tlie decision of the Postmaster-General is final. In the erection of very large buildings, and in the construction of railways, although the specifications may be somewhat long, the terms and conditions of contract are of the simplest character. The engineer in the case of railways, or the architect in the case of buildings, is the final I arbiter, and as he will be known to the contractors, they can trust him, and there is very little difficulty. In view of what the Prime Minister said the other night as to the great want of business methods in certain branches of the Public Service, I trust that the Postmaster-General will look very closely into the way in which telephone line construction is being carried out. I trust also that the Governmeut will see that, as the honourable member for Kennedy has pointed out, telephone communication will be extended throughout the country wherever there are people willing to pay for the facilities afforded them. I wish honourable members to understand that I hold no brief for the Commonwealth electrical engineers. It cannot be said that in speaking on their behalf I am seeking their votes, because their number is so few. But I understand a little about their work, and I must say that I have just listened to one of the most unfair and unjust attacks that could be made upon any body of men. It was most unjust and unfair for the honourable member for Parkes to produce a great number of specifications and conditions, when he should know that they are not provided for the construction of the line, but are submitted for the guidance of the various bodies iu calling for tenders. For instance, the conditions with respect to",40,Ibvine I T Is Going To Tuency I Am Very Anxious To Assist I N The

314,Mr Laibdsmith,"members to understand that the line must be going through miles of unoccupied country, and was not affected by other lines running parallel to it . were otlier lines parallel to such a line as the honourable member described, it would be useless. Only yesterday, I tried to talk to a geutlerna.u at Lara, and I found there was a considerable amount of in duction on the line, so that I could only hear about half that this gentleman wished to say. The reason was that there are a lot of lines parallel to the Lara line, which is one of the cheaply constructed lines. owing to the lack of engineering knowledge of those who carried it out; or, more likely, want of funds to enable the engineer to construct a metallic circuit. I remind honourable members that, at all events, until quite recently, many requirements such as the height of the poles to be used, are specified in the Act of Par-, liament. WhatI should advise would be the establishment of a zone system of construction. The first zone should include lines in large centres requiring the most perfect construction, such, for instance, as a main trunk line between Melbourne and Geelong, or Melbourne and Ballarat. Such liues should be constructed under the best possible conditions to secure a low resistance. Then, in less thickly populated districts, we could have less perfect lines, and in purely country districts lines could be built much more cheaply, say, for £ 1 2 6s. per mile. These would be removed from other lines, and though the resistance might be a l it t l e high, so long as one could hear the ring of the telephone, he could speak over it . It will pay us to have skilled engineers to carry out the construction of our lines. I remind honourable members that, even if construction is handed over to contractors, we shall require to have supervising officers. I have walked about with my hands in my pockets for weeks supervising the work of a contractor, and I might just as well, at the time, have been directing the men, and doing something for the wages I was receiving. The honourable member for Parkes has told us that no estimates are submitted, but there is not a telephone line constructed in Australia to-day without an estimate being submitted. An estimate is in every case submitted by the local engineer to the Engineer-in-Chief, who, in t u r n, submits it to the Postmaster-General. I venture [73] to say that the Department may go so far as to ask the engineer to submit a tender side by side with the tender of a If there contractor. The houorable member for Parkes was amused by the provision for bracketing, but that was because he d i d not understand the importance of it . If brackets are not properly used in the construction of a line, the first strain' to whicli it is subjected may strip ifc back for half-a-mile. The honourable member may be a brilliant lawyer, but he has demonstrated to-day that he knows nothing of telegraph and It was imperfectly constructed, telephone construction, or of electrical engineering. I ran a copper line between Hobart and Parattai n rough country, as the lionorable member for Franklin will know. I had six men working with me, and with those men I did 4 miles of line a day. Untrained men could not possibly have done the work, and they would probably, when in sulating, have given an extra tur n to the tie wire, aud the first frost would break the line altogether. It is necessary to tie the wire carefully on the insulators when straining the line between the poles. miles of telephone line without doing that. of wire ? to galvanized wire, but to copper wire. Where there are a number of lines in use, galvanized wire cannot be used. W it h the use of No. 8 galvanized wire, the resistance amounts to 16 ohms to the mile, whilst with copper wire the resistance is less than 8 ohms. The honourable member for Biverina may know a good merino lamb, but there is a great deal of difference between a merino lamb and a telephone line. On looking up this matter, I find that while the honourable member for Barrier and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie were at the Post Office, during the regime of the Fisher Government, they constructed more telephone lines in Australia than had any other Government during the previous ten years. More telephones were constructed i u the In d i electorate, I believe, than i u any other division in Victoria, and, unfortunately, for In d i , and the people of Australia, the people of In d i did not recognise that fact, and turned down a good man who had done much for the district, regardless of his",42,Ibvine I T Is Going To Tuency I Am Very Anxious To Assist I N The

318,Mr Laibdsmith,"I do not referpolitical ideas. Much has been done in Australia. The country people have my sympathy, but I tell the farmer in the country that it is essential for him to have a telephone line in the city working well, if it is judiciously and fairly used. Sometimes, I am told, when a farmer calls on merchant A , and after getting a price says, "" I w ill not take that price,"" the merchant telephones round to merchant B before the farmer can get there. That is not putting the telephone to the best use, because a price is fixed. It is essential that the telephone system of a city shall be in first-class condition. There is nothing more irritating to a person than to have paid money for a telephone servico, and not to be able to hear what a subscriber is saying to him. MrM c W ILLIAMS -That is little compared with the irritation of the man who has no telephone at all. to have a good service. One day a friend of the honourable inember and myselfan eminent gentleman in Tasmania -los t £-50 in five minutes owing to the defective working of the telephone. A mistake was made in speaking over the line in a business transaction, and it cost that gentleman £ 5 0 . Hadi t been a good silent line he could have done the business safely and well. That is why I am anxious to see telephone lines constructed under first-class engineers. I suppose it is because honourable members have to ride in railway trains that they do not suggest that any farmer along the line should construct a section of the railway opposite his farm . follow that the farmer is going to do it . What answer have you to give to those who for eighteen months have had propositions unattended to? gather, the engineers have not been able to get sufficient money to stock material, and so on. The Fisher Government rose to the occasion, and a sum of, I think, £600,000, was voted to enable the electricians of the Department to continue the work. an abominable system that compels the Department to employ so many casual hands, and if the Public ServiceA c t is complied with, as soon as an engineer has trained a number of men-the y are employed for about six or nine monthsthey are put off, and new men have to be brought in and trained.

Would there not be a hours. Let him rehowl of indignation because of his want which of foresight ? I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not be influenced to any great extent by the criticism of novices in this matter, and that the Department w ill not stock goods to the extent that has been urged.

A gentleman was brought down here district over from Queensland some time ago to The honourable organize the Postal Department, and I venture to say that no private company doing business in Melbourne to-day is better organized than that Department is under him.

I wish to point out, as plainly as I can, what I with him by the novice. consider to be the infamous conditions operating in connexiou with our various quarantine stations. Our present communicaSpeaker, together with the honourable member for Franklin, the honourable member for Herbert, Senator Givens, and I , were quarantined last year at the Sydney station. I am glad that we were, is not far behind them. If although I regret that what was supplied time to me as Australian lymph proved to be we New Zealand filth that ought not to have The only been given to any human being. The life of Senator Givens was seriously imBy way perilled by its use, whilst the case of the honourable inember for Herbert was also telebad. On the other hand, the Manilla lymph obtained from the United States was regarded as something of America Government, and the Japanese lymph, proved to be perfect, and lef t no Then, again, bad results. I said, a little over a year ago, that Sydney was standing on the We have also been brink of an inferno, and I repeat that statement to-day. We were told when What would be said of in quarantine that only 1 per cent, of who imported and the population of Sydney had been prepared by vaccination to resist small-pox; and I did not dream then that proof of the truth of my words would so soon be forthcoming. I think it was the lionorable member for Franklin who said, at the time, that Sydney had escaped epidemics of small-pox, not because of the quarantine arrangements, but in spite of them. We know that on a balmy day the germs of small-pox w ill carry a considerable distance, and that there is practically no distance between the boundary fence of the quarantine station in Sydney and the town of Manly. used to call at the station every day; but I do not want to say too much about the matter. that I desire to make. If three men, one extremely wealthy, another of moderate means, and the third in absolute poverty, were imprisoned for a crime, would there not be a shriek of indignation on the part of the public if any difference were made in their treatment in prison-if the wealthy man were given a good bed and an eiderdown quilt, whilst the man of poverty had only bare boards and a blanket? No one would defend such a system. Then, why should there be any difference in the treatment of first and second class and steerage passengers when ordered into quarantine ? the second class passengers, and those who travel steerage, as well as the sailors and firemen, be treated as they have been by past Governments? I hope the Prime Minister will effect a change. women sent into quarantine are held under restraint purely for the good of the community. being, the guests of the Commonwealth; and, just as we do not differentiate between the rights of citizens over twenty-one years of age, so there should be no difference in the treatment of men and women in quarantine, no matter whether they travel in the saloon or in the steerage. Mahon, who, until lately, represented Coolgardie in this House, was sent into quarantine, and was ordered off a plot of grass because he had travelled second class, and the grass plot was reserved for saloon passengers. Our accommodation in Sydney was all that could be desired, but the second and t h i r d class passengers were not thought f it to have even decent places to wash in . travelling in the steerage had to bathe in a bath 2 f t . 6 in . long and 18 inches wide, posedand 15 inches deep-receptacle s which had been provided for the washing of clothing. I understand that we have on these Estimates £40,000 in respect of "" Quarantine. "" Last year, £50,000 was voted for that purpose, but only some £27,000 was expended; so that really only a sum of £17,000, added to the unexpended balance of last year, has been made available for improvements We all recognise that there must be some control over our shipping, and at present I would not The postman do away with the regulation under which the owners of a ship ordered into quarantine have to provision the Tliere is only one other point passengers whilst they remain there. Such a requirement must necessarily make ofiicers careful in the carriage of passengers and merchandise from infected ports. But let the sleeping apartments, the bathing accommodation, and the grass plots provided by the Government be the same for all classes Those whose only crime is that they* cannot afford to travel first class should be treated just as saloon passengers are. Let us have equal privileges, and fair treatment for all.

The tenor of the report is that the cost of keeping accounts, amongst other things, under the systems proposed for charging according to the business done, is not an improvement on the flat-rate system of charging. A f t e r the fullest inquiry, the auditors recommended a return to the flat-rate system, which is entirely opposed to that advocated by my honourable friend. I regret to have to return to a matter which has been ventilated on several occasions during adjournment discussions, namely, €he manner in which names are being struck off the rolls in connection with the so-called purification. I received the-.following letter, to which I draw the attention of the Honorary MinisterConstable Murphy. . . to-day, and asked me to file an electoral claim, stating that my name had been removed from the roll.
