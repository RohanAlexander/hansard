Both these Bills have one very major advanbased on a system of Australian content to one tage; that is, that they are Bills which provide calculated on a value added basis. I think that for a bounty rather than a tariff. In that respect is a much more sensible way of evaluating what they contrast with the other Bill before the the level of bounty should be. I point out also House, the Bounty (Commercial Motor Vehithat this is consistent with the recommendations cles) Amendment Bill (No.2). of the Industries Assistance Commission.

In to provide a bounty I think that bounty should particular I believe bounties minimise the cost be consistent right through the industry rather to consumers and to the users of the imported than being somewhat erratically applied just to or assisted goods.

Finally, I would like to ket.

The third effect is that higher costs motor vehicles, parts and accessories of February will eventually lead to higher inflation. As other 1984 and partly the Minister's second reading members have noted, we have an inflation rate speech.
