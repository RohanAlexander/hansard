Visa Holders: Health Insurance Cover (Question No. 1175) Mr Randall asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 2 February 2010: In respect of the requirement that subclass 410 Retirement Visa holders maintain ‘fully comprehensive’ health insurance cover: (1) What was her department’s role in defining ‘fully comprehensive’. (2) How does her department define ‘fully comprehensive’. (3) What is the scope of ‘fully comprehensive’, and what falls outside this scope. (4) What proportion of costs for health services is required to be covered. (5) What is meant by Medicare equivalent cover. (7) How does her department ensure that the requirements are met by these visa holders. (8) What assessment does her department undertake of health insurance premium increases for these visa holders. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) My Department was consulted regarding the definition of ‘fully comprehensive’ health cover. (2) The definition of ‘fully comprehensive’ in the context of 410 Retirement Visa is not something that is defined by the Department of Health and Ageing. (3) (4) and (5) These matters are for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship policy. See Senator Evans reply to SQON 2391 (2) (3) & (4) (7) It is the responsibility of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to monitor the health insurance requirement of these visa holders. (8) The Department of Health and Ageing has no role in assessing premium increases for Overseas Visitors Health Cover (OVHC), which is a term broadly used to describe health insurance products sold to 410 Retirement Visa holders and temporary visa holders who are not eligible for Medicare. OVHC products are related to the broader category of travel insurance policies sold in the general insurance market, where the principle of risk rating is applied by insurers. An insurer can decide to refuse to sell OVHC to someone or set higher premiums for people at greater risk of claiming (for instance, elderly persons with a pre-existing illness). OVHC is also sold by some private health insurers outside of their core business. It is not considered health insurance business which is regulated under private health insurance legislation. Asia-Pacific Community Conference (Question No. 1198) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 8 February 2010: In respect of the Asia Pacific community Conference in December 2009: (a) how did each country respond to the Prime Minister’s Asia Pacific community idea, and did any express concerns; if so, what were they; and (b) what total sum of money was spent by the Government on (i) accommodation, (ii) airfares, and (iii) catering, for all Conference participants and officials. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The Asia-Pacific community Conference in December 2009 was a one-and-a-half track Conference. As such, participants engaged in the discussions in their personal capacities, not as representatives of their countries or governments. I attach a copy of the Conference report, also available on the Conference website (www.apc2009conference.org) which summarises the discussion at the Conference. (b) As at 25 February 2010, the Government spent a total of: (i) $111,108 on accommodation (ii) $623,533 on airfares (iii) $59,874 on catering on all Conference participants and officials. THE ASIA PACIFIC A COMMUNITY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY 3-5 DECEMBER 2009 The conference, “The Asia Pacific: a community for the 21st century”, was held in Sydney, Australia, from 3-5 December 2009. It was hosted by the Australian Prime Minister’s Special Envoy on the Asia Pacific community (APc), Mr Richard Woolcott AC, and co-chaired by Dr Michael Wesley, Executive Director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy, and Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh, President of the Founding Committee of Tri Viet International University, Vietnam. The conference was attended by over 140 academics, commentators and senior government officials from the 21 countries visited by Mr Woolcott during his regional consultations on the APc and also from Australia, along with experts on regionalism from France, the United Kingdom and Germany. The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, addressed the conference’s opening session on 4 December. The keynote speech was delivered by former Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Dr Han Seung-soo. The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Stephen Smith MP, addressed the conference dinner on 3 December. The conference was not an inter-governmental negotiation nor did it attempt to reach agreed conclusions or present recommendations. It was a “1.5-track” gathering of participants from both nongovernment and government sectors, participating as individuals under “Chatham House” rules. As intended, it was a discussion – held in plenary and “breakout” sessions – to further explore the idea of a leaders’ level APc, as proposed by the Australian Government. The APc initiative Prime Minister Rudd first proposed the idea of an APc in an address to the Asia Society AustralAsia Centre in Sydney on 4 June 2008. Mr Rudd proposed that regional countries discuss the development of an APc which would have the right membership and mandate to address economic, security and other transnational challenges at leaders’ level. Mr Rudd has made the point that the movement in economic and strategic weight to the Asia Pacific is set to continue and will provide significant opportunities, but also challenges. He has put the case that intensifying inter-connectedness and inter-dependency calls for increased consideration of what arrangements can serve to manage regional stresses and strains, and that it is in the region’s interests to work cooperatively and actively to shape improved regional arrangements. Mr Rudd announced in his speech in 2008 the appointment of former senior diplomat and head of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Richard Woolcott AC, as his Special Envoy on the APc, charged with conducting consultations with governments and non-government stakeholders across the Asia Pacific. Between September 2008 and March 2009, Mr Woolcott visited 21 countries, holding discussions with more than 300 individuals, including more than 30 ministers and eight heads of state or heads of government. Mr Rudd wrote to leaders in May 2009 outlining the main conclusions of Mr Woolcott’s report to him on the regional consultations and inviting them to send representatives to a 1.5-track conference to further discussions on the initiative. The Prime Minister announced the conference publicly in a speech to the Shangri-la Dialogue on 29 May 2009. In that speech, Mr Rudd said that an APc could help ensure that the process of regional economic and financial integration is driven forward; nurture a culture of cooperation and collaboration on security; and provide a vehicle for discussion and cooperation on other challenges such as climate change, resource and food security and terrorism. Further to his speech at the Shangri-la Dialogue, Mr Rudd spoke with regional leaders about his initiative at the East Asia Summit in Hua Hin, Thailand, on 25 October and at the APEC leaders’ meeting in Singapore on 14-15 November. His Special Envoy also had further high-level discussions in Washington and New York in October and Singapore and Jakarta in November. Address to the conference by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd In his opening address to the conference, the Australian Prime Minister, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, welcomed the increasing level of comfort among regional countries with an ongoing discussion about the Asia Pacific region’s future. Mr Rudd said the region had been served well to date by institutions created in the past, including Meeting (ASEM) and these institutions had evolved to meet changing needs. The Asia Pacific region was, however, lacking a regional institution with wide membership and a wide mandate to deal with the breadth and depth of all the main political, security, economic and environmental challenges we would face in the 21st century. Mr Rudd highlighted three key messages about the region and its future: it was dynamic and was rapidly becoming the centre of global economic and strategic weight, driven by the rise of China and India and long-standing powerhouses such as Japan and the United States as the continuing superpower; it was becoming infinitely more connected, increasing the importance of robust pan-regional institutions to enhance the positive dimensions of growing regional interconnectedness and manage any negative impacts; it faced a number of emerging challenges including the need for a balanced model for regional growth, competition for scarce resources, unresolved border disputes, along with large and growing militaries and continuing regional flashpoints, non-traditional security threats, climate change, a confluence of interests of five major powers – the United States, China, India, Russia and Japan. History should caution regional countries not to assume that peace, harmony and concord were predetermined; common security had to be crafted by nation states driven by common purpose. The United States and China had so far managed their interests well on a largely bilateral basis, but it may be that in the future this would be supplemented by emerging regional institution building. Moreover, challenges were not static; the prospects for rapid change were great. Regional countries could draw lessons from the G20’s response to the global financial crisis: we needed to be alert to where our trajectories were leading us and to ways we could cooperate more closely on our shared interests. We needed actively to shape our regional future. Key questions for the conference were: how do we best manage our region’s dynamism, inter-dependency and common challenges? how do we ensure outward-looking regionalism continues as the bedrock of Asia-Pacific integration? how do we foster a deeper regional culture of cooperation and entrench habits of cooperation and so avoid any future conflict? how do we craft integrated solutions to complex and multi-faceted problems? Mr Rudd said the Australian Government had deliberately not sought to answer fully questions about what sort of APc was required, but had sought to stimulate a dialogue, and it valued the counsel of senior regional statesmen. The regional conversation had been enhanced by the contribution of Prime Minister Hatoyama of Japan on the future of our region. From Australia’s perspective, an APc would need to: engage all countries that made up the region, including the United States, and have ASEAN play a major role; be able to traverse all of the major questions that affected our region – political, economic and strategic – in an integrated way; shape the habits of transparency and trust and foster the instinct of cooperation; and meet at leaders’ level, as only leaders could fully connect economic, strategic, environmental and political issues. It was, however, also clear that the region did not need a supra-national decision making structure, an additional institution or a further leaders’ meeting. Instead, regional countries needed to discuss how to “evolve an Asia-Pacific region from our existing regional institutions – rather than try to start completely afresh”. Mr Rudd said that some options were to: do nothing – exposing countries to weaknesses in current architecture; build an entirely new institution from the ground up; or build an APc using existing architecture such as APEC (which would need to admit India and take on a more defined security mandate), the EAS (which would need to increase its membership to include other key players), or by bringing APEC and the EAS together, bringing with it the benefit of a single leaders’ meeting or cluster of meetings – an arrangement that could be extended by merging the wider range of regional bodies to bring together political, economic and security agendas. Mr Rudd urged conference participants to settle on ideas and principles that would guide future discussion and find a mechanism to continue the conversation on an APc in a constructive way. The full text of the speech is available on the Prime Minister’s website www.pm.gov.au Address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith In addressing conference delegates and heads of diplomatic missions, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Stephen Smith MP, highlighted the shift in economic, political, military and strategic influence to the Asia Pacific. He noted that this ongoing shift in influence was not just about economics or demographics. The Asia Pacific was home to the world’s five largest militaries – the United States, Russia, China, India and North Korea. Mr Smith said the United States had underwritten stability in the Asia Pacific for the last half century and would continue to be the single most powerful and important strategic actor in the region for the foreseeable future, both in its own right and through its network of alliances and security relationships. The relative resilience of the region amid the global economic crisis had also brought home to others that the Asia Pacific was and would be crucial to global economic stability and growth. Prior to the global financial crisis, only the United States, Canada and Japan, of the Asia Pacific countries, had been members of the principal global economic institution – the G7. In contrast, 10 countries of the Asia Pacific region were in the G20. Mr Smith noted, however, that with the rise of the Asia Pacific region came difficult challenges – some which had been with us for years, others more recent. They included: terrorist attacks; people smuggling; and latent security problems such as on the Korean Peninsula. Regional integration had underwritten the economic success of our region, but the region could not rest on its laurels. Regional countries needed to ensure a meaningful, long-term response to the global economic crisis by entrenching good economic policy and structural reform. The region also needed to be able to respond rapidly with significant assistance to natural disasters. None of these challenges could be addressed or resolved by any one nation; they could only be addressed by nations in the region acting together. Mr Smith said the lessons of a regional approach were clear from cooperation in the Asia Pacific. The stability, prosperity and regional cooperation ASEAN had fostered since its establishment had been an important achievement; the ARF was gradually developing a role in preventive diplomacy; the EAS was an increasingly productive forum; and APEC had become vital to building consensus around open markets, trade and investment. The Minister said, however, that as valuable as existing groupings continued to be, there was a need to examine closely the regional architecture and consider how it might best be developed to serve our interests into the first quarter of the 21st century and beyond. Australia had asked whether the present regional arrangements were equipped to enable all the key Asia Pacific players to have a conversation in the same room at the same time about trade and investment and also about peace, stability and security. APEC and ASEAN would have central roles to play into the future, but we needed to recognise the gaps that existed and consider how to address them. An Asia Pacific community would: encourage further economic and financial integration; foster a culture of deeper collaboration and transparency in security; and drive cooperation on the range of transnational challenges. Mr Smith said the APc initiative was not about supplanting or diminishing the roles of existing regional groupings, especially the centrality of ASEAN; it might emerge from the existing architecture just as the ARF and the EAS had emerged from ASEAN. Keynote address by Dr Han Seung-soo, Former Prime Minister, Republic of Korea In his address to conference delegates, the former Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Dr Han Seung-soo, said his main point was that “the current political, security and economic architecture of the Asia Pacific region must be restructured to meet the new and emerging challenges of this region”. Dr Han pointed to a growing consensus that the 21st century was likely to be the “Asia-Pacific century”: the region’s dynamism was most clearly manifest in its impressive economic growth, which would be sustained and accelerated by the removal of trade barriers. The region’s huge potential for further growth and movements towards sub-regional integration were likely to raise its profile internationally. The growing economic influence of the Asia Pacific region had also considerably bolstered its strategic significance. Furthermore, the region was of monumental importance in global security: the North Korean nuclear issue posed a threat not only to Northeast Asia, but to the rest of the world. Dr Han said it was imperative for countries of the Asia Pacific to respond to these trends. The question was: how do we align the recent positive developments in the Asia Pacific to achieve our strategic objectives in ensuring security and stability? Dr Han believed the region could play a pivotal role in five major areas: conceiving viable solutions for the global financial crisis in other regions (drawing on the lessons of the 1997 Asian financial crisis) and advocating free trade; leading international cooperation to address climate change through a coming together of developed and developing countries to articulate a single voice that the rest of the world could follow; narrowing the development gap by expanding and improving development assistance; bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table, serving the interests of regional security and supporting the vision of a “nuclear free world”; and continuing to provide innovative solutions to non-traditional security threats such as maritime security, piracy, human trafficking, narcotics and terrorism. Dr Han maintained that existing regional mechanisms lacked sufficient mandate and capacity to solve effectively new challenges. The scope of the problems confronting the region rendered urgent calls to create more effective cooperation structures to supplement extant mechanisms. A new structure could be constructed either by readjusting existing mechanisms or forming a new structure to replace current arrangements. Mr Rudd’s APc initiative and Prime Minister Hatoyama’s proposal for an East Asian Community had emerged against this backdrop and both deserved serious consideration. Dr Han said the process of reshaping regional architecture should be guided by a number of principles, taking into account the complexities and diversity of the region: the process should be inclusive; ASEAN should continue playing an instrumental role; a clear standard of contribution from participating countries should be set; and the new framework should not be duplicative. Dr Han said he believed that the enthusiasm surrounding the new proposal of an Asia-Pacific community for regional governance indicated wide support for new multilateral institutions with broad mandates to respond to the changed geopolitical context of the region. The conception of an APc also stemmed from the acknowledgement that the current mechanisms no longer sufficed to comprehensively deal with all the major challenges. An Asia Pacific community that included key global players such as China, Japan, India, the United States and Indonesia as well as other countries in the region would substantially improve the region’s capabilities to deal with the challenges of the 21st century. Possible models for an APc included: expansion of APEC through the addition of political and security issues to its economic agenda and the inclusion of countries not currently members; and expansion of the EAS, allowing the participation of other key players in the region. As the G20 had emerged as the premier forum for global governance, building a new Asia Pacific community should be closely coordinated with the G20 process. Dr Han proposed establishment of an APc Eminent Persons’ group to devise a “concrete action plan for the eventual creation of an Asia Pacific community”. Conference discussion This summary seeks to reflect the free-flowing and open nature of discussion over the six separate breakout sessions and concluding plenary session of the APc conference. As was made clear by the conference host and co-chairs, the conference was not a negotiation and did not seek to be conclusive. Rather, it was intended to enrich and take forward the regional discussion of an APc, which had been proposed by Prime Minister Rudd. The region Participants agreed that the region was increasingly interconnected and that many of the challenges facing regional countries needed to be addressed on a regional basis (although some observed that some challenges might better be addressed globally). The region was going through a profound transition, both in terms of its internal power balances and in relation to its overall global power and influence. The rise of the Asia Pacific was positive and needed to be facilitated. Challenges Challenges facing regional countries in the 21st century were highlighted by participants throughout the two days of the conference. Many of these were new and of a different intensity to challenges the region had faced previously. They included: the confluence in the region of the interests of and, potentially, competition among the great powers – the United States, China, India, Russia and Japan; maintaining economic growth; rebalancing economic relationships (including rebalancing debt in the United States against surpluses in Asia); the build-up of regional militaries; arms control and non-proliferation; competition for scarce energy and water resources; ecological challenges such as climate change; the need to distribute more equally the benefits of globalisation; demographic challenges such as ageing populations; unregulated migration; transnational crime, including terrorism and the illegal movement of people; calls for civil and political rights that could be seen to impact on political stability; and the need to meet demands for human security through freedom from want and fear while not violating states’ rights. Existing regional institutions Conference participants agreed broadly that existing regional institutions had served, and continued to serve, useful functions and should not be discarded. Nevertheless, there was also a broad view that the emerging challenges demanded close examination of current regional architecture. There was, within the region, an uneven and, at times, decreasing confidence – though off a high base – in the ability of existing institutions to cope with anticipated pressures and guarantee peace and prosperity. A committed view was put by some that the region’s key institutions – APEC and ASEAN, including its various associated groupings – were functioning and the region did not face a crisis of institutional failure. In contrast, other participants suggested variously that current regional institutions had a poor record of anticipating challenges, had not dealt effectively with crises, and would not necessarily be up to the task of dealing with future challenges likely to be different from those of the past. Other views fell between these ends of the spectrum. Some took the view that existing institutions had failed in particular to address significant geopolitical changes such as the rise of China and India. Issues arising among the great powers had been largely absent from the agendas of regional institutions. They had not, for example, discussed how bilateral alliances might be transformed into a collective regional security system. The region needed, but did not currently have, architecture that could promote major power cooperation and prevent a small concert of major powers squeezing out the interests of smaller powers. Some expressed the view that ASEAN had survived and prospered because of its consensus approach and because it had evolved in response to regional change. It had reached out to the broader region through groupings such as ASEAN+3, the ARF and the EAS, and had fostered regional linkages and cooperation, including, for example, through the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation. Moreover, nor defensive and was changing to fit current needs. Others took the view that while ASEAN had been successful in building a community in South-east Asia, it was not necessarily optimally placed to play the role of “institution builder” in the Asia Pacific. Regional institutions in their current form did not reflect an emerging “new regional order” and partly for this reason the Asia Pacific region had not had a strong enough voice in global conversations. While there were differing views on its achievements and effectiveness, it was clear that ASEAN’s role was valued. Its future role was a subject for discussion. Were ASEAN and ASEAN-based bodies able to tackle hard security problems and/or drive concrete outcomes? Some participants took the view that the ARF in particular faced significant challenges: it had, for example, achieved some success on confidence-building measures, but to the extent it had begun moving on preventive diplomacy, progress had been very slow and it was not equipped to respond to the larger task envisaged in the Asia Pacific community initiative of discussing together security, political and economic challenges. Whether ASEAN could remain as cohesive as in the past was also discussed. APEC’s role as the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia Pacific region was widely acknowledged. Its practical achievements were, however, thought by some to be difficult to measure. In contrast to APEC’s free trade goals, there were multiple preferential trade agreements in the region, many of which were driven by strategic or defensive rather than economic interests. Moreover, it was not clear whether APEC was robust enough to tackle emerging challenges such as energy and food security. The presence of non-state members Taiwan and Hong Kong would have to be taken into account in any proposal to develop a security agenda. An Asia Pacific community There was broad agreement among participants that countries in the Asia Pacific region needed to both examine existing regional structures in the context of future challenges and strengthen and deepen regional cooperation, including on security. A significant majority of participants believed the APc initiative had generated an important regional conversation that should continue. Participants saw both value in regionalism and gaps in existing regional architecture. Participants also saw clear linkages between political, security and economic challenges, but held a range of views about the APc initiative and the most effective way to address future challenges at the regional level. No participant put the view that there was a need for a “brand new organisation” and no participant put the view that existing organisations could not be improved. Participants discussed the need or otherwise for an APc; possible approaches to taking it forward, including the use of existing “platforms”; the role of an APc; and the need to better define the idea of “community”. Most participants favoured either: an evolutionary approach to regional architecture whereby a focus on identifying challenges and delivering results through closer cooperation would, over time, clarify what institutional arrangements were required; or a more active approach which would focus sooner on structural changes that might be required in the face of emerging regional challenges. A few participants put the view that there was no need for change at this time and that existing structures would adapt if and when the need arose. Questions were raised about the capacity of a single institution to deal with the diverse range of issues facing the region. Some put the view that while imperfect and untidy, networks of existing institutions and state and non-state actors might be best suited to addressing complex and changing challenges. Multi-layered and overlapping approaches to regional architecture might be more effective than a single institution which could become overloaded. It was, however, suggested by others that the inseparability of economic, political and security challenges demanded the attention of leaders gathered in one place, noting that only leaders were in a position to address all three of these types of challenges together in the one national viewpoint. The two approaches were not necessarily exclusive. There was a broad, though not unanimous, view that that APEC and the EAS could be the potential building blocks for an Asia Pacific community. If this approach were developed, in the case of APEC, it would be necessary to admit India and develop a security agenda; in the case of the EAS, it would be necessary to consider admitting the United States and Russia. There was a widely-expressed view that it was necessary to define the meaning of “community”. A community could be a customs union, an integrated economic system or a loose-knit grouping within which common interests and cooperation could develop into institutional arrangements. Participants noted variously that a community should encompass common identity, interests, purpose and norms. Regionalism and a sense of community were underpinned by the presence of driving factors, including: common or converging strategic interests; clarity of purpose; historical factors; an incremental build-up of habits of cooperation and institutions; economic imperatives; and common security problems. A view was put that that any successful future Asia Pacific community would need to: include principles of equality and transparency; take into account the security and development needs of all its members; and involve close collaboration between the principal powers, including China and the United States. The idea of creating an Eminent Persons’ Group to take forward the APc initiative, suggested by Dr Han in his keynote speech, was also raised by several participants. Some put the view that this would be a useful further step, while some others found the idea premature at this stage. A key set of questions, raised in closing discussion, on the best way of taking the APc idea forward, through either an Eminent Persons’ Group or another mechanism, was: was there value in a regional approach, as distinct from a global approach, to meeting present and future economic/financial challenges, geostrategic/security challenges, environmental and other political/social challenges and the interconnections between them? what kind of institutional role would be required to add that value and how crucial was it that this integrate economic, security and other issues (as distinct from addressing them in separate silos)? how should the region be configured for this/these institutional role/s? how would we move institutionally from where we were now to where (as a result of answers to the above), we wanted to be, given: the lack of support for any supra-national executive structure or brand new institution superimposed on all others; the continued significant role for ASEAN; and support for an evolutionary process? Observations by Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh, co-chair Madame Ninh highlighted the challenges of inequality, as well as prosperity, posed by globalisation; increasing competition for energy and water resources; and the rise of China and India. An APc could not manage bilateral relations between the great powers, but could help to develop an environment conducive to amicable settlement of problems that did arise. Madame Ninh told the conference that challenges did not occur in “silos”, but were inter-related, posing the question: could any single structure cope with such interconnectedness and complexity? To be effective, any mechanism(s) responsible for managing future regional challenges would need to be flexible, adaptable and dynamic. There should be resistance to the desire to be “neat” for its own sake. Rather than a single framework or institution, a “modern” approach may be a flexible, modular one where countries were present in some institutions or discussions, but not others. Communities emerged from perceived common challenges, threats and interests from which common goals and objectives could be identified. As the discussion about regional architecture was taken forward, it would, however, be important to pay attention to “style and approach”. Pace and momentum would need to be considered. In developing regional architecture, there would be an element of “right place, right people, right moment”. Factors which might shape membership of any APc included economic inter-linkages, geostrategic weight, ability to contribute, peer acceptance, and geography. In considering membership, it would also be important to get the right balance between effectiveness and inclusiveness. Madame Ninh said ASEAN was an indispensable grouping within the Asia Pacicic community, but precisely what it could contribute in the future was an open question. Once ASEAN was convinced of the need for change, it would move forward. In her view, membership of the G20 by an ASEAN country would not detract from and, in fact, should be a plus for ASEAN. Madame Ninh noted that the inclusion of the United States and Russia in the EAS made realpolitik sense, but remarked also on what she saw as Asia’s growing sense of shared identity and the fact that some countries would be less comfortable than others with the inclusion of these two powers. Observations by Dr Michael Wesley, co-chair Dr Wesley underlined his sense of broad, though not unanimous, agreement that the Asia Pacific faced real challenges and current structures were likely to be inadequate. He said ASEAN had been a response to regional rivalries; APEC had been a response to emerging trade blocks; the ARF had been a response to territorial disputes; and ASEAN+3 and the EAS had formed after the Asian Financial Crisis. Current institutions had not shown a capacity to deal with the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, compelling the region to consider new regional architecture. Dr Wesley saw the most compelling current challenge facing the Asia-Pacific as the rapid realignment of the region’s great powers. The realignment and intersecting interests of the five great powers was potentially a combustible mix and all regional countries had an interest in its management. He said there was no desire to do away with existing institutions, but he had also found support for the idea of a comprehensive regional leaders’ meeting – noting there would be different views on this. He was attracted to the idea of a “concert of powers”, including smaller states as well as the great powers. Such concerts worked best at leaders’ level, face-to-face. There was a well-established tradition of “concerts” in the region – through ASEAN, APEC, ASEAN+3 and the EAS. Dr Wesley also saw a need to build a sense of community at the popular level. There were seven principles which Dr Wesley believed could help form the basis of an APc, were the idea to be taken forward: the core of an APc should be an annual leaders’ meeting with a mandate to engage across the breadth of the security, economic and political challenges facing East Asia and the West Pacific; an APc should complement other regional and global institutions, and might arise out of the evolution of existing multilateral arrangements; an APc should draw on the important role ASEAN continued to play in the evolution of regional multilateral arrangements, and ASEAN would be an important part of any future APc; an APc should promote a market-driven regional economy that was open to the world; an APc should enhance regional stability through dialogue on traditional and non-traditional security threats and seek to develop confidence and security building measures across the region; APc countries should have a history of significant engagement in East Asia and the West Pacific across economic, strategic and political arenas; and APc countries should have a demonstrable vital interest in – and capacity significantly to contribute to – the economic, strategic and political circumstances of East Asia and the West Pacific. Dr Wesley said he believed that there was more support among participants for evolving current institutions than for doing nothing, or creating a new body from the ground up. The best approach to regional architecture would involve a balance between activism and gradualism. He also supported Former Prime Minister Han’s suggestion of an Eminent Persons’ Group or similar senior advisory body to consider the most appropriate means for movement towards the creation of an APc. Observations by Richard Woolcott, conference host It was intended that the host should make closing remarks but, because of the number of participants wanting to speak at the final session, Richard Woolcott decided to give preference to speakers from the floor. He thanked the two co-chairs for their personal observations. In addition, his observations based on discussions with numerous participants were that: the conference had achieved its stated objectives. While it was not a negotiating body, a wide range of interesting and mainly forward-looking opinions, as well as some concerns, were expressed. The discussions were frank and sometimes robust, which we had hoped they would be. Prime Minister Rudd’s concept had been refined and had gained momentum, especially in recent months, since he had first put it forward on 4 June 2008. there was a consensus that there was a need to discuss and consider now the implications for the region of the continuing shift in economic and strategic influence from the Atlantic to the Pacific. the opinion was widely held – although there were some participants who considered existing institutions adequate for the task – that present arrangements had neither the mandates nor the memberships to deal comprehensively, at head of government level, with the major security and political issues the region can expect to face as the coming decade unfolds. the attitudes of government participants from key countries on the call for a more effective regional architecture and the need for an APc were evolving in a positive direction. South Korea’s existing support had been explicitly and publicly strengthened. a number of participants spoke of a possible linkage between an institutionalized G20 and the APc concept. The G20 had demonstrated the value of addressing collectively global financial issues. Some participants said a similar logic could be applied to any emerging arrangements for an APc as well as to the need for links between global and regional institutions. The host believed the outcome of the Conference would provide the Prime Minister and other regional leaders with useful ideas for the next steps in progressing the concept of an APc, including continuing to promote a growing culture of cooperation across East Asia and the Pacific and developing some broader principles for a future APc. Richard Woolcott Ton Nu Thi Ninh Michael Wesley Conference Host Co-chair Co-chair Israel-Palestinian Conflict (Question No. 1199) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 8 February 2010: Does the Government’s recent vote on the United Nations resolution for Palestinian self-determination signal a change in its position on the Israel-Palestinian conflict; if so, can he explain it. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Government considers Middle East-related resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly on a case-by-case basis on their merits, and within the context of our strong support for Israel’s ongoing security, the Middle East peace process and a two-state solution, and the striving for a just and enduring peace. Consistent with these principles, the Government supported the resolution on Palestinian self determination. Foreign Affairs and Trade: Personnel Files (Question No. 1200) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 8 February 2010: (1) Does his department have a system of secret personnel files; if so, why and on what legal authority. (2) Has the Community and Public Sector Union contacted his department in respect of a system of secret personnel files; if so, can he state the outcome. (3) Can he indicate whether his department has been asked to provide information to the Privacy and Merit Protection commissioners about alleged breaches of law and the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct or Values by senior management and/or individual officers in the Corporate Management Division of his department. (4) What are his department’s policies and practices in respect of recording and using confidential information about its officers, and have they recently changed; if so, how. (5) Are staff given access on request to all of their personnel files held by his department; if not, why not; if so, are any records removed prior to being released to staff, as suggested in the media report ‘Secret personnel records back at DFAT’ by Philip Dorling (Canberra Times, 23 November 2009). (6) How many requests have been (a) made, and (b) refused, this calendar year by staff of his department seeking to examine their personnel files. (7) What advice is provided to staff of his department about their rights in relation to accessing their personnel records. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) No. (2) The Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) wrote to the department on 7 October 2009 regarding the department’s management of personnel files. On 27 October 2009, the First Assistant Secretary Corporate Management Division wrote to the CPSU outlining the department’s policy and practice in relation to personnel files – namely that the department maintains personnel files in keeping with the Privacy Act 1988 to administer and manage the department’s staff; that staff can access their individual file; and that each year the department advises the Privacy Commissioner of the types of personal information it holds, including personnel files. (3) The Office of the Privacy Commissioner wrote to the department on 7 December 2009 regarding the department’s management of personnel files. The Privacy Commissioner requested information on what procedures were in place to manage the files and employee access to them. In its reply of 7 January 2010, the department outlined the procedures in place for managing personnel files. On9 February 2010, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner wrote to the department to advise that it had ceased its investigation and closed its file on this matter. The department has not been asked to provide information to the Merit Protection Commissioner on this matter. (4) The department’s policy and practices are outlined in question 2 above. An internal administrative circular was issued on 29 October 2009 to remind staff of procedures for managing and accessing personnel files. There has been no recent change to departmental policy or practices in this regard. (5) Staff can access their personnel files. In keeping with the department’s implementation of the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) in the Privacy Act 1988, information about other individuals on an employee’s personnel file will be removed before access is granted to the employee unless the third party has consented to the employee having access to that material. Other information, such as that obtained from a foreign government or on a confidential basis as part of a Code of Conduct or other grievance process, may also be removed. An employee will be notified if any documents have been removed from her/his personnel file before access is granted to the file. (6) In the calendar year 2010 to 22 February 2010, two requests have been received from employees for access to personnel files. These requests have not been refused. In calendar year 2009, eight requests for access to personnel files were made and no requests were refused. (7) On 29 October 2009, the department issued an internal administrative circular reminding staff how they can access their personnel files.",112,Unhcr Figures For The First Half Of 2009 Ganised Crime
