15,Amendment (By Mr Joseph Cook) Pro,,14,Commerce Bill No 2
16,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"IAccording to the Attorney-General, however, the trade description must be as prescribed, and of such character as the regulations require. For instance, the manager of a butter factory might be compelled to mark his produce as coming from a particular factory, or a particular district, or through a particular agency, and the regulations might prove harassing to the last degree. Moreover, if a word were omitted, or a word were added, to a trade description, it might be held that the law had been contravened, and that the goods were liable to forfeiture. All weneed concern, ourselves about is that goods shall be in accordance with the description attached to them. That was declared to be the real object of the measure, and if a true trade description is applied to goods, there should be no necessity for the Minister to prescribe the very words that shall be used in such description. The Minister might prescribe that butter should be marked as coming from the North Coast, or the South Coast of New South Wales, or elsewhere, or he might insist that even the name of the particular dairy in which it originated be indiCourt of Justice. I endeavoured to induce cated. The provision in the clause, as it stands, appears to be quite unnecessary, and therefore I shall press the amendment. we allow the Bill to pass in its present form, our exporters and importers will be seriously harassed. The States Governments are doing all that is required, and the powers proposed to be conferred under this Bill are not necessary in the interests of our export or our import trade. Wherever possible we should avoid legislation by regulation, and abstain from conferring large powers upon Ministers and officials. habit of passing skeleton Bills, and leaving almost everything to be provided for by regulation. The honourable member for Franklin recently mentioned the case of apples being exported from Tasmania before they were thoroughly matured in order to catch the London market at a time when high prices were ruling. I should like to know what the Minister would do in such a case. Would he insist upon marking the apples as unripe? I do not think that he would be called upon to do anything of the kind. The question whether such' apples -are fit or unfit for use should rest entirely be a foolish proceeding. The same remark upon the decision of the consumer, and if he chooses to purchase them well and good. Every producer and manufacturer should put his own brand on the goods he sends to market, and should stand upon his own reputation. If he sends articles of good quality to market his reputation will insure him good prices, whereas if he forwards articles of bad quality he will have to put up with Jpw prices. We know that goods are sold on the strength of the reputation of the brands applied to them. Why should consumers be denied the opportunity to purchase goods of low quality, when they cannot afford to pay the prices asked for the superior article? We know that so-called shoddy goods are manufactured, not necessarily with the object of deceiving the public, but in order to supply a. low-priced article to meet the requirements of persons of small means. So long as every producer places his own brand on his goods and stands by it, we can do no more for the consumers of our produce beyond the Commonwealth. I should not object to grant the Minister extensive reserve powers if the right were conceded to persons charged with contravening the law to appeal to a an honourable and learned member to drafta clause which would make provision in thaidirection, but he represented that the provisions of the Bill were so complex that it would be difficult to meet the case. This Parliament, which regards itself as occupying a position of superiority to the States Legislatures, should be the last to strip citizens of their right to betried by judicial authorities when they are charged with evading the law. It may be urged that if one exporter sends out goods of bad quality he will injure the reputationof our products. There mav be a few cases of that kind, but We have fallen, into the T do hot think that they will have any appreciable influence upon our markets. If , on the other hand, an importer brings goods into the country under a wrong description, he alone will be the sufferer. Mr Davidson, a large buyer in London, who was 1 examined before the Butter Commission the other day, distinctly stated that Australian butter was not purchased upon the strength of a Government brand, but upon its quality. Will' any man: of common sense purchase butter at an auction sale in England without -first having a sample box opened? That would, indeed, is applicable to apples. They are not purchased in the London market in sealed.",14,Commerce Bill No 2
17,Mr Lonsdale (New England),"I fcases. It is absolutely foolish to talk about men buying goods with their eyes closed. They have to use their own judgment in matters of this sort. All that we should do under this Bill is to compel a man to put his own name and that of his factory upon his goods. If we do that, every articlewithin a very short time-wil l receive its proper price. I do trust that the Minister will make the Bill very much less drastic. Minister might very well accept the amendment. There is no person who is better qualified to give a true trade description of goods than is their owner. I do not believe that we should leave it to the Minister to declare by regulation what shall constitute a true trade description. The owner of any goods should be held responsible for placing such a description upon (hem. To my mind, we are' asked to trust 1 the Minister and the Department altogether Too much. I am entirely opposed to the imposition of undue restrictions upon exporters. The onus should be upon the exporter himself to give a true trade description of his goods. My experience has been that the judgment of practical men is infinitely preferable to that of so called experts. The exporters of apples or of butter will take every care to see that their brands are not injured by any trade description which' they may put upon them. A* man would not, for example, place his best brand upon goods of inferior quality. brand on, and, if he can dispose of the butter as being of the best quality, he will do so. member for West Sydney knows very little about the matter. condition of affairs which was disclosed by the Butter Commission. who are engaged in the trade, and who are exporting their own goods. At the present time, two-thirds of the butter exported from New South Wales is being shipped by the farmers themselves. They have had to cut their owrr pathway to success, and in doing so, they have been severely torn by thorns and brambles. Despite the disabilities under which they laboured, they have achieved their object. I trust that the Minister will agree to the amendment. amusing to hear the honourable member for Cowper insisting that the words "" a true trade description"" should be embodied in the Bill. He has altogether overlooked the fact that the words "" trade description"" are already defined in the measure, as will be seen by reference to clause 3. Honourable members opposite were parties to the acceptance of that definition. words ""of such character."" must give the information required by the Minister. Minister being allowed to determine the precise form of any trade description. opposite wish to embody in the Bill a provision which may have the effect of obscuring the origin of certain goods. We know what the words "" of such character"" imply. We do not want a repetition of the condition of affairs which was disclosed by the Butter Commission. butter that was sent to London had the Government brand upon it. had been removed by the shippers at their own sweet will trade description"" overcome the difficulty ? the definition which is contained in clause 3.

36,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"to Be under a curious misapprehension as to the object which we have in view. There is nothing in the amendment that would interfere with the right of the Minister to prescribe a trade description in any way he thought fit, so far as its substantial accuracy was concerned. The definition of ""trade description"" in the interpretation clause, is wide and vague, and under it the Minister may prescribe that goods shall be so branded as to show the country of origin and the country of destination, their nature, measure, quality, gauge, and every other particular. that under the clause, as it stands, a man might accurately describe his goods in all these respects, but if the description contained a word different from the verbiage dictated by the Minister, his goods would be liable to forfeiture. If that be permitted, we shall make the Minister a despot of a kind who ought not to be tolerated. I do not wish it to be the law of the land that if a man happens to place a description on his goods which is not exactly in accordance with the words dictated by the Minister in relation to a matter about which there is really! no dispute, he may be liable to have those goods held up and forfeited. The Attorney-General argued last night that it was not sufficient that a trade description should be true. He urged that it should be given in the exact words prescribed by the Minister. That would be an injustice to honest traders who have nothing to gain by hiding the truth. It would leave them liable to the risk of having their goods confiscated simply because some one who i\ad been told to brand them omitted from tl:e description a word that it ought to have contained. I think the Minister should instantl)"" accept the amendment"". opposed to the clause altogether, and am therefore prepared to support any amendment that will limit it, or at least make its terms definite. the words "" of such a character "" are not only indefinite, but unnecessary. I approve of the word "" true "" being inserted in their stead, so that a true trade description will be all that is reduired. If the clause be nassed ns it stands, it will frive the Minister power to provide for any description thflt he pleases. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) I am astonished at the attitude of many honourable members in regard to this amendment. The ostensible object of the Bill is to provide that our imports and exports shall be true to name, but when an amendment is proposed that will more effectually carry out that object, we find honourable members declaring that what is needed is not a true description but a description to be prescribed by the Minister of Trade and Customs for the time being. During the last twelve months, we have had three different Ministers in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs, and each of those honourable gentlemen might have issued different regulations. Our object should be to The point is, however, make this measure as clear and as definite as possible; but we are now proposing to pass what is really a skeleton B ill , which will place very wide power in the hands of the Minister. I protest against the Minister being given power to say what shall be a true description. The clause, as it stands, does not provide that goods imported or exported shall be true to the labels they bear. tion of "" trade description,"" and the regulations cannot go beyond that definition. MrM c WILLIAMS The proposal to eliminate the words "" of such a character"" must be considered in connection with the proposition to insert the word "" t r u e "" in their stead. What we desire to do is to provide that a trade description shall bea true one. If a man exports or imports-, goods bearing what is an absolutelv truedescription, nothing more should be required of him. The Attorney-General said"" last night that the Minister must have some reserve power over and above that provided"" in the Act itself. I do not think that it would be wise to give the Minister such apower, and I shall support the amendment, so that all regulations framed under the Bill will require that goods imported orexported shall bear a truthful description. able member for Moira, whose opposition toI t seems to me that the amendment is, I am sure, based on a misconception, should be one of the first to support a proposal to insure a fair deal' to the producers of Australia. been looking for. will not insure a fair deal to the producers if he allows the clause to pass in its present form. port any proposal that would really nullifv the object of the B ill .",16,Commerce Bill No 2

42,Mr Kennedy,"I am not going to suphas laid stress on the definition of "" trade description"" given in clause 3, but I would point out to him that under this clause a landing waiter-would have a right to say whether the description placed on any goods was not merely true, but "" of the character"" prescribed in the regulations. He would have the right to say, not only whether it was substantially correct, but also whether the statement of the technical details was in the order and sequence required under the regulations. Let me give my honourable friend an illustration of what I mean. Butter, for instance, would certainly require to bear the factory brand, and a description showing whether it was factory, creamerv, or dairy butter. Then perhaps the place of origin, and the State from which the butter had come, would also be required. But unless the clause be amended in the way proposed, a landing waiter will be able to say, simply because any one of these essential items of information has not been given in the order prescribed by regulation, that the butter shall be seized, and in the end it might be forfeited. Surely that is not a position in which the honourable member would like to see the producers of his constituency placed. If the departmental regulations said that the particulars of a trade description were to be set forth in the following order: Brand of factory, description of butter, place of origin, and State of origin, and the producer placed on his packages a description in which the particulars ran : State of origin, place of origin, brand of factory, description of butter, thus transposing the order, a landing waiter could refuse to allow the goods to pass. partment are men of common sense. intelligence of the Department were so extremely high as to enable us to trust to the judicial intelligence of every officer drawing £ 2 0 r £ 3 per week, it would not be necessary to propose the amendment, because the administration of the 'Act would be as we wish to insure it. In view of the inconvenience which may be caused to his constituents if the clause remains unaltered, the honourable member should be only too anxious to assist those who are supporting the amendment. We ask for a "" true "" trade description; and surelv insistence upon a true trade description will prevent roguery. But the honourable member objects. He says that the clause as it stands will not affect any honest exporter. That being his position, I cannot understand how he can contend that the insertion of the word "" t r u e "" would affect any honest exporter. The Minister tells us that the words which we propose to omit should remain in the clause because they are in the clauses which deal with imports. That is an extraordinary remark for the representative 'of a producing constituency, to make. Although the contention of the minority, that the Bill should seek to protect only our consumers, has been overborne, and we are being asked to deal with exports as well as imports, I should like to know if the health of the people of the countries to which we export should be of more consideration to us than the welfare of our producing classes. to study. that the manufacturers of Great Britain are losing ground because they consider their own tastes in the methods of their manufacture rather than the tastes of those for whom they are making!' Are they not blamed because they make their goods, not for their markets, but according to the methods which they think best, without consulting the wishes of those for whom they are intended ? And yet the Government is now asking us to commit the same fault. We must consider the markets to which we send our produce. and get-up of packages, and so forth. the size of packages mav be prescribed. Destill further powers.

In any action^ in Court the defendant has his defence, and it is his own fault if he makes no claim for the goods when seized.

We do not brand fruitbut we brand the packages in which it is put up, and it is the same in regard to fruit. All perishable products are to be branded. If that is not to be done, why has there been all this talk about grading?

It may be most desirable that the butter sent to England shall be packed in a certain way, and that sent to other markets in another way. I was very much struck on reading the report of a British Consul on the Continent of Europe by the statement that the English manufacturer has failed utterly to take the advantages which belong to him, and has lost his market by declining to pack his goods in the manner considered to be most suitable by those who wish to purchase such goods. I expect that before long we shall become large exporters of fruits, dried and otherwise, and the question of capturing markets Is a box of fruit to be perwill depend upon the most delicate details, such as the particular mode of packing adopted, the labels affixed to the goods; whether, for instance, prunes are packed in thin syrup or thick syrup, or without is not syrup at all, and so on. It is neither necessary nor desirable that the Department should interfere with the packing of the goods. All that they can say is that they are advised by their agents in other countries that such and such methods of preparation and packing are most likely to find favour in the markets! The exporter must be asAlthough the Comptrollersumed to be thoroughly advised from all sources as to the-best methods of preparing his goods. If he is not so advised, he will have to pay a very heavy penalty in the shape of losses on his shipments. Therefore it should be sufficient for the Customs authorities to satisfy themselves that the goods bear a full, true, and particular description. For instance, an exporter of jam ought to include in the description on the label a statement that the contents weigh 16 ozs. gross, or net, as the case may be. He ought not to deceive the consumer as""to the actual weight of the contents, but at the same time he should be free to pack his goods in such a way as to cater for the public taste. He should be permitted to amx to his goods any label he pleases, so long as he does not misrepresent their character by making false statements, or telling only a part of the truth.

That is a reasonable supposition, and the object of such a prescription would be an excellent one. Apples may be brought to a wharf for export, and the officials in charge may say that they are not up to the prescribed standard, or are not branded with the proper description. wrongs of these proposals may be, the Minister and his friends have a majority behind them, and so they say, "" What is the good of contending for the right view when the decision is predetermined?"" Even though the view which I am expressing may be quite wrong, it is one which is entitled to be put, and which should be considered by the Committee, instead of being voted against mechanically. All that the honourable member for Parramatta proposes, adopting the words which I moved last night in regard to importers, is that the exporter who satisfies the Comptroller General or the Minister that the nonapplication or inaccurate application of a trade description has been the result of an accident, or, at any rate, was not an attempt to defraud or to break the law, shall have his goods returned to him. As the clause stands, goods which have been seized will not be released unless the Minister or Comptroller-General chooses to release them. otherwise ? ' fact that there has been no intent to defraud should give the owner the right to receive back his goods. Their return should not be left entirely to the discretion of the Department. But the Minister refuses to give that right to the man who proves that his violation of the law has been accidental. The reasons for that refusal are beyond my comprehension. learned member think that a standard for apples will be prescribed? to the export of foods, medicines, and manures. Are we going to export medicines? We may before long export manures, because of certain recent developments in the trade; and we are already exporters of foodstuffs. Those of us who have taken an interest in the export of fruit know that harm may be done by the export of fruit of poor quality, and the Bill will be a dead letter unless it is applied to all our staple exports of foodstuffs. I am appealing to the Minister, not in the interests of the importing class, but in the interests of the producers, as a protectionist to a protectionist. If a man proves to the satisfaction of the Minister that his violation of the law is accidental and a mere error, he should have the right to get back his goods. ister is not satisfied. to accept the statement of facts laid before him he could, under the amendment, be charged with maladministration, and the merits of the case would then be thrashed out. Under the clause as it stands, however, he could allege a thousand reasons for refusing to return the goods, none of -which could be challenged. If the exporter places before the Minister in justification of, or excuse for, what has occurred, statements which any reasonable man would believe, and the Minister or his officials refuse to deliver up goods which have been seized, it should be possible to make them responsible for their action. But under the Bill as it stands the return of goods which have been seized will be entirely a matter for the discretion of the Minister. We are entitled to ask for this protection of the producers, no matter how implicitly the present Minister may be trusted by both importers and exporters. Are the producers to be unable to challenge departmental action, when they have proved beyond reasonable doubt that they are entitled to the return of their goods?

Such a provision is a monstrous one. MrM c LEAN (Gippsland) I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter. I am quite in favour of conferring upon the Minister power to prohibit the exportation of products if they f a l l below certain standards, and I would not vote for any amendment that would have the effect of curtailing the Minister's authority in that direction. At the same time, we should not impose any unnecessary disabilities upon our producers. The amendment does not seek to limit the Minister's power to prohibit exports that do not reach the prescribed standard, but it fixes the responsibility for any decision that may be arrived at upon him. If the original wording of the clause be adhered to, it will permit of the white-washing of those who may be guiltv of lax administration, and I do not think we should lend ourselves to anything of that, kind. I am sure that the Minister does not wish to avail himself of any such power, and I trust that he will see his way to accept the amendment. amendment will not alter the effect of the clause, because it will still rest with the Comptroller-General or the Minister to decide whether or not the goods shall be confiscated. the Minister slower to be careless. tolerate any Minister or any Comptroller General who confiscated goods without just cause.

Not only will merchants be obstructed, but those who are working on the farm, in the orchard, or in the dairy factory will find themselves hampered at every turn. I do not suggest that the officials of the Customs Department will deliberately inflict injury upon our producing interests, but our experience in the past is sufficient to justify us in insisting that the fullest safeguards shall 'be provided against harsh treatment being meted out to those who may innocently contravene the law. We have no desire whatever to facilitate the operations of dishonest traders or producers, but we should protect by every means in our power the interests of those who make honest mistakes.

An article recently published in the Sydney Morning Herald reads as follows :As State supervision and the grading of dairy products extends, the unqualified success which marks its progress is causing its opponents more anxiety. order.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am replying to the remarks made by the honourable member for Kooyong in regard to the attitude taken up by Ministers and their supporters towards the compulsory provisions of this Bill. I claim that the legislation which is operative in Queensland is practically identical with the Government proposals in this measure. I hold in my hand a copy, of fhe Review of Reviews for the present month, which contains an article upon the New Zealand grading system. In that country the Government have adopted even more stringent measures than we propose to take with regard to the grading and general treatment of produce which is intended for export.

However, I shall not pursue that aspect of the subject any further. I have simply made these remarks with a view to rebutting the statements of the honourable member for Kooyong. that the object of the amendment, which is a very similar one to that which was proposed in clause 7, is to prevent the Department from acting in a way which' might prove injurious to the exporter. pose that the Department would in any way restrict the export of the produce of Australia? gine that either the officers of the Department or the Minister would lend themselves to anything of the kind. In spite of all that has been said in regard to my administration, I say that there is nobody who b prepared to do more to assist in developing the export of the natural and manufactured products of Australia than I am. An attempt has been made by some honourable members to place a fanciful interpretation upon the words of this clause. The Customs Department will meet the exporters in every possible way. clause is designed to protect the producers generally from the injurious consequences of acts committed by persons who do not care whether they destroy our commerce or not. learned member for Corinella, the object of the amendment is to prevent the Department from seizing any goods for export, if the Minister or his officers-eithe r one or both-ar e satisfied that the owner of fhe goods has unwittingly allowed a false trade description to be placed upon them.

At the same time, the -Minister has a right to say whether the law has been complied with. So long as it is complied with, there is not the slightest danger of any restrictions of an arbitrary character being imposed upon our export trade. Only a year or two ago It has been declared I had to deal with the marking of certain packages or tins which were imported into Australia by one or two tobacco firms. Those firms complied with the provisions of the Customs Act, but they did so ini such a way that it was necessary to use a But does anybody supmicroscope in order to discover the letters upon the tins. If the Department had not possessed power to compel them to It is simply absurd to imamark those tins in a proper way, theywould have complied with the law; but the public would not have been protected. sity for the Bill. firms was a large one, and its memberswere very angry with me because I compelled them to alter their labels upon the tins so that the public could see them. All that the Department desire is that our exports shall be of a standard quality, so Ths that no injury may accrue to the trade. I am just as strong as is the honourable member for Gippsland in my desire to do nothing to hamper the business of the exporters. If the Committee will agree toAs was stated by the honourable and the clause in its present form, and I subsequently find that, without injuring its effectiveness, we can alter its wording insuch a way as to dissipate the dread which is in the minds of some honourable members, I shall be pleased to recommit it.

I am as strongly convinced as he is of the necessity to fix proper standards for exports. In that respect I may differ from manv of my honourable friends of the Opposition: but had I not been thoroughly convinced of the necessity to fix standards of purity and excellence for exports, I should not have given instructions for the drafting of this Bill. I believe that I am really more convinced than is the Minister himself of the need to take action in this regard, because in certain respects he has already weakened the measure in a way that I should not have clone had I remained in office. My intention was that the Bill should provide the nucleus of a Department of Agriculture; but my honourable friend has transformed it into something of the nature of a Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. I would point out to him that if the amendment be carried, he will still be the supreme judge of whether the goods in question comply with the regulations. speaking from personal experience of the working of the Department. Sir greatest respect to the honourable member's opinions. knows that, although the Comptroller General is named in the clause, the administration of the measure will have to be intrusted to officers at the various ports from which exports are made. While I was Acting Minister of External Affairs, a case came under my notice, in which the Commonwealth had been brought into disrepute in the eyes of the world, owing to an error of judgment on the part of an officer stationed at a distant port. I refer to the case of the blind man, Mcintosh. The matter never came under my notice until the harm had been done, and the consequence was that, owing to this slight error of judgment-a n error into which an officer might naturally) fall-grea t harm was done to the reputation of the Commonwealth. In the same way, trouble might arise under this clause. A producer might send his products to a port for export, and an officer of the Department, either did not strictly comply with the requirements of the law, might proceed to forfeit them, leaving the exporter no opportunity to put his case before the Minister. Such an incident would be quite possible under the clause as it stands. The amendment, however, proposes that the Minister shall give the owner of products which are threatened with confiscation the right to put his case before the Department. The Department is still to be the supreme judge. If the Minister considered there had been an evasion of the law, he would naturally support the action of the officer; but in that event he would act with full knowledge of the case, and would accept the responsibility for his action. If the clause were allowed to remain as_it stands, an officer at a distant port might forfeit, say, perishable goods without bringing the case under the notice of the Minister, and it might subsequently be found that a serious mistake had been made, with the result that an individual had perhaps been ruined. The Minister would then come down to Parliament, and say, "" I never knew anything about the forfeiture,"" and Parliament would whitewash him. That should not be possible. I desire to protect the producer, I am as far as he can be protected, consistently with strict compliance with the law, as the Minister wishes it to be administered. I simplv wish to give the producer a right come before the Minister, so that the latter will have a full knowledge of the circumstances, , and accept the responsibility of any action he may take with regard to it. ' If he considered there was an evasion of the law, he could proceed to confiscate the goods, while if , on the other hand, he was satisfied that an error had been innocently committed he would save the party concerned from the loss of his goods. The amendment is a reasonable one, which will insure proper inquiry before drastic action is taken. My honourable friend should not object to such a safeguard in the interests of the producer, seeing that his power and that",26,Pairs

135,Mr Mclean,"My honourable friendof his Department wiil not be weakened. His opposition to. the amendment suggests that he is afraid of the responsibility which it would impose upon him; but I think he is too strong a man to be influenced by such considerations. He must remember that it is a very serious matter that a producer should run the risk of having his goods confiscated without being heard, and perhaps in the absence of a valid reason for their confiscation. I confess that, although the equities may be the same, I feel much more strongly with regard to this amendment than I did in reference to that proposed in the clause relating to imports. It may be that I am more familiar with the position of our exporters : but I know how they will regard such a clause as this. It is the imposition of unnecessary restrictions that frightens the producers, and causes many of them to be opposed to supervision of any kind. I am strongly in favour of Government supervision over exports and the fixing of standards, for I know that the system has raised the reputation of the products of the United States of America in the markets of the world to such an extent as to more than justify the application of a very stringent law. Such laws, indeed, have been more than iustified, wherever they have been brought into operation; but let us, in mercy's name, refrain from encumbering a Bill providing for Government supervision with oppressive provisions that are not essential to its probeen amended, it cannot be postponed. per administration. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I know that the honourable member for Gippsland is in full sympathy with the producers, and I should like to meet him as far as I possibly can. At 'the present moment I do not feel 'disposed to accept the amendment; but in view of the honourable member's statement, and because, like him, I am anxious that the prothis particular question. ducers shall not be unduly alarmed at the provisions of the Bill, I shall have the matter thoroughly investigated, and shall probably submit an amendment calculated to remove all fears in this regard, if such an amendment can be drafted. I shall be quite prepared to recommit this part of the clause, so that after I have inquired whether clause are those set out in sub-clause 3; it can be modified to meet the views of honourable members, they will have another opportunity to vote upon it, provided that we cannot come to an agreement. some remarks made this afternoon by the Minister, the honourable gentleman is under the impression that certain observations which I made this morning with reference to the administration of his Department had a personal application. orable gentleman that I did not intend in any way to reflect upon him. He was quite justified in saying that the Chambers of Commerce recognise that his first accession to office as Minister of Trade and Customs was followed by a moderate, rational, and business-like administration of the Department. I do not make that statement with' any desire to cast reflections on his predecessor ; but I do say that the mercantile community recognise that he has administered the Department on equitable lines. They also recognise that he showed a desire to meet the wishes of the deputation from the Chambers of Commerce, which recently waited upon him. I wished to make it thoroughly clear that the remarks which I made this morning had no personal application. able member's assurance; as a matter of fact, I was not referring to him.

In any case, if requested, I shall recommit this portion cf the clause, in order that we may deal with of this kind to be made, as much in the interests of the Department as in those of the produceYs themselves. It seems to me that the only circumstances in which the Minister will be able to avoid forfeiting goods coming within the provisions of this but if the word "" s h a l l "" were substituted for the word "" may,"" the position would be altogether different.

On the second reading the Government were asked as to whether it was intended by the Bill to provide for the Commonwealth grading of exports. One Minister denied that the Bill would have any such effect, and others said that it would have that effect, while the Attorney-General said both that it would and would not have that effect. This clause provides beyond all manner of doubt that goods intended for export may, in rrianner prescribed, be graded. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in speaking of-this matter, is reported to have saidIs there anything in tfie B ill which can be construed by a sane man as a provision for the compulsory grading of butter. . '. . No sane man out of Parliament would'think that such a thing is possible. It is plain, however, that the clause gives the Government power to grade. The constituents whom I represent get their livelihood wholly from the soil. They do not believe in the grading of produce, and they expect me to voice their feeling on the subject. I did sd. in the State Parliament, and I intend to do so here. I shall divide the Committee against the clause. It does not seem to me that the branding of exports with the Commonwealth, brand will enable a higher price to be obtained for our produce, and fhe system of grading may cause a goodi deal of trouble. Minister to say that there was to be no Commonwealth grading, but the clause provides for grading, and the Minister some time ago read a number of articles and letters to prove that the grading of our exports is the proper thing to provide for. In Victoria, I believe, grading is done by officials of 'the State, though I do not know that it is compulsory; but in Queensland State grading is compulsory, and the -Minister read an extract from a letter published in a newspaper, in which the writer tried to show that beneficial results are obtained from it. In South Australia, too, there is State grading, and the people seem to be satisfied with the system. In New South Wales, however, there is no Government interference There is a system in vogue there which is far before any system of Government interference, co-operative companies taking the work of distribution into their hands, appointing their own salesmen, and sending their butter to the markets of the world themselves.

163,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"I contend thatstandard should be fixed, and that goods falling below that standard should ndt be exported. As the clause stands, goods of any quality may be exported, provided they are properly marked. I am quite prepared to empower the Minister to fix a minimum standard, but once that standard is complied with, sellers should be allowed to determine how far they would go above that standard. If exports are graded, buyers will never pay more than a certain price for a particular grade, no matter how high the quality, but if goods fall below the grade they will pay less for them. Therefore the seller will never gain, but may be subjected to serious loss. The clause as it stands does not convey what the Minister desires. It means something which neither the Minister nor the country want. I would urge the Minister to abandon the clause, and substitute a provision for fixing a minimum standard. can determine what the clause means until the High Court has given its decision, and that tribunal will know only because it will be the last to speak. Will the Minister accept an amendment providing for a minimum standard? pass the clause as it stands, honourable memprescribed be markedbers are entftled to know what it means. At present it is so vague that it is impossible to ascertain what is intended by it, how it will be interpreted, how the officers of the Department will construe it, or what will be done. In one aspect of the clause it would be possible to do anything in the way of grading goods. The Government might establish ten or twenty grades of butter. The Minister must know from his experiences of grading how expert opinions vary. There is no difficulty, however, in determining whether an article is, or is not, good enough for export. The Minister has, on the whole, been very reasonable, and I ask him not to spoil a good record by taking up an attitude of obstinacy in this matter. Will he undertake to recommit the clause for the consideration of amendments ? of Trade and Customs) I would point that the clause is as definite as it is possible out to the honourable and learned member to make it. for Corinella that grading is in operation at the present moment in Victoria.

He is an absolute necessity to have such a proproposes to establish standards, and to have vision in the B ill . The .Minister of Trade and Customs is perfectly right. The meaning of this clause is absolutely plain. It is clear that it goes a great deal further than any State Acts attempt to go. It is a great pity that the Minister did not read to the Committee the report which his departmental officers have placed in his hands. Instead of doing so, he merely read a few sentences in reference to the matter of grading. I have here the f u l l report of his officers. In regard to South Australia, that document states that, when asked for by the shipper, grading takes place, and certain things are done. In Victoria an Act was passed in 1898, I did not say called the Exporters' Produce Act. Compulsory inspection under this Act takes place in the case of butter and cheese intended for export, but there is no provision for compulsory grading. There is an inspection for the purpose of ascertaining that the food which is intended for export is of good quality. The Minister has quoted figures with a view to showing what are the weights of certain kinds of lamb. I am informed that lamb of the lighter weights is very much superior to lamb of Therefore, I do not the heavier weight. Consequently it does not follow that the grading of lamb in this way indicates the quality of the produce. The Minister, however, proposes to stamp the qualitv of the produce upon the packages in which it is shipped. The report goes on to say that grading is not undertaken in Victoria except at the request of the shippers. It , is not compulsory.

It will thus be seen that in all these cases the grading of goods is a voluntary act on the part of the exporters. it is compulsory. the Minister upon having discovered that it is compulsory in that colony. In all the States of the Commonwealth it is optional. It is unwise to arm ourselves with these drastic powers, and I am perfectly certain that our action will be bitterly resented by the States. In Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia, matters are progressing satisfactorily enough; why, then, should we impose upon the Slates additional legislation of a much more stringent character? If the Minister can show that these further and drastic powers are necessary, honourable members upon this side of the Chamber might be prepared to meet him. But the weight of testimony is that the grading which already takes place in the States is quite sufficient and quite satisfactorv. pathize very much with the position of the Minister. He was not responsible for the drafting of the Bill, and he has had it placed in his hands without any knowledge of the original intention of its authors. I think that this clause goes much further than there is any real necessity to go. It appears to me that what the Commonwealth should do is to establish a standard below which the export of produce should not be permitted, or, if permitted, we should clearly indicate that the produce is not exported as fit for human consumption. Having fixed that standard, we should be going out of our way if we attempted to establish the different grades of commodities which were fit for human consumption, and the export of which was permitted. Any such attempt would throw upon the Commonwealth Government the responsibility of fixing 'the exact, value of every commodity exported. That would be going a great deal further? than there is any real necessity for, and much further than we have power to go. Besides, it would in many respects result in discrediting the judgment of the Commonwealth inspectors, because, as the honourable member for Moira Commerce [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill (No. 2). is aware, some, of these commodities would deteriorate after they had been marked. If they were branded first, second, third, or fourth grade, and some of them subsewould be discovered, and the judgment of the .Commonwealth classifiers would consequently be brought into disrepute. All that it is necessary for us to do is fo establish a' standard of excellence with which all foodZealand stuffs must comply, and to provide that if anything is exported below that standard, it must bear a discrediting mark upon it. of that sort in the Bill which was prepared at the instance of the honourable member? tions to have a Bill drafted. When that measure came into my hands, it did not comply with my intentions by a very long way. Accordingly, I intended to thoroughly revise it before submitting it to my colleagues for approval, but I was denied the opportunity of so doing. As a result, it was put into the hands of the present Minister in a very crude form. He did not know my intentions in the matter, and consequently I sympathize with his poj sition. I am anxious to assist him to make the Bill effective for the purposes for which it was intended. I desire to insure that no Australian products shall be sent abroad which are likely to bring discredit upon our export trade, and to lower the value of our products in the outside markets. I wish to maintain a reasonably high standard for all the produce that we export. But having fixed that standard, and having forbidden the export of any product which falls below it, except under certain conditions, I think that we ought not to be asked to go further. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) -The honourable member has disclaimed that he"", at any time revised the Bill from which a good many of these clauses have been taken. He declares that he gave instructions to his officers to prepare that measure. For the information of honourable members, I shall again read one of the clauses which the original Bill contained.

The New Zealand Act contains the following provision: No product sha'l be shipped or placed on board any ship for exportation to any place beyond New Zealand unless it bears the prescribed stamp or mark, or the certificate in writing as to quality or condition, signed by the officer duly authorized in that behalf under this Act. tories there. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It may be that the Department will take the opportunity to have the grading carried out at the factories. I have quoted this section to show that the grading and marking provisions of the law which have accomplished so much good in the case of New Zealand products are of a compulsory character. I will not promise at the present time to recommit the clause under consideration, but when I move to recommit the two clauses to which I am already pledged, it will be within the power of any honourable member to take action in that direction. That will give honourable members an opportunity to test an amendment in the clause. gentleman might say, in the event of the amendment being carried, "" I will surrender the B ill . "" Sir WILLIA M LYNE I shall say nothing of the kind, but shall be prepared to accept the decision of the House. I. do not promise to agree to an alteration of the clause, but I shall be prepared in any reasonable way to accept the decision of the House, and subsequently the decision of the Committee, in reference to -it. I do not think I should be asked to do more than that. that the wording of the clause may give rise to some alarm on the part of the producers and exporters of goods. I therefore suggest that it would be desirable to amend it so that it would readAny goods intended for export, which have been inspected in pursuance of this Act, shall have a trade description attached, as may be prescribed. provided in the clause as it stands. wording of the New Zealand Act. It is the verbiage of the clause that suggests, that the Government propose to attempt fo grade these goods for export. I do not think, however, that the Department could, of its own volition, attempt to grade goods in the literal sense of the word. in favour of the Commonwealth grading exports into different classes? ing only so far as the inspection of exports must necessarily lead to their classification. what is feared or nothing. our intention to be clearly stated. It has been said that grading is carried on under the Victorian Act. As a matter of fact, however, we have no compulsory grading. The grading that takes place is the result of the inspection, and is simply a classification of the goods. Take, for instance, the classification of Iambs for export. only to the weight and the age of the lambs. away from the fact that it leads to grading, although it is grading that is not compulsory. quality. The objection to the wording of the clause is that it might lead to the belief that Government grading was intended.

At present it seems to me that his proposed amendment differs very slightly from the clause itself. The only point is that it might allay the fears that have arisen. I make the suggestion in all earnestness, because I think it is to be regretted that we should differ on non-essentials. It is fair to assume that we are doing our best to make the Bill a workable one, and I think that all we need to provide in this clause is that exports shall bear a trade description conveying an intimation of what they really purport to be.",33,William Lyne An D I Pay The To State His Case In Such A Way That It Must

204,Mr Kennedy,"That is my object.I hold, however, that inspection is absolutely necessary. In the early days of the frozen meat industry of Victoria our reputation was seriously affected by the action of those who, in an effort to make money, shipped inferior meat to London. Under the present system of inspection, however, we are once more building up a reputation for our meat, butter, and other food products, and it would be a pity if we allowed anything to be done that would damage that reputation. The object of the Bill is to prevent inferior goods of Australian origin being sent into the markets of the world, but we ought not to draw fine lines of distinction as to quality. I trust that the Minister will carefully consider the clause, and see whether an amendment cannot be made that will meet the wishes of the Committee. point out to the honourable member for Moira that, whilst it is true that the reputation of Australian commodities on the markets of the world hus probably been injured by the export of inferior goods, there is nothing in the Bill that would put an end to such practices. All that it provides is that our exports shall bear labels showing what their classification is. Once they leave our shores, however, the labels may be removed. We have no guarantee that when they are placed on the markets of England they will bear the brands that they had at the port of shipment. It must, therefore, be recognised that the proposed system of inspection will not promote the interests of the producers in the smallest degree. position to be met? except by the action of the Legislatures of the countries to which our exports are consigned. The developments that have taken place during the consideration of the Bill have certainly surprised me. told at the outset that it did not provide for Government grading; but now we find that this clause could have been inserted for no other purpose. have been inspected they are to have marks or labels placed upon them, indicating that they belong to certain grades. After the explanation made by the honourable member for Gippsland, one can understand how this ill-digested measure came to be introduced. I am not casting any blame on fhe Minister. Probably he imagined when he took office that the draft Bill had been well considered, but his views regarding its scope and intention have very materially changed since its introduction. I must confess that my own opinions with regard to it have also undergone a considerable change. The more we consider it the more must we be convinced that it is not likely to serve a useful purpose. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon honourable members that the. excellent provisions with respect to grading that have been adopted in the States are purely voluntary. Any one who exports through the agency of the Export Department of South Australia must submit to certain conditions as to grading; but an exporter is not compelled to avail himself of the services of that Department. The fact that many consigments are sent direct to London without passing through the Government Dep6t keeps the Government graders up to the mark, because they know that the goods passing through their hands will have to compete with those sent through other agencies. Under this Bill, however, it is proposed that all our exports shall be graded, and there will be no competition to stimulate the Government graders to perform their work efficiently. I am convinced that the conditions at present prevailing in, at least, some of the States, are infinitely better than any likely to be brought about by the passing of this Bill. that the Minister should consider this question from the point of view of the tremendous responsibility which the Government are proposing to take upon themselves. The deputation from the Chambers of Commerce which recently waited upon the honourable gentleman pointed out the objections to Government grading, and the Minister then replied that he was not in favour of such a system. We were said that the desire was to have goods so marked as to show whether they were inferior or superior; but the reply to this statement was that no one would think of After the goods exporting goods bearing the words "" in ferior."" I do not wish to debate the question at length; but it is so serious that we should not allow the clause to pass without a promise from the Minister that we shall have a further opportunitv to discuss it.

I cannot understand why the Minister should ask for a special privilege in regard to these regulations. Tlie Minister cannot get power to make regulations without the concurrence of both Houses of Parliament. How, then, can he logically ask that regulations..shall . be allowed to have force, even when they are disapproved of by one House of Parliament? If the regulations are not approved of by both Houses, and are objected to by the representatives of the people in either House, they should be disallowed. Under the proposal of the Minister, if either House passed a resolution objecting to a regulation, while the other did not, the regulation would still have force. I hope that he will not press the amendment. have all along objected to legislation by regulation; but the amendment gives the Minister still further power in this direction. He could not obtain force for any provision in the Billi f it had the approval of one House only. Why, then, should regulations have force before both Houses have approved of them? We should protect the rigRfs of the people by refusing to give the Minister the power he asks for. The Act which deals with the disallowing of regulations should not be interfered with in the manner proposed. now before us is of the most amazing character. The Minister apparently aims at defeating the whole of the efforts that have been made by honourable members to modify the provisions of the Bill, because he contemplates taking power to bring into force by Executive act regulations which cannot be disallowed except-by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. So far as I am aware/ there is no precedent for any such proposal. It is unfortunate that we are not able to fully debate this matter. able member has debated it long enough. of a large number of persons who will be very seriously affected by the provisions of the Bill, and I object to the Minister dictating to me as to what I shall do. If the Minister's proposal is to be persisted in, I shall be compelled to bring under the notice of honourable members a series of statements with which I have been supplied, bearing upon the detrimental results that may be brought about by the application of undesirable regulations. Take, for instance, the case of tea -The most complex questions might arise in connection with the introduction of that article of commerce into the Commonwealth. The Minister's proposal is so amazing that I can scarcely realize that he is serious in bringing it forward. Honourable members are aware that some time ago I indicated that I intended to move that the following words be added to clause 14:Provided that such regulations shall not come into operation until the same shall have been confirmed by resolution of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Possibly the Minister is not aware of the great difficulties aware of the attempts which are being made to destroy the Bill. fied in making a statement of that kind. So far as I am aware, the desire of honourable members upon this side of the Chamber has been to make the Bill a workable measure. I think the Minister might reasonably consent to report progress. because it was agreed last night that we should finish the Bill to-day. that we should consent to pass any new clause which the Minister might submit. test against the proposal of the Minister, which appears to me to be unwarranted by anv reasonable requirement. There is nothing unreasonable in the request that progress; should be reported. It is true that an arrangement was made last night that we should, if possible; complete the consideration of this measure today, but the Minister has sprung a number of surprises upon us, and the position has thus been entirely changed. The Minister's I think the honorproposal is altogether a new one. In the Excise Act, and other Acts, provision is made that the regulations brought into operation under them shall cease to have effect if one of the Houses of Parliament passes a resolution disallowing them. Under the Minister's proposal, the disagreement of one House with certain regulations would not have the slightest effect.

MrM c LEAN (Gippsland) I do not wish to place any obstruction in the way of the B ill , because I believe that the Minister desires to do what is f a i r ; but I consider that the proposal now before us has not been properly considered. It aims a blow at the fundamental principle of representative government. Under his proposal, the Minister might submit a regulation, and this House might unanimously condemn it , and yet, if the Senate failed to endorse that! condemnation, the regulation would continue in force. that such a condition of affairs would be in accord with the principles of responsible government? The proposal appears to me to be so monstrously absurd that I cannot conceive of its having been seriously put forward. I should like to know whether the Minister has consulted the Prime Minister, or any of his colleagues. Sir General drafted the clause. of the Cabinet, that they can legislate by regulation against the express wish of either Chamber? I have never before heard of anything of the kind. I trust that the Minister will not press his proposal. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I am surprised to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland; he has turned matters topsy-turvy. Every law has fo be passed by the two Houses of Parliament, aud has also to be repealed by both Houses. No law can be repealed by one House. WhatI desired to do was to prevent the repeal of a law by one House of Parliament. would not have been previously submitted to proceed with the proposal. Do not let to either House of Parliament.

I trust that the honourable I shall certainly be compelled to strictly enforce the Standing Orders in the event of anv further interruptions. Sir WILLI AM LYNE If the Bill be passed, it will confer power to make regulations, and the moment such regulations are passed they would have the effect of law until such time as they were disallowed by a resolution of one House of Parliament. That is provided for in the Acts Interpretation Act ; but it occurred to my mind that regulations made under a measure of this kind and brought into force should remain operative until such time as they were disallowed by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. never approved of the regulations? orable member for Gippsland declared that I had had nothing to do with the drafting of the B ill , he stated what was not correct. ; did not know the object for which the Can it be contended Bill was framed, because I have read his speech in moving its second reading. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not know what was in the honourable member's mind, but I did know the contents of the Bill which he left in his office. The measure did not represent what he declares was in his mind at that time. Seeing, however, that the general feeling, of the Committee pretation Act, I shall not press the amendment any further. the Minister has been worried a great deal to-day, but I would point out to him that we are bound to take up a strong attitude upon a matter of this kind. He claims that a regulation should not be annulled, even by a vote of this House. In that case the only result which could follow the adoption of a motion in opposition to the act of any Government would be the resignation of that Government. The Minister apparently thinks that it would be unjust to him if a majority of the House declared that any regulation did not accord with its wish.

If the new clauses were carried the Bill would be reported, and I should then ask that it be recommitted, in order that the"" amendments necessary in other clauses might be made. like to know whether the Minister would be prepared to agree to the recommittal of only those clauses which he himself thought ought to be recommitted, or whether he would consent to the recommittal of any others in respect of which such a request might be preferred? So far as I am able to see, we shall lose nothing by consenting to the proposal of the Minister. If necessary, we shall be able to secure the recommittal of other clauses. mav not be strong enough. strong enough to secure their recommittal we are not strong enough to do anything at the present time.

By consenting to the course proposed by the Minister, honourable members may deprive themiselves of a right which they should be careful tb conserve. A new clause having an important bearing on other provisions in the Bill may be agreed to, but if the Minister's proposal is adopted, he will be able to say, "" We will not allow a recommittal of those provisions."" member think that I would do such a thing ? the honourable member to take up that position.

We have been endeavouring in Victoria for many years to build up a permanent naval force. I do not favour the proposal to create an Australian Navy at the present time, for, the reason that it would involve greater expenditure than we can afford; but I hold that we should endeavour to assist the Imperial Navy by means, not of a subsidy, but of permanent local forces. It appears that the policy pursued for many years by the Victorian Government, in. regard to the Naval Forces* is to be changed, and the first intimation we have had of this is the statement that the Cerberus\ is not to be reintention that there shall be an enumeration armed. When the Naval Agreement Bill was before the House, Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister, said that the Cerberus and its officers and men would be retained; but when I asked the Prime Minister a few moments ago whether a new vessel was to be obtained, he stated that proposals would be submitted in due time.
