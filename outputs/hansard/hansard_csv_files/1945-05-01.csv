In view of the lengthy session that confronts us, I request honourable members to refrain from asking for extensions of time. From this I except the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), or their deputies on any occasion. The Government will be grateful if honourable members will endeavour to expedite the .business of the House. Later: Minister say whether the refusal to grant extensions of time will apply to the banking legislation before the House and the measure for the rehabilitation of service men and women? The honourable gentleman will realize able member may not debate the question. honourable member's question is "" Yes "". I request honourable members to confine their remarks to the time allowed under the Standing Orders and not to ask for extensions of time, and I hope that that request will be acceded to, except in the case of speeches by leaders of parties, or others acting for them. I was able to confine my second-reading speeches on the banking bills to 50 or 55 minutes. S>ir EARLE PAGE -In view of the fact that the two measures relating to banking are being taken together, and cover a wide range of subjects, would it not be possible to allow some elasticity in regard to the length of speeches on them? Mr Speaker, that, in order to avoid the necessity for honourable members to prepare two speeches on related bills, particularly as the cold winds are starting to blow in Canberra, honourable members might be permitted to make reference to both bills in the one speech. With that suggestion Mr Speaker agreed. that both bills are being debated together. stood was that both bills would be discussed separately, but that an honourable member could refer to something in the other bill not then being debated and would not be called to order. WAR IN EUROPE. Prime Minister state whether or not the Government has made a decision in regard to arrangements for marking the conclusion of the war in Europe? considering the matter in the light of information which it received to-day from the British Government in reference to the form of observance which that Government considers should mark V-E Day in Britain. An announcement will be made shortly. POST-WAR WORKS. time past, the Commonwealth Government has made references to a policy of post-war works by local authorities. The Oo-ordinator of Public Works in Queensland has requested all local governing bodies in that State to supply to him a list of post-war works which they propose to undertake. As the Queensland Treasury has adopted a scheme for the payment of a subsidy on approved works by local authorities, up to a maximum of 17$ per cent, on the amount of the loan raised for the purpose, will the Acting Prime Minister state what additional amount of subsidy, if any, the Commonwealth proposes to advance? knows, the National Works Council adopted recommendations by the Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of Works in relation to the works that might be undertaken in the immediate post-war period. Generally sxieaking, all such works were to be financed from their own resources by either the State Government or semi governmental bodies.

FILM THE BELLS OF that a film with the title The Bells of Remembrance is to be issued to all city picture theatres :by the Department of Information, for exhibition immediately an official announcement has been made of the .cessation of hostilities in Europe. As large numbers of people patronize suburban picture theatres, the proprietors of which have responded generously to requests by the department for screen space during the war, will the Minister for Information make the necessary arrangements to have this film exhibited in suburban theatres simultaneously with its exhibition in city theatres? representations on the subject by honourable members, I have given, further consideration to the possibility of suburban and country theatres ibeing supplied with copies of this film. Unfortunately, the additional expense that would have to be incurred is not the only obstacle. A greater difficulty is presented by the existing short supply of film in Australia. The department would need to make 1,486 additional prints, and the length of film used would be approximately 400,000 feet. We have on hand only about 240,000 feet for the use of thc services and for other important governmental purposes. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to make prints available to .suburban and country theatres. film mentioned by the Minister contemplate a showing on the one day or for a period of a week? exhibition of the film simultaneously for two or three days in every theatre. Of course, it would be possible to exhibit the film in city theatres for two or three days, and then transfer it to suburban theatres. The suburban theatre proprietors desire a simultaneous exhibition. For the two reasons that I have given, it is not practicable to accede to their request. Telegraph published to-day the statement, "" Calwell is new Film Board Chief"". Will the Minister for Information say whether or not that is correct? 'Can he announce the names of tbe persons who are to be appointed to tbe Australian National Films Board? Will any person possessing a practical knowledge of film production be appointed to the board? What expert advice, apart from his own and that of Commonwealth and State Government officials, has been, sought? Have certain Communists shown a lively interest in the constitution of the board, as an instrument for the dissemination of party political propaganda? Is it intended that there shall be Communist representation on the board? message from the Sydney Daily Telegraph to which the honourable member has referred, and. which announced-to use its own verbiage-that I was to be the "" Film Board Chief"". A ministerial announcement was made yesterday with regard to the decision of the Full Cabinet to set up a National Films Board, and a little later I sliall make a fiull statement regarding the personnel of the board, the interests to be represented and other relevant facts. As to the possible use of this instrumentality for the dissemination of Communist views, all I have to say is that that particular fear is but a figment of the honourable gentleman's very disordered imagination. Labour and National Service inform the House whether any action has been taken to increase the number of nurses available to hospitals in .South Australia? was raised last week, steps have been taken in that direction, and I regret to say that I have 'had to resort to direction orders.

The greatest difficulty is experienced in inducing women of any age to go into hospitals or kindred institutions, becara.se ment. As far as I am aware, nothing of the low rates of pay offered and the poor living conditions. My department, however, can do nothing about it, for it is purely a State matter. NEWS SERVICES. Prime Minister inform the House whether the Government has failed in its attempts to induce B class wireless stations to bind themselves to continue relaying the Australian Broadcasting Commission news service for a fixed long term period, including the election year of 1946 and later years? Have tliose stations now made arrangements with the newspapers of Australia for the provision of independent news services, which will provide the listening public of Australia with radio news that will be free from government inspiration and control? Were those services inaugurated in New South Wales on the 1st May? Did the Government, through the Postmaster General's department, inform broadcasting stations on the 30th April, that land lines would not be available for the transmission of those news services to B class stations in country areas? Will tbe Government direct the Postmaster General and his officers that such land line facilities are to be provided without delay, so that all country listeners may have the privilege which will now be enjoyed by residents of metropolitan areas, namely, that of hearing news services which will be objective and free from party political taint? fairly long one, I had better arrange for a reply in detail to be furnished to the right honourable gentleman. .The provision of the facilities referred t'o, would depend largely, I should think, on whether it would be physically possible to make tbem available. If a demand has been made on the department for some additional service, the facilities for which are not available, I should say that it would -be physically impossible to provide it. As to the other matter, an agreement which I think, speaking from memory, was made in 1942, terminated yesterday. I am not sure that it was not a gentleman's agreehas been done which is contrary to the law with regard to broadcasting. However, a full reply to the right honourable gentleman's inquiries will be furnished by the Postmaster-General. representing the Acting Minister for the Army read the press reports to the effect that discontent r.ver lack of canteens and hostels led l w i l d scenes, in which hundreds of Australian servicemen, with a sprinkling of servicemen from Great Britain participated, in Brisbane city streets last night? If so, will the Minister explain the Government's failure to provide adequate canteens and hostels, and will he take immediate steps to remedy the position by giving the necessary facilities, and so prevent a repetition of such scenes? reports to which the honourable gentleman has referred. Generally speaking, canteen and hostel facilities sufficient for all of the services have been provided. I shall refer the matter to the Acting Minister for the Amuy and obtain a reply from him. WAR CORRESPONDENTS. the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) asked me a question concerning war correspondents' despatches. I am informed by the Minister for the Army that every facility is given to war correspondents in operational areas to secure in the front line such information as they require. Every effort is made for their despatches to reach their newspapers in the quickest possible time-in fMs respect, communications within the Army are made available, and immedir.tcly the despatches reach the mainPostmaster-General's land they are transmitted by civil telegraph.

36,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister for-by leave-On the 7th March, 1945, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) referred to an invention by VX146267 Craftsman L. V. Malee and complained of the manner in which the invention had been dealt with by the Army Inventions Directorate and the Army authorities. The Acting Minister for the Army desires me to state that there is complete liaison between the Army Inventions Directorate and the Minister for the Army and he is satisfied that the Army Inventions Directorate takes extreme pains to ensure that all inventions received by it are given complete consideration; wherever there is any possibility that an invention may lie based on sound principles, or will meet a definite service requirement, every mit more complete details of his proposal. effort is made to assist the inventor in the development of his idea. AVbile the Army authorities are represented on the board of this directorate, the majority of its members are drawn from the ranks of professional and experienced men in civil life, and the Acting Minister is fully satisfied that the services they are performing are worthy of every commendation. Among the large number of inventions that are considered by the directorate, it is inhad put forward projects which had the evitable that cases will arise where enthusiastic inventors will insist that their inventions have possibilities far in Directorate was asked to obtain a workexcess of those which are admitted to be sound and feasible by the experienced, technical and professional advisers on the directorate. The case of Craftsman Malee would appear to come within this category. Tbe honourable member, in his lengthy statement on this case, alleged that General Steele, the Engineer-in-Chief, was so impressed by the working model of this invention that he approved a grant of £300 to enable Malee to develop and perfect bis idea. This is not the first time that this statement has been put forward in regard to Malee's invention, as the file shows that representaunit. tions were made to this effect to the Minister on the 13th March, 1943, but General Steele denied its accuracy at the time and again has stated most emphatically that at no stage was the invention regarded by him as an Army requirement, nor did he recommend spending £300 on it. This statement from General Steele in itself largely discounts the representations put forward by the honourable member for Wentworth, but in order that the position may be fully explained, I submit the following further observations:The basic idea of remotely controlling demolition charges by means other than electric leads was not new, and Malee's submission to the authorities was made in such a form as to indicate that he was merely following known ground in his attempt to obtain the result. However, reports were received that he was successfully operating apparatus at the Royal Australian Engineers Training Station, Wagga, where he was stationed and he was accordingly requested to subMalee's invention, together with one received from New Zealand, was referred to the Army New Munitions Committee on the 3rd December, 1942, but neither was considered sufficiently important to warrant its classification in a high priority group. However, as it was the policy both of the Army New Munitions 'Committee and of the Army Inventions Directors te not to discourage persons who elements of novelty combined with practical application, the Army Inventions ing model of the device from the New Zealand Inventions Board, ancl Malee was brought to Melbourne to discuss his proposal with officers of the "" user"" and "" supply "" branches of the Army. Malee was returned to his unit in March, 1943, wben it was decided that consideration of his proposal should be held over pending trials of the New Zealand device for the reason that, although Malee's proposal was recognized as being theoretically sound, the New Zealand one was thought to be based on better principles and to have greater possibility of translation into a practical In May, 1943, the matter of Malee's transfer to a technical unit was first raised officially. In June he was transferred from Royal Australian Engineers Training Centre to tbe Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Training Centre, and was from there sent to a basiitraining course for radio mechanics in Brisbane. He qualified from this course in November, 1943, and was then sent to attend an electrical and course. On completion of this latter course Craftsman Malee. was posted to 16th Radio Maintenance Section, and, on the re-organization of that unit, he was posted to 8th Australian Advanced Workshop, Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, on the 1st August, 1944. A request was received in August, 1944, for Craftsman Malee to be attached to Design Division, Land Head-quarters, to enable him to build a working model of his invention. This request was complied with on the 27th August, 1944. In the meantime, the experimental model of the New Zealand apparatus had arrived in Australia in August, 1943, but on a preliminary test, it was found not to perform satisfactorily. Army Inventions Directorate, with the assistance of the Postmaster-General's Department Research Laboratory, and later the Experimental Establishment of Design Division, adjusted and modified the New Zealand apparatus to bring it to a stage at which it could he subjected to field trials. This Malee recently went absent without leave work took some considerable time as do many scientific developments, especially those which are not sufficiently important to warrant a high priority classification. When the trials had been completed, it was found that, for the New Zealand apparatus to be satisfactory for service use, it would, have to be still further radically miodified. Therefore, it was considered desirable to give Craftsman Malee the opportunity to build a model of his proposed apparatus concurrently with the consideration of the New Zealand device. accordingly attached to the Design Division Experimental Establishment in August, 1944, with the object of constructing a model of his proposal. He had modified his original proposal, and proceeded to build the modified type. It became evident that Craftsman Malee was not sufficiently experienced in the complexities of the subject to enable him to construct the apparatus necessary, even with the assistance and advice of the technical officers of the unit. As it. had Mr Dedman. by this time become known that a superior device had been successfully developed overseas it wasi decided that, in view of the availability of the equipment mechanical radio conversion developed overseas, and also the changed conditions of warfare in the South-West Pacific Area, further development of either the New Zealand apparatus or that proposed by Craftsman Malee was no longer desirable. In January, 1945, Craftsman Malee was returned to his unit, which is a Radar Section of the 8th Australian Advanced Workshop, Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, where he was again employed on radar maintenance. As far as can be ascertained, the only non-technical duties which have been performed by thissoldier are in the nature of fatigues allotted to any soldier within a normal unit. Regarding his period of absence without leave, it is advised that the three days concerned were a Saturday, Sunday and Monday. There was never any statement that he desired to purchase material and, on being interrogated in the Orderly Room, he stated that his reason for taking leave was "" to meet someone"". Craftsman for a second time for a period of approximately one month, and was fined £5 on that occasion. The Acting Minister is satisfied, after a complete investigation of the case, and an examination of the Army departmental and Army Inventions Directorate files, that Craftsman Malee was given every consideration by the Army Inventions Directorate, and that he has no cause for complaint.

In committee: Consideration resumed from the 20th A p r i l (vide page 1005). Clause 6(1.) The Board shall consist of the Commonwealth Wool Adviser and six other members representative of Australian Wool growers, who shall be appointed by the Governor General and shall hold office for three years. (2.) Three members shall be appointed on thc nomination of the organization known as the Australian Wool growers' Council. (3.) Three members shall be appointed on the nomination of the organization known as the Australian Wool Producers' Federation. (4.) The Minister may, on the recommendation of the Board, appoint one of the members to be the Chairman of the Board. (5.) On the occurrence of a casual vacancy in the office of any member of tlie Board (other than the Commonwealth Wool Adviser), the Minister may, after consultation with the organization on tlie nomination of which the member whose office has become vacant was appointed, appoint a person to fill the vacancy, and any person so appointed shall, subject to this Act, hold office for the residue of the term of the member in whose place he is appointed. way of amendmentThat, in sub-clause (1.), the word "" s i x "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" ten "". Dame ENI D LYONS (Darwin) [3.46]. I s the Acting Prime able argument had taken place with reference to the constitution of the proposed board. The merits of equal representation for the two bodies concerned, and the alternative of representation on a proportional basis, had been argued with considerable livelinesis. I am not particularly concerned w it h that aspect of the matter. However, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) has moved an amendment to provide for five representatives from each of. these bodies, on the ground that this would allow representation to be given to growers in each of the five principal wool-producing States. It w ill be obvious to honourable members that once the question of representation on a State basis comes into the picture, no State which can in any way be concerned in the matter should be ignored. Justi n case honourable members are not aware that sheep and wool are produced in Tasmania, I point out that the Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics reveals that at tiie end of December, 1944, there were 2,187,799 sheep in Tasmania, and that wool production in that State for the year 1942-43 totalled 17,256,000 lb. Obviously, that is a very small quantity in comparison with the production of certain other States. £1,000,000. Dame ENIDLYONS It is worth a large sum of money.

62,Mr Barnard,"Its value is aboutthe Commonwealth. Over and over again, because Tasmania is small geographically, and consequently its production must ibe small, the State is ignored in matters of this kind. The result is that, unfortunately, a feeling has grown up in the State that it is ignored on occasions when it should not be overlooked. Although the production in Tasmania of certain comimodities if small, the quality is very high, and repeatedly, top prices have been obtained for Tasmanian wool, apples and potatoes. I strongly urge the honourable member for New England to accept the suggestion that six members of tiie board shall be nominated by the Australian Wool growers Council and six members by the Australian Wool Producers Eederation. If my suggestion be adopted, the position should examine the advisability of of Tasmania in the wool producing business, and, beyond all else, as a partner in this Commonwealth, will receive proper recognition. speech of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) recalled to my mind the adage, ""Beware the Greeks when they bring gifts "". At considerable length and with great emphasis, the honourable member urged that the clause should be amended for the purpose of increasing the membership of the Australian Wool Board. He suggested that five members should be appointed by the Australian Wool growers Council and five by the Australian Wool Producers Federation. If honourable members will peruse his speech carefully, they will disunveiling of a memorial to her in the cover that originally he complained that one of those organizations, being numerically stronger than the other, should have greater representation. Now, the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has pointed out that the representatives on the board will be selected from the principal wool-growing States, to the exclusion of Tasmania. In this particular instance I agree with her observations. If representation on the Australian Wool Board is to be on a State basis, the only way in which to achieve it is to appoint representatives from the six 'States. To contend that some States, being larger wool producers than others, should have greater representation is to overlook an important consideration. Tasmania is a con' sidcrable producer of excellent wool. For a long period, that State has obtained the top price on the market. Therefore, if we contemplate increasing the number of representatives on the board, we should provide for the representation of each State. My own opinion is that a board of ten members would be unnecessarily large, but if we agree to a body of that size, we should be prepared to go the additional distance and appoint a board of twelve members, on a State basis. The production of wool figures prominently in this legislation, because we are discussing proposals for advertising it. When considering the suggestion to increase the membership of the board, we appointing a woman as a member. for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) already has sufficient duties fully to occupy her time. that the honourable member for Darwin should be appointed to the Board. WhilstI have great respect and admiration for her, I consider that there are other women who can fill that position more capably than she can. More than a hundred years ago, the wool industry in Tasmania was founded by a woman. In 1826, 100 merino sheep were brought from Saxony by Mrs. John Ferling and her two sons. I had the pleasure of being a. member of a party which attended the Midlands of Tasmania. The argument which has been adduced by the honourable member for New England and his supporters for an increased membership of the board is not wellfounded. The appointment of three members each by the Australian Wool growers Council and the Australian Wool Producers Federation will suffice. The smaller board will function more satisfactorily than a larger body, and the two organizations should have equal representation on it.

66,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"so ably, tliat tke clause sbould be amended to provide for the appointment of six members of the Australian Wool Board by the' Australian Wool growers Council and six by the Australian Wool Producers Federation. I do so for the same reason as that which the honourable member advanced, namely, that wool production is the greatest of Australian industries. As the wool industry £70,000,000 per annum to the economic well-being of Australia, its management should be such as to ensure the broadest national outlook ou all its problems. We should do everything possible to provide for effective administration of the industry. There has been both misconception and misrepresentation of the attitude of the Australian Country party to this clause. According to the Prime Minister's statement last November, the original decision was that the Australian Wool Board should consist of four representatives of the Australian Wool growers Council and two of the Australian Wool Producers Federation. I am advised that that is in accordance with letters written by Mr England( Mr Abbott) and the Minister Cowdery and Mr Hitchins, tlie presidents of the respective organizations. The view put so clearly and forcefully by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) that the two organizations should have equal representation and that representation should not be based upon sheep ownership or membership of the organizations is reasonable. The Country party considers that such representation would also give more adequate representation to the various States. The honourable member for Darwin has now foreshadowed a further amendment to provide that there shall be not only equal representation of the two organizations concerned but also representation of each 'State. As the bill stands, it will be possible for all the representatives to provisions of clause 14. The important be nominated from Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and for the important wool-producing States of Western Australia,, South Australia and Tasmaniato have no representation. commend the suggestion of the honourable member for Darwin to the favorable consideration of the committee. It is desirable in my opinion that the two organizations .mentioned should have equal representation and that each State should also have representation on the hoard. the proposal that has been made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). The numerical strength of the board should be increased is worth approximately to ensure that each State shall be represented upon it. It is becoming a habit of the Parliament to ignore Tasmania, and I protest strongly against it. This important board certainly should have on it a representative of each State. As the honourable member for Darwin has said, Tasmania produces some of tbe finest merino wool in tlie world. The quantity may not be great but the quality is superb. Tasmanian merino wool always fetches the top price in the market. As the purpose of this ibill is to promote the use of wool, and as Tasmania produces substantial quantities of first-class wool, it is only proper that that State should be represented on this board. I hope that both the honourable member for New in charge of the measure will accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Darwin. Government agrees to any alteration of the numerical strength of this 'board I . hope that it will adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Darwin, but I have not yet heard any argument which justifies an increase of the number of board members. My experience of boards in this country, which extends over many years, is that, generally, the larger they are the less effective they are. The value of this measure will depend not upon the size of this board but upon the effectiveness of tlie Wool Consultative Council that is to be constituted under the duties of the council are set out in paragraphs a to g of sub-clause 2. I regard the constitution of that council as by far the most important justificaI tion for this legislation. What we need is a thoroughly scientific investigation into ways and means of increasing the use and the quality of our wool.",25,Claims Foe Subsidies Whe N Progress Was Reported Consider

68,Dr. Gaha (Denison) [4.6],"If themember consider that the .proposed wool board is unnecessary? lishment of an effective wool consultative council in the terms of clause 14 is far more important. of the Australian Country party. proposed Wool Board as a competent body to advise the Minister on the most important aspects of the development of the wool industry. Such competency would, however, reside in a thoroughly representative wool consultative council which would have power to co-opt necessary scientific assistance. If the memberBoard will have very important funcship of the Wool Board is to be increased beyond six I consider that there should be twelve members, which would give equal representation to the two wool producing organizations which have been mentioned and also to each State of the Commonwealth; but I do not regard tbe board as being of very great importance. The proposed consultative council will be, in my opinion, the more important body. [4.10] -My conclusions in relation to this matter are similar to those of the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha). The producers naturally have the greatest interest in the development of an organization for improving the production and increasing the use of wool. Unfortunately, the principal duty under the bill is to be assigned to the Wool Consultative Council. in the slightest degree opposed to the amendment of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). I point out, however, that the duties of the board will be confined to promotion of the use of wool, and that it can have no value in connection with the other problems by which the industry is beset. Only one member of the board will be appointed to the Wool Consultative Council. Therefore, that valuable instrument would not be strengthened by an increase of the number of members of the board. Cf what use will it be in assisting the Government when, according to the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Forde) in his first important pronouncement honourable abroad, the Government is about to establish a large factory for the production of synthetic fibres in this country? I am more concerned about tlie representation which tbe wool growers will have on the Wool Consultative Council than I am about the number of members of the Australian Wool Board. honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) has expressed the view that the Wool Consultative Council will be the principal body, and that the Australian Wool Board will be of only minor importance. I point out to him and the committee that the Australian Wool tions indeed. Under clause 13, it is to be empowered to make arrangements with persons, authorities, and organizations in Australia and other countries for joint measures of publicity or other means for promoting the use of wool. The words "" other means "" imply a very wide area of activity. They might mean entering into certain exchanges of wool with other goods, or sending wool free to China. On the other hand, the Wool Consultative Council will be only a minor body under the present terms of the bill. It will be only consultative, and will be called together only when the Minister so desires. It might never be summoned; to meet; therefore, its functions might be reduced to zero. I should not mind very much if the Australian Wool Board consisted of the membership I am not proposed by the bill or that proposed under the amendment of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). But I concede the point made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), that tbe number of members sbould be increased to six representatives of the Australian Wool growers Council, and six representatives of the Australian Wool Producers Federation. However, merely adding one member to the present proposed membership of the board would not necessarily result in each State having representation. Under the original proposal as well as under the proposal of the honourable member for New England it would be possible for that to occur, but in order to make it",26,Claims Foe Subsidies Whe N Progress Was Reported Consider

Commerce and Agriculture) [4.18] Unfortunately, owing to indisposition, I was unable to take part in the earlier discussion of the bill. Some honourable members opposite treat this clause as if it were one of the most contentious of the bill; but I understand that it is not viewed with disfavour by representatives of the wool industry. Some honourable members consider that tlie proposed representation on the Australian Wool Board should be widened. I do net agree with them. I was responsible for all the negotiations with the industry which led to the introduction of the bill. I had consultations witb members of the Australian Wool Board, and with representative,? of both the Australian Wool growers Council and the Australian Wool Producers Federation. Early in the negotiations, I received a letter-whie h I believe has been discussed at length-signe d by Mr may desire, and the board will be Cowdery and Mr Hitchins, the presidents of the two growers' organizations, agreeing that the representation on the Australian Wool Board should be four members for the Australian Wool growers Council, and two memhers for the Australian Wool Producers Federation. Almost immediately after the agreement had been made, and the letter had been delivered to me, Mr Hitchins called on me in Canberra, and asked that it be repudiated. I suggested that be sliould ask the Australian Wool growers Council, as a. party to the agreement, to discuss the matter with him, with a view to seeing whether or not it would be agreeable to the representation of tbe two bodies being equal, as be and his organization throughout Australia desired. ThenT received a further letter from Mr Committee, bas extensive knowledge of Hitchine stating that be could not come to an agreement with the Australian Wool growers Council, and that it had decided to adhere to the original agreement between the two organizations. He said that he would like a repudiation of that agreement, and his organization asked the Government for equal representation of the two bodies. Subsequently, it was decided to give to tbem equal representation, as far as it could be arrived at on the basis of available statistical information. I regret that an agreement has been departed from, but in my opinion it would not be advisable in any circumstances to increase the personnel of the board. Six representatives, with equal representation of the two organizations, is a workaible number. The board will be fully representative of the wool industry of Australia, and, from what I know of the men who I expect will be nominated, no major disagreement should occur among them. Their one desire will be to promote the welfare of the industry and the use of wool throughout the world. Dissatisfaction has' been expressed regarding the personnel of the board, but, after all, its decisions will represent the views of the industry throughout the Commonwealth. The Wool Consultative Council will be an important body, but. it will have no executive authority. Its express purpose will be to furnish special advice that the Wool Board the only medium through which that advice can be given effect. I regret that I was unable to take part in the earlier discussion on this clause. I have talked over the matter with the honourable member for New England, and I think that there is no major difference of opinion between us. I have had long discussions with Mr Boyd, who is one of the outstanding men in the wool industry, and I have always hoped that he will be long associated with tbe board. The board has clone good work for the industry in the past, and I do not believe that any man in Australia is more competent than Mr Boyd to assist the industry in future. Mr Hitchins, who ha? been appointed to the Central Wool the industry, and with men like Messrs. Boyd and Hitchins associated with the board, the safety of the industry is assured.

I do not suggest, Mr Chairman, that your ruling is wrong, but 1 contend that you should reconsider it. the question in the way provided by the forms of this House, and. the committee has decided to retain the word ""six"".

I -believe that it should have on it the best men available, whether they come from Bourke, Forbes or Donnybrook. It should represent mainly those who contribute most of the money, and wbo have the interests of the wool industry really at heart. It cannot be denied that the Wool growers Council is t.he body which really represents the wool industry of Australia. Its members are concerned almost exclusively with the production of wool and meat, and they include practically all the notable stud-breeders in Australia. These are the men who, over the years, have put Australian wool on the map. They are naturally more keen to see the industry go ahead than is the man who runs only a few sheep. The members of more concerned with growing wheat than with producing wool. In Victoria, most of its members are located in the north-western corner of the State. Their activities are directed chiefly to the growing of wheat, and they run a few sheep as scavengers. On the basis of the amount of money to be contributed under this legislation, the case for increased representation for thc Wool growers",28,Claims Foe Subsidies Whe N Progress Was Reported Consider

82,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [4.31].,"Council ia very strong. In Victoria, the Graziers Association is affiliated with the Australian Wool growers Council. Members of the association pay a membership fee of approximately 2s. for each 100 sheep. Thus, it is easy to ascertain the number of sheep which members of the association own. I believe that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was approximately correct when he said that the members of the Wool growers Council throughout Australia own 60,000,000 faheep, which is atbout half the total for the Commonwealth. The Minister said that memlbers of the Wool Producers Federation owned 39,000,000 sheep, but he admitted that there was no way of getting accurate information on the subject. Apparently, he made a wild stab at a figure, and decided upon 39,000,000. In my opinion, that figure is ridiculously high. If it be correct, then only about 20,000,000 sheep a.re owned by persons who belong to neither the Wool growers Council nor the Wool Producers Federation. That, also, is ridiculous, because we know that there are thousands of sheepowners in Australia who belong to neither body. I should be surprised if members of the Wool Producers Federation own more than 20,000,000 sheep between them. However, for purposes of comparison, let us accept the Minister's figure of 39,000,000, and even on this figure-which, as I have said, is manifestly incorrect-the case of the WoolgrowersCouncil for increased representation on the board remains unanswerable. The Minister will agree with me that a fair way to estimate the production of wool is to reckon on three bales .from 100 sheep. On that basis, members of the Wool growers Council will contribute under this legislation £180,000, as against £117,000 by members of the Wool Producers Federation, a difference of £63,000. There is justice in the claim that the Australian Wool growers Council should have four representatives and the Australian Wool Producers Federation two representatives on the board. During the discussion on this bill last week it was pointed out that that basis of representation had been agreed to by the presidents of tliose two organizations. Speaking presumably with a knowledge of the Government's legislative intentions, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) on the 1st November, 1944, said that representationwould be on the basis for which I now ask, and subsequently the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) informed members of the Australian Wool growers Council that Cabinet had agreed to that basis. I , therefore, ask the Government to honour its promise. If it will not accept the amendment, the only explanation appears to be that to which the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) referred on Friday last, when he said that politics had entered into these proposals. The honourable gentleman said that a section of the Australian Wool growers Council had previously been associated with the Australian Country party, and the implication was that the basis of representation had been altered by the Government for political purposes. In Victoria, and I believe in other States also, the Australian Wool growers Council has no political affiliations. I repeat that wool growers who are members of the Australian Wool growers Council Avill puit into the fund more money than will those who belong to the federation, and that, in the main, the council represents the people who in the past have done so much to improve stud flocks. I trust that in a matter of such importance to Australia the interests of a great industry will not be subordinated to party political considerations. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [4.44] -The Government cannot accept thc amendment proposed by the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson). The case for and against any alteration of the proposed basis of representation on the Australian Wool Board was discussed at length at the second-reading stage, and I do not propose to weary the committee by traversing the arguments then advanced. The Government is convinced that the representation proposed in this bill is equitable when all the circumstances are taken into account.

83,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister forI moveTliat, in sub-clause (4.), the word ""may"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""shall"". Probably tlie intention of tbe sub-clause is the same as I have in mind, because I cannot conceive that any government would be unwilling to appoint as chairman of the board one of its members whom the board recommended for that position. The amendment is practically only a machinery provision. Should the clause remain as printed, a future Minister, who may not favour the nominee of the board, could hold up the appointment of chairman, and so interfere with the board's functions.

In its present, form, the sub-clause cuts across the principle of producer control, which, presumably, the Government has in mind, seeing that certain organizations are to have direct representation on the board. If the amendment be not accepted, the time of the committee will be wasted in debating the rest of the bill. hope that the Minister, after reflection, will decide to adhere to the form in which sub-clause 4 is drafted. I express that hope because of the fact that the clause employs the time-honoured form of words. In parliamentary government, in the highest exercise of the democratic form of government, it is not the practice to direct a Minister of the Crown as we are now asked to do by substituting "" shall"" for "" may"". I have no doubt that the draftsman of the bill was alive to the historic propriety of using the form of words which he has used, and I hope that the Minister will adhere to sub-clause 4 as it appears in the bill. The Minister may do what the majority in the Parliament directs in any particular set of circumstances, but it is not usual or proper to say that the Minister"" shall"". Other reasons on lower grounds could probably be advanced why the form of words appearing in the sub-clause should There may be be retained; for example, the financial responsibility of the Government. That responsibility will be found to be inherent in the bill. The expert draftsman who drew tbe bill is well aware that it is not usual to direct a Minister of the Crown, and say that he shall do something, whereas in fact his duty is to carry out the will of the Parliament as a whole in his capacity as adviser to the Crown. [ 4.49] -The amendment proposed by the honorable member for New England( Mr Abbott) is perfectly consistent with the two preceding sub-clauses; and the Government having drafted those two sub-clauses, I am a little puzzled as. to why it boggles at the amendment. If the GoHowever, I object to tbe basis on which the clause as a whole is drafted. From 20 to 25 per cent, of the people who will be compelled to contribute under this measure will not be represented by either of the two bodies who are to be given the monopoly of nominating the members of tbe proposed board. In fact, they will appoint the members of the board, because the clause prescribes that the members shall be appointed by the Governor General on the nomination of tbe Australian Wool growers Council and",30,Claims Foe Subsidies Whe N Progress Was Reported Consider

Sbould the Minister ibe not satisfied, he has no authority to appoint as chairman any member not recommended by the board. That is a hopelessly invidious position in which to place any Government. Therefore, the Minister would be well advised to have a really good look at this clause before the bill is dealt with by the Senate. I had hoped that the Government would have taken a good look at it over the week-end, and would have consulted the Solicitor-General on the matter.

This chamber is the Commons of Australia, and here these subjects sbould be discussed and decided.

If thc Minister did not accept the original nominations the board could not be constituted. If an organization is required to make a nomination to fill a casual vacancy and it refrains from doing so, a difficult situation can arise. In my opinion, the Minister should have power to appoint a person to a casual vacancy in the terms of sub-clause 5. If the board did not consist of the full number of members for .a. period that fact would not render it inoperative.

His insistence of the right of the Minister to make appointments to fill casual vacancies in the event of the death -or resignation of members was extraordinary. I am not fearful of what the present Minister may do, but, as the honourable member for Forrest has pointed out, ancient history may repeat itself, and a Pharoah may arise who kuew not Joseph. I can see no reason why the Minister should have a power in relation to casual vacancies which he does not possess in connection wibh original appointments. The adoption, in certain circumstances, of the procedure outlined in sub-clause 5 might enable a Minister to appoint to the board persons who would be subservient to Casual vacancies should ministerial direction. The honourable member for Forrest has put his finger on a vital principle. I shall not move an amendment, but I confess that I am shocked that an honourable member opposite who claims to represent primary producers should seek to deny to them rights in connection with casual vacancies which they possess in regard to original appointments. In fancy, I can hear the crowing cocks in the electorate of Calare to-night. What possible justification can there 'be for departing from the principle laid down in subclauses 2 and 3?

[5.49] -Unde r the Wool Publicity and Research Act the board had complete initiative in the field of publicity, but under this provision the proposed board will be practically superfluous. I am so strong an advocate of producer control that on six occasions I have moved the adjournment of the House to -emphasize the necessity for that form of control on an Australia-wide basis. This bill provides for control of the wool industry on an Australia-wide basis, but it does not provide for producer control. ment decided to introduce legislation designed to promote and increase the use of wool, the wool growers of Australia agreed to a levy in order to provide a fund for advertising wool, and the Commonwealth Government agreed to subsidize the amount so raised. Otlier industries, as, for instance, the iron and steel industry, have been granted subsidies without any contribution at. all by those engaged in them. There is no need for the restriction which the clause in its present form imposes, as the Minister will be represented on the board by the Commonwealth Wool Adviser; he will have his own direct representative on the controlling body. Moreover, the money to the credit -of the fund can be expended by the board only in advertising wool and promoting its use; it cannot be used to buy expensive motor cars, or for any other purpose. And we must not forget that half the money will be contributed by the wool-growers themselves. The committee has already agreed to the appointment of an Australian Wool Board on which two organizations will have direct representation. sentatives of those organizations and the Minister's own nominee will be responsible for the expenditure of the money to the credit of the fund, is it necessary to -obtain the permission of the Minister tbefore expending money on advertising? I foresee that, with the clause in its taining men willing to carry on the board's administration. I therefore move That the words "" Subject to any directions of the Minister,"" be left out. The amendment, if agreed to, would leave the board un'trammelled. After the cessation of hostilities Australia may have difficulty in disposing of its huge stocks of wool, and the board should not, be subjected to harassing restrictions. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) suggested that Australia should make-a generous contribution of wool to India and China. In my opinion, Australia should assist the people of devastated European countries by supplying wool to them through When the GovernUnrra. But we have not supplied wool as a portion of our Unrra quotas. That being so the Government should make a grant of wool to China, India and Poland to help them to become wool minded. We could also do something for Great Britain as a gesture of gratitude for what that country has done for us, but, with the clause in its present form, the board would be powerless to do such things. The present board, which the Minister agrees has done good work, has more power than the Government proposes to vest in the new body. The existing board has worked conscientiously and, within the limits of. its power, has been of great advantage to the wool-growers of Australia. Sitting suspended from 5.59 lo 8 p.m. able members opposite have made much of the point that the organized wool growers of Australia should exercise exclusive control over the funds which are to be collected under this legislation. On general grounds there might seem to be something in their contention, but tlie fact is that the two organizations which As the reprethis bill empowers to nominate representatives to the board do not byany means IT present all the wool-growers of Australia. As a matter of fact, I go so far as to say that they do not represent. 50 per cent, of the growers. Therefore, it is only right that the Government^",37,Paiks

During the war, the that it is expended in the interests of all the growers, and not of a section of them only. There are good reasons why many wool-growers are not memhers of the organizations named in the bill. For instance, the New South Wales Graziers Association, which is one of the organizations affiliated with the Australian Wool growers Council, was until quite recently affiliated also with the Australian Country party. Thus, had a wool-grower with Labour sympathies joined that organization, the money which he contributed to it might well be used to bring about the political defeat of his own party. The same thing applies to the Farmers and Settlers Association, which only recently dissociated itself, financially at any rate, from the Australian Country party on the ground that it wished to leave tbe way open for members of the Labour party to join it.

As in the Board is to be given authority to expend past, so in the future, the board will the money raised, and it should be trusted have to work in conjunction with other to do so ih the way best calculated to organizations overseas.

For that reason, I hate °0 per cent, of the wool grown in Austhe provision that the money is to be quantity manufactured in Australia haa risen to nearly 15 per cent, and it may be that we shall be able to continue manufacturing that percentage after the war, but 85 per cent, will still have to be exported. The wool-growers' organizations will naturally elect to the board those persons whom they believe to bebest qualified to carry out effective publicity designed to promote the use of wool. In 1937, when the Australian. Wool Board was first created, a conference was held in Melbourne between representatives of Australia,. South Africa and Now Zealand, and it was decided that, instead of each dominion singing the praises of its own wool, the three of th.em should contribute to a common fund in London to be expended upon advertising wool in general, and upon encouraging its use. I believe that, after the war, markets for wool will open up of which we did not dream a few years ago. The applica-",38,Paiks

AlthoughI have no strong feelings regarding this clause, it appears to me that on all matters of this kind the Minister should have a discretionary power, because in the final analysis, he must accept obtained from a levy made by wool proresponsibility for the administration of this fund. If the administration of the board is a failure, it cannot be dismissed until the expiration of three years. The words ""Subject to any directions of the Minister"" are rather far-reaching, but I assume that tbey mean that the Minister shall have the power to veto a proposal or arrangement that the board may make for publicizing wool. In its present form, the clause is logical and is in harmony with the remainder of the bill. I cannot see anything wrong with it. As the board will be responsible for the £1,000,000 on wool publicity during its three years term of office, tlie Government, through the Minister, should be empowered to say whether the money is being expended wisely or unwisely. For that reason, I consider that the clause should remain in its present form. -The issue, which is very simple, republicity will be less than the total consolves itself with a question of producertribution made by the wool industry, the control of the producers' money, and I board should be permitted, as it has been am satisfied that when the case has been in the past, to control it.

The corresponding p r o v is i o n in t h is b ill readsSubject to auy directions of thc Minister, the board shall have power to make arrangements with persons, authorities and organizations in Australia and in other countries for joint measures of publicity or other means for the promotion of the use of wool. The board bas been in existence for nine years, and no one has questioned the wisdom or quality of its work. Its funds may be described as ""producer-money, ducers on themselves"". This organization was established at their request, and, therefore, these persons have the right to determine how they shall expend this money, especially as they have a record of wise administration. Honourable members should note that the Wool Use Promotion Fund will be financed by the imposition of a tax of 2s. on every bale of wool, and the Commonwealth Government will contribute an equal sum. That money will be controlled entirely by the Wool Consultative Council, consisting of eight persons, only one of whom will represent the wool producers, who expenditure of approximately will contribute one half of the money.

In sumed) : Clause .13. [8.42] I was interested to hear the Minister say that the Government could not accept any amendment. of this nature. never before known of a government to be in the position of this Government, and I am still Avaiting to see whether it will accept any amendment of any kind. member for Calare( Mr Breen) reminded me of the muzzled ox. How the honourable member can reconcile the speech which he delivered before the suspension of the sitting with that which he has just delivered is beyond my comprehension. The principle embodied in this clause is at variance with that contained in a clause we.passed earlier. In one case the Minister had no discretionary power, ibut in this case he can issue directions to the board and practically control the expenditure of the fund that is to be raised. The power of veto of M . Molotov at the San Francisco Conference has nothing on the power of veto that the Minister may exercise under this bill, for one power will expire within a few days, whereas the other may go on On the day following V-E Day indefinitely. No two parts of this bill fit into each other. The .parts of a jig-saw puzzle will make a picture, but the parts of this bill will make nothing but chaos. If the bill is to hang together at all, the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) should be accepted. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to moan about tbe provisions of the bill if they will not help us to amend them. --The more I consider this bill the more convinced I become that it constitutes what is practically a confidence trick on the wool-growers' organizations. The Government approached these organizations with the object of obtaining their concurrence in the establishment of research and publicity organizations, but it is now saying: ""We will establish au Australian Wool Board, but the expenditure of its funds will be committee (Consideration recontrolled by the Minister, and we will establish a Wool Consultative Council on which the growers' organizations will have only one representative "". In relation to publicity, the Government says: "" We are going to take from the growers £325,000 ""-that is the estimated amount"" We are going to allow a board to be established to expend such portion of that money as we allow it to have "". That is governed by clause 17. It then says: "" But whilst it will be able to expend such portion of this money as we allow it to have, that expenditure will be subject to the control The speech of the honourable of the Minister of the day"". Therefore, actually, the sole control of the expenditure of this money of tlie wool-growers, plus the amount to be provided by the Government, is to be exercised entirely by the Minister of the day. The board will not be able to engage in any activity except in regard to publicity. The Minister said: "" The reason for our making the expenditure subject to the directions of the Minister is that a certain number of growers are not members of the different organizations"". Let me deal with that point. According to the figures given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), the Australian Wool Producers Federation represents 39,000,000 sheep and the Australian Wool growers Council represents",43,Celebration Of V E Dat

Therefore, at 2s. a bale the wool-growers represented by the Australian ""Wool growers Council will contribute to the fund £180,000, and those represented by the Australian Wool Producers Federation will contribute £117,000, a total of £297,000, leaving only £28,000 to be contributed by the other wool-growers who ' are not members of any organization. I said in an earlier speech that I regard as grossly inflated the figures in regard to the Australian Wool Producers Federation which the Minister gave to us. I come now to the other point. The same Minister said: "" I intend to control the expenditure of this money, if necessary, because I believe that this board may at some time become extravagant"". of the sort. Minister for Post-war Reconstruction It is not bureaucracy, but the antithesis knows very little about wool, and a future of it. Minister who has control of the matter may know nothing about it. Yet sucb a person is to be the judge as to whether I am in favour of grower control. With a board composed of representatives of the words, "" Subject to any directions of wool-growers is expending its money the Minister "", there will not be effective wisely or unwisely! Does the Minister grower control. The experience in really believe that the growers who are Queensland of orderly marketing under outside these organizations would trust grower control boards-and they are a Minister of the day rather than grower controlled, not subject to direction elected representatives of organizations by the Minister-ha s proved that there is representing ' sheep-breeders and woolno necessity for those words.

It is another instance of a pergrower-controlled marketing boards, and fectly just case being denied recognition there is no record of any wild expenditure by the Minister. The Leader of the Australian Country throw them out if they were guilty of it. party ( Mr Fadden) argued that this clause provides for another bureaucratic time. The point made by the honourable set up. I maintain that it does not. If member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) has full powers in regard to the expenditure been illustrated in Queensland. of this money were delegated to any Queensland Butter Board, nominated appointed board, that would be the acme by the organization and not by the of bureaucracy. On the contrary, if the growers, performs its functions with disbursement of the fund is made subject satisfaction to the growers. That is to the Minister's control, that is, in fact, the only instance in which the responsible government,. I do not think State Government has not given to the that that can be gainsaid. This board growers the right to vote directly for is to bn established for three years. It the appointment of their representatives is not to be elected by the wool-growers, but is to be appointed from the nominees of certain organizations. In all probability, they will be good men. But they may know very little about the matter of publicity, which is a specialized activity, and, therefore, they will have to rely on outside advice. orable member consider that the Minister will know more? that. But in the long run, he must accept responsibility on behalf of the growers and the people of Australia, in the same way as the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) must accept responsibility in regard to the moneys that are collected from the whole of the taxpayers of Australia.

The executives of the wool-growing organizations are elected to their positions in the first instance, and are responsible to the growers of wool. Wliy would they not be concerned with the welfare of the wool industry? If we do not have confidence in representatives appointed by the growers, the matter becomes farcical. I should certainly have more confidence if they had the expenditure of their own money, and so would the growers. After all, they would have the handling of only a part of what is collected from the growers, because undoubtedly the Minister will direct tliat a part of it shall be paid into the fund, together with the full amount provided by the Treasury, and nil of that money will be controlled by the Minister. Surely we can have sufficient confidence in the representatives of the growers deciding wisely! I was astonished when the Minister said that the words ""Subject to any directions of the Minister"" are not words of limitation on the Australian Wool Board. ;irc not words of limitation, but that they are not very drastic limits. tween the two is similar to that between lino's Fruit Salts and castor oil. The Minister told a very old story when he said that these are not words of limitation. Such a story was told by the wolf when he was digesting old Granny in bed. He was dressed in Granny's clothes, and lie said to Little Bed Biding Hood, "" There is no danger "". A Minister is no different from the wolf in Granny's bed. Both are big bad wolves. One will eat up the wool-growers, as Little Bed Biding Hood was eaten. Whether drastic or not, tliese are words of limitation. Thc board will not have the power to make any arrangements with persons, authorities and organizations iri Australia ancl other countries, unless it gets directions from the Minister. All of that work will have to be done subject to tlie directions of the Minister. There is no likelihood of the funds being wasted. The honourable member for Wimonera [45] ( Mr Wilson) has said that the bodies which control the Australian Wool Board are of the unelective type. They arc elected by the organizations whichrepresent the wool-growers, just as the trade unions of Australia represent the working man. The Government has preached for years its faith in prodnicercon-trol. If it wants to be consistent, it must delete from the clause the words to which we object, hand the control to the producers themselves, and not impose the limitation that everything must be directed by the Minister. The honourable member for Wimmera, in speech, brimming with unctuousness, just as is the Ministei' who has interjected. He said that Parliament is responsible for the expenditure of all funds. I remind him that the Parliament is responsible for seeing that all funds shall be expended according to the provisions of the Audit Act. The Australian Wool Board has always discharged its functions in that way. That is the sole concern of the Government. man will agree that we want to get the best value for the money. Decs not the honourable member, as a practical wheat-grower and farmer, consider that he and those whom he represents would be far more likely to obtain gocd value for the expenditure of their hard-earned cash, than would a lot of gentlemen who have derived their knowledge of wool-growing from reading books in the Parliamentary Library, or studying the sheep pastured on the Canberra common? The Minister, in order to be consistent, must accept the amendment. I bope that he will do so. Question putThat the words proposed to he left out part of the clause. Thc committee divided.

157,Mr Johnson (Kalgoorlie) [9.20],"which I am general president, and suggested that I would not agree to the representative of the Australian Workers Union on the Wool Consultative Council being appointed by the Minister. I remind honourable members that the procedure contemplated in the bill is exactly that followed in the appointment of representatives of the Australian Workers Union to other bodies. The union will submit a recommendation to the Government, and the Government will, in all probability, act upon it. in the bill. the Minister will appoint some one to represent the Australian Workers Union, for instance, without having been advised by that organization that the person is acceptable to it, and the same procedure will be followed in regard to the other bodies to be represented on the council. We know that when the general terms of this bill were being settled the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) had many conferences with the representatives of the organizations affected, and also with representatives of the consumers. Most of the opposition to this measure comes from the representatives of vested interests. We have also to contend witli the parochial outlook of some honourable members who maintain that this or that State should be represented. applies to the honorablo member for Bass( Mr Barnard) as well as to those on the opposite side of the House. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) suggested that Western Australia should be represented Wool Board. As a matter of fact, I am just as much concerned with the interests of Queensland in this regard as I am with those of Western Australia. There has been evidence of too much parish pump politics in this debate. I represent a constituency which produces 50 per cent, of the wool grown in Western Australia, and the bill is acceptable to me. I approve of it, and I am prepared to accept responsibility for doing so. [9.27] -This is one of the two vital clauses of the bill, because it provides for by a Minister, and why there should be the appointment of a Wool Consultative Council. The other vital clause is that which provides for the constitution of the Australian Wool Board, and the bill stipulates that the board may function only at the direction of the Minister. Now, in this clause, it is provided that the Minister shall appoint members of the Wool Consultative Council. It is clear that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) is practically of the same opinion as the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), who has moved that the various bodies mentioned in the clause should be given authority to nominate their own representatives to the council. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie claims that the Minister would naturally invite nominations from the bodies concerned. said. that is what we are pressing for, but at present there is no provision for it in the bill. ' The clause provides quite plainly that the members shall be appointed by the Minister. ber knows that recommendations are always sought by the Ministeri n such circumstances and almost, without exception, accepted by him. the honourable member would support an amendment to that effect. This is a period of life or death for the wool growers of Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who is president of the Australian Workers Union, the greatest organization of workers on the Australian in Australia, knows that, in matters affecting the bread and butter interests of the members of that union, the Minister does not select the union's representatives. Yet when the bread and butter interests of an organization of primary producers are concerned he says that the representatives of that body should be chosen by the Minister. No industrial union would stand for such interference in. its affairs.

After discussions lasting several days, the major provisions of the bill were agreed to. Mr Boyd wrote to me about several minor matters and asked me to see Mr Cowdery, tlie president of the Australian Wool growers Council, and Mr Hitchins, of the Australian Wool growers Eederation, and I agreed to do so. After that a bill was prepared, and it later was examined in my office, clause by clause, in the presence of those gentleconcerned. The growers will have only men and experts from the Departments of the Treasury, Commerce and Agriculture, and Post-war Eeconstruction. Some amendments were agreed to. A t the conclusion of the conference, a draft bill similar to that now before the committee was definitely agreed to by representatives of organizations of wool growers, and therefore it is not correct to say that the measure has not the endorsement of the representatives of the wool industry. The men to whom the draft bill was submitted were earnest in their desire to bave a bill which would be acceptable to tbe industry. The honourable member for New England( Mr will stand to the measure simply because Abbott) will agree with what I have said, because he had a consultation with the representatives a little later. much. they told the honourable member that they had not agreed to the bill. I have no doubt that representatives of tihe different organizations were conrayon was evolved in Great Britain. sulted in the preparation of the bill; but Prior to the discovery of this rayon, that does not relieve honourable members of the responsibility of giving thorough consideration to the measure. I am sure that had the faults disclosed during the course of this debate been revealed to the representatives of those organizations they would agree with the views being expressed by honorable members on this -dde. I believe that were these shortcomings made known to the rank and file would be asked to answer for their action in accepting this measure. It is now apparent that the proposed board is merely a palliative to the growers, because it will handle only a certain amount of money and will not be able to do very much publicity work. The Wool Consultative Council is purely an advisory body, which shall meet only wben requested by the Minister to do so, and matters of policy arising from its deliberations will be the subject of decision by three Ministers. Consequently, authority for the expenditure of moneys will reside in the Ministers one representative on the council, namely, the board's representative, and he will be chosen by the Minister. The board itself will have no voice in selecting its representative on the council. I do not agree with that set-up. I fail to comprehend why tbe Minister refuses to agree to the different bodies concerned nominating their representative on the council. It would appear that the Government, having introduced the measure, is determined to push it through without alteration, regardless of the logic of the observations of honourable members on this side. Apparently, the Government it has the numbers to push it through. I repeat the suggestion I made in my second-reading speech and again urge the Government to set up a board fully tell me representative of the growers, but comprising representatives of all phases of the industry from the production to the distributing end. This board should be given full executive powers in order to enable it to deal effectively with the different problems confronting the industry.

Personally, I am not contry, and clothed with executive power, could direct its attention. Only in that way will the industry be able to deal effectively with its problems. I also point out that a campaign is now going on in this country with the object of creating the impression that rayon is being developed in the interest of wool. Wide press publicity is being given to that idea. In the example I have just cited, synthetic materials can help wool; but I emphasize that the people interested in rayon are out primarily to benefit themselves, and not the wool iudustry. Matters of this kind pertain to research, and a body, fully representative of the industry and clothed with executive powers, should be enabled to deal with such matters in the best interests of industry. I ask the Minister if he will give an assurance that the Wool Consultative Council will meet at least three times a year. I also ask him to explain why he refuses to accept the amendment which is designed simply to enable the interests concerned to nominate their representatives on the Wool Consultative Council. I am sure that the repmeasure passed in 1936. Had those resentatives of the growers would welcome the amendment. I repeat that they agreed to the measure as submitted largely because they were not aware of shortcomings which have been disclosed in this debate. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment if only to establish harmony in the industry. listened with great interest to the debate, tion of the Wool Consultative Council, and particularly to the remarks of the but I suggest that the Minister amend Minister for Post-war Reconstruction sub-clause 2 by adding tbe words, ( Mr Dedman) this afternoon, when he "" and such otlier members as the Minisintimated that some of the suggestions ter may from time to time appoint"". made in the course of the debate may yet As scientific investigations proceed we be considered before the bill reaches the shall find more and more people comSenate.

One velopment of the industry on the sciencan only conclude that the latter measure tific side. This is the only clause that did not prove satisfactory, and that the really matters in the bill because it machinery provided under it did not meet the needs of the industry; and, consequently, the growers, of their own volition, asked that it be replaced by this cerned with the first part of the bill, because I do not think that it is within the competence of the growers to do anything more than grow wool. This clause deals with the really vital aspect of the measure. The proposed board is not competent to give an opinion on the scientific side. The Wool Consultative Council is to consist of the Commonwealth Wool Adviser, and members appointed by the Minister to represent the seven bodies specified. The first of these is the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research whose representative will be competent to deal with the scientific side. The representatives of the other interests enumerated, namely, the board, wool manufacturers and the textile distributors, .will not be competent to deal with that aspect. The representative of authorities concerned with textile education may be competent to give such an opinion. Should we fail to provide a proper scientific set-up, this measure will not be worth the paper on which it is printed. Apparently, the board fell down on the job allotted to it under the people been competent to do their job, there would be no necessity for this measure, which the Government has introduced at the request of the growers. I repeat that the really important part of the measure does not concern the growing of the wool, but development on the scientific side, and the discovery of new uses for wool. However, I do",51,Pairs
179,Dr. Gaha (Denison) [9.53],"I have not quibble with the proposed composirelates to the wider uses of wool. This is a problem for scientists, whereas growers, or their representatives, are not competent to give advice in that sphere. I urge the Minister to accept an amendment along the lines I have suggested. As to whether members of the Wool Consultative Council should be nominated or elected, I contend that we should be consistent, and the principle which we apply to one part of the bill should be retained tbroughout it. During the last fifteen years, I have had considerable experience of boards and believe that their personnel are the only people with heads of reinforced concrete. They are absolutely incompetent, and are always the excuse for the classic method of government in this country which, at the best, is government by suspicion. No speech to which I have listened in this chamber more revealed a person's ignorance than the rambling speech of the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha). His remarks were an insult to the Australian Wool Board, which has been in existence since 1936. It was recognized that further wool research was necessary, and because the funds at the disposal of the board were not sumcient for the purpose, the wool-growers were invited to make a greater contribution, and the Commonwealth Government was approached to introduce legislation to enable research work to be undertaken. That is why the bill is now before honourable members. Regarding tbe personnel of the Wool Consultative Council, I submit that, democracy does not mean autocratic selection by the Minister. Because the method of selection proposed in this bill is not in conformity with democratic principles, 1 object strongly to it. Despite the agreement reached between the Commonwealth Government and representatives of the wool industry, the rank and file of wool growers throughout the length and breadth of the land will protest against ministerial selection alone. I cannot imagine the Minister applying a strict interpretation of this clause to the Australian Workers Union and the Australian Textile Workers Union, because they would not accept his dictation. As president of the Australian Workers Union, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) has outlined the attitude of his organization to the proposal, and I know from experience that the unions will select their own representatives and. recommend them to the Minister, who will meekly accept them. I ask that the nominees of the other groups mentioned in sub-clause 2 shall be similarly accepted. WhilstI agree with the principle of the amendment, I am not able to see how the bill prejudices it. The clause does not provide that the Minister shall select the members of the Wool Consultative Council. beyond doubt? ""seven other members appointed by the Minister "". the Minister will not select the representatives, although he will appoint them. That is clear from the wording of the clause. If that assurance could be given by the Minister, it would satisfy members of the Opposition. In general practice, such bodies as the wool manufacturers and textile distributors would select their own representatives for the Wool Consultative Council. It is only right that they should. Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) assures me that those bodies will select their own representatives, and in general practice, the Minister will appoint them. them. confident that he would not do so. The organizations themselves would become very vocal, and rightly, if he did so. when the bill has been passed. Now is the time to be vocal. charge against members of the Opposition that they have not been vocal, and if the Minister were to reject the nominees of those various bodies, honourable members would hear a good deal",52,Pairs

If their interpretation be correct, I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) whether he is prepared to accept an amendment providing that "" The council shall consist of the Commonwealth Wool Adviser and seven other nominated members appointed by the Minister"". At present, those persons must be approved, and in fact, they will be selected and appointed by the Minister. The honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) claimed that the Wool Consultative Council will be a scientific body, and that in that respect, the Australian Wool Board's nominees are of no value. He contended also that the representatives of the wool manufacturers and textile distributors would be unable to tender scientific advice, as members of tbe Wool Consultative Council. Then he stopped short, and did not explain how tbe council would benefit from tbe scientific advice of the representatives of the Australian Workers Union and the Australian Textile Workers Union. The honourable member stated correctly that this clause is a valuable part of the bill. Whilst agreeing with that statement, I point out that this legislation does not deal only with scientific wool research. The honourable member made disparaging remarks aboiit the Australian Wool Board, which has heen in existence since 1936, and explained that the present board is abolished because it is useless. Evidently the honourable member forgot that tbe Minister bad previously complimented the board upon its wonderful record of service. The previous legislation on this subject was enacted under the title, ""Wool Publicity and Research Act 1936 "". This bill is entitled the "" Wool Use Promotion Bill 1945 "". Science is, of course, of the greatest value to the wool industry, and scientific research is one feature .of the measure. Tbe Australian Workers Union is another feature of it . The people whose bread and butter is at stake deserve consideration. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, I ask bim to agree to the Australian Wool Board, tbe wool manufacturers and the wool distributors each having the right is obvious that heavy responsibility will rest upon the Minister in connection with the selection of the representatives that will constitute this council, each member of which must be of the right calibre. The remarks of the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) indicate how narrow scientists can become in tbeir views._ The fact is, of course, that the scientist needs the help of the practical man, and the practical man needs the help of thc scientist. As a practical man engaged in the fat lamb industry, I have problems which I need to refer to scientists. A proper balance of scientists and practical men will be necessary on this council. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) chided tbe honourable member for Denison with ignorance, and attacked him because he criticized the work of the Australian Wool Board which was constituted under the 1936 legislation. If the honourable member for Maranoa had examined the facts more carefully he would have been aware that the first approach in connection with this matter waa made by the Government and not by the Australian Wool Board. The Government expressed the opinion that the functions of the board could be greatly enlarged to the advantage of the industry and it proposed a f l for £1 subsidy under certain conditions. The result of the subsequent negotiations was that a levy of 2s. a bale of wool was agreed upon. The honourable member for Maranoa displayed ignorance in attacking the bonorable member for Denison on that, point.",53,Pairs

193,Mr Lemmon (Fewest) [10.12],"I tI would not have participated in this discussion except for the aspersions that have been cast on the work of the Australian Wool Board. I have observed the activities of that board during the last nine years. It has done extraordinarily good work. It has contacted some of the finest scientists in the world, proposals, as well as between the and has placed its funds freely at their disposal. The result has been a great improvement in the quality of our wool, and in the woollen textiles that have been manufactured. I referred in my second-reading speech to the substantial advantage that had resulted from the use of unshrinkable wool in the manufacture of socks for soldiers. In the old days after a pair of socks had been Washed a couple of times they had shrunk So much as to be useless. Very fine work has been done at Torridon and the Australian Wool Board is entitled to a share of praise in this connection. Its activities uncier the old levy of 6d. a bale were political sense in this matter. I was so satisfactory that the wool-growers voluntarily agreed to increase their contributions to 2s. a bale, and they are no more ready than other people to part with their money. I agree with the honourable member for Denison that scientific investigation is necessary. It is a pity that the present proposals are not, more elastic in that regard. The Wool Consultative Council should have authority to co-operate with the Scientists. It is also necessary, however, that have been overlooked by the Minister that both the wool manufacturers and tbe textile distributors sbould have a place on the council. The distributors are able to give valuable advice about tbe kind of textiles that people favour and the manufacturers need to be in touch with the work of the council so that they may give advice from their point of view. The wool belongs originally to the wool-grower. Nobody else is to make any contribution to the fund, except tbe taxpayer. Surely, therefore, the wool-grower should have the right to say how the Wool Consultative Council should be constituted. Amendment negatived. -As the Minister bas pointed out, the Wool Consultative Council is one of the most important of the bodies to be constituted under the act. Its chief function will be to advise Ministers in connection with the working of the act. The chairman of the council should be the Commonwealth Wool Adviser. He will be the link between the publicity and the promotion sections of the Government's scientific research and the research in connection with the textile industry to be carried out by other bodies with the money that is to be provided. The chairman must be a scientist of the highest standing. Not only must he have a thorough knowledge of biological research, but in addition he must be competent-as is Mr Wilsdon, of the British Wool Research Association-to conduct research in relation to fibres and manufactured cloths. Despite the fact that the Minister has refused to accept every amendment so far submitted, we cannot be accused of acting in a party astounded when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) said that, having considered the measure closely, he regarded it as a very good one-so good that it could not be improved; therefore, it did not need further consideration by the Parliament. I do not believe that there is any legislation which 74 members, imbued with determination, cannot improve. All of them view it differently, and probably notice points and his advisers in tlie drafting of it. The full discussion given to a bill provides means whereby it can be improved. This bill would be very greatly improved by ensuring that the Commonwealth Wool Adviser shall be the chairman of the Wool Consultative Council. Accordingly, I move That sub-clause (3.) be left out with a view to insert in lieu tliereof the following subclause:"" (3.) The Commonwealth Wool Adviser shall be the Chairman of the Council."".

Nevertheless, an occasion might arise on which a representative of one of the other organizations represented would make an even more competent chairman. I say quite frankly that such a situation is not likely to arise. It is almost certain that the Commonwealth Wool Adviser will be the chairman of the council. But I do not want to tie myself completely in that respect. The honourable member can rest .assured that the Minister will use his discretion wisely. If the Commonwealth.

The Wool Consultative Council will be an important body, which will advise Ministers. Therefore, it is necessary that it should meet at regular intervals. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [10.26] I cannot accept the amendment. In my opinion, there is no justification for it. It may be necessary to hold only two meetings in one year, four in the next year, and six in the next year. Why tie the Minister down to any given number? He will call the council together as often as it is required to meet. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 15(3.)

I move That, in sub-clause (3.), .paragraph ( a ) , on the council after the word "" production"" the following words be inserted:-"" , carriage, distribution "". It will be essential for the Wool Consultative Council to investigate from time to time the cost of the carriage of wool, not only on the railways of Australia, but also, and particularly, from Australia to the United Kingdom, Europe, and the East. I recall to the Minister's mind an occasion some years ago when we had a tremendous fight against the overseas shipowners association to effect a. reduction of tbe wool freight from Australia to Europe and the United Kingdom. Tbat fight continued for some years and eventually we were able, largely through the instrumentality of the Cooperative Steamship Company, whose vessels the Primary Producers Association of Western Australian chartered, to effect a reduction of approximately -Jd. per lb., which in the aggregate represented a saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. The matter of wool freights must be investigated. Tremendous research can be done in connection with it, because there is no equality in regard to freights between the different countries. As I pointed out earlier, the freight is far greater on frozen meat than on wool from Argentina to the United Kingdom, whereas the reverse is the position between Australia and the United Kingdom. A matter which has caused great concern to wool producers is the greatly increased cost given to wool as the result of the costs of processing and distribution. The intermediate costs between the production of the raw article and the time when the finished product reaches the purchasing public add to the difficulties of the growers in the selling of wool in competition witb synthetic products'. Very little has been done ia reducing the cost of distribution. Some work in that direction was carried out in Great Britain in 1938 by Mr Cronje, a representative of South Africa On tbe International Wool Secretariat, who showed that the prime cost of wool",55,Pairs

Wool is subjected to many manufacturing processes from the time when it is shorn until the finished article appears in retail establishments, and every process adds to tbe final cost. When I submitted my previous amendment, the Minister admitted that I had almost convinced bim that it sbould be accepted. I hope that on this occasion I have completely convinced him tliat the amendment before the committee should be made. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [10.33] The amendment is not at all necessary. Subclause 3 provides that moneys standing to the credit of the Research Account may be applied "" in any manner approved by the Ministers"" for the purposes of the act, including certain purposes that are specifically mentioned. One of the purposes of the measure is to secure the expansion and betterment of the wool industry generally, and the carriage and distribution of wool are, in their widest sense, matters which may be approved by the Ministers, and are included in the purposes of the bill. It is true that paragraph a of sub-clause 3 indicates some of the purposes, but these are preceded by the words ""including tbe following purposes "". That does not exclude any other purposes which may be approved by the Ministers. I can assure the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) that the matters referred to by him will be taken into account as soon as the Wool Consultative Council meets. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 16 agreed to. Clause 17(I) Before the beginning of each financial year after the commencement of this act, tlie Ministers shall determine the proportion of tire moneys to be credited to the fund . . . -This is one of the most important provisions of tlie bill. The fund is to be raised by the wool-growers of Australia, and 80 per cent, of the growers' contributions will be provided by the members of the Australian Wool growers Council and the Australian Wool Producers Federation. The growers would not have consented to the Government having the right to allocate those funds to purposes other than those determined by tbem. The funds belong to the growers, and they have the right to dispose of tbem, in the manner they think proper, through their representatives on the Australian Wool Board. This clause breaks down the whole idea of producer-control of boards appointed to deal with the sale of various commodities. I move That, in sub-clause (1.), the words ""Ministers shall determine the proportion"", be left, out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" Bbard shall determine the proportion, if any "". I urge the Minister to keep faith, with the wool-growers of Australia, who have made arrangements with him for the administration of this fund. The Minister stated that they would be satisfied if 25 per cent, of the funds collected from them by means of the levy on wool were allocated to the research fund, but I am assured by the representative? of the two bodies concerned that no such arrangement was ever made. There will be a distinct breach of faith with the growers if they are not permitted to handle their own funds. I see no necessity for this clause, and it is hard to understand why the Government wishes to take money from the control of the growers' representatives without their consent. The annual income of tbe fund will be about £650,000, of which the Government will provide £325,000. The research programme provides for the expenditure of £100,000 in the first year, £175,000 in the second year, and £305,000 in the third year, or a total of £5S0,000 in the three year period. The Government would pay into the fund £975,000, while the expenditure would be £580,000, leaving a reserve of £395,000. The estimated capital expenditure on buildings and plant for research purposes is estimated at £400,000, so that, after the first three years, the most that the Government could seek from the growers' fund would be £5,000. Surely it is not suggested that the board would refuse £5,000"" to tbe Government in such circumstances.",56,Pairs

201,Mr Abbott (New England) [10.35].,"Tbe growers are seriously concerned over the possibility that the Government, in a time of financial stress, might yield to money in the form of a tax. There are the temptation to divert the money from the purposes for which it was originally intended. I do not say that tlie present Treasurer would yield to such a temptation, but treasurers eome and go, and thero are good treasurers and bad ones. It may happen that there will at some time in the future be a treasurer who would say, "" The wool-growers do not need all this publicity. We will stop our contribution to tbeir fund."" The Minister is to be given power to say what proportion of the fund shall be devoted to publicity and what proportion to research. A Minister may say that nothing is to be expended on publicity, bnt all on research. That is what the growers are afraid of. They ask that they themselves shall be given authority to administer the fund to which they have contributed. Therefore, I ask the Minister, as a staunch democrat, t.o act in a democratic way, and to allow those who raise tbe fund to administer it for the benefit of the industry and of Australia. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of tbe Council for Scientific and Industrial honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) has moved a number of amendments to-day, and when arguing in support of the last one he almost convinced me that it would be a good thing. Tn regard to bis present amendment, however, I can say without any hesitation that in no circumstances would the Government entertain it for a moment, for a number of reasons. In the first place, this money is to be collected by a tax. Government taxing machinery is to be used as the instrument for its collection, and, therefore, tbe Government must be tbe final authority in determining how the money will be expended. if the growers, by tbeir own action, colbill. Without any approach having been lected thc money. They would then be perfectly entitled to expend it how they liked. Listening to the honourable member for New England, one might be pardoned for thinking that that was actually what was to happen. He said that the growers themselves would collect tbe money. That is not true. It is the Government which will collect the other reasons, also, why the Government must be tbe final arbiter in determining how much of the money shall be used for research. In order to draw up a research programme, it is necessary to look many years ahead, and to know how much money will be available year by year. It would be impossible to organize an effective programme if it were open to the board to say at any time, "" No money will be made available from the fund for research purposes this year "". The Government must know how much money it will have at its disposal. agreed to, would not prevent the Government from obtaining that information. would empower the board itself to decide Iiow thc money, which is to be raised by a levy on wool, would be expended. ment cannot and will not agree to that. Of course, the Government will consult with the board. the bill. have been left out of the bill. may say that, in its opinion, 75 per cent, of the money raised is to be expended on publicity in any one year, and 25 pei cent, on research; (but if the Government had no say in the matter tbe board might decide that 100 per cent, of the money should be expended on publicity. tion. Well, tbe Government cannot agree to that. This is the first government in the history of Australia which bas made such a generous gesture to the wool It would be different industry as it is proposed to make in this made by tbe wool-growers or the Australian Wool Board, the Government has said that, in its opinion, the wool industry is so important to the future of the country that it proposes to expend a great deal of money on research into the industry.

Finally, the point has been -well taken jy some speakers that part of the money which is to be raised by taxation will be obtained from growers wbo are not members of either of the. organizations to be represented on tbe board. Tbe Government has a duty to them to ensure that the money which they contribute is properly expended. The wool industry is probably tbe most important in Australia, and it is necessary that, in working out any scheme for its improvement, there sbould be a full measure of co-operation between the industry and the Government. The industry has readily agreed to make a contribution of £325,000. The board will consist of men who are keen to make a success of tbe industry in which they are engaged, and they will not be likely to stand in, tbe way of anything which would be in its interests. If tbe Government will accept tbe amendment it will do something to counteract the irritating tactics to which the industry has been subjected, and the lack of co-operation shown by the Minister during this debate. Never previously in my parliamentary experience have I seen proposed amendments given so cold a reception by any Minister. The wool-growers of this country will not oppose any proposal of the Wool Consultative Council which is in the best interests of the industry. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, and in that way promote greater harmony among all concerned in this important industry. unusual to have so many important proposals for the improvement of a measure summarily rejected by the Minister in charge of it. The Government sbould pay some attention to the views of bonorable members on this side, particularly those who have a sound knowledge of wool-growing. In supporting the amendment, I emphasize the statement of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) that as the money will be provided largely by wool-growers it should be expended under tbeir direction. When that point was made, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) said that the money would be raised by taxation. That is a specious argument, because half of the money will, in fact, be provided voluntarily by the wool growers, and the Government will merely act as agent for the wool growers in collecting it. As the money will belong to the wool-growers, the fund sbould be administered by tbem. I agree with the Minister that it is not always possible to say how much money will be required each year for research, but I suggest that the way to deal with that is not to make inroads on the moneys provided by the wool-growers, but to increase the government subsidy. I understood, and I believe my colleagues bave been of tbe same opinion, that although tbe wool-growers, in consultation witb tbe Minister for Commerce, and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, agreed to many things, they did not agree to the way in which the money was to be expended. Therefore, I regard some of tbe proposals in this bill as a breach of faith on the part of the Government. to make. breach of faith, and therefore the Minister should reconsider his decision not to accept the amendment of .the honourable member for New England. [10.56] -In rejecting the amendment proposed by the bonorable member for New England( Mr Abbott), the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) made some exaggerated statements. Tbe Minister apparently overlooks the fact that the growers have voluntarily agreed to increase the levy on -wool which they themselves pay. It now appears that, in doing so, they have lost all control of that money. In its present state, the bill provides for Government control of the wool industry.

The Government is interested in assisting the wool-growers because the destruction of their industry would mean a serious loss of revenue. The failure of wool to meet the competition witb which it is confronted would mean considerable loss of employment, and the Government would be a big loser. Tbe small subsidy which this bill provides shall be paid by the Government is small in comparison with the revenue which the Government derives from the wool industry. If tbe Government really wishes to assist this industry, it should cease to pay a subsidy obviously, should the income earned by on the production of synthetic fibres, and should also cancel the arrangements made to establish a factory for the production in Australia of synthetic fibres to compete with wool. No subsidy that the Government pays to the wool industry can compensate for the damage that will be done by establishing a factory for the manufacture of synthetic fibres. Leader of the Australian Country party) [11.0] I should not have spoken on this clause but for certain remarks by the Miuister for Post-war Reconstruction. ( Mr Dedman). I support the amendment moved by the bonorable member for New England( Mr Abbott) because it seeks to provide that the growers shall lently towards the industry in subsidizexercise control over at least a portion of the funds provided which they themselves contribute. However, the Minister in the course of his remarks stated that in allocating the subsidy provided uncier the measure the Government was doing more to assist the industry than had been done by any previous government. The honourable member for Wide Bay Mr Corser) made a very good point when he stated tbe reason why the Government's interest in the industry has never been so pronounced as"" at present. We know that wool now faces serious competition from synthetic fibres. I remind the Minister that the Government's proposed subsidy of £325,000 will be taken from taxation revenue and does not represent benevolence on tbe part of the Government. At the. same time, Australia's annual wool cheque is approximately £70,000,000, and an expenditure of £325,000 represents an insurance premium of, about $ per cent, in relation to the wealth safeguarded by maintaining and encouraging tbe development of this great industry. The Government would have fallen down entirely on its job had it failed to realize the urgency of giving every possible financial assistance not only to maintain but also to expand this industry which is the greatest individual contributor to the economic well-being of Australia. Therefore, tbe proposed subsidy of £325,000 is a contribution for the purpose of maintaining our taxation base, because, the industry be reduced, tbe Government's source of taxation also will be seriously reduced. Therefore, failure on tbe part of the Government to heed tbe representations of the growers would be suicidal. The growers have volunteered to tax themselves at the rate of 2s. a bale provided tbe Government subsidizes their contribution to an equal amount. The maintenance of the industry is essential to the welfare of Australia. Apart from, the direct financial aspect, the industry provides substantial employment and maintains our economic stability. It helps us to meet our exter nal liabilities as well as maintain our internal economy. Therefore the Government oannot claim that it is acting benevoing the growers' contributions to an amount of. £325,000 annually. I repeal that that is a very small insurance premium in order to safeguard our economic well-being as a nation. In answer to arguments advanced in support of earlier amendments, both the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) told the committee that, representatives of the wool-growers' organizations had agreed to this measure, and therefore honourable members should accept tbe bill as drafted. It is clear that this provision was not agreed to by the growers. Had tbey realized that from 1 per cent, to 99 per cent, of the money contributed by tbem could be utilized by the Government for purposes other than those for",59,Pairs

The Government proposes to take £325,000 annually from general revenue. That is a large amount to be expended on research. However, I believe that the growers, because tbey realize tbe necessity for research, would agree to the Government taking something like 25 per cent, of their contribution to be expended on research. That would provide an additional £80,000 annually, making a total of over £400,000 for that purpose. However, publicity is also of great importance for the success of the industry. If we are to encourage the sale of our products throughout the world, we shall need to expend hundreds of thousands of pounds to undertake a worthwhile publicity -campaign. However, after adding £80,000 of tbe growers' contribution to the Government's subsidy of £325,000 to be used for research, approximately £200,000 would be available for publicity. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has said that tbe Government's contribution under this measure represents the most munificent offer ever made to the industry. I remind him. that long before the Government ever thought of raising this money, the necessity for a special tax on wool was realized by representatives of the growers throughout Australia. Indeed, last session I mentioned the necessity for such a scheme, before the idea was ever put forward by the Government; but, before I mentioned the matter, representations had been made by the growers emphasizing the necessity for concerted action on the part of the industry to publicize wool and to engage in research in the interests of the industry. flows from the growers to the Government; it is not the bright idea of the Government. However, the Government has sufficient sense to realize the wisdom of the growers' proposals. I again ask the Minister to amend the clause to pro""ide that not more than 25 per cent, of the growers' contributions shall be used for research. I have not the slightest doubt that a board consisting of growers' representatives would be prepared to agree to the amount beina; increased should tbey be convinced of the necessity ilr.

I remind tbe honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) that during the period in ivhich tbe Australian Wool Board exercised complete control over all the money collected for wool publicity, nearly £200,000 has accumulated. Under this bill, tbe Commonwealth Government will allocate to the new board approximately three times the amount of money that the original board controlled.

It makes me angry when I hear an honourable member make such ignoraart statements as did the honourable member for Denison. The Australian Wool Board accumulated a fund of £200,000 because the outbreak of war restricted wool publicity. But, in future, just as we must budget for research, so also must we budget for increasing tbe use of wool by means of a publicity programme. If tbe Australian Wool Board is given the right to control this fund , it will expend a considerable sum of money. What the wool-growers do not want is control of the expenditure of their funds by a M in ister in a Government which has not collected, them. The Minister quibbles about growers do not collect the money. Of course they do not! When there is a mass collection machine sucb as the Treasury, why sbould they? But whether they put it in themselves, or it is collected from them by the Government, it comes out of tlieir pockets. For that reason, the Government should accept the amendment and allow the Australian Wool Board to say what proportion of the fund it will give for research, purposes.

234,"Makin, N. J. O. Mr Guy (Wilmot ) [11.28]","I wouldtlian quote what appeared in a Tasmanian newspaper yesterday. It readsBIG FRUIT CONSIGNMENT CANCELLED. Failure by Hobavt waterside workers to give an assurance that they will not repeat demands made on a former occasion, and w ill observe the custom of the port, has resulted in the cancellation of shipping space for a consignment of 113,000 cases of apples for the United Kingdom. A considerable quantity of tlie f r u it , which was to have been lifted shortly, already is on the Hobart wharves. It is known that the British Shipping Controller expressed dissatisfaction at the fact that the first ship which lifted f r u it at Hobart this season, when exports to Britain were resumed after a break of four years, was allowed to leave with space unfilled. Mir. E. Ross, deputy representative for Tasmania for the British Ministry of War Transport, made the following statement on Saturday:"" Urgent representations were made by the Australian authorities to the British Ministry of War Transport to allocate refrigerated shipping space for the carriage of apples this year from Tasmania to the United Kingdom. As a result two vessels were nominated to load at Hobart. "" D u r in g the loading of the first vessel, which took place recently,the Waterside Workers Union demanded that all men, whether employed trucking f r u it or aboard the ship, must be paid tu the same hour. This involved paying thc shedmen for an hour or thereabouts while they were idle, and thc waterside workers were hatches aboard the vessel at the conclusion of each night's loading. "" The regulations of the shipping company owning the two vessels nominated to load Tasmanian f r u it , like certain other companies which have customarily served the Tasmanian f r u it trade, require that the insulated hatches he fitted at thc conclusion of loading each day, so that sonic of the refrigerating equipment may be operated to assist in the good carriage of the f r u it . "" D u r in g the loading of the first vessel the union's men carried into effect their threat. Following this a telegram was received from Sir Thomas Gordon, Director of Shipping, for conveyance to the Waterside Employment Committee, reading' You must make it perfectly plain to the Port Committee that the Federation must guarantee that they will observe and work award conditions, otherwise the projected additional f r u it loadings will be cancelled.' "" Various discussions have tnken place since that notification was given a fortnight ago, but as the Stevedoring Industry Commission informed Sir Thomas Gordon that the men had refused to give the required assurance, advice was received from Sydney on Friday that the f r u it load ng had been cancelled, and that the : loading of the second vessel would now be confined.to general cargo only. This decision was postponed until the very eleventh hour, when the point was reached that other arrangements had to be completed elsewhere for the filling of the vessel's refrigerated space."" The people in Great Britain are starving for this fruit. Apples are wasting and rotting in Tasmania, and because of the action of somebody the people of the United Kingdom are being deprived of tbe fruit. I am not discussing tbe merits or demerits of tbe case, because I do not know them, but there can be no merit in holding up in time of war supplies wbich tlie people of Great Britain urgently require. Surely we have sumcient boards, tribunals and regulations to enable all industrial differences to be adjusted without resort to diirect action of this description. The worse feature is that the alleged action of the waterside workers has resulted in the fruit loading of tbe second vessel being cancelled altogether although some of the fruit was on the wharfs awaiting shipment. After four years without fruit shipments overseas, Tasmania is faced with the serious effects of the disloyal action of those who are responsible for tbe cancellation of this shipment overseas. The growers of apples are greatly fitting insulated perturbed at the withdrawal of the shipment of the large quantity of apples which they contemplated would be exported. I appeal to tbe Minister to take whatever action is necessary to insist that these vessels shall be loaded. The Australian authorities were successful in their representations to tbe British Ministry of ""War Transport for securing refrigerated space to send the muchneededapples to the United Kingdom, but the effort bas been frustrated by the action of somebody who has blundered. The stage bas now been reached wben s transport in limited quantities is available, but it appears that 113,000 cases of apples cannot be sent to our kinsmen on tbe other side of tbe world. As the matter is most urgent, I hope that the Minister will ensure that the second boat shall be loaded, even if it be necessary to call on members of the fighting services to do the job. I am sure that nobody would be more pleased than members of the services if the fruit could be despatched to the people overseas who are in dire need of it. 1 -for in the day, tbe Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Harrison) directed a question to me concerning the decision .of Cabinet to establish a National Eilms Board. He read from a newspaper a .certain item that was dressed up in a way whicli apparently appealed to his fancy, and I promised to make a statement later concerning the Cabinet's decision. \ t a meeting of Full Cabinet yesterday it was decided to establish a National Films Board under tbe chairmanship of -the Minister for Information. The duties of the board will be to expand, promote, assist and co-ordinate the production and distribution and the importation of films for purposes of school and adult education, rehabilitation, social development, international understanding, trade -and tourist expansion, and immigration. In addition to the chairman, members .of the board will be Dr. H . C. Coombs, Director-General of Post-war Reconstruction, or his deputy; Mr J. F. Murphy, secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, or his deputy; Mr K. Binns, Librarian of the Commonwealth National Labrary, and Professor Stout of the University of Sydney, representing the Documentary Films Society. The Government will also -invite tbe State Directors of PublicI nstruction, through the State Premiers, to nominate a representative of secondary and primary educational bodies. The seventh member of tbe board is yet to be selected by the Government. The establishment of the board follows a series of conferences, the first of wbich, fication, and bibliographic research. The called by the Government in September last year, was widely representative of Commonwealth and State instrumentalities interested in the production of documentary, fact, and educational films. Represented at this conference were Commonwealth departments, including the fighting services, State Departments of Education, universities, technical schools and organizations concerned with adult education and training and upon the decisions of the conference the proposals now adopted by Cabinet were based. An immediate responsibility of the board will be to train a number of Australian technicians, so that an Australian production organization may be built up Information) [11.35] -Earlie r that will be able to make films equal in quality to those produced by tbe British Ministry of Information, tbe Canadian Films Board and other overseas units specializing in this type of film production. With the assistance of the British Ministry of Information inquiries have been proceeding for some months with a view to bringing to Australia two film technicians experienced in documentary film production who will organize the production activities of the board and train Australian technicians. As soon as the board meets the results of these negotiations will be placed before it and arrangements completed to bring the specialists to Australia. In addition to its specialized national interests, the board will, with the approval of the Treasurer, provide financial assistance to Australian producers to facilitate the production of films approved by the board as being consistent with the advancement of Australian prestige at home and abroad. Tbe board, for administrative purposes, will be attached to the Department of Information, which will be the Commonwealth authority responsible to tbe board for the production or supervision of films approved by it. The distribution of films produced or acquired by the board will be effected, in tbe case of non-tbeatrical films, through the Commonwealth National Library, wbich will act as tbe central distributing agency within the Commonwealth and be responsible for the storage of master copies, cataloguing and classiboard hopes to continue the distribution of films and their exhibition in commercial theatres through the National Films Council, an honorary organization representing commercial film exhibitors that has, since the beginning of the war, co-operated closely with the Department of Information in all matters effecting Commonwealth film activity. State governments will be invited to form State advisory committees to advise the board., wbich, on request and at the expense of tbe States, will produce or acquire approved films and make available the facilities of the board for the",63,Chaibman Mb Riobdan I Inform The House That Australian Troops

I bring to the notice of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Sydney. In all the other capital cities, Holloway) what I regard as a serious anomaly. I recognize that the Minister cannot be aware of everything done by tbe man-power authorities, and I believe that if cases of. injustice arc brought to bis notice be will do his best to rectify tbem. My complaint has to do with the action of the authority in placing a ban upon the employment of apprentices in the ladies' hairdressing trade. This ban has been in force since May, 1943. Tbe industry was given to understand that the ban would be progressively relaxed, but, far from that being done, it has now been extended to cover students in training at hair dressing colleges. The master hairdressers originally agreed to the imposition of a ban because they recognized that at that time there was a shortage of female labour for other industries, but they believed that it would be relaxed as soon as possible. Indeed, tbey were told that permits would be issued for tbe employment of students who had had one year's training at a licensed college. They were also told that permits would be issued in cases of hardship when firms had lost so mauy employees that tbey were unable to carry on. Hairdressing businesses, in the meantime, bave been carried on, mainly Avith senior staffs, but the loss of staff whicli has been great since 1943 has not been made good by replacements. In 1944, only 26 college students and 23 other assistants were allowed to enter tbe trade, although there is in Sydney a great number of establishments engaged in ladies' hair-dressing. In 1944, the manpower authorities were approached with a request that apprentices sbould be allocated to tbe trade through the State Apprenticeship Commission, which would ensure that tbe trade was not flooded with cheap labour. This -application was rejected, mainly on the representations dressers Union, which also objected to the issue of permits to college students. However, an exception was made in tbe case of students who had had two years' training, and, strangely enough, this happened to coincide with tbe curriculum of the union college. However, the manpower authorities decided to ban all apprentices, but the ban applies only to apprentices may be taken from colleges or, alternatively, girls between the ages of fifteen and seventeen may be taken into the industry. As a matter of fact, the man-power authorities have no power of direction over girls between those ages. The effect of the ban in Sydney is that girls must either remain at home or go into some industry other than the one of their choice. Tbey may enter a hairdressing college, but they may not go into the industry. If they take a twelvemonths' course at a college, their training if) wasted unless they are allowed to enter a hairdressing establishment afterwards. The ban drove many girls into training colleges. If they have a year's training in a college, for which they pay a fee of about £40, it counts as two years' apprenticeship in tbe trade itself. Hairdressing firms were prepared to accept this condition because it was recognized that the training at the college bad tbe effect of rubbing off the rough edges. Tbe trouble is that many parents in poor circumstances made a serious sacrifice to scrape together enough money to send their girls to a college for a year so that they might enter this popular occupation of hairdressing. Now, after the girls have finished a year's training, they are prevented from entering the trade. They must find something else to do, or their parents must try to scrape up another £40 to enable tbem to take a second year's course. There is a number of hairdressing colleges in Sydney. Amongst them there is one controlled by the master hairdressers, and the other by tbe Hairdressers Union. Tliese colleges, I understand, constitute a lucrative business. The union, w bicb was 7 formerly in straitened circumstances, has recouped its finances as a result of the activities of the college. Tbe master hairdressers want apprentices to come into the trade, but not with the object of of the HairTetting cheap labour. As a matter of fact, only a limited number of apprentices would be allowed to enter. The",65,Chaibman Mb Riobdan I Inform The House That Australian Troops

I have no doubt that some of the matters wbich he raised can be explained satisfactorily, sented :but in order to make sure I shall discuss them with Mr Bellemore, the Under Secretary for Labour in New South Wales and also with the man-power authorities and the Hairdressers Union, t know that there are several hairdressing colleges in New South Wale3: one is conducted by tbe union, and another by tlie master hairdressers, and there are also some private colleges. The man-power authorities have interested themselves in seeing that some hairdressers do not bave too many juveniles while others cannot get sufficient assistance. It is not quite true to say that the man-power authorities have no control over girls between fifteen and seventeen, years of age and bave not the right to direct them, and, indeed, tbey do not wish to direct tbem; but tbey can prohibit an employer from employing girls of the ages stated.

Tenders for the sale of dehydrated mutton the property of the Departmentof the Army have been invited by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. I understand that a considerable portion of the quantity involved was processed at Homebush Bay in the initial stages of the dehydration project. It has been held in reserve, therefore, for lengthy periods, much beyond the normal safe life of the product. It would not be desirable at this stage for it to be sold for human consumption. 2. All dehydrated mutton that has been produced has been passed by Commonwealth Inspectors as suitable for human consumption, including the quantity-147,00 0 lb -no w in question. 3.

Isi t a fact that this amount would have been enough to provision the British, and Australian fleets in the Indian and Pacifi* oceans for the whole of 1.945 or to have increased this year's export to Britain by almost 50 per cent.? 3.

What action has been taken to prevent a repetition of this excessive consumption? and Customs bas supplied tbe f o l l o w in g answers:1. No. 2. No. 3. Consumption exceeded the tentative estimate by approximately 35,000 tons. This was due to the absence of any accurate preAND UNDESIRABLE rationing record of meat consumed locally and also to t.he fact that many slaughterhouses and particularly Victorian metropolitan abattoirs were not equipped with proper weighing facilities. 4. W it h the experience of a year's rationing, it is now possible to estimate more accurately and to adjust the ration to the amount allocated. Furthermore, scales have been installed in Melbourne abattoirs and steps are being taken to check weights of all slaughterings.",70,Services Cancellations The Department Of The Navy Whieh Is Th F Illegal Use Delegate Of The Commonwealth Disposals Com

Have such passengers been informed at Adelaide this month that civilian travellers must wait until the Army bookings arc known ? Mr ""WAKD -This question should have been addressed to the Minister for the Interior, who supplies the following answers:1. The routing of the limited' civilian passenger and goods traffic from Adelaide to Alice Springs via Terowie and Quorn is due entirely to the traffic arrangements necessary for the service requirements and the ho.ivy defence traffic on the trans-Australian railway. 2. (a) Bookings from Adelaide to Alice Springs are controlled hy the South Australian railway authorities who have advice that owing to the fact that this train runs into un operational area it is necessary for Army demands to he met first and civilian nccoiumodation is subject to Army requirements which are not known until tlie day prior to thc departure of the train.

Two tentative agreements were made with the States at a eon ference of Commonwealth nnd State Ministers in October, 1944. The two agreements were designed broad); to meet thu different circumstances operative in the two groups of States. The agreement with Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria provides that thc States will undertake the mnjor administrative responsibility for carrying out land settlement of servicemen. The actual schemes nnd conditions of settlement are subject to Commonwealth approval. In the agreement with Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia detailed administration is carried out by the States, with the Commonwealth determining major questions of policy, after full consultation with the States. In general the two agreements and schemes of settlement are very much thc same, except that in the case of Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia thc Commonwealth financial contribution is greater, and certain conditions, such as tenure, aro laid down by the Commonwealth.
