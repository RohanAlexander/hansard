PerhapsI may make my meaning clear by reminding you that the question which I put to the Minister of Trade ancl Customs bore upon a statement ment as a member of the Royal Commission. I always understood that it was not a breach of the rules of this House for an honourable member to refer to a statement made by a member of a Royal Commission under such circumstances. honourable member a few minutes ago was making certain remarks the effect of which was to make it appearI may have been wrong-that the Royal Commission referred to had been appointed in a way Neither are the appointment of that was not creditable to the Government or to any one else connected with it.

If he chooses to give notice of a question to me such as he has indicated, I shall be pleased to look into the matter and to give an answer at a later stage. At the present time. I am not in a position to give a direct answer. It appeared to me, however, that a Royal Commission, situated as is the Commission to which reference has been made, stands in very much the same position as if it were a court of law dealing witli a case.

When men are brought from Queenscliff for guards of honour they are accommodated in the School of Instruction, proper bedding being provided for them, therefore their presence does not affect the accommodation in barracks proper. 2. No report has been received from the medical authorities as to the overcrowding of barracks with the present strength. 3. The Department of Home Affairs are in negotiation with a view to obtaining the present police quarters and hospital. 4. Plans have been approved for the building of the dep6t for the Field Artillery Battery at Maribyrnong, and the work will be proceeded with forthwith. 5. The overcrowding referred to by Mr bers of Naval Cadets can be obtained within Ozanne in his letter of the 24th July last was immediately obviated, as stated in paragraph 4. the honourable member for Herbert asked some questions relating to entry to the MiliHome Affairs, upon noticetary College. The Minister of Defence has furnished the following reply :In regard to a question asked by the honourable member for Herbert relative to the method of entry to the Royal Military College of Australia, I desire to point out that the paragraph on the subject he quoted from the report on the first entrance examination is a quotation from Lord Kitchener's memorandum on the Defence of Australia, and it does not indicate the method which has been adopted by the Department. If the honourable member will read the paragraph immediately following that which he quoted he will see that it was decided to abandon the method proposed by Lord Kitchener, and to adopt the principle of a competitive examination, open without restriction to all candidates within thc prescribed ages. ister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice1. Has the Minister of Defence called in the pass books of the compulsory cadets, thereby causing the boys to walk to drill or pay their own railway fares? 2. Does the Minister know that boys have to walk from St. Kilda to Port Melbourne, also that naval cadets are compelled to walk from the suburbs to Williamstown or pay their own train fares? 3. Does the Minister think it is fair that these boys, in addition to losing their Saturday halfholiday, should be further penalized by having to pay their own fares? honourable member's questions are1. Pass books issued to naval cadets in the Melbourne Area bave been recalled as they may have been issued without authority. 2. The extreme distance of the furthest point in St. Kilda portion of training area from the Port Melbourne drill-room is 2 miles to the west, z% miles to the north, and 3-£ miles to the east. It is not known what suburbs are referred to in the second part of the question as the naval training area is only about 7 miles by 4 miles around Williamstown. The Minister is aware that boys have to walk or pay their own fares, but in view of the limited distance shown above, no hardship is entailed thereby. Naval cadets from St. Kilda do not now attend at Williamstown. 3. The Parliament has decided that boys shall be called upon to give up a certain time to naval or military training. The loss of the Saturday afternoon is not, therefore, a question for the Minister. As regards payment of fares, if any Naval Cadet at a distance from the drill-halls desires, he can be transferred to the military training centre near his home, as sufficient numeasy walking distance of the drill-halls at Wil liamstown and Port Melbourne. paying their fare. 1. Is it a fact lhat the Commonwealth authorities have acquired, or taken steps to acquire, compulsorily, three hundred and fifty acres of Perth endowment lands for purposes of a rifle range ? 2. Is the Minister aware that in carrying out this object a large area of land at Ocean Beach, where it is proposed to develop a seaside township, will be made unsafe for settlement and rendered practically useless? 3. Have the Government any alternative scheme, or will they cause further inquiries to be made to secure a rifle range not open to this objection? to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. Yes, the land has been compulsorily acquired, with the concurrence of thc State Government. 2. It is proposed that the firing shall be out to sea, and as the area acquired embraces an ample danger zone it is not seen how any lands without that area can be prejudicially affected. 3.

65,Dr. Maloney Asked The Minister Of,"the article into the Commonwealth without the labels and have the objectionable labels printed in Australia? orable member's questions are as follow:I . Yes. In forty-eight cases the Department has objected to the importation of foods containing ingredients deleterious to infants unless such foods have been marked in a prominent manner as "" not suitable for children"" under a specified age which is regulated by the class or properties of the food. In the case of many infants' foods formerly reported with advertisements containing misleading and extravagant claims, such advertisements bave been prohibited admission. In numerous cases infants' powders, soothing syrups, & c , have been found to contain drugs, more or less injurious, although advertised as containing "" nothing injurious to a tender babe,"" &c. Where preparations containing injurious drugs, or where statements are false, importation has been prohibited. In cases, however, where the contained drugs are not injurious, unless taken in excess, prohibition has not been enforced, but manufacturers have been compelled to revise the advertisements and mark prominently the percentage of deleterious drugs contained, or to exclude such drugs from their preparations. 2. In four of the States laws are in force dealing with the manufacture and sale of infant foods (in one of these States, however, only milk foods are dealt with). In one State no law is enforced dealing with infants' foods, while in the sixth, regulations will be in operation next year. So far as is known, none of the States had laws dealing with the manufacture and sale of medicines bearing extravagant claims, and a number of such medicines are manufactured and advertised with claims so misleading and extravagant that they would be prohibited if entered for importation. 3. In cases in which the Department objects to misleading statements on wrappers, labels, & c , importers seldom advise the Department when they purpose having the same printed in Australia; but in numerous cases in which objections to extravagance and misleading advertisements have been taken by the Department the same have been removed from medicines, & c , imported, but pamphlets and advertisements with . similar objectionable wording have been printed in the Commonwealth. ter, ufon notice1.

Debate resumed from 20th October (vide That this B i ll be now read a second time. That all the words after the word "" T h a t "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" no measure the effect of which will be to concentrate in any one person the control of all the conditions of carrying on all the industries of this continent can be other than impracticable and fraught with danger to the whole community."" by way of introduction, pay deference to the utterances of the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Flinders? We cannot but appreciate the lucidity, the' logic, and the keen and careful attention, which these honourable members do, from time to time, give to various propositions which are submitted to the House. I pay my deference to them for the very lucid explanation which they gave from their standpoint of this measure, though at the same, time. I feel myself in opposition to the main points of their contention. I have no legal knowledge, and therefore I speak subject to the professional opinions of legal members on tlie Opposition side and of the Attorney-General, and such other legal gentlemen as we have on this side. There was one question put by the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Darling Downs, which appeals to me in a. most pronounced way, and I confess that I cannot see my way out of the difficulty, and that is in connection with the additional powers which are sought for the Arbitration Court. It is sought by amendment to provide that no award or order of the Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed,, quashed, called in ..question, or be subject to prohibition or mandamus in any Court on any account whatever. The power to review, quash, and so forth, such orders is undoubtedly given by section 73 of the Constitution. While a High",17,Commerce Act Deleterious Foods Apple Taint I N Butter

72,Mr Howe (Dalley) [3.38],"May I ,Court is established as an appellate Court its powers are limited, and -cannot be exercised in the way of reviewing or quashing any decision in connection with arbitration. On the other hand, section 75 of the Constitution, which, I understand) deals with the original juris-diction of the High Court, provides tha' the power of prohibition, mandamus, or injunction does lie in the Court; and I fail to see how by the mere addition of the words proposed we can go beyond the limitation expressed in the Constitution itself. If it can be shown that this may be done, I shall be very pleased; and, therefore, though much against my own judgment, I take it that the Attorney-General, in conjunction with the draftsman, can see a way which is not apparent to me as a layman. Nevertheless, I view the .situation with much alarm, and shall be agreeably surprised if they get over the difficulty. Further, I fail, to see how the honourable member for Darling Downs, the honourable member for Flinders, and many others, can vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Ballarat, which is distinctly at variance with the contentions of those gentlemen. orable member for Ballarat declares that no amendment of the Act, the effect of which would be to concentrate in any one person the control of all the conditions of -carrying on all the industries on the continent can be other than impracticable and fraught with danger to the whole community. The contention of these honourable .gentlemen is that the power sought does not, and cannot, exist constitutionally, and, therefore, cannot be exercised by Parliament. able members. I have named cannot vote for the amendment. however, that there is a possibility that such power may lie in the administration -that the interpretation placed on the -clause by the Opposition may not be correct-and that it is possible by the means proposed to attain what we desire. It is further contended that to place this power in the hands of the Judge of the Arbitration Court is wrong. We are asked what will be the result if we invest the Judge with this enormous power; and there is no doubt that honourable members opposite have made much of this point. It is contended that the Judge of the Arbitration Court is subsidiary to the High Court, -or should be, ancl that, if he be invested, with these powers, he will be no longer subsidiary.; and the High Court, having no longer any control over him, he will become a Judge supreme in himself, with a power and authority not only judicial, but legislative -that , by his interpretation of the Act, he will decide for himself what the legislation shall be. I admit that there is a great deal of force in the contention; and it is for that very reason I am going to oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Ballarat. I absolutely fail to see how, under any aspect of Federation, it is possible to prevent some legislative power lying with those who have the final determination of the interpretation of the Act.. A day or two ago, when the honourable member for Flinders was speaking, I interjected that in the High Court the final determination was by the judgment of one man; and the only retort from the learned gentleman was that, while we are a democratic community, questions must be decided by majority rule. I fail to see, in connection with such an issue as that with which we are now dealing, that any greater benefit is to be obtained by leaving the legislative power in a Federal Court of five Judges, rather than in an Arbitration Court with one Judge. Ever since the ConstituThe amendment of the hontion was established, ancl an appellate High Court has been existent, I have looked with amazement, and sometimes with amusement, at the differences that arise in reference to decisions of the Supreme Courts of the various States. I do not know that the Judges of the High Court are intellectually superior to the Judges of the State Supreme Courts. They may be; but that is a matter no one can determine. We have the fact that, time and again, decisions of SupremeI f that be true, then the honorCourts, which, in the absence of a High Court, would have expressed the laws of It has been said, the States, have been upset, not by unanimous determinations, or the common recognition of what the State law is, but oy a determination in which, in many cases, two Judges were on one side, and three, by chance, on the other. Without disrespect to the High Court, I cannot refrain from commenting on the fact that there is invariably seen, more especially in arbitration matters, Judges like Mr Justice Higgins and Mr Justice Connor, or, if not the latter, certainly Mr Justice Isaacs on one side. This seems to me to mark the trend of feeling of those gentlemen-it seems to me not a mere judicial determination, but,-shal l I say-la w tempered by feelings, emotions,, and tendencies which develop in connection with their social thought'. the humanity of any Judge, or, indeed, of any other individual in this community. I believe we are all susceptible to those -humane feelings and considerations that make for the benefit of humanity. Nevertheless, this is certainly an aspect of the power of the High Court that has appealed to me in the most pronounced maimer. It has, however, been opposed by many honourable members, who have asserted that the power of interpretation is not the power of legislation. I felt myself on such safe ground that I thought I could not do better than appeal to an authority of some standing ; and I do not think any one will question the status of the writer whom I propose now to quote. Mr Henry Sidgwick, in the Elements of PoliticsI am, perhaps, drawing the matter a little, but I do not think unjustly, from its contextwritesI f the Judges are to recognise as valid the precedents of previous decisions, so that a certain amount of legislation under the guise of interpretation is inevitable. The point that I wish to make, and a point which honourable members opposite repudiate, is that this power of one individual, whether it be that of a Judge of the Arbitration Court, whose decisions cannot be quashed or interfered with by the High Court, or that embodied in the High Court, and expressed there finally by a majority decision, is unquestionably, by the terms of interpretation, a power of legislation vested in that Court. That is a power that we do not desire. I fail to see how, in the Federal jurisdiction, we can get rid of it ; but if it is possible to get rid of it, then, I for one, am prepared to do my utmost in this House to do so, or to strive at least to modify it. I have here a more lengthy passage from a chapter in the same work, dealing with "" Federal and other composite States,"" which I feel justified in quotingBut it is evident that the position of the judiciary relatively to either central or local legislature will be materially different from that which we have so far contemplated, if we assume the formerThe judicial power to have the duty of sitting in judgment on the legality of the acts of the latter : That is the legislative powerand the more stability is given to the constitution by making the process of changing it difficult, the greater becomes the importance of this judicial function of interpreting its clauses. honourable member evidently finds himself In order that Ibis function may be well performed, the supreme court of justice must be made adequately independent of both central and local legislatures, no less than of the executive governments : I emphasize this pointand it is a delicate problem to find conditions of appointment and tenure that will secure this independence, without, at the same time, giving the supreme court too predominant a power. the full Supreme Court. "" supreme "" in this relationship merely implies that the Court is the supreme, and therefore tlie highest, Court of the community. It seems to me that the difficulties suggested by honourable members opposite are not tenable. As a matter of fact, whether you place your power in the hands of a Judge who shall exercise it for industrial legislation, or whether you place it in the High Court, finally, it amounts to this : that you vest in the Court a power, not only judicial, but legislative. And the question is whether that legislative power should rest in the hands of the individual who may be termed the Judge in Arbitration, or by a majority decision, in the hands of some individual who may be known as a Justice of the High Court. There is yet another aspect with which I wish to deal, and I am glad that the honourable member for Darling Downs is present.

I take it that we are now going to amend the term "" industry,"" so that we may have an amended Conciliation and Arbitration Act, upon the lines which we think will more effectively deal with the situation as we see it. . The honourable member for Cook spoke at length the other night on the lines of what he terms '' industhe 1901 Arbitration Act of New South trial unionism."" I was not present when the speech was made, and if , in my criticism of it, I say anything that does not correspond with the facts of that utterance, I must apologize; but I do not think I shall do tlie honourable member any injustice. The attitude taken up by the honourable member seems to fit in very exactly with the attitude which the Opposition are taking up on diis measure. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member knows that I have taken up that attitude consistently. because I have had to fight my honourable friend for some considerable time on the subject. The honourable member for Darling Downs said on Friday that the honourable member for Cook expressed the attitude of a worker. True, it is the attitude of a worker, but it is not the attitude of the workers; ind the honourable member for Cook knows that it is opposed by the Sydney Labour Council, has been opposed for two or three years by the Trade Union Congress, and is opposed by my own organization, the engineers, by the traffic association, by the building trades, by the Locomotive Engine Drivers' Association, by the Tramway Union, by the carpenters, and, in fact, by nearly every trade and calling in the railway service. The honourable member's proposition is not recognised in New South Wales, even outside that service. other States; but I can assure honourable members of the Opposition that the attitude which they think most satisfactory on the part of the honourable member for Cook does not, in any way, represent the position of the trade unions or of the craftsmen in my own State. Mr J. H . CATTS -It represents that of rest or peace being obtained. It is of no a very large section. honourable member means by a very large section. He may have thousands of men in his organization. Mr J. H . CATTS -We had 5,000 new members last year. The question is, what is member's attitude by no means represents that of the general workers and the trade unionists of New South Wales. To give an illustration, which may enable honourable members to see the desirability of this amendment of the Arbitration Act-abou t five years ago I was instrumental in getting an award for the engineering trade under Wales. That award had to last for three years. When the award was about two years old, the Industrial Disputes Act came into operation. The result was that, whereas the employers, from the Railways Commissioners down, had been complying with the award, we suddenly found ourselves face to face, under the new Act, with applications for exemption. The first was by the Railway Commissioners, the next by the Northern Collieries, and we had just spent £.250 in prosecuting the colliery-owners for breaches of the award. We are always told how the men break awards by coming out on strike, and will not recognise their duty and their obligations in connection with legislation; but I venture to say that, if honourable members opposite were in the Arbitration Courts day after day, and saw tlie breaches of awards that take place, they would find that, for every body of men that go out on strike, there are 150 employers violating the awards every day of their existence. First, then, we had an application for exemption from the Railways Commissioners, then from the Northern Collieries, and then from the Southern Collieries. Then there was a Coach and Car Builders Board formed. Although we had spent money for some years to get the award, we found all these exemptions suddenly granted under the new Act, and granted under precisely the same terms as members of the Opposition are asking for in this I cannot speak as to the case, with a definition of industry which relates to the employers rather than to the employees. From that day to the present time, New South Wales has simply been seething with disruption and dissatisfaction among the trade unionists, and the Courts have been filled with applications day after day, without any possibility of industrial",22,Second Reading

We have built up for ourselves, during a long course of years, a line of action that we deem essential. We have formed associations that we know to be beneficial to ourselves, and no definition of industry that may emanate from this House will take possession of us, if we find it to be injurious. There is nothing for it but the trade or craft union. The industrial union may have, and I believe will have, its political characteristics j but, so far as industrial organizations are concerned, only one basis will be satisfactory to us, and that is the craft union. I trust, therefore, tliat the Opposition will not further oppose the measure. If it be only in a tentative way, if only to give us some opportunity of seeing what results may arise from the operation 'of an amended Act, I hope they will give us the Act amended in the terms for which we are asking. I think then they will find that if they want industrial peace they will get it ; but they will never get industrial peace without it. The honourable member for Dalley has given us some very interesting definitions, and some interesting information, respecting trade unionism; but he has put his whole case from the stand-point of trade unionism only, and has laid down no fair and equitable basis upon which an arbitration scheme can be built. will now put the fair and equitable basis from the employers' point of view. deavour to show that the amendments, as proposed in the Bill, will have the effect of destroying the whole basis of arbitration. The amending Act of 1910 had for its main object the settlement of differences before they became active disputes, and also the securing of preference to unionists. The word ""industry"" remained untouched, except that it was extended to rural industries ancl domestic servants. The Act as then amended was not given a proper trial before this new amendment was brought before the House, altering the whole basis upon which our scheme of arbitration had formerly been built. amendments in our arbitration laws, before we have any real opportunity of testing their efficiency, or their possibilities for the cause them very grave and serious difficulty. prevention ancl settlement of disputes, are calculated to cause irritation in the industrial world, rather than to make for peaceful settlements. all this trouble. defined "" industry "" in a manner which really upholds instead of destroying the old Act, and preserves, for the future judgments of the Arbitration Court, the true basis of arbitration between employers and anployes. We object to these amendments of the Act, because the High Court decision has properly interpreted the word "" industry "" as we understand it, and as the Legislature originally intended that it should be interpreted. nearly evenly divided. cision was a majority decision, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Flinders; but surely the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who professes to belong to a Democratic party, cannot object to a majority decision, even when it comes from the High Court. The amendment' of last session, including, as it did, rural \rorkers and domestic servants,, was a sufficiently sweeping extension. I believe there was no necessity for the inclusion of those callings as "" industries "" within the scope of an Arbitration Act. Australia such a variety of climates ancl conditions that the system of agriculture varies in every State, and almost in every locality within a State; and, therefore, the State tribunals appointed to represent parI shall enticular districts in particular States are in a better position to give a true and proper award with respect to agricultural workers than can any Arbitration Court whose operations extend over the whole continent. would apply to bootmakers. dustry carried on in large cities like Melbourne and Sydney continues under much more closely approximating conditions than any agricultural industry can possibly do.

If this Bill be passed, we shall find that those difficulties will be accentuated. posite say that the Bill will be ultra vires. any member of this House will arrogate to himself judicial functions by offering definite opinions on this measure. It is the duty of the ""High Court to interpret the constitutionality of legislation passed by this Parliament. I admit that if* the measure be passed in its present form the cause of strengthened. Unionism in itself is a good thing. If we are to have unionism, we must have organizations of employers and of employed. The more extensive their operations can be made the better. But my complaint is that by passing this Bill we shall throw the whole cause of conciliation and arbitration into the tralia. It would be very useful if the hands of various craft unions, and shall make it extremely difficult for employers and employed in the rural districts to have their cases determined. The difliculty of such persons bringing cases before the Arbitration Court will be accentuated. Thus we shall strengthen the trades organizations *xisting in the large centres of population. Cases affecting rural interests will be brought before the Court in a partial manner, and reasonable decisions will not be given. I wish to refer to the New Zealand experience. It is constantly being stated in this House that, owing to our constitutional limitations, we are not able to adopt an effective system of arbitration. I believe that there is a direction in which we can improve our system by enabling the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to hear appeals from the various State tribunals. Such a policy would, I think, be endorsed by this House, and if it had been submitted to the people at the last referendum I believe that it would have been sanctioned. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should not only sit to settle Inter-State disputes, but should also hear appeals from State tribunals affecting particular industries. That is the true line of advance for the Federal Legislature. The New Zealand experience, I may remind honourable members, has extended over twice the length of time that arbitration has been in operation in the Commonwealth. New Zealand has had twenty years' of conciliation and arbitration as compared with about seven years' experience under the Commonwealth. Moreover, the New Zealand Court is not hampered in any sense by. constitutional limitations. The Court has full power to arbitrate in whatever sense it may deem arbitration advisable. But the New Zealand Legislature, realizing the multitudinous industries operating in the' Dominion, and knowing how difficult it was for rural representatives to present their claims, divided the Dominion into districts. Separate awards are made in those districts in the same way as awards are made by the various State tribunals throughout Australia. But sometimes, after a district unionism in Australia will be award has been made, the Board, having finished its local work, undertakes the functions of a Court of Appeal. That is to say, on the application of unions of either employers or employees the Court considers what may be called an appeal from particular district decisions. There we have an example that might be followed in AusCommonwealth Arbitration Court could hear appeals from State tribunals. We have all the machinery that is operating under the Arbitration laws of New Zealand. By adopting this plan, it would not be necessary for the Commonwealth to interfere seriously with the work of the Wages Boards that are being conducted so successfully in different parts of Australia. What is now proposed, however, would, in my opinion, exercise an unwarrantable interference with State tribunals, which could only end in confusion, anddestroy a large part of the benefits which are at present conferred upon those concerned in production in this country. If we are to substitute for industries, as the term is understood under the principal Act, a system of craft organization extending over the whole of Australia, we shall accentuate difficulties that have already made themselves apparent. We shall strike a serious blow at production, and shall, at the same time, destroy the basis upon which the whole scheme of arbitration has been built up. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is well aware of the importance of our great water ways in the arid centres of this continent. Rural cultivators in those parts of the country are engaged in a great variety of industries. We have fruit-growing, dairying, agricultural work of all kinds, wheat growing, and wool growing. The occupations are so varied that dozens of workmen are employed for different classes of",24,Second Reading

In connection with the pumping schemes along the rivers, for instance, there are engine-drivers who have some knowledge of engineering, and who drive engines for a portion of their time, whilst the rest of their occupation is directed to some other class of labour. If this Bill be passed, and we carry out a system of craft organization instead of the present system of industrial organization, we shall undoubtedly strike a serious blow at our great producing industries, which, after all, form fhe backbone of this country, and without which there can be no strong secondary industries. connection with the application of rural workers for registration, the difficulties that control the industrial laws of the Commonfarmers have to encounter at present. I venture to say that the great majority of farmers throughout Australia are quite prepared to pay fair and reasonable wages. They are equally prepared to abide by the decisions of equitable tribunals as to the wages they shall pay. The farmers and the dairymen have greater confidence, I venture to say, in the Wages Board system as it operates in the States, because they believe that the Boards are composed.in a way which will bring about better results than would the Arbitration Court. The Wages Board system is less costly than the other. The parties have not to go to a Court for a judicial decision, but to men who understand the operations on each side, and meet together for the purpose of discussing, in a practical and human way, their differences, in order that they may arrive at a reasonable settlement. When this power was placed in the Constitution Bill by the Federal Convention, it was never anticipated that the work of the Arbitration Court would be directed to every small organization of industry throughout the Commonwealth. It was only intended that the great industries which operate more or less over the continent should be Supervised by the Arbitration Court, in order that disputes might be settled by that body in a way which could not possibly be undertaken by the State tribunals. to have the rest. time, we are not giving an opportunity to the States to develop their various tribunals. Victoria has over ioo Wages Boards; but the State Legislatures have found, from experience, that it is impossible to appoint Boards whose decisions will operate with fairness and equity over even a very small!. territory compared with this great Commonwealth. Even the States have found that Wages Boards operating over the whole of a State cannot do justice to particular industries by reason of varying climatic and other conditions. They have been compelled, in, some instances, to appoint, not only town Boards, but also country Boards, in order that decisions may be framed in a way that will suit the local conditions and be arrived at by men who understand each other, and have a practical knowledge of the difficulties of an industry. I hope that I know from experience, in the House will pause before it places in the hands of one individual the power to wealth. I believe that this measure, if passed, will be fraught with the greatest confusion and the greatest difficulty, and be found to affect very prejudicially industries .throughout, the Commonwealth. It is against the spirit of the Constitution, because it is destructive of that local control, that subdivision of effort, which we know is so valuable in the settlement of industrial disputes. I am sorry to say that there does not seem to be much prospect of carrying the amendment; but I trust that the Opposition will make a strong protest against this attempt to destroy the basis of arbitration, and to place in the hands of one man the control of the industrial affairs of the Commonwealtha power which will seriously militate against the successful operation of our Wages Boards, and will generally, in my opinion, strike a very heavy blow at the production of the Commonwealth. feel that this measure deals with the most important subject which can be brought before this Parliament; and though honourable members opposite have agreed that the Arbitration Court has proved a failure, and been a clog on the industries of the country, and is unwieldy and unworkable, I would, point out that the success of that Court means , more than the success of any other Court, because it operates under a new piece of legislation. Other Courts, such as the Equity, Divorce, Bankruptcy, and Criminal Courts, are institutions which have been handed down for perhaps hundreds of years; and laws relating to those Courts have been amended year after year until they have reached perfection.

I remember reading the speech with which the Leader of the Opposition introduced the principal Act, and I was struck with the sense of responsibility under which he addressed the House, and I hoped that he would live to see the successful working of the measure. I feel sure that he, like other honourable members, will not hesitate to give a vote to perfect any measure which will tend to bring about industrial peace, and promote the happiness of the people of the Commonwealth. The present Government were placed in power by the electors to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act where possible, with a view to bring about .that condition of peace and harmony which we all wish to see prevailing. We may have failed under the existing Acts to achieve our purpose, but we are only human. This Parliament has been charged by the Judges with not having given any lines of guidance to the Court to go upon. They have said, "" You have thrown at us an Act, and told us to carry out the dictates of Parliament, without laying down any lines on which we are to proceed."" I admit the charge. It is a serious handicap on a Judge sitting in the Arbitration Court. But I hope that the day is not far distant when the House will give directions to the Judge in many respects. I believe that the time has come when the House should pass a Bill providing that no more than eight hours shall be worked by any man in the Commonwealth. That would be a direction to the Arbitration Court in one respect. The Judges are clamouring for a direction as to hours of labour. They want some guidance from Parliament; not hours of labour should he restricted within certain limits. I also think that a Bill should be passed providing that no person shall be expected to work for wages under a certain standard, that is, laying down a minimum wage. That also would be a guide to the Judge. His Honor is quite right in saying that Parliamait throws all responsibility on the Judge, and takes none itself. We are open to that reproach, but I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall give the Judges a lead in various directions. Honourable members on the other side have complained greatly about one-man decisions. Here again I am in .accord with some of their criticisms. I be[24 OCTOBER, 1911.] Arbitration Bill. 1743 lieve that the basic principle of the Federal Arbitration Court was wrong. I hold that no one man should dictate the rates of wages, the hours of labour, in fact the whole industrial conditions for the Commonwealth. I consider that the Arbitration Court should be reconstituted, and include a representative of the employers and a representative of the employees. In that way we should strengthen the faith of the people in the Court. At present when a decision is given in the Arbitration Court, the employers say "" Although the Judge has the confidence of the people, because he is a. learned lawyer, and has held high positions, still he is not a business man. He has no sympathy in his nature. He is simply a legally-trained man to give a decision on the evidence put before the Court.'' The Court is, as I have said, different from all other Courts. It deals with live industries, with humanity; it does not interpret dead laws, but gives decisions which will affect the whole of the industries in the Commonwealth. The President of the Arbitration Court should not be called upon to be guided altogether by his own legal training and knowledge. I believe that in many cases even an employer's representative would give a fair decision when he had a case brought before him as an em : ployer, even though it was to advantage the employees, because he would look at the matter from a business and practical standpoint. He could help the Judge in many directions by the weight of his experience, and guide him in arriving at a judgment. The same thing applies to a representative of the employees. If an award is given by the Judge, the employees are not satisfied to the same extent as they would be if they were represented in the Court. It is necessary to go over the whole of the industrial and we should conditions to explain the conditions of an hesitate to provide that the industry. The Court takes a longer time than otherwise it would to come to a decision, and sometimes, unfortunately, the decisions have not been satisfactory. If we had two laymen to assist the Judge the position would be different. This is not a Court in the strict sense of the word. The persons who go before the Court are not criminals-no t men who have broken the law and been brought up to be tried, but men who come and submit to its judgment the conditions on which they are prepared to work in an industry. I agree with the members of the Opposition that no one man should have the power to decide the labour conditions for the whole of the Commonwealth. 1744 This Bill does not affect that. I believe that the Court would command more respect and confidence if it included representatives of the employers and employees, that is judging by the experience of New Zealand. It was the first country to adopt the principle of arbitration in these matters, and it still adheres to that principle. Its Court is composed of a Judge who is accustomed to discussing points of law, drawing up awards, and giving decisions, and two laymen, representing the employers and the employees. What has been the result of this system? land, to-day, the industrial system is proceeding very smoothly. There are any other country in the Southern Hemisphere. The progress of New Zealand has been very satisfactory under the operation of an Arbitration Court. Since the principle has been successful there, I believe that it will be successful here. It has been argued from the other side that if the Arbitration Court is going to deal with the whole of the industrial system, matters must get congested. appeal -d o not count. The employer takes no the work. Judge has power to appoint deputies in each State to assist him to carry on the work of the Court. I think it would be justifiable, if necessary, to create a Federal Court to deal with, for instance, the mining, textile, shipping, and coal-mining industries. If that were done, the work of the Arbitration Court would be facilitated and the progress of the Commonwealth assisted. honourable members, although they sit in Opposition, would be only too pleased to bring into force a scheme which would secure peace and harmony in the community. I was pleased to follow the honourable and learned member for Flinders when he pointed out the rocks ahead. I believe that he is very near the point. I believe that when we want to get the whole advantages of legislation we sail so closely to the rocks as to involve disaster to the measure. However, we are sent here, as a party, to give, if we can, the best legislation for the industrial class. Great exception has been taken to the word "" c r a f t .

The word ""industry"" could not cover the whole of the people or craft in an industry. Take, for instance, the boot trade. The engine-drivers ami firemen are employed entirely apart from the place where boots are manufactured. Although they are part of the industry, they are not in the industry, but outside of In New Zeait. They do not touch leather or handle goods. Their whole work is connected with the boilers and the engine, but they fewer strikes there than in are the mainspring of the industry, because they supply the power. Without their co-operation the industry could not exist pin of the industry? join the Operative Bootmakers Association. When operative bootmakers appeal to their employer for better conditions, or for a conference, the engine-drivers and firemen, as a Court of being few in number-perhap s three or four notice of them, but deals with the large Under the present Act, the body of men. Consequently, tlie engine drivers and firemen have been forced to form what is called a craft union. When the Operative Bootmakers Association seeks an award, they do not apply to the Court for any conditions which would benefit the lot of the engine-drivers and firemen. The latter are left completely out of consideration, although they form part of the industry. We cannot separate the craft from the inI feel quite sure that dustry-the two work together. separate them? certain purposes. The engine-drivers and firemen start an hour or two before the other men come in, and are at work after the men leave; they live in a different atmosphere compared With those employed in clicking, heeling, lasting-up, and other branches. The manufacture of bread, in most up-to-date factories, is carried on by machinery; and here, again, the men who fire the boilers and drive the engines are entirely outside the bakehouses. Their dirty clothes and greasy hands alone would render them unfit to touch the bread. Although they are an important part of the industrial organization, when the bakers go to the Court, the engine-drivers",26,Second Reading

The Arbitration Court, with as engine-drivers andfiremenemployed, for instance, in the boot trade. There is another illustration, in which Inter-State comvestigate the profits of an industry, and petition arises. In the freezing industry, which deals with beef, mutton, rabbits, and so forth, for export, hundreds of men are employed in the handling and stacking of the food and material; but the engine drivers and firemen, who look after the machinery that keeps the chambers cool, are really the principal men. If they stopped work, and the temperature was allowed to rise, there would be a loss of thousands of pounds. However, if the storage employees make a demand for increased wages or better conditions, they do not take the engine-drivers or firemen into consideration. Judge? by the High Court that the Judge of the Arbitration Court cannot add any claim to the case filed. He did so in the Broken Hill case, in regard to Sunday labour; but the High Court held that he had no power to do so. Because the men are not in the union of the industry, but belong to a sepavery nature of things, an employee in that rate craft union, they would have no claim before the Court. I remember a case in Sydney where the freezers got an award of the Court, and the whole argument against that award, which was one of increased wages, was that there was InterState competition with the shippers in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Queensland; and that, consequently, increased wages to the engine-drivers anclfiremenwould be unjust to the employers in Sydney. To get over the disability these men federated, having got as many Wages Board awards as they could, and still found themselves left out. They got an award from the Federal Arbitration Court, but lost the benefit of it, because the employers' associations in New South Wales and Victoria were separate organizations, and, in order to defeat the Act, they had not registered. On this ground, the Federal Arbitration C t was held to have o u r no jurisdiction, and the engine-drivers were denied justice. Surely it is only fair to so amend the Act as to introduce the word "" craft,"" and thus bring the engine-drivers and firemen within the jurisdiction ? we are asking. any trickery on behalf of the Government in trying to introduce the word "" craft."" There is no wish to do away with the Wages Boards, although, personally, I am the full powers of a Supreme Coiirt, may send for documents, examine books, and inthus be enabled to give an award fair and just to all concerned. With the Judge in the Arbitration Coiirt should be two men paid a decent salary, who would make' it their business to study the conditions of the various industries. These men, after having, as laymen, acted as the representatives of the employees, would not then have to look for work; they would be above that, because, for the time being, their position in the Court would be a professional one, and they should be independent. Under the Wages Board system, however, there is no power to send for documents and books or to investigate as to the capital invested or the profits made. The Board are confined to the evidence laid before them. And how is that evidence obtained ? A union selects one of its members because he is smart, capable, and straightforward; and, in all probability, he finds himself sitting on the opposite side of the table from his own employer. In the position is not a free man, because he knows that, after the work is finished, he must look tor employment. If he puts up a good fight for his fellow men, and obtains a decent award, it has, unfortunately, occurred in some cases, though I hope this is not prevalent, that he has been gradually shunted out of the industry. settled by compromise, because there is no one to give a final decision. South Wales, because the appeal is to Judge Heydon's Court. For the reasons I have given, the workers of New South Wales are not favourably impressed with the Wages Board system. There is another reason why we, on this side, do not raise any serious objection to the decision being left to one man. In New South Wales Judge Heydon settles all the disputes, there being no appeal from the Industrial Disputes Court. Mr Wade amended the Act, so as to make the decision of the Court final; and I think that Judge Heydon has been very successful, or, at any rate, there have been no protests raised. Under all the circumstances, we may, I think, congratulate the Opposition on their fair criticism.

No Court in the civilized world has so much depending on it as an Arbitration Court, which can keep the wheels of industry revolving; and, as this Bill is an effort their union, although the Act was based on to that end, the majority of honourable members ought to support the Government. If we give the engine-drivers andfiremen,for instance, no redress, they are in a position to bring about industrial chaos throughout the Commonwealth, seeing that they supply the power to every factory, every gold mine, and every coal mine. If the Federal Arbitration Court does not give them justice, we cannot blame them if they try to obtain it by brute force; and in the interests of peace and good government I trust the Bill will be passed. nearly all the strikes taking place to-day occurred after the Court had given a decision ? orable member is correct. There were no strikes in New South Wales under the old Act until the High Court decisions in the Brown case, and several other cases in the Newcastle district. When the Act was passed, the coal miners of New South Wales were the first to register; and, after -occupying the time of the Court for months, they got awards which they accepted as satisfactory. The employers, on their part, decided to test the legality of the decisions in certain of the cases. I make the assertion that under the Arbitration Act of New South Wales there were not, so far as I know, any strikes during the first three or four years; at any rate, there were certainly no strikes until the High Court decisions, one of which had reference to the common rule in the Clancy case. Was ari industrial agreement which the Court could not extend. decision of the High Court was that the Coal Miners' Union could not lodge a case on behalf of its members. the members were not in employment at the time, and the High Court could not help the position, though it was rather unfortunate. to the fact that in one case there; was cessation of work for a ""few weeks. point. decision that the union could not lodge a claim on behalf of its members. The men naturally asked what was the good of recognising a Court that would not recognise the recognition of unions. From that decision came all the disaster; and, unfortunately, there was a Government in power in New South Wales at the time which was antagonistic to arbitration, and did not amend or renew the Act. This was a temporary measure for six years, ancl it expired by effluxion of time, the unsympathetic Government making no attempt to improve legislation which we knew was only experimental. The result is that we have had nothing but strikes, locks-out, and general, industrial upheaval. Under the. circumstances, I hope the Commonwealth Parliament will doits best to make the Act acceptable to the people of the country. If the High Court declares the amendments ultra vires, ancl thus completely annihilates the whole principle of arbitration arbitration ! the principal ActI give the honourable member for Ballarat credit for the best intentions: and we know that the late Mr Kingston made strong efforts to procure an effective measure. If he were here to-day, I am sure that he would regret the many failures of the Act as the result of test cases brought before the High Court. Unless we can pass a Bill that will be beneficial and work smoothly we cannot expect either the industrial army of workers or the employers to be content. If we cannot secure arbitration for both sides on reasonable lines we shall have, to return to the old method nf settling disputes. I believe, however, that the position even under the existing law is infinitely better than it was under the old method of determining .industrial differences. Two orthree disputes have heen settled even by the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and in that way great industrial upheavals have been averted. For example, the Court, after some years of fighting, has settled the trouble in the boot trade in a way that has given,' I believe, satisfaction, whilst it has also effected settlements in regard to the pastoral industry and the seamen. In both those cases I believe the decision of the Court has given satisfaction.",29,Second Reading

I appreciate the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Angas, the honourable member for Flinders, and others who have dealt with the legal aspects of this measure. I believe that there is a great deal in what they have said. We can, however, only hope for the best. I trust that we shall give this measure a trial, and that when it becomes law, and a case relating to it is brought before the High Court, the Justices will not search section after section to ascertain what was the real intention of its framers, but will take the passing of the Act itself as an instruction that our intention is that crafts shall be recognised as part of an industry. -Perhaps one reason why honourable members opposite should seriously consider the passage of this measure has been supplied by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. His speech, interesting as it was, was full of expressions of the gravest doubt as to the value of the Bill. First of all, the honourable member said it was wrong, and more or less courting disaster, to increase the already overwhelming duties of a one-man Arbitration Court. Then he feared that there were rocks ahead by reason of the constitutional difficulties standing in our way. All these difficulties he fully realized, but he invited us to join with the Government and their supporters in an effort to make the the Bill as complete and effective as possible. My honourable friend spoke with a large experience, and the warnings given by him should of themselves be sufficient to induce honourable members to hesitate in their wild rush to pass this Bill. The honourable member for South Sydney realizes to the full the constitutional difficulties in the way, and the Opposition have been persistent in pointing out those difficulties to the Government and their supporters. We have asked them to realize that we are bound within the limits of the Constitution, and that therefore we have to consider the character of the measure that we can pass, having regard to those limitations. The Leader of the Opposition demonstrated the. revolutionary character of the Bill, and he and other honourable members have shown conclusively that the proposed substitution of the craft union for the unit of industry practically means the recasting of the whole of the arbitration laws and amounts to a departure from the fundamental principles of those laws. is proposed, or simply the inclusion of both industry and craft? cally a substitution that is proposed. The honourable member for Flinders ably and forcibly demonstrated that from a constitutional stand-point there are difficulties in the way of applying the craft principle to our present arbitration laws. The essence of the Constitution so far as this matter is concerned is contained in the provision giving us power to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitrationfor the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and the Court has already held, as the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out, that "" industry "" implies the relationship of employer and employee.'

Hence, there would not be in the ordinary course of affairs an ""industrial dispute"" as between the craft union, and the whole of the employers of Australia interested in any particular trade, unless it was artificially brought about, for the purposes of the Act. If there cannot be an "" industrial dispute"" in that sense there can be no constitutional power to deal with the dispute. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -What about tlie Employers Federation? name, a federation of employers, but, in fact, is representative of only a limited number of the employers of Australia. Thousands of manufacturers and other employers of labour throughout the Commonwealth, have their own individual interests, but there is no common interest ;is between the one employer and the other. In these circumstances, therefore, this Bill contemplates a total departure from *he fundamental principle of the idea of industrial disputes. It is looked upon with some degree of anxiety from this side of the House, because of that fact, and because also we believe that it subverts the Constitution. We believe that it destroys the scheme of the Constitution which gives to the Commonwealth certain arbitration powers in regard to large Inter-State matters, while it reserves full and complete power to the States themselves to deal with their own State industrial affairs. If this Bill is availed of to the fullest extent, by the whole of the crafts of Australia, then the power to deal with industrial matters is thereby transferred to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, what industrial power can remain with the States? If the fullest advantage is taken of this measure, and if there is a craft union in connection with every trade there will be practically no inquoting from Hansard now. dustrial power left to the States and the various industrial tribunals of the States will be mere obsolete machinery with practically nothing to do. This Bill, in such circumstances, would really subvert the Constitution, and must have the result of defeating the powers that were specifically reserved to the States themselves. It is difficult to see how it will be possible for an industrial dispute to arise as between the whole of the employers of Australia and the whole of the employees cf a particular craft, yet that practically imtralia ? possible condition of affairs is contemplated by this Bili. I am disposed to the view that, even if the Bill is passed, the awards must be confined to, and bind only, those employees who are contestants and parties to the dispute. Even if we assume that such an industrial dispute is technically possible, I am certain that the Bill is doomed to failure by reason of its utterly impracticable character. The Attorney General stated that one of the objects of the Bill-and he urged this very strongly -wa s to cause the doors of the Feder.il Conciliation and Arbitration Court to he opened wider and wider so that it would be possible for every trade union to go to the Court at its pleasure.

He said .that a differentiation in the rates paid to men belonging to the same union, but engaged in different industries, was calculated to cause serious discontent, and from that stand-point he urged the payment of a uniform rate. I can quite understand that, from a constitutional standpoint, the Attorney-General would do so. To have uniform rates for the whole of Australia, which is really one of the objects of the Bill, would be outrageously unfair. It would be unjust to fix for engine drivers, carpenters, plumbers, and others working at Kalgoorlie the same rates as were paid to similar artisans in Victoria or New South Wales, where the cost of living is 30 per cent. less. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Did the Attorney General suggest uniform rates ? his words.

The Constitution provides for absolute and complete freedom of trade throughout Australia. Section 92 enacts thatOn the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free. Section 51 empowers the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States, but with it must be rend section 99, which says that The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State, or any part thereof, over another State, or any part thereof. Again, section 51 empowers the Parliament to make laws with respect to taxationBut so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States. While there is the greatest doubt as to whether there can be an industrial dispute under this Bill, it is certain that the Court is governed by paragraph xxxv. of section 51, which empowers the Parliament to make laws with respect toConciliation ancl arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one Slate. Do honourable memAnd it cannot, as is frequently done,call to its aid the other sections of the Constitution referring to trade and commerce, because they specifically declare that there shall be no preference or discrimination. This is not a new contention ; it is an obiter dictum of the President himself. The constitutional pitfalls in our way are numerous. If , with craft organization, there are to be uniform rates, there will be no trouble, but the exercise of discrimination must mean thehampering of trade and commerce. The Bill makes it possible for every trade to register as an organization, and, as a consequence, all industrial power will practically be transferred to the Arbitration Court, which is against the scheme of the Constitution, and and danger.

It has been found impracticable to impose uniform rates, even for Victoria. Except in a few industries, awards are confined to branches of industries, or to particular localities. In regard to engine-drivers, there have been appointed in Victoria Boards, one relating to gold-mining and coal-mining, and another dealing with all the factories throughout Victoria. It is competent for the last-named Board to determine that an engine-driver in one factory shall be paid a particular rate, and an engine-driver in another factory a particular rate; but coal-mining engineers and goldmining engineers are dealt with by a particular Board of their own. In this connection, a differentiation in the rates takes place, and a higher rate is paid for drivers in charge of winding engines, because they carry human freight. There are two Printer's Boards in Victoria, one of which deals with the cities and towns, and the other with the country. We have the same experience with regard to saddlery and sawmilling. The power which the Governor in Council possesses of taking away certain powers given to one Board and transferring them to another, for the purpose of adjustment, has been exercised in two or three cases, such as that of the Carters Board, where quarrymen carters were attached to the Quarrymen's Board; and pastrycook carters were attached to the Pastrycooks Board. In this State Wages Boards have the power to deal, not only with industries over the whole State, but with the same industries, in detail, in various portions of the State where different conditions exist. The Prime Minister and the Attorney General spoke in high terms of the success of our Arbitration Court. 1 am prepared Sir Robert Best. to say, at once, that any success that has been achieved by the Court has been achieved through the distinguished ability of its President, and that the work has been done, as far as he has been able to do it, ably, thoroughly, and conscientiously. The Attorney-General went on to say that ""no testimony could be than that all the unions are trying to get into it . "" Will my honourable friend think for a moment why this Court has become so remarkably popular? In existing circumstances, we cannot blame the unions for their anxiety to get into it as soon as possible. We cannot ignore the circumstance that the President of the Court has seen fit, no doubt in the conscientious discharge of his duty, to make generous awards so far as the workers are concerned, based, of course, on the present highly prosperous condition of Australia. I am not attempting to cavil 'at what the learned President of the Court has done; but the fact remains that, as Artemus Ward once said, there is a great deal of human nature about men; and consequently, as it has been the universal experience to secure very generous treatment at that Court, there is naturally a great desire to get into the Court. That fact has been brougnt about by reason of the -personnel of the President of the Court. The Labour party, however, has not been always so anxious to have these cases dealt with by judicial tribunals, nor have these Courts always been so popular. I can refer to an unfortunate experience, so far as the Industrial Appeals Court of Victoria was concerned. In one case, an appeal was made to it from the Artificial Manures Board determination, which awarded 40s. 6d. to certain workmen for a certain class of work. The Court was presided over by one of our leading Judges, and a man equally as conscientious as is the President of the Arbitration Court. He saw fit to reduce the award from 40s. 6d. to 36s. The result was that he was most maliciously attacked in labour circles, and an agitation was started for a repeal of the Act. The Judge threatened to resign his position; but I believe a compromise was brought about whereby those good things which were enjoyed by him were to be shared in turn by each member of the Supreme Court bench. However, as a consequence, this industrial tribunal became quite an unpopular Court. We, therefore, must not be led away by the passing popularity of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. If one or two adverse verdicts or awards were given, the probabilities are that the experience of the Victorian Court would be repeated. I say this, because there is always a band of agitators ready to misconstrue what is done, and whose aim in life is to create discontent. Arbitration Court was great, and the anxiety of all of us was to secure a tribunal for the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes, and to put an end, so far as we possibly could, to locks-out and strikes, the experience in connection with that Court has not been so completely satisfactory as one could wish. In fact, the experience of Arbitration Courts generally has caused us to think very seriously whether our ideal has been realized to the extent that we could have desired. its limitations. such limitations in New Zealand, and I desire to tell the honourable member the result of arbitration proceedings there. That country, so far as its general economic conditions are concerned, is on very similar lines to our own. tralia. wards, if the honourable member so desires, to deal with our experience of arbitration in Australia. Let me first deal with New Zealand. I regret to have to say that tliere is a certain section in the community, whom I call political unionists, who are all for arbitration so long as the awards are. in their favour, but so soon as the awards are not in their favour, no one is stronger in condemnation of arbitration than they are. That tendency has gone so far that these tribunals have been ignored, and in a number of cases awards have been defied instead of being generously accepted as it was anticipated under the provisions of the arbitration scheme that they would be. inember see that they are human beings ? it, but arbitration cannot bind one side and not the other. The idea and scheme of arbitration is to arrive at a peaceful settleWellington North, when asked by a represenment by a determination which both sides are in honour bound to accept, whether it is for or against them. The following interesting extract from the New Zealand Dominion of 7th October, 1911, has come under my notice:A STRIKE COMING. BIG INDUSTRIAL UPHEAVAL. While the conception of the wrote the article.

199,Sir Robert Best,"But honorablesome time, and that he was prepared to speak on the subject at his next election meeting on Monday. Labour, said Mr Carey, had a constructive policy on the subject, more far-reaching than a mere change of the personnel of the Court as indicated by the Minister. Too LATE. MrM . J. Reardon, Labour candidate for the 'Hutt seat, was more communicative. "" It is not the Act so much as the Judge of the Court that is creating the hostility that is now apparent,"" lie said, in answer to a question. That is to say, a Judge who honorably, honestly ancl conscientiously does his duty is at once condemnedUnfortunately the Minister has discovered the true position too late. The agitation from the Labour side against existing conditions has now developed until it has become an agitation against arbitration. Primarily it was an agitation against the decisions of the Court. From this it has been an easy transition to the conclusion that arbitration is not as good as the strike, and in view of the fact that the majority of the workers in New Zealand have had no practical experience of the strike for the last twenty years, the new creed is being swallowed. I am satisfied that nothing that is now done by Parliament or by anybody else will stall off the impending disaster of a strike. My own opinion is that it will come about the end of the present year, and that when it does come it will not be among those who have condemned arbitration so much, but among men who have given the present Court several trials. This view ns to the early occurrence of the strike is not shared by a good many in the Labour movement. They think it is rather farther away than that-probabl y five or six months hence. An arrangement has been made to place the decisions of the Trades Conference before the Prime Minister, but, unfortunately, owing to bis illness this had to be postponed. I had been entrusted with the task of dealing with the grievances of the unions against the President of the Arbitration Court. I felt that the task was an extremely painful one, but still -we are nil agreed that it is one that has become necessary. WhatI think is due to happen is a very serious industrial upheaval, and then it will be for the Parliament of this country to determine whether the Act will be retained for the protection of unskilled workers, or whether the action of those who have endeavoured to wreck the arbitration system is to be allowed to prevail. Of. course, we realize that there are certain unions that can act unitedly nnd independent of protective legislation. They can have their agreements observed by resorting to force, but there are many such organizations not so situated. If these workers had not the course of law behind their industrial awards, free contract would prevail as between master and employed And this would be lo the detriment of the employees in those trades. _ My opinion about the cancellation of registrations of the unions is that the unions who take this step ought to have some consideration for the classes of labour that are not independent of the law, and that while tbey are warranted in withdrawing from the Act, since they feel that they can do better outside its Sir Robert Best. scope, they are not warranted in creating aa impression that the strike is preferable to arbitration for New Zealand experience is in the contrary direction. I hope that the Arbitration Act will be retained, but whether or not any alteration is now made in tbe personnel of the CourtI am satisfied that we cannot undo the mischief that has been done in the. last three years. This cannot be undone by anything short of a strike, and a strike will surely come. The fact is that every union in New Zealand is distrustful of Judge Sim, and having once made up their minds about this, they look round for a better method. Then they hit upon the strike. The strike notion has got into their blood, and nothing we can do can prevent a strike from happening. He goes on to show that Conciliation Councils are of no value. What, however, I want to urge, is that amongst the Labour party in New Zealand, the value of arbitration settlements-and I regret that it should be so-ha s been seriously shaken. The Act came into force some twenty years ago, and worked very well for a while, but latterly there have been such protestations in favour of striking that the whole value of the legislation has been doubted. Indeed, it became necessary that an Act should be passed to strengthen the law. The new law came into force in 1908. It was, however, defied within twelve months. The case which arose out of the defiance of it was, I think, either the case of the miners, or one in connection with the frozen meat industry. In the latter case, the slaughtermen were paid something like £ 1 for 100 freezers. They were able to earn something like £ 5 or £ 7 a week. When the award had nominally expired, but was in actual operation, and before a new award had been made, the slaughtermen determined on a strike, insisting on the payment of 25s. per 100, which would enable them to earn something like £ 7 to £ 1 0 per week. The point that I am urging in this connection is that this is typical of several instances where strikes have lately taken labourers and women place in New Zealand, and where parties have not been prepared to abide by the award of the arbitration tribunal, which was established with the express purpose of avoiding strikes. In New South Wales, the arbitration system came into operation in 1901, and within twelve months there was a serious strike. ber quote the case of a strike under the Commonwealth Act? with the principle of industrial arbitration, and the reluctance of political unionists, when awards are given against them, to accept the wages paid under those awards.",35,Workers Tired Of The Court Labour Leader S Opinion

The alteration of the definition of "" industry "" to include trades and callings will not, in my opinion, in any way reduce the trouble. The Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, I may say, some of the State Arbitration Courts, appear to have created difficulties instead of removing them. The Prime Minister said that but for the Arbitration Court there would have been many more disputes; but I do not agree with him, seeing that disputes have been created purposely to bring questions before the Courts botli of the States and the Commonwealth. the Arbitration Court. the compliment that the people in America paid, when, in order to start a cemetery, they had, in consequence of the healthy climate they enjoyed, to kill a man The dispute in the timber trade in Western Australia was referred to the Arbitration Court of the State, but the decision was not accepted by the men. They held out for months, ancl agitators were sent all over Australia, in an endeavour to prove that the trouble extended beyond the limits of a State. VVe all know that, when the matter was referred to the Federal Arbitration Court, no redress was given; and, in the end, an amicable arrangement was arrived at between the employers and the employees, who have been working very well under it ever since. I can also instance the arrangements made from time to time between the employers and the lumpers at Fremantle, and similarly in the mining industry at Kalgoorlie, without resort to arbitration. We may say that there has been industrial peace at Kalgoorlie from start to finish, so far as the miners are concerned, simply because both sides have the common sense to pick out their best men to meet together and fix up some reasonable settlement somewhat on the lines of the Victorian Wages Boards. are mutual arrangeinents made without reference to any Act of Parliament. In the past employers have been compelled to obey awards, but I know of -no means by which employees can be compelled to obey them. The latter generally obey an award if it suits them, ancl at no other time; and I do not think there is any honourable member who could suggest how compulsion could be exerNo doubt industrial cised. It is the old story of the man who said, "" I do not believe in arbitration, for did we not refer our case to arbitration, and it went against us?"" There is a general feeling amongst the men against both the State and Commonwealth Arbitration Courts; and there is no doubt in my mind that the Wages Board system, as adopted in Victoria, is the best possible means devised up to the present for obtaining industrial peace. In the case of the Wages Boards, so much can go unsaid, because eacli side sends, representatives who thoroughly understand the subject, whereas, when they go before a Judge, both sides are practically fooling that Judge, and whoever can fool him most gets the best decision. As one of the present Judges of the High Court said, when speaking of the Inter-State Commission, "" it must be recognised that legal knowledge is not necessary, or is not the best knowledge, for the settlement of commercial propositions."" I should like Parliament to be able to approach a question of this kind without any quibbling, and devise some means, not only for settling disputes, but for suppressing the men who live by creating trouble between the two parties. but, perhaps, the honourable member speaks with authority. Throughout my life, I have always endeavoured to work amicably with employees, and have succeeded fairly well. If we are to have industrial peace, we must find a way to suppress those irresponsible men who try to bring themselves into notoriety at the expense of the trade unions or the employers. That class of agitator or person should be treated somewhat in the same manner as are offenders under the Licensing Act. Those who deal in liquor have to do so within certain hours and .under certain conditions, and if they transgress the law they come under its penal provisions. I fail to see why the agitator, who is outside the limits of the ConAll these ciliation and Arbitration Act-wh o runs, as it were, a little union on his own-shoul d not be treated just as the sly-grog seller is.

They have to spend a great part of their lives in study, as many honourable members know from personal experience, and until they have passed examinations and shown their competency they are not allowed to be members of the profession.

I know of very few unions in which numbers are not considered before competency. I should like to see competency made the key that would open the door to the joining of a union. Under the old English system, it was impossible for a man to join a guild unless he could produce his indentures, bearing the signature of his late employer, to prove that he was a competent tradesman. Indeed, in those days a man -could not obtain a position in London without producing his indentures. There is a time in the life of every young fellow when he thinks that he is hardly dealt with because he is compelled to stick closely to his calling, trade, or profession. Parents have a lot to do to keep their sons up to the mark, so far as their trade or profes[64] sion is concerned, at a certain period of their lives; but in nineteen cases out of twenty these young fellows live to thank their parents for having kept them up to their work. If parents would adopt the same attitude nowadays, then young fellows, having completed their course, would I am not going into join unions, ancl the unions would be looked upon as something worth registering and worth having in Australia. But what is the position to-day ? In many cases, a union will demand the reinstatement of an In Vicincompetent man, or a man who has broken the working rules of his employer. I know of an instance where it was part of a man's work, one Sunday out of ten, to attend to some horses. on Sundays. There were about ten drivers in the employ of the firm in question, so that each man had to go on duty about once in every ten Sundays, and he took the Much has pay for that Sunday work. One of these men, however, left the horses without food one Sunday, and they were going out on the Monday morning without food or drink, when this neglect was discovered. When the man offended in this way a second time, he was discharged; but his brother drivers demanded that he should be reinstated, and that the man who dismissed him should be put off. That is the sort of thing that brings a union into disrepute. I may mention that the overseer was net put off, and that when the bulk I should like to of the men, other than the drivers, employed by the firm heard the facts, tney said that the offending driver should be sent about his business.

Owing to special circumstances workers in different industries in Australia, often receive higher rates whence it could be pumped back to the of pay than would be awarded by any Arbitration Court. Having been through the Broken Hill rush, ancl also the Kalgoorlie rush, I can speak from experience. In the first-named case men were able to leave Adelaide at night, and to arrive next day at Broken Hill, where they found waiting them work for which they received three times the wages that were offering in the city from which they came. No award made by a Court could meet special circumstances of that kind. The position was the same at Kalgoorlie, where, perhaps, the highest wages ever paid in Australia, were paid in the early days. Men could earn there within a fortnight of their arrival sufficient to pay for their passage from the eastern States to Fremantle, ancl their railbut one of their number has admitted by way fare thence to the gold-fields. I hope that we shall have many such rushes, for I like to see new districts developed, and new towns springing up. Men so situated would not be so foolish as to say, "" VVe are governed by an award made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in Melbourne."" With them it would be a question of supply and demand, and they would have a right to take advantage of the position. a strike involved.

I fear that we are legislating on the foundation of our continued prosperity. We have enjoyed a time of great prosperity,, and long may it continue; but with a bad season or two there would be nothing to refer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The attempt now being made to control from one centre all the industrial' concerns of this great continent is something like trying to establish a successful irrigation scheme by running all the waters of a State into one given place, instead of impounding it in the several districts where it could be successfully used. Half-a-dozen, rivers might be running into one stream, and on each of them a good irrigation system could be established. But what would be the position if we passed an Act of Parliament declaring that the people should divert .all the water to one centre points at which it ought originally to have been conserved, and at which it could be advantageously used? That is really what the Governments are trying to do in regard to industrial legislation. They are trying to bring the whole' control of the industrial life of Australia into one given centre, whence it is to be pumped out again all over the Commonwealth, and sprinkled over every State. I should not be surprised to see in one of our comic papers a cartoon depicting, a huge Commonwealth squirt spraying industrial awards all over the State. The Government and their supporters would have us believe that this system is to becarried out without cost to those concerned,, way of interjection that it cost £30,000 to settle one industrial dispute through the medium of the Commonwealth Conciliation, and Arbitration Court. Surely so expensive a system cannot be beneficial either to employees or employers. The best system to adopt is that of State control as far as possible.

The debate has shown that it is ten to one that the amendments proposed by the Government in this Bill are unconstitutional ; and it is twenty to one that they will increase trouble, ancl, in fact, create chaos. But Australia expects us to devise means to obtain industrial peace; and, if Ministers sincerely desire to clo this, they will put aside all party feeling, and propose a system for the settlement of disputes which will benefit this great country.

I can claim to be as much a legal authority as are the honourable members for Ballarat, Flinders, and Darling Downs, and I have a number of law books from which I can quote, just as they have clone.

The honourable member for Echuca adorns the assembly in one way, the honourable member for Maranoa adorns it in a totally different way.

As I told the honourable member for Richmond, there is no fun in going out on strike. The working man has nothing to lose but If you take the his labour, and his labour in 999 cases out of 1,000 means bread ancl butter for his wife, his children, and himself. It puts me in mind of a cartoon I saw once depicting a splendid dinner inside an alligator's mouth, with the words, "" Take it, or work."" If the man had taken it, the jaws would have come down, and he would have lost his life. The worker has to lose practically all that he has with which to buy food for his wife and family. Once a worker loses that money, it is gone from him for ever. There is no hope of his ever making it up, and so the honourable member for Richmond had better disabuse his mind of the idea that workers go out on strike for the f u n of the thing. There is no f u n in it for either side. I shall read a statement of the decisions of the High Court in regard to the measures passed by this Parliament for the alleviation of industrial trouble throughout the length and breadth of Australia, in order to let the people of the country know what the position now is.

There is the position in a nutshell. Who was more disappointed at the judgment in that case than were the workers in connection with the agricultural implement inthem to have more pints of beer and to get dustry? Some of them went so far as to say that it was a put-up job. Now, there was no job about the matter at all. What was done was done in all good faith by the Government of the day; and, as I said before, we got legislation by the High Court. The workers of Australia are beginning to be alive to the fact that there is something radically wrong in the state of Denmark when we pass legislation here and the High Court knocks it out. One can get on a platform and speak for hour after hour, but one cannot make them understand the position. knock out the Act, but merely interpreted it. able member to tell me what the High Court did with the Acti f they did not knock it out. It is no good, arid when a man. is knocked out he is no good; that .is a certainty. The Chief Justice winds up a judgment with very few words, ancl that puts the kibosh on the Act. Whether it is knocked out or knocked in or knocked endways, it is out all the same. I am not complaining, I repeat, about the High Court, but the people are. I venture to say, in passing, that when we take the next referendum and distribute the debate on the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, we shall dance to' quite that one cannot hurt a man worse than Notwithstanding what by touching his breeches' pocket. That is just what the High Court is doing, and it is one of the best object-lessons that the people can have before we take the next referendum.

It is, gratulate honourable members opposite upon having their old friend back in harness. He is one of the best organizers we have ever had in the Commonwealth, and is paid by the Employers' Federation.

This is the gentleman who gained notoriety a few years ago in Victoria by telling the people of Lilydale that for theworkers marriage was a luxury, and that the employers were not going to pay for married. If marriage is a luxury, then God help this country. The letter reads, as follows :THE CENTRAL COUNCIL OF EMPLOYERS OF Oxford Chambers, Bourke-street, Melbourne, 21st October, 1911.

Until the creation of this Federal Parliament with a Senate and a House of Representatives elected by those of the full age of twenty-one years, when did we have representative government in Australia ? When did we see or hear the voice ot the people until that event? But in ten years from the inception of Federation what did we find ? We found a whole reversal of form in favour of this dastardly Labour party. I have related times without number how Labour members were treated in Queensland fifteen or sixteen years ago. To-day the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches, ancl have what no previous Federal Government had, ancl that is a majority of Labour men in each House of this Parliament. At the last election the people spoke with one emphatic voice. It was no oneState more than another which spoke; all the States spoke, ancl even Conservative Tasmania sent more than her quota. transgressing. I was carried away by my feelings. These are the resolutions to which I have referredThat the Prime Minister and Parliament be advised that this Conference of delegates, now sitting, representing the Employers' Federation of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and West Australia, are opposed to any further amendment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as expressed in tbe Amending Bill now before the Federal House, on the following good and sufficient grounds :BeforeI read the grounds of their objection I would mention that this very Bill has brought together the whole of the manufacturing class from one end of Australia to the other. We are slowly consummating what the honourable member for Flinders suggested should come, and that is that all the employers should be united on one side and all the employees on the other. Then, I venture to say, we shall have compulsory arbitration of the best type. The resolutions continue{a) That the proposed Amending Bill endeavours to give the Court (consisting of one Judge only) autocratic powers over the freedom of both workers and employers unknown in any British community, and instead of bringing about conciliation and peace, must only intensify the friction existing between the parties before the Court. That the establishment of Wages Boards in Victoria now spread to all the other States, and the abandonment of Compulsory Arbitration Courts in certain States. They do not say why Courts were abandoned. They were not abandoned because they were not workable, but because it was thought that in many instances the worker was getting too fair a deal. The Governments of the clay brought in amending Bills to do away with the Conciliation and Arbitration Acts, particularly in New South Wales. In Western Australia a Government went out on a Wages Board system as against compulsory conciliation and arbitration, ancl what clo we find? To-day they are floundering about for another policy. vernment of New South Wales repealed the Wages Board Act, then? the Government had of passing legislation, let alone repealing any ? it? of any Government, not even the Commonwealth Government; and I cannot say what is proposed.

This is shown in the hundreds of trades now either placed, or about to be placed, under Wages Boards in the different States. The satisfaction with their results, in the public mind, is best shown by the refusal of a large majority of the voters against the further extension of industrial powers to the Federal Parliament at the late Referenda.

I do not know whether they think we are foolish, or never read, when they put such stuff as that before us. It may suit their purpose for a time, but it has no more influence on me than water has on a duck's back.

The first judgment of the High Court to which I desire to call attention is that given in the case of The King v. Barger. an action by the Customs authorities. that occasion saidIn determining whether a particular law is or is not within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to enact, regard must be bad to its substance rather than to its literal form. The circumstance that an indirect effect may be produced by the exercise of an admitted power of legislation is irrelevant to the question whether the legislature is competent to prescribe the same effect by direct law. So are the motives which actuated the legislature and the ultimate end desired to be attained. So long as the limits of the power of taxation are not transgressed, Parliament may select the persons or the things in respect of which the exercise of power is to operate. If the control of the domestic affairs of the .States is in any particular forbidden by the Constitution, either expressly or by necessary implication, the power of taxation cannot be exercised so as to operate as a direct interference with those affairs in that particular. The selection of a particular class of goods produced in Australia for taxation by a method which makes the liability to taxation dependent upon conditions to be observed in the industry in which they are produced is as much an attempt to regulate those conditions as if the regulation were made by distinct enactment. . . . Properly construed the Act imposes taxation upon implements which are not in fact manufactured under described conditions to be ascertained in prescribed modes, but does not render any conditions unlawful. It is, consequintly, not a regulative Act which a State could pass in the same terms, but an exercise of the power of Excise taxation, and, if passed by a State Legislature, would be invalid. As the Act merely imposes Excise taxation, section 55 of the Constitution is not contravened. « The proviso does not discriminate between localities at all, but describes standards applicable to Australia generally, irrespective of its division into States or parts of States, and does not offend against the prohibition contained in section 51 (ii.) of thc Constitution. Per Isaacs, J -The discrimination forbidden by section 51 (ii.) of the Constitution is between localities considered and treated as States and parts of States, and not as mere Australian Never in the whole localities or parts of the Commonwealth considered as a single country. This was in reference to an Act under which it was desired to secure, as a quid -pro quo for increased import duties on harvester machines, that fair ancl reasonable wages, adjudged by the Court, should be given. The case was not struck out as the honourable member for Batman said, but the award was not allowed, it being practically held that the Act was idtra vires. In the Engine-drivers' case Mr Justice Higgins saidIt is quite clear that the learned President, in inquiring into the existence of such an industrial dispute as is necessary lo giving jurisThe Chief Justice on diction, is no more bound by the ordinary rules of evidence than he is in hearing the merits of the dispute. In proceeding on prohibition, the evidence taken before the Arbitration Court may, of course, be brought before this Court on affidavit in the ordinary way, but the Court could not act upon any evidence which would be inadmissible under the .ordinary law of evidence. Mr Justice Higgins expressed himself in no uncertain language with regard to the engine-drivers, with the result, that it was held there was no jurisdiction, as was also held in the case of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and that of the union label. If there was one question more than another on which this House was less divided, it was in regard to the union label. The Attorney-General of New South Wales",49,Australia

I shall not read these judgments, except in the case of the Seamen's Compensation Act, which I think ought to be placed on record, as it was one of the measures that was passed at the close of last session.

The arbitration that we have known in Australia until now has been, both in thc .States and in the Commonwealth, on the lines of industrial organization. The -disputes that have been dealt with have been those between employers and employees in homogeneous industries. -many cases the organization, so far as the employees have been concerned, has also been on the lines of craft unionism, the members of a craft being all engaged -in the same industry. Arbitration requires -the existence of two parties having a matter in dispute between them and a third party as arbitrator. On one side there must be the employers, and on the -other the employees. To secure the representation of both,"" there must be a common basis of organization. Then an arbitrator can hold level the scales of justice. The Government, however, propose to depart widely from the present system, and to follow the suggestions of counsel for the claimant in the case of the Federated Engine-drivers that the community of interest is not between those producing the same commodity, but between those employed in the same class of labour. His point was that if there was community of interest between the employees, the Court need not consider whether there was community of intere-t between the employers. But arbitration with only one party before the Court would be impossible. Uncler such circumstances, theJudge, instead of being an arbitrator, would be a dictator, and legislator. The industries in which engine-drivers are employed number pretty well all in the Commonwealth. If a Judge were called upon to make a determination regarding the -wages, hours, and conditions to be observed ""throughout Australia, for engine-drivers he -would have to investigate the affairs of all those industries. That would be a terrific task to set any one man. Mr W. H . IRVINE -As a judicial inquiry, it would be impossible. any man could undertake it at all, howdifferences could be ever willing and able. Yet that is the task which the Government proposes to set We have been trying to find out the the President of the Arbitration Court. The question must also be asked : Would the Court, in making an award, be able to discriminate between one State and another? The honourable inember for Maranoa desires that unions shall not be put to great expense by arbitration proceedings, but if will be immensely extended, so that they must take longer, and cost more. Consequently, the cost of getting an award will, in many cases, be infinitely more than in the case which the honourable member cited a little earlier this evening. In debar us from doing the right thing? should, but I draw the honourable member's particular attention to the fact that the President of the Arbitration Court, in the judgment which he recently gave in the shearers' case, said that he had grave doubts whether it was possible to discriminate between one State and another. Consequently, if any award was given in an industry of that sort, he would probably think it incumbent upon him to grant an absolutely mechanical wage from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. The Sydney Worker of n t h October published the whole of his judgment verbatim. According to that report, he saidAs a. result, the grounds for the discriminaAssociation. He argued tion in favour of the pastoralist on the south border of the Murray against the pastoralist on the north are so elusive and unsubstantial that 1 must refuse to make the distinction in rates for shearing. If any discrimination in rales ought to be made as between States, the rate ought to be lower for Queensland, for the sheep generally are in Queensland easier to shear, and the tallies are greater for a day's work, and, owing to the prevalence of dry weather in the shearing months the average earnings from start to finish are liigher. He practically said, therefore, that had'it been in his power to grant discrimination in the shearing rates, he would have reversed the decision of his predecessor, and fixed lower rates for Queensland than for Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. He went on to sayThe decisions of the High Court, however, raise a doubt whether, even if a discrimination would be just, I have power to make a",52,Australia

Consequently, if the engine-drivers went to the expense of going to the Court and getting an award under this B ill , unless he made an absolutely mechanical award from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, the President of the Court himself has said that, in his opinion, it would in all probability be unconstitutional. member for Flinders contended that it was decided that such a discrimination was permissible in the case of the woodworkers. M.r. GREENE -I am simply quoting the statement of the Judge of the Court for what it is worth. ' Mr W. H . IRVINE he was forced to that conclusion by the decisions of the High Court. quoted what he said. honourable member for Maranoa to watch that the Government do not, by passing this B ill , hold out to the workers, to whose interests the honourable member would never do anything detrimental, a bait which will lead them to apply for awards at far greater expense than they have to go to now, and obtain them only to find that the whole basis of the measure is unconstitutional. The Government should be caref u l to see that that does not happen. If the recent referenda had been carried, this Bill would have had a much more serious effect than it probably will have now; but we must not lose sight of the fact that the Government intend to re-submit those questions to the people. If they do get the powers asked for, of course the Bill will operate. At present there is no power to make a common rule, and, consequently, no award is binding on those who are not parties to it . If those industrial proposals, as submitted at the referenda, are subsequently adopted by the people, and the power to make a common rule is given, we shall have 'an infinitely worse position than that which obtains to-day. As soon as a common rule can be made, those who are not parties to an award will nevertheless be bound by it. In industries which are scattered all over Australia, whilst under craft organization there is a community of interest among the employees, there is none among the employers. be. interest can there be between the mine owners of Western Australia, the sawmillers of Northern Queensland, the butteiv makers on the Richmond River, the soapmakers of Sydney, and the jam-makers of Hobart? Can the honourable member show me any basis of organization covering industries so widely dissimilar and scattered as they are? Whilst there is a basis of organization as far as some of the employees, such as the engine-drivers, are concerned-the men being all of one craftthere is of necessity no such basis for employers. The honourable member for Cook pointed out last week the difficulty that exists. There is no desire on this side of the House to interfere with organizations of employees as such. All that we are contending for is that an award of the Arbitration I doubt whether Court shall be confined to an industry. Suppose that an industry such as jam making applies for an award. There is nothing whatever to prevent the secretary A t any rate, I have for the engine-drivers appearing before the I would ask the Court and putting in a claim on behalf of the members of his union, provided, of course, that we make it legislatively possible. The same may be said with repect to the saw-milling, the freezing and other industries. I am sure that every one who had the pleasure of listening to the honourable inember for North Sydney was very pleased to have the benefit of his experience, But at the same time. I do not think that any honourable member who has spoken from the Ministerial benches has in any way answered the case which the honourable inember for Cook put before us. workers in New South Wales would not approve of what the honourable member for Cook said. for Dalley stated that the greater number of the employees in New South Wales do not approve of this particular form of arbitration. outside one organization they do not approve of it . availed themselves very largely of the facilities given to them under the existing industrial law. nothing. faith which the honourable member for North Sydney has in the old New South",53,Australia

During the first two years of its operation, up to the 30th July, 1910, 103 unions registered uncler the Act, and in two years they secured no fewer than 100 determinations. eighteen Wages Boards sitting at that particular moment. Sometimes there were as many as twenty-eight Boards sitting-at one time. not register uncler the Act. the largest unions refused to register, that magnificent record was enabled to be put up in less than two years, whilst the Arbitration Court in more than three years only dealt with In the first place we have to remember that the Arbitration Court in New South Wales was dealing with one State only. Here we are dealing with the whole of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, we are adding fo the difficulties of the Arbitration Court six-fold, because we have six States to deal witli. W'e are giving to its jurisdiction a much greater scope, and once we permit this particular class of organizations to register and appeal to the Court, then we shall practically drag in every industry throughout the Commonwealth. TheI f general prosperity industry with which my constituents and I are more particularly concerned is the rural industry. And great as the difficulties are in any organized industry confined tq great centres of population-to mining, or Numerically, the unions have any industry of that scrt-onc e we bring under the operation of this law, agriculture, dairying, horticultural pursuits, and Whilst during three years and so on, we shall add, and add enormously, to the difficulties. Honourable members think, I presume, that if this Bill be passed into law the Rural Workers' Union, which is being formed from one end of the Commonwealth to another, will be one of the first unions to apply for an award. A t No ; the Court was stuck the present time. I repeat there is no power to make a common rule. Perhaps we need not be very much alarmed, because there will be a necessity to cite before the Court practicjally every farmer 'throughout .he Commonwealth. But the moment my honourable friends get their constitutional proposals accepted ""by the country the Court will have power to make a common rule, ancl then, of course, the award will apply Government to rural workers from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. When the question of including the rural workers was considered here last session, I opposed the proposal. I clo not think we have yet devised a system of arbitration whicli is applicable to the rural industries. I do not think that we have yet obtained a system which is sufficiently flexible to meet the varying needs and conditions, and the various circumstances in which they are carried There were on. Again, I do not think that any system has yet been devised which is sufficiently elastic to meet the various seasonal changes. system. idea, whicli I do not want to take up time in giving to the House to-night.
