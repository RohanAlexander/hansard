I desire to know if the honourable gentleman first inquired whether Mr Mills has not some contracts with the mine owners, and whether by the suspension of the mail and shipping services the honourable gentleman is not assisting the owners as against the strikers? anything except that which I was convinced was absolutely necessary. It was represented to me that the carriage of the mails must cease unless I agreed to what was proposed. what my honourable friend has indicated until I was sure that it was imperative. newspapers that the Postmaster-General has agreed with Mr David Mills to make a concession in regard to the running of the mail services to Tasmania. to ask the honourable gentleman whether, in making an arrangement with the contractors to run the steamers from Melbourne to Launceston twice a week, he consulted any of the representatives of Tasmania in this House, or the Senate, in reference to their convenience to return home, or whether he made the arrangement without regard to those who are best qualified to judge in the matter? honourable friend the same answer as I have just given-that representations were made that coal could not be obtained; that the only arrangement which could be made for the carriage of any mails was on the lines I have indicated, and that, as it was imperative, I agreed to make a concession. The application had to be decided before I could discuss it with the representatives of Tasmania. ask the Postmaster-General whether he told Mr Mills, when he asked for a reduction in the mail service, that -there was plenty of coal procurable' in Tasmania at a low price, that there was no strike in the State, and that the ships could be supplied if they wanted fuel to maintain the regular service? coal was discussed, and it was pointed out people who know-that its steaming qualities are of such a character that the company have to mix other fuel, with the supply already in hand in order to get across.

I do not desire to agree lightly to the recommittal of any item, but that relating to hay and chaff is certainly of great importance. opens the door to speculators. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Quite so. The matter is of considerable importance, since some of the States can supply all the fodder required in the drier parts of the Commonwealth, and it will, at an early date, receive the serious consideration of the Government.

Bill presented and read a first time. Debate resumed from 14th November (vide page 6033), on motion by S IR That this Bill be now read a second time. introducing this B ill , the Treasurer appealed to honourable members to as far as possible curtail the debate, and having regard to the importance of the matters to be considered by us before the close of the year, I am prepared to do my best to give effect to his desire. A t the same time those who differ to some extent from the proposals of the Government must necessarily point out some of the reasons why they think that a better method of attaining our object than that provided in the B ill could be adopted. I presume that every honourable member is in favour of encouraging the local production of iron from the iron ore of Australia. On that point, I am sure, we are unanimous; the only issue between us is as to the best methods by which our object can be accomplished. The Bill now before us provides for the payment of a bounty on iron produced in Australia from Australian ore, and, f a i l ing the adoption of this proposition, the Government prefer the imposition of a duty to an attempt on' the part of the Commonwealth or any of the States to carry on the industry. That being so, we are entitled to examine the reasons that have led the Government to take up this attitude, and to inquire whether a better and safer method could not be pursued. I wish at the outset to make it clearlyunderstood that I am as anxious as is any one to see at the earliest possible moment iron produced from our native ores, and that I am quite prepared to pay the price. I feel, however, that the scheme favoured by my party is the best that could be suggested to secure that end. In dealing with this question, I shall endeavour to avoid the great array of figures which has been submitted from time to time in connection with our consideration of a similar proposition. I certainly prefer the payment of a bounty to the imposition of a duty for the encouragement of the industry, since the people as a whole have to contribute of iron are not called upon to bear the whole of the increased cost. It will readily be recognised that a duty might penalize the users of iron without giving them any corresponding advantage; and, for that reason, I emphatically favour the bounty system. But I propose later on to submit an amendment to allow the Committee, when dealing with the B ill, to make this iron industry a national one. And for this reason : 1 think that the iron industry will for many years to come in Australia be confined to one or two manufacturers. I think that whether the work be taken in hand by a State, or by the Commonwealth-prefei ably by the Commonwealth, so far as I am Concerned-o r by individuals, the advantages will be confined to one or two States. The rest of the States will be more or less penalized. When dealing with the question of nationalization from a Commonwealth point of view, I expect that I shall be met with the objection from legal meml>ers and others that it is beyond the powers of the Commonwealth Government to carryon any industry. A t any rate, that contention has been made again and again. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is not the most serious objection. from the honourable member. I believe that he is in dread of a nationalization proposition of any kind rather than inclined to raise the constitutional difficulty. Mr W. H .

The objections to nationalization will undoubtedly be principally two. One is the constitutional objection. I shall not deal with that, because I do not feel capable of doing so. All that I wish to say regarding the con-, stitutional objection is this-that the High Court, so far as I can read its judgments, has laid down the principle that until somebody is injured there is no constitutional difficulty at all. If this Parliament comes to the conclusion that it would be a good thing for Australia to nationalize the iron industry, then this Parliament ought tp proceed to do it ; and if the High Court should afterwards say that the action of this Parliament was unconstitutional, it will be for Parliament to consult the people, and to ask for greater powers from them to enable us, to the best of our knowledge and ability, to carry on this industry on national lines. The opposition to national enterprises of this kind, from the earliest times, has proceeded from people who have said that a country cannot carry on an industry as well as a private individual can. orable member's opinion.

133,Mr Fisher,"Yes. The extractbers are aware, that country leads the world in the production of iron and steel. It is to the United States that we look to ascertain the great progress that has been made in this direction. Since my boyhood I have heard it referred to as a "" triumphant democracy."" We have been told that there is. nothing but a triumphant democracy in the United States, and that industries there are advancing by -leaps and bounds. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is a triumphant plutocracy. triumphant plutocracy, so much so that the Parliaments of the United States, both Federal and State, and the people themselves, are jigld firmly by the throat by financial kings and magnates. This state of things is due to hesitation on the part of the people to embark upon State enterprises, and thus prevent these powerful individuals from crushing them. The honourable member for Flinders may shake his head, but I say that if the State had had control of the public necessities of the United States, the power of the financial kings would have been as nothing compared with what it is to-day. We should not have seen its powerful President travelling from place to place telling the people that something must be done to insure that the laws of the country shall prevail over the will of a few men. . if anything should be a guide to us, it is the experience of that country. Those who have preceded us in the public life of Australia are deserving of all credit for having reserved to the State so many of these public necessities. They did good work in that connection, and they deserve more credit than we do, because they undertook it at a time when it was practically new in the political history of the world. We, with all this experience to guide us, hesitate to do things which we plainly should do. We say that State enterprises have proved more successful than have private enterprises. We say that they have provided the individuals engaged in them with higher remuneration than have private enterprises, and yet we hesitate to embark upon them simply because .we fear that some ill may result from what may be regarded as a socialistic proposal. I trust that this Parliament will face the difficulty, and will adopt the amendment which I have the honour to submit. In Committee we can so arrange the Bill that the Executive Government will have power to take .over the iron industry and proceed festo of the Prime Minister at the end of to produce in Australia that iron which we so urgently need and which we hope to see produced here at the earliest possible moment. I move That the following words be added, "" and the Committee on the Bill be instructed to incorporate in the B ill provision for the nationalization of the iron industry."" gratulate the honourable member for Wide Bay upon making his first important appearance as the leader of the Labour Party in championship of the principle which distinguishes the Labour Parties of Australia from all other parties. There may be some members of the Labour Party who have not accepted the principle of Socialism, but there is no doubt that, taken generally, the planks of the Labour Parties of Australia do affirm that principle, and the leader of the Labour Party in this House has, I think, with candour and clearness made his appeal to honourable members to rest upon that principle. The history of the Bills dealing with the encouragement of the iron industry which have been before this Chamber is worth looking at for a moment, particularly with a view to explain exactly the position which was occupied by members like myself upon previous occasions. When in 1902 a proposal was made to initiate a . system of bounties in order to establish the manufacture of iron, the position of free traders in this House was that they looked Surely upon the fiscal policy of. the then Government as one which was not in accordance with the policy upon which that Government had gained the approval of a majority of the electors. When the then Prime Minister went before the electors his policy was one of revenue without destruction, which was clearly a revenue Tariff policy, with incidental merciful consideration to protected industries. But when the Tariff was submitted the policy of the Government went far beyond their election utterances, and consequently we free-traders in opposition felt that the Ministry had no proper warrant for this scheme, and accordingly adopted every legitimate method of stopping its progress. In 1903 the present Prime Minister went to the people on a policy of fiscal peace, and when the Manufactures Encouragement Bill was brought forward in the Parliament of 1903-6 we regarded its introduction as a breach of faith with the electors. 1903. He went to the country upon a policy",23,William Lyne

135,Mr Reid (East Sydney) [4.7],I con,24,William Lyne
136,Sir William Lyne,When was that?,24,William Lyne
137,Mr Retd,"I am referring to the maniwhich may briefly be described as one of fiscal peace and preferential trade. We complained strongly that the Government who had gone to the electors on a policy of fiscal peace should break that fiscal peace in order to introduce a very important proposition, as this undoubtedly is. We, on that occasion, did all we could (o stop the measure, believing that still there was no proper electoral warrant for it. In this Parliament of 1907, we are in a different position, and I have been the first to acknowledge it. There are some of my friends whose idea of policy is to conceal defeat when you sustain it, and to persist in misinterpreting what seems to be a pretty plain decision of the electors when it is opposed to your own convictions. I do not think that that is the proper attitude to take, and, therefore, when this Parliament assembled, I frankly acknowledged that in spite of my labours, which have extended over a pretty long political career, the people of Australia had returned a very large majority of declared protectionists, and that the Parliament then elected .was in a different position from previous Parliaments in this respect. I cannot now pretend that there is no electoral warrant for a proposition such as this. I cannot pretend that there is no electoral warrant for protective duties. I do say, however, that the length to which the Government have carried their protective duties' is, so far as we can express an opinion, absolutely beyond the wish of the electors. gentleman cannot say that. . ment, because no one can prove it. The qualification which I make, and which I think is a proper one, is that, so far as one can form an opinion, I believe the Government have put the protective duties up to a pitch which would not meet with the approval of the majority of the people of Australia. But I think it would be wrong of me to say that, so far as the principle of protection is concerned, it has not been accepted and endorsed, greatly to my own regret, by a majority of the people of this country. This House, therefore, is in a different position in these matters. I feel no sense of personal grievance at all at the introduction of a Tariff proposing higher protective duties. I feel that Ministers have in no sense betrayed the trust or confidence of the electors, as I certainly did feel on the previous occasions to which -I have referred. It would, of course, be easy for me to display a' vast amount of physical energy and rhetorical emphasis in denouncing protection as I have done during the whole course of my public life. When I declared for a policy of fiscal peace at the last election, I can' assure my honourable friends it was not in order to do an injury to the cause of free-trade. On the contrary, to be perfectly candid, my belief is that if I had gone in for the other policy, I should not have occupied any other position than that which I occupy to-day. I feel that on the free-trade issue, I should have signally failed as I did fail on the issue of fiscal peace. I recognise the decision of the people, and the only appeal from that decision is not to the members of this House, who must be bound by their honourable pledges to .their electors, but to the electors of Australia. The only way in which the verdict of the electors can be reversed in any honourable sense is by another verdict of the same electors disposing of the last they gave. I do most earnestly hope that the issue as embodied in the Tariff may, in some generally accepted form, be put before the people'in some definite way, free from the heat and inflammation which is engendered by a general election, and free from the distractions which the public mind must experience when the people are suddenly called upon to decide a large number of important issues. I do, therefore, hope that the Federal Parliament will adopt and give effect to the principle of referring the Tariff we are now considering to the people of Australia. right honourable gentleman like it? those who are in favour of the Tariff ought to be anxious to get a title deed for it. to the electors at the next election. people were shown to be in favour of the Tariff, the whole matter might well be considered settled for ten years at any rate. We should get fiscal peace on a stable basis-the basis of the declared will of the people upon that definite issue, without any disturbing issues being mixed up with it.'

In view of that notice of motion, I cannot allow that Honourable members, in the exeraspect of the question to be debated on the present occasion. principle underlies the rule on which your remarks are based, and that principle is that the House would have an opportunity COOK -These, are not to discuss the motion of which notice is given.

I do not wish to trouble you, sir, with any ruling upon the point, as I have practically said I did not feel .it all I wish to sav in this connection. I might, however, be allowed to answer the question put by the honourable member for Wimmera. The statement of the honourable member involves two suppositions, neither of which is clear; the first being I thought the honthat, if a man is returned to pass a protective Tariff, it is within his rights to pass a prohibitory Tariff; and the second, that the verdict of the people given at an election at which all sorts of inflammable questions-goin g so far even as the Emerald Isle-were raised and mixed together, is to be taken as the deliberate expression of their views upon a certain point, without regard to all the other distracting issues put before them. One of the disadvantages of election decisions is that they enable one party to say that the people have decided one thing, and another to say that they have decided some other thing.

I very much prefer the bounty to the duty system, and when the Bounties Bill was before the HouseI supported it, because I look upon bounties as giving a number of advantages which do not attach to the imposition of protective duties. leader of the Labour Party himself suggested a few moments ago, bounties come from the national pocket, and I think that a national policyshould be supported by contributions of that kind. The policy of establishing a possible iron industry upon a sound footing is a national one, and nothing could be more appropriate than that the burden of it should fall upon the community, as it will do if the money comes from the Treasury. When protective duties are imposed, the burden of them -if , as I think, there is a burden, though some say that there is not-falls , not directly upon the community, though it may do so ultimately, but upon those who encourage the protected industry by buying its products. They have to bear the burden of protecting it, by paying higher prices, or by taking goods which are not equal in quality to the imported goods. on iron would not increase the price of machinery very much, because the cost of the raw material is very small in proportion to the cost of the finished article. in the problem of price that it is the most difficult thing in the world to work it out. Prices fluctuate from causes quite beyond our knowledge. fluctuating. difference in proportion between the cost will sell at a reasonable price, and mainof raw iron and the value of a finished tain quality. Amongst the difficulties of machine is so great that the 10 per cent, price is the elementary difficulty of quality. duty on raw iron is not a very big burden. As the Tariff puts up the prices of that it is? It is one of the curiosities of cumstances of the great masses of the this Tariff, although I admit that there people are such that they cannot buy is a business reason behind it, that whilst articles which are priced highly, and the we are prepared to put a duty of 40 or shopkeepers and the manufacturers have to 50 per cent, on slops-a n industry which come down to the level of the consumer has an ugly history in all countries, and by putting the quality of the article down certainly not one of the leading industries to suit him. He is getting his clothes at, of a country, as the iron industry would be-w e have a policy of 10 per cent, duties in the case of the latter. I am sure that it is far more arduous to establish in Australia a national iron industry than to establish a clothing factory, as there is a greater number of difficulties to be encountered. explain the difference. In the one case the articles could be made' here, in the other case they could not; and therefore the duty would have to be paid by the people here. so to some extent, but the reason for imposing a duty of 10 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, is obvious. Iron is one of the necessities of every manufacturing industry in Australia, and if the Government were to levy a-duty of 40 per cent, on the article it' would cripple all trie industries which they desired to encourage. perhaps, in the fact that the people who are most desirous of seeing the duty imposed have said that 10 or 12J per cent, is quite enough. pressed by Mr Sandford. I made use of it, and it seemed to be supported by solid facts, but history seems to teach us that matters are not so simple as that enterprising gentleman thought they were. A high protective duty on iron would cripple every industry in Australia which used that article. That is another reason for adopting a bounty system. Amongst, others, a bounty system has the advantages, that we know how long the bounty is to be paid, how much is to be paid, and how much an individual has to do in order to earn any part of it. All those things are, to my mind, advantages.

One objection to the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay is this-that he does not propose at all an immediate remedy for this trouble.

If vou are in favour of a Government Post Office or Government railways generally, you are called a Socialist. Why? These public utilities were all established long before Socialism was ever heard of in Australia. There is a broad ground upon which Socialist and anti-Socialist can act side by side, in which they can use the methods and the great powers of the State in the direction of helping forward the advancement of the people. But the line of distinction is this-the Socialist is looking forward to the time when the State shall be the sole employer in Australia, whengether in the service of the Government. That is the development to which he looks forward. The anti-Socialist, willing to work with himto use the power of the Government for the general welfare,, wishes to use the power of the Government not to disturb private enterprise, but in order to promote opportunities for private enterprise."" What is this Tariff-wha t are all these hundreds of duties which our protectionist friends are proposing with so much satisfaction? Why are they so rejoiced in their success? It is because they believe that they are conducing to the establishment of industries which will flourish in the future under private enterprise. It is because they believe in assisting industries which .are established, that they are strengthening the opportunities, widening the scope for the expansion of private enterprise. That is the line which divides the Socialist from the anti-Socialist. The Socialist cannot claim every wise exercise of the powers of the State in reference to railways and workshops as if they were the product of Socialism. They were established by anti-Socialists in order to promote the welfare of private enterprise over the length and breadth of the land.

There would be The right honourable member's remarks one industry only, and there is no room in would have been not less interesting, and this country for more than one.

But the right honourable gentleman does not understand the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay. That honourable member proposes to nationalize this industry; but the right honourable member for East Sydney does not attack that proposal. Instead, the right honourable member tells us that the honourable member for Wide Bay believes in nationalizing all industries, and that, if all industries are nationalized, there will be but one employer, that independence of spirit and private enterprise will be destroyed, and all mankind reduced ±0 one dull uniform drab level-that the happy, peaceful and delectable state of things we have known so long will be gone for ever. I am not going to follow the right honourable member into a morass ; I decline to be bogged. All that the honourable member for Wide Bay said was that he was in favour of nationalizing the particular industry referred to in the B ill ; and I decline to follow the right honourable member for East Sydney in a disquisition on Socialism. The right honourable member has got it into his headand, apparently, nothing will remove the idea-that Socialism means, in some mysterious way, a levelling of all persons to one uniform height-that we are to wear a uniform dress, be for ever sunk in slavery, and unable to choose our own employment. In short, the right honourable member, picremarks, I propose to say nothing at all might have allowed me to finish what I was saying before he asked me that question. We propose to establish a monopoly with State money. A monopoly, from my point of view, is not an undesirable thing only because the industry has. arrived at the stage when it is most easily and advantageously ""taken over by the State. But to deliberately hand over so many thousand pounds a year for the purpose of creating a private monopoly would be very foolish, and even criminal. Individualists, if there be any such in this House, must regard a monopoly with a certain amount of horror. They believe in free competition, and it is obvious that monopoly and free competition cannot co-exist. Where monopoly is, there competition is not. The people who ought to be against monopoly tooth and nail are not the Socialists, but the individualists. Yet the individualist does everything he can to foster monopoly, and we are asked now to vote a very large sum of money for the purpose of creating a great monopoly. In these circumstances-becaus e I believe that the iron industry is one of those primary industries upon which, as is admitted, other industries in a very large measure depend, and as we have in this country everything necessary for carrying it on-w e should do well to start it at once upon a healthy and ' proper basis.

266,Mr Hughes,"The honourable membersav to-day that the nationalization of the coal mines in Australia is not within the sphere of practical politics, I am very much afraid that he does not realize the nature and extent of the present dispute in Newcastle. If we look forward a few weeks, we shall , see, if the dispute continues, that not a wheel will go round.* There will be no communication between one port and another, or between one part of the continent and another. Everybody will feel the consequences, and why ? Because private people own the coal mines, and seem to imagine that they have a perfect right to decide upon what terms the people of the country shall get coal, or whether they shall get it at all. fixing the price by the world's markets? tries which are at the base of all other industries are so important to the country that, not for the sake of the workmen or the employers, but for the sake of the whole body politic, it is necessary that the State should have control of them, for without them we cannot carry on any other industries. I will take the definition given by the right honourable member for East Sydney. He said that there is a common vantage ground upon which Socialists and anti-Socialists can stand-suc h an interference by the State in industrial mat-' ters as will further and foster private enterprise. I take it that the nationalization of the "" all rights are reserved."" coal industry would be such an interference. Such a disturbance as now exists certainly does upset and retard private enterprise. The same thing, although not, perhaps, to the same extent, applies to the iron industry. It is an industry that deals with one of the primary products-on e of the assets of the country. Every pound of iron that is taken out of the ground leaves us a pound poorer. The metals have always been regarded as a prerogative of the Crown. Even when the land, which primarily and theoretically still belongs to us, was parted with, the precious metals were not alienated with it. It is very proper that we should have control of these things. The' right honourable member for East Sydney admitted that the iron industry might be a monopoly, but said that we could deal with abuses as they arose. If there is one thing more than another that is becoming clearer every day, it is the fact that we cannot deal with abuses as they arise. Any attempt to deal with an abuse after it has reached a certain stage meets with opposition from the most unexpected quarters, and is regarded as an attack upon vested interests. Only the other day the attempt to enforce an Act of Parliament, not much more than twelve months old, was met with a torrent of protests and no small abuse. I refer to the efforts to enforce the Excise Tariff Act. When, in attempting to enforce any Act, we run up against important interests, we are told that we are disturbing industry, attacking wealth, and driving capital out of the country. The right honourable member for East Svdney said something about the ideal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and asserted that the honourable member would nationalize everything. I have no idea of what the ideals of the honourable mem&ei for Wide Bay are; they are matters which mainly concern himself, but I do know that he has this afternoon moved an amendment to the effect that, in his opinion, the iron industry should be nationalized. If we are going to take every man's ideal as permeating and affecting any amendment he moves, or any action he takes in this House, that practice ought to apply all round, and we should consider also the individual ideals of honourable members opposite. I have here a little book called Liberty and Liberalism, by Mr Bruce Smith, formerly a member of the New South Wales Parliament, and now member for Parkes in this House. The book was published some time ago, and member is about to quote a book that he does not understand. all right-a t least, I can read it. Of course, there is a lot of it, and I do not propose to read it all. It embraces some 683 pages. Part of it was written by Mr Bruce Smith, part of it by Mr Hume, the historian, part of it by Lord Macaulay, part of it by Green, part of it by Erskin'e May, and part of it by a great number of other gentlemen. I propose to read one of the very small parts written by Mr Bruce Smitha part in which, abandoning those convenient and pleasing bladders upon which little boys swim out to glory, he ventured upon his own. In dealing with the Factories Act of, Victoria, he saysThe following is that summary :-No one under thirteen can be employed in a factory. No female can work more than forty-eight hours in a week. No male under sixteen can work more than forty-",34,William Lyne

No girl under sixteen can be employed between the hours of six in the evening and six in the morning. No boy under fourteen can he employed between the hours of six in the evening and six in the morning. No woman shall be allowed to clean such parts of the machinery in a factory as is mill-gearing, while the same is in motion for the purpose of propelling any part of the manufacturing machinery. No one under eighteen shall be allowed to work between the fixed and traversing parts of any self-acting machine, while the machine is in motion by the action of steam, water, or other power. No person employed in a factory shall be permitted to take his or her meals in any room therein, in which any manufacturing process or handicraft is then being carried on. Upon these statements the honourable member for Parkes makes these very pertinent and sapient remarksA volume might be written upon the ignorance of the political science, the ignorance of human nature, the misconception of legislative effects, and the indifference to commercial interests, displayed in the measure of which this is but a short summary. Here is an Act of Parliament -which absolutely prevents little boys under thirteen years of age from working in factories, which deprives girls under sixteen years of their inherent right to work in factories more than forty-eight hours a week, and which decrees that, under no circumstances, must they work between the hours of six in the evening and six in the morning. Why, curfew, in the worse of its days, was not like this. This Act strikes a blow at the commercial interests of Victoria. The honourable member saysA volume might be written upon the ignorance of the political science, the ignorance of human nature, the misconception of legislative effects, and the indifference to commercial interests. These are his ideals. He addsShortly restated and further summarized, they are as follow :"" No parent, however poor or dependent, shall be allowed, even under the most favorable circumstances, to derive any monetary assistance from factory work performed by his or her children, unless they are over thirteen years of age."" Here is an interference by (he State. Here are poor, unfortunate persons, who are absolutely deprived of the right to put their children in factories and to live upon what they earn-a n everlasting burning shame and discredit to a civilized community. The writer proceedsEvery citizen of the Colony of Victoria is -saddled with a proportion of an enormous expenditure for maintaining a large staff of inspectors to secure a close observance of the provisions of the Act. I do not know how many inspectors are employed, but evidently there is a very large number. The writer further statesLastly, but paramount in importance, every woman, and every male and female under sixteen, is deprived of the liberty of determining for himself or herself the times and extent of work which he or she shall adopt in the pursuit of a livelihood. honourable member quoting? The ideal of the honourable member for Parkes is that which obtained in Lancashire prior to the enactment of factory laws, when little children were permitted to work at the loom, not eight, ten, or twelve hours a day, but until they fell down from sheer physical exhaustion. Had it not been for the introduction into England of factory laws, Lancashire would have been depopulated. The honourable member's ideal is a condition of things in which men and women are treated worse than cattle. No man is at liberty to take a horse with a sore shoulder and drive it through the streets. No man is at liberty to starve an animal. But, according to the honourable member's ideal, he may do all these things so far as children and men and women are concerned. I do not know what is the ideal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, but I say that it would be a very poor one if it were not preferable to that of the honourable member for Parkes, as set forth in his book. If time permitted, I could take from this interesting little volume those other remarks which were written by the honourable member. I omitted to say previously that a portion of this remarkable work was written by Professor Huxley, and still another portion by Herbert Spencer, who, I learn from the preface, upon one occasion actually wrote a letter to the honourable member congratulating him upon being, with himself, one of the few who were standing by the great cause of individualism. Herbert Spencer is dead. The honourable member alone remains. His ideals have been steadily attacked, so that to-day there is in this House only one other man who will rise and defend the views which he entertains. Throughout the whole of Victoria not even two men can be returned to Parliament who favour the perfectly damnable doctrines advocated in the book from which I have quoted. The ideals of individualism ! They are ideals, indeed ! The ideal of the Labour Party in this connection is simply that",35,William Lyne

I have known Parliaments to be run on lines that were not dissimilar. I say that since we have affirmed in the most positive manner our adherence to this principle, and since we have with us no less a person than the right honourable member for East Sydney, who approves of the new protection, it does not lie with him or any other supporter of that principle to say that the proposal now made is an invasion of the sacred right of the individual to do as he pleases. We say that we will establish this industry. Whether we shall be able to do so or not is a mere question of business. In establishing this industry one But by State may be successful, or may not, but that would apply to private individuals in just the same way. The right honourable gentleman has said that railways in this The new procountry are not run on business principles. I venture to say that they are not, if bybusiness principles he means taking the last drop of blood out of the unfortunate It is the regulation of prices employees, or exploiting society. But I do say that, as a general thing, the very excellent men who occupy the position of Commissioners of Railways Tn Australia do Under the new protection he can run the railways under their control very He cannot pay much on business lines, and are, on the whole, making a very good thing for the country out of the business ; It involves a complete whilst the railway employees, as a general rule, are treated tolerably.

How has the threatI am not now saying ened great railway strike in England been averted? It has been by the providential intervention of the Government, and a. threat to enforce latent powers, thus compelling the railway companies to pay certain, wages and charge certain rates and fares for freights and passengers. Is there any man who will say that the nationalization of railways is not a live question in England? If the threatened strike had occurred, is it not patent that the nationalization of the railways would have been a very live question there?

No doubt some honourable members have inside information as to what the millennium is. I have not. I know nothing at all about it. WhatI say is that it is not the Labour Party that proposes to establish the millennium by Act of Parliament, but many other parties. For instance, what do the prohibitionists say? the brotherhood of man. That is new, and copyright. tells me that the millennium is the brotherless advantageous than those which now hood of man. I am glad to know it. Perhaps the honourable member will tell us where he got that by-and-by. No one will say, however, that the brotherhood of man is an ignoble ideal. I thought it had been taught for 2,000 years past, or .nearly so, without, however, producing very much result upon mankind. That the party to which I have the honour to belong has taken some practical steps to make the brotherhood of man possible without at the same time committing physical and industrial suicide is something to its credit. There are several prohibitionists in this Parliament who say that if we pass an Act of Parliament to prevent the sale of liquor mankind will be transformed. Yet when the Labour Party propose to do anything by Act of Parliament they say 11 is absurd. What are we to say of our Factories Acts, our Health Acts, or our free education system, but that they are all endeavours to change the nature of mankind by Act of Parliament? This very assembly is a living proof of the fact that we do believe mankind can be altered by Act of Parliament. As a matter of fact, we know that mankind has been altered by Act of Parliament. tion is abroad in the land, and nearly every man and woman in this country now takes an interest in politics. Things are not as they used to be, and the legislation [218] of to-day, as a consequence, takes more intimate notice of "" the man down below."" Only the other day, for the first time in the history of mankind, it was definitelydecided that a man has a right to receive more than enough merely to keep him from starving. Mr Justice Higgins has said that he has a right to receive, not merely enough to keep hima right that is accorded to every horse, sheep, and bulThe lock in the country-bu t enough to keep himself and his family, and to sufficient even to enable him to put a little by for a rainy day. We have achieved that decision by Act of Parliament, and I will say that if we never do anything more we have at least proved that Acts of Parliament can do something to alter the lot, and so the nature, of mankind. To my mind it will be to the benefit of society at large for the State to establish and undertake this necessary industry. If it is not undertaken by the State, it will become a monopoly, and we shall, before very long, be confronted with the necessity of taking it over, under conditions piesent themselves. We may, as time goes on, be called upon to still further spoon-feed the industry, if we leave it in private hands; but if we make it a State concern, and put the right man at the head of it, we shall make a business success of it. I believe that every industry in the country exists primarily, not for those in it, but for the whole body of the people. Therefore I support the amendment. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [5.41J. I understand that at this stage we shall be in order in discussing both the provisions of the measure and the amendment of the leader of the Labour Party. I do not propose to occupy much time in discussing the proposal for the nationalization of the iron industry, because, while all the questions related to the proposals of the Labour Party for the nationaliza tion of industries are extremely interesting, I regard the nationalization of this industry as entirely beyond the reach of practical politics, especially towards the close of a session such as this, when we have such a heavy weight of work to get through before we can conclude our labours.

I may mention that towards, the end of my remarks, which I will endeavour to make as concise as possible, I shall have to return to the question of monopolies in connection with this particular proposal, and suggest what I consider the legitimate lines on which the State can and ought to control and regulate monopolies. As the subject had been debated here so often and so ably, I felt that it was due, not only [ 2 , 8 ] -2 to the older members of the House, but also to myself, that I should ascertain the arguments which had been used on If the State various occasions, and I have read every important speech which has been delivered here, so that I do not propose to ask honourable members to listen to matters which have been practically threshed out. But there are one or two aspects which it seems to me, approaching the subject at that point at which it was left, have not yet been thoroughly and clearly determined. We are asked by this B ill to sanction the expenditure of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for the encouragement of manufactures. The long title of the -Bill is very vague and almost misleading ; but I take it that it is intended for the encouragement or establishment of what may be known as the iron industry. It would seem I am entirely in favour of establishing, on a thoroughly sound and permanent basis, I shall have to ask the question a comprehensive iron industry. I agree with all that has been said-and the strongest thing that has been said by those who have preceded me in this and other debates tion the establishment of the iron industryis almost essential. Therefore, I shall not waste time by going into that matter. I propose to deal with the particular proposals which the Government have submitted. We ought to approach this as a simple business proposition. We ought to look at the proposal apart from any sentiment. We ought to look at it also unhampered by any narrow limits of expenditure so far as it is within our finanI certainly sav cial power to do so. We ought to regard this as a great national problem. I am glad to get Putting on one side party views or differences, we ought to regard ourselves as being charged with one of the most responsible and serious duties which have ever devolved upon any Parliament. The first question we ought to ask ourselves, I think, is "" What do we want ? What is it that we I . will pass on intend to establish?"" It is all very well to speak of the establishment of "" the iron industry."" That may mean much or little; it may mean half a dozen things or any number of them. Do we mean by the term merely that we want to establish the industry of making pig iron from Australian ore ? I submit that it would be most futile to attempt to do that by itself. Mr .WEBSTER -And also to establish the industry of making steel. Mr W. H . IRVINE I submit that it would be quite useless to spend any money on the mere productiono f pig iron.

We have to say what we intend to include. We intend obviously, and the Bill clearly points it out, to include rolled iron and steel. But the goal which I submit we ought to keep before us is the establishment of an industry which, commencing with the production of crude ore, should include all of what may be called the simiple processes of iron production. It should include not merely the smelting of the ore and production of pig iron, but also the rolling of iron and its conversion into steel, and especially should it include all the plant and appliances necessary for the manufacture of that which of such productions is perhaps in greatest demand in this country-stee l rails. proposal is to be considered not only from the point of view of having a comprehensive industry, but also from ihe point of view of mv friends in the Labour corner. employment if we only establish an indusiry which will perform the first two or three processes of iron making. quire to establish is an industry which will ;;ive us a considerable population, who will ' « trained to the historical manufacture of : ion from the earliest, simple processes, to those highly complicated scientific .processes of the present day, involving not only a large expenditure of capital, but the employment of a large number of highly skilled operatives. supply Australia not merely with pig iron, i oiled iron, bar iron, or sheet iron, but also with steel of the best quality for the manufacture of rails and girders. The first point which we ought to get clearly fixed in our minds is, What is the end we propose 10 gain by the expenditure of a large capital? I have been obliged, professionally and otherwise, to make myself more or less acquainted with the processes of iron making. My reading on the subject, and the information I have obtained from others who know much more about it than I do, teach me that we can only succeed with a very expensive and complex plant which can be worked under economical conditions, that if we attempt to perform some of these processes separately, as a rule, we shall be doomed to failure. We must have the highest skill, the largest and most complex plant, and perform as many of the processes as we can. very large production. Mr W. H. Irvine. Mr W. H . IRVINE Yes . It is quite true that if our efforts, were confined to the production of pig iron we should practically have no demand for what we produced. We import between 30,000 and 40,000 tons of pig iron. 50,000 tons. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Comparativel y a small quantity of pig iron is imported. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think it is more than that. Mr W. H . IRVINE We need not quarrel about the exact figures, as that is practically of no consequence. The real question of consequence is that the manufactures of iron are imported to the value of nearly £2,000,000 . The are valued at nearly £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , but the imports of manufactures and everything else are worth nearly £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Mr W. H .

We are not dealing with harvesters, What we reor agricultural machinery and implements generally. They belong to a totally d if ferent class. the steel employed in such manufactures. Mr W. H . IRVINE C e r t a in l y ; but, as I have endeavoured to point out in dealing with the iron industry, we may leave out of account manufactures the cost of the We desire to raw material of which represents an infinitesimally small proportion of the value of the complete articles. The iron industry relates to the primary processes of iron production, and the imports of its primary products represent something like £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Sir WILLIAM LYNE £ 2 , 1 8 1 , 0 0 0 . Mr W. H . IRVINE I have gone rather f u l l y into this| point, because it ! leads directly up to that which I am now about to put before the House. I wish for the moment to leave entirely out of account any existing iron works. Let us assume that there are no works at Lithgow or elsewhere in the Commonwealth, and, viewing the proposition from that stand-point, ask ourselves what would be a reasonable step to take. In the first place, we should contemplate obtaining a plant capable of a daily output of some hundreds of tonssuch an output will be necesbary ultimately with a to supply the wants of Australia-and of being worked on the most economical and",40,Willis Tha T Is About Would Be I F The Railways Were Run By

The question has been dealt with in previous debates, and I therefore do not propose to' go into details; but I think I am right in saying that such a plant would cost at least £1,000,000. ironworks of Pennsylvania did not cost who have displayed so much pluck, we are £1,000,000.

Mr W. H . IRVINE I have not been to Lithgow, and cannot speak from personal knowledge of the industry there. But other honourable members have been there, and know the conditions ; and all I can do is to ask whether they are assured that the particular amount mentioned, given in the particular way proposed, will insure the establishment, on a permanent and satisfactory basis, of a complete iron industry plant. It is not for me to answer that question; I simply put the problem to honourable members. orable member's views might be met by a condition as to the output. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is not the output which is the test of efficiency, but rather the amount of money which is put into new plant. good output without plant. Mr W. H .

IRVINE -Quite so;' but undoubtedly one of the conditions of success is an up-to-date plant, whether-it be costly or not. Production is not the real test by which we ought to be guided. The condition of .granting a bounty ought to be the erection of machinery and plant of the kind which, if efficiently and properly worked, will produce iron in its various forms, under modern conditions, with economy and efficiency. Therefore, I venture to submit that, first, we ought to imlarge and flowing revenue from Customs pose on any bounty a stipulation-which , for myself, I shall not attempt to formulate, but merely indicate roughly-as to the extent of plant, the kind of plant, and the time within which it must be erected.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is a question which, of course, is very easily put, but is very difficult, for one not in the position of the Treasurer, to answer. But, after looking into the matter as well as I can, in the limited light I have, I am inclined to think that, subject to certain conditions, we might at least double the amount. PerhapsI might point out, at this particular stage, how. this suggestion is consistent with the view I took in the speech I made not very long ago, showing that our financial position would become rather gloomy in a few years.

One modern plant costing probably £1,000,000, with the necessary skilled labour, would be sufficient. Therefore, to some extent, we should be fostering a monopoly. only become a monopoly if competition is prevented. Mr W. H . IRVINE -An effective duty upon pig iron, sheet iron, and wrought iron would cause it to partake of the character of a monopoly. dustry were successful why should it not become an exporting industry ? Mr W. H . IRVINE I hope that it will. In Europe and America, which possess the enormous advantage of having the iron industry long established, the sources from which they draw their best supplies of ore are rapidly diminishing, whereas our own are practically' untouched. Consequently .we may ultimately hope to compete with those countries in the markets of the world. of the East. Mr W. H . IRVINE I should think that we may ultimately hope to compete with them in South Africa and South America. These are possibilities of the future. I have always felt a good deal affected by that portion of the arguments of the Socialist party, which is directed against what we may call the undue influence of great trade monopolies-aggrega tions of capital exercising a control and influence not merely on the conduct of business but over the lives and fortunes of. thousands and millions of people. That condition of affairs obtains very largely in America The panacea of the Labour Party for this is nationalization. I submit, however, that there is in all Governments a power of control and regulation very much short of nationalization, which, if wisely exercised, would prevent any of the evils we see in America from growing to any considerable magnitude, and would at the same time preserve for these industrial ness which alone springs from private enterprise. We have examples of the kind of regulation of which I speak in dozens of Acts of Parliaments, such as those passed in connection with gas companies in Great Britain certainly the later companies and in connection with other practical monopolies. To some extent, I believe that the principle has even been carried into the regulation, of railway companies in Great. Britain. facilities are sought from Parliament. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes, wherever Parliament grants concessions it may do so under provisions intended to prevent the use of the concessions as a means of unduly taxing the public. ableness. Mr W. H .

I am in agreement with the honourable member for Flinders in desiring to see the iron industry established within Australia. He says that he is thoroughly satisfied that, if established, it is nearly sure to be a monopoly. for Mernda explained and apologized 'for speech; but I do not think that he made that reservation. He went further, the tenor of his argument being that to establish the iron industry in Australia, the assistance of this or of the State Parliaments was necessary; that legislative assistance must be secured before private individuals will invest the immense amount of money required to obtain permanence! We have therefore three positions, that the industry will be a monopoly, that it is desirable to establish it, and that the bulk of the money to be expended in establishing it will be the money of the people, contributed in compliance with' provisions of Acts of Parliament. It seems to me, however, that if the Government is to contribute most of the money necessary to start the industry, it should control it. The honourable member for Flinders instanced monopolies which have been created in Australia, and I was pleased to note that he does not, like the honourable member for East Sydney, adopt the attitude of being scared by the bogy of Socialism. Reference was made to the Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne, whose powers are restricted, so that they cannot levy what it is he considers undue charges upon consumers; but, inasmuch as the company is permitted Jo make dividends' of 10 per cent., it must be regarded as, in cricket parlance, ""on a pretty good wicket"" defined many years ago. cent, is not thought by honourable members opposite to be sufficient for the Denton Hat Mills of Victoria. the Tariff now, though I may say, in regard to hats, that I am considerably in agreement with the honourable member. divided by the Gas Companv, in addition to the 10 per cent, dividends'? of the directors of the Metropolitan Gas Company is sufficient to find a means of distributing profits in excess of the 10 per cent, dividend permitted by the Statute. way Company. the Melbourne Tramway Company, for whose sake a monopoly was created by a Victorian Act of Parliament.

It remains for this House to say whether, having seen the industry established, and Mr Sandford enter into it with an energy, spirit, and enterprise worthy of all commendation, we will help it by this bounty. I believe it is true that if the -proposals of the Government are carried the industry will be put upon a sound basis. In view of the facts which 1 have shortly enumerated, I think it is worthy of the encouragement that the Government propose to give to it. Something has been said about the advantage of giving a bounty in preference to 'a duty. Personally, I agree with much that was said by the last speaker. I had rather help the industry by means of a bounty than by a duty, although if the bounty proposals are not carried, I am-prepared to vote for a duty of 12J percent. jected in regard to woollens that a duty of 40 per cent, amounted to prohibition, an honourable member opposite said, "" Oh, no; that is only a free-trade duty."" If 40 per cent, is a free-trade duty on the authority of one of ""the members of the Labour Party, I think that a duty of 12J per cent, would certainly be no more than a free-trade duty. raw material, should we not require to follow it up by a duty on the manufactured article of 12J per cent, on the raw material, we must remember that on an average it does not amount at the outside to more than 2 per cent, on the manufactured article, taking the manufacture of iron right through. the result of putting these works upon a sound basis will be that the manufacturers who at present have to lay in large stocks of pig, rolled, and bar iron and steel, will no longer have to Jay up those stocks, and will not be required to keep so much capital lying idle. It will be seen that so small a duty will make very little difference to the finished article when it is turned out in the shape of machinery or something of that kind. the House will agree to stimulate the industry by carrying the bounty proposal. I should like, before sitting down, to say that I do not believe that the iron industry will by any means become a monopoly. I believe that there will be in Australia, as there are in America, several blast furnaces and ironworks. At present there is a proposal to establish an iron industry in Victoria, which has a promise of assistance from the Government of this State. We know that only to-day there has been an exhibition in Melbourne of the manufacture of iron by the direct process j and in Tasmania, Queensland, and South Australia, there are large deposits of iron ore. I am hopeful that not only in New South Wales, but in other States of the Commonwealth, we shall see this, industry established under the encouragement given by this Bill. In my opinion, there are infinite possibilities for the industry, and, therefore, I urge the desirability and necessity of passing this Bill into law. This is the third time we have had a measure of the kind before us, and I must say that I am rather surprised that the Bill should have been introduced by the Government at the present time. The only result of the passing of this Bill must be the handing over of £250,000 to a certain iron manufacturing oompany; and I do not be-' lieve that we in this Parliament should be prepared, when some person or persons are in a difficulty, to come forward with a considerable sum in order to bolster up an industry in which they may be engaged. I believe, with others, that it is necessary to have the iron industry established in Australia, not only for ordinary domestic purposes, but for the purposes of defence. I maintain, however, that there is only one way in which to establish the industry on safe and legitimate lines. The honourable member for Flinders told us this afternoon that he had come to the conclusion that a monopoly was necessary for the successful establishment of the We must also remember that iron industry, and any one with common sense must see that the proposal before us means a monopoly. Now, I shall never cast my vote to give any monopolv or companycontrol of a bonus of £250,000, and thus place it in a position to demand extortionate prices from dependent industries. The consumption of iron in» Australia is something under 500,000 tons per annum, and one modern blast furnace, I am told', will turn out that quantity in a year, employing I trust that only about 240 men.",55,Willis Tha T Is About Would Be I F The Railways Were Run By

As the honourable member for Laanecoorie says, the blast furnace at Lithgow is a mere toy in comparison; and it will be readily realized that, with a small furnace, the cost of manufacture is proportionately greater. It is idle to say that under this Bill there will be competition in the industry, seeing that there is already one blast furnace in operation at Lithgow. competition from oversea. honourable member to suggest that the duty should be so adjusted as to leave only the smallest margin of profit, so that there may be an opportunity for competition oversea. thing further than that this need not be. a monopoly unless we deliberately make it one. that success can follow only if it be a monopoly. We must not forget, further, that, in accordance with our standard of living, certain wages will have to be paid, and, therefore, the cost of production will' be greater here than in other parts of the world where similar restrictions are not in operation. Under the circumstances, our local producers are placed at a disadvantage, and to make the industry successf ul there must be monopolv, or a loss which will mean the failure of the enterprise. There is no guarantee that, after this £250,000 has been used up, further assistance will not be required.

As I say, ' I am surprised that the Government should introduce this measure at the present time.

447,Mr Spence (Darling) [9.10],"Re offices, and other services that are called,is the problem before us? We have here admittedly any amount of splendid iron ore. Everybody is unanimous in the desire that we should make our own iron in Australia. I regard it as a necessity for Australia-and members will agree with me in this-to have our own iron industry developed. That would very quickly be seen if Australia was involved in war. If we are to have our own arms and ammunition factories we should manufacture our own iron. The experimental stage, so far as the qualitv of the iron and the methods of developing the industry are concerned, has already been passed in Australia. One capable and able enthusiast in the industry has put all his money into developing it in New South Wales. He has carried it beyond the experimental stage to the stage where he has an excellent contract with the State Government. Yet, staring us in the face, but seemingly overlooked by numbers of honourable members, is the fact that private enterprise will not touch it. Private enterprise openly confesses itself a failure in handling the iron industry. Millions of pounds of capital are lying idle in the banks; we have plenty of men here with large means, but they will not touch the industry. In spite of the fact that the experimental stage has been passed, that the market is waiting, that there is every chance of carrying the industry on, the capitalists will not touch it. They ought to know, with the present Government in power, and in view of the tenacity of purpose of the Treasurer, who always sticks to. his promises, that it is unnecessary to ask us for an under the last Act expired in 1906, but it assurance that they'shall be given a bounty or a duty. They ought to know that they are certain to get one or the other from the present Government. Consequently, I do not think .there is much in that excuse. One or two proposals have recently been advanced for the production of pig iron by new and simpler processes, and capitalists are awaiting the results of these with great interest In Canada the Dominion Superintendent of Mines, Dr. Eugene Haanel, in a report which he has prepared, speaks enthusiastically of the electric process. By adopting this method of treatment he declares that a furnace capable of turning out 120 tons of iron daily could be erected for $750,000, of which $500,000 would' be expended (in providing the necessary machinery of 10,000 horse-power. I mention this fact merely with a view to .show that there is Mr Spence. a risk of changes taking place in the methods adopted for the production of iron. Probably this fact accounts for the reluctance of private enterprise to embark upon the industry. I ask honourable memI think most honourable bers who have been fighting under the anti-socialistic banner to regard this question from the stand-point of the necessity which exists for having a sufficient supply of iron produced in Australia at as cheap a rate as possible. In view of the difficulty experienced in inducing private enterprise to enter upon the iron industry, I think that it is one. which should be nationalized. able member think that the State of New South Wales can afford to nationalize it? favour of its nationalization by the Commonwealth, although, personally, I should not object to New South Wales undertaking the work. The people ought to own and control the industry. It is not reasonable to expect private capitalists to embark upon the enterprise in the light of the experience of other countries. The experience of Canada proves the inherent difficulty of developing the iron industry by means of the bounty system. In the Dominion bounties have been paid upon the production of iron since 1884, notwithstanding that each measure authorizing their payment has been limited to a specific period. But the term over which these Acts shall operate has been extended from time to time. The bounty payable has since been renewed till 1910. Since the inception of trie bounty system the Dominion has paid over $6,080,000 for the development of the iron industry. Four years ago there were nine private companies in existence there. These companies have, erected fifteen furnaces, but only nine of them are now working. It is interesting to note that last year about four of the larger companies practically appropriated the whole ot the bounty paid. In that year the bounty exceeded $2,000,000, of which one company-the Dominion Iron and Steel Company-re ceived $957,277. For the first. time in its history with the aid of bounty, its operations resulted in a profit during that year. I repeat that it received by way of bounty $957,277, and that its accounts showed a surplus of $652,594. It will thus be seen that but for the bounty its",58,Willis Tha T Is About Would Be I F The Railways Were Run By
448,Mr Tilley Brown,Does the honor,59,Willis Tha T Is About Would Be I F The Railways Were Run By
449,Mr Spence,"I am speaking inoperations would have resulted in a deficit. The Lake Superior Company has a representative of the Government of Ontario upon its board of directors, because that Government have granted it a loan of $2,000,000 to develop the industry. The company has paid off a portion of that loan, and renewed $1,000,000 of it. For eight months of last year it made a profit of about $520,000. But it will be seen that the State had to come to its aid. The Canadian companies, in fact, would have been unable to carry on operations in the absence of State aid. The establishment of the iron industry is an absolute necessity to Australia. Canadian experience demonstrates the difficulty of building upthe industry, and points to its tendency to be controlled by a few individuals, because, although there were nine companies in existence in the Dominion paratively short period, ago, there are only four companies in existence now. failed? They have had the benefit of a big bounty and a heavy duty. tage of a large bountv and of a very much larger market for the iron they produce than we should have in Australia. But this only proves the great difficulties to be of the metal in Australia, including manusurmounted in establishing the industry. I have referred to the tendency towards monopoly in the industry, and that is a tendency which we should have to face in Australia from the start, because our market would not justify the establishment of more than one company. It is all very well for honourable members to quote for us the total importations of articles made trom iron or steel, in addition to the actual quantities of iron and steel imported, but they should not forget that no company established in Australia could hope to secure the market for all that iron and steel right away. I do not know what the figures for last year were, but in 1903, in Canada, although the industry had been established for some time, and had been assisted with bounties to the extent of over $4,000,000, the local production reached only 78 per cent, of the home consumption. After all those years, and in spite of the assistance and protection, afforded them, the local industry for the production of iron was unable to supply the home market. A great deal of iron is still imported into Canada, despite all the obstacles placed in its way. .1 was saying that the market for iron in Australia must be considered as very much less than that represented by the total importations of iron and articles made from iron. The people talking of investing in the industry recognise all these difficulties, and I feel that if it is to be established in Australia on a permanent basis the Commonwealth itself must taokle the job. I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for' Flinders admit that the State workshops in Victoria were able to produce railway engines and material more cheaply and tetter than private enterprise, although private enterprise in this connection was represented by an important firm that was originally voted a large sum to put in plant, -and had considerable-experience in production. In spite of this, the Government railway workshops have been able to beat private enterprise out of the business. a comApart altogether from any question of principle involved, this is just one of those industries which should be taken up by the whole people. One honourable member interjected that we should require more than one furnace to supply the market for iron in Australia, and yet, from the evidence given before the Royal Commission, I find that one furnace in Carnegie's steel and iron works produces more iron than would be sufficient to meet the whole consumption: factures of iron imported. That is an answer to those who say that anybody else might make a start in the industry. It amuses me to listen to such. a. statement. I recognise the force of the claim made by the honourable member for Parramatta that iron produced at Lithgow can compete abroad with iron manufactured elsewhere. Buti f people cannot be induced to invest money voluntarily in the industry under existing conditions, is it likely that any one would be foolish enough to doso after one firm had become fairly established, and had secured a grip of the market? I believe that the honourable member for Flinders was right in saying that the amount of bounty proposed at the outset is not sufficient. Certainly the Canadian experience amply supports that view. works are shut down. there are nine companies having fifteen furnaces, and that six of these were idle. I have mentioned also that 1905 and i9o6 : were years of exceptional prosperity in the industry, and the best years that it has-",59,Willis Tha T Is About Would Be I F The Railways Were Run By

454,Mr Spence,"I do not say that Ifited, I would like it to be the gentleman who has so interested himself in the establishment of this industry. Still, as we have adopted the policy of protection, those connected with the iron industry have as much right to benefit by it as have those connected with other industries. Andi f a majority of honourable members do not vote for the proposal to make the manufacture of iron a Commonwealth concern, I must, when faced with the alternative of bounties or protective. duties, vote for the latter. As in the past, I shall endeavour to condense my remarks on this subject as much as possible. When, in 1891, it was my privilege to visit Europe, I met on board ship Mr J. Mitchell, then a member of the New South Wales Legislature, who was going Home to interview the big ironmasters in tbe north of England. He had interviewed them previously, and I understand that final arrangements were about to be completed when death called him from the scene. His statement to me was that the iron masters of England recognised that in New South Wales the natural resources were such as they had not in Great Britain the deposits of coal and iron being so close together. me, furthermore, that the experts which they had sent out here had reported that, after allowing for rates of wages twice the measured mile from Edgeware-road to as high as those paid in England, iron could be manufactured much more cheaply in New South Wales than in the Old Land. The amendment of the leader of the Labour Party has my approval. I shall always vote for the nationalization of anything appertaining to the welfare of the community. I should prefer to see the coal industry nationalized, first, because I recognise that it is the foundation of the iron industry, as the latter is the foundation of all manufacturing industries. But, should we not be able to get a majority for our proposal to nationalize the iron inmust pay is. 6d. extra;' which is contrary dustry, I shall vote for its establishment under other conditions. At the present lime, the 4,000,000 people here cannot do what a few -thousands were able to do in the Transvaal, namely, manufacture a large piece of ordnance. I doubt if we could make even a good rifle. We may be able to make bayonets, but they are becoming obsolete weapons. A statement made by the honourable member for Wide Bay was discounted by some honourable members, namely, that, according to the Victorian Chief Commissioner of Railways, the Melbourne suburban railways are amongst the best managed in the world. The honourable member for Bourke will remember that Mr Speight made a similar remark many years ago. I endorse this view. About Melbourne you travel first class more cheaply on a national railway, than you can third class in any part of England, including the London suburbs, though I except what is known as the "" Tube,"" in which there is only one class. To make the comparison with a concrete instance, to travel in London a distance such as that from Melbourne to Brighton9J miles-woul d cost is. 6d. return fare, third or fourth class. The English Parliament has passed laws which require the British railway companies to reduce rates and freights when their dividends rise to a certain point. But, as has been pointed out by others who have preceded me, companies can easily get rid of superfluous earnings. Those who have visited the Old Land will remember the splendid railway terminal stations there. A great deal of moneyhas been spent on them,, and large salaries are paid. The English Parliament has also provided for what are known as parliamentary trains, on which the fare is i d . He told per mile. But so contemptible is the management of these private railway companies, that if a passenger wished to travel Gower-street, or any similar distance, and asked for a first class ticket, he would be charged 3d.; if he asked for a second class ticket, 2d.; and if he asked for a third class ticket, i j d . ; but if he asked for a parliamentary ticket, i d . only. Thus they stoop to the deception of charging four rates for only three classes of conveyance. There. is another anomaly in the private railway management of England which does not exist here. A return from London to Gravesend, a distance of 24 miles, costs 2s. 6d.; but if you get out half way, you to Euclid's axiom that the whole is'greater than the part. These statements are borne out by a Copy of the English Bradshaw's Railway Guide, and a copy of the English A.B.C., which I have here. in London as the Melbourne Tramway management. tramways, compared with the Sydney tramways, are a farce and a fraud.

If it had not been for his action, conservative though he was-and all honour to him for what he did-the company would have had the right to control our streets for ever. Never has such a villainous franchise or concession as that been granted in the 'United States. In the course of years }Vliitaker's Almanac has become very much more respectable than it used to be. It has dropped out the harsh terms which it formerly employed. The reference to about .£50,000,000 having been spent on bribery and corruption in connection with the House of Commons and the House of Lords has been left out of the later editions. But tinder the head of railway statistics there is one paragraph which may interest honourable members. It saysThe expenditure incurred in securing legislative authority to construct railways was enormous. good qualities of which I admire equally The parliamentary cost of the Brighton Railway .averaged £4,806 per mile; of the Manchester and Birmingham, ^'5,190 per mile; and of the Blackwall, ^'14,414 per mile ! The solicitors' bill for the South-Eastern Railway contained 10,000 folios, and amounted to ,£240,000. That, I suppose, is the biggest legal bill in existence. It is no wonder that in England railway companies cannot pay dividends or be run at a fair cost as in Australia. Leaving out the supply of London and its immediate suburbs, it has been stated that seven-eighths of the gas supply in England has been nationalized, or in other words belongs to the municipalities. honourable member's question will be'found in a short quotation in Municipal Owners/tip in Great Britain, written by H;ugo R. Meyer and published in 1906. It is taken from an article which appeared in the Hereford Journal in June, 1887, and reads as follows :-Happy Hereford! congratulate ourselves on our latest bereavement. There are also national iron..and paper works. The city rate (tax) has expired. It is dead, The beginning of the inevitable and desirable past, and gone, and will never come to l if e end in each case. ' again. To be still more explicit, let us put it in this way-the citizens of Hereford will never I am very pleased that the Government have another city rate (tax) to pay.

Clauses8 and 9 profore now, has had to be met by a rate of 3s. 6d. in the pound. That, I think, is a. fair answer to the honourable member. ber has picked out a very good one, but I can name some cases where the rates total 14s. in the £ . cases where the rates come to even more than that. For instance, in one place where I was acting as locum lenens the rent of the house was £ 3 0 a year, while the rates amounted to £50. The net profits of these 280 municipalities run from £54,000 downwards, and the amount of money put into the gasworks ranees from £2,500,000 down to even £1,500. I maintain that in Australia the time has come when with our more liberal franchise and greater privileges to citizens we should, if need be, make a precedent. What is it to us if no country in the world has nationalized the iron industry except one country-Japan-the with the honourable member for Parkes? On the subject of nationalization of industries in Japan, let me quote a passage from a recent publicationThe industries already nationalized in Japan are-tobacco , salt, camphor. These are absolutely under the control of the Government, and are run in the public interest. The world's estimate of the value of the tobacco monopoly is made plain by the success of the late loan. It will be remembered that that loan was floated in the midst of a terrible war, and, according to my reading, the success of the flotation has been unequalled by any other country fighting tinder similar conditions. The minds of honourable members will immediatelv revert to the history of the civil war in the United States. They will remember at how low a price loans were then floated in comparison with the price at which the late loan of Japan was floatedThe tobacco profits are offered as security. The financiers seem to regard them as fairly satisfactory.

The compensation is seemingly rather high, but it will not appear so high to honourable members if they will reflect for a moment. Suppose my amendment, either in words or in substance, were adopted, and,, say, £250,000 were spent in establishing the industry. If the Commonwealth should take over the industry, its proprietors could not obtain more compensation than £500,000. Let me give another concrete exampleSuppose that the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company had been floated with 500,000 shares of JOS; each, to be paid up at once. capital of £250,000. similar provision in the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company's Act, the State of Victoria could purchase their tramways, knowing that it would not have .to spend more than £500,000, though the dividends, based on the market value of the shares, might seemingly make the property worth £1,500,000, or even more than that. I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay, in order to secure the nationalization of the industry, and, failing the carrying of the amendment, I shall vote for the bounty or for duties, because I desire to see the iron industry established in Australia. -On e of the unfortunate features of this debate is that, instead of this Bill being regarded as a general provision for encouraging the iron industry in any part of the Commonwealth, it has been regarded by quite a majority of the speakers as a Bill specially designed to give assistance somewhat Jeremiad-like circular which its proprietor has addressed to honourable memance of being a sort of charitable appeal acquainted with the iron trade is aware that not only in Lithgow, but in other tralia and Queensland. only fair way, therefore, in which the House can regard this Bill is by putting aside altogether-as the honourable member for Flinders in his mental calculations proposed to do-the existence of the Lithgow industry, and to question the reasonableness of this proposal from the point of view of all Australia, not as it. stands to-day, but as it may be in the next few years. I venture to say that if this Bill is so regarded it will give a very different aspect to the question. That would have provided a If , as a free-trader, I were to give expresI f there were a sion to my academic opinions, apart from the inevitable trend of events in this House, and particularly in this State, I should certainly be a keen opponent of everything in the form of a duty or a bounty that was capable of being shown to be an artificial aid to any industry. I have always contended that artificial aid to industries, whether in the form of a bounty or a duty, must, of necessity, be unjust unless it is universal, because if one man's occupation is entitled to artificial assistance out of the funds of the people, then every industry is entitled to be assisted. By the time that we had thus helped every one, we should be very much in the position of the old women who lived on an island and under-, took to take in one another's washing. By the time that we had protected every one, and were paying one another an artificial price for our several commodities, we should have merely lowered the value of the sovereign.

It opens up. the whole field of history and political economy. member used in support of his advocacy of nationalization a number of illustrations, and I should not like it to go forth to the country, or even to the honourable member's own constituents, that he advanced these arguments to the House as illustrations of the soundness of his doctrines, without the other side of the question being put before honourable members. The honourable member for Wide Bay referred to the railways of this country. all that I can say about our railways is that they offer no illustration whatever of the possibility or practicability of the general policy of nationalization'. We all know that the railways of Australia are, in the first place, statutory monopolies. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member would urge that private enterprise should take them over? honourable member will not make inopportune interjections. If he says something that is relevant I shall be happy to reply to him. State-owned railways are desirable or notare, de facto, statutory monopolies. No one is allowed to run a line side by side to compete with any one of them. The Commissioners of Railways fix their own ratessometimes, we .know, very inequitablywithout consulting anybody. We are well aware that in some parts of New South Wales-and in some parts of Victoria also, I believe-railwa y freights are greater for a shorter distance than they are for a longer. H . IRVINE I say th.it I am one can possibly compete with them. The Commissioners fix their own freights and conditions, and they thus take care to H as any proearn enough to pay the interest on the capital borrowed on account of them. My view of State railways is this: that under the peculiar circumstances in which"" That is, the State originally owned the whole of the real estate of the Colonies, it was a perfectly justifiable thing for the State to desire to realize as large a price for that real estate in the interests of the people as was possible; and it was therefore justified in running lines of railway through its own property in The order to make it accessible. But I have always held this opinion also: that, so soon as these States had disposed of their land, I am not or of the greater part of the lands held by them, it would be much more profitable to the people to place their railways in private hands upon the principle adopted in Great Britain. The honourable member for FlinBut the honourable ders pointed out very properly that in Great Britain, having regard to the fact that all the railway companies have required statutory authority to enable them to run through private property, and so construct their lines, the Parliament has imposed upon them the obligation to charge reasonable rates. Many honourable members are aware that in England there is a Board of Commissioners, whose Well, sole duty is to investigate charges made by the railways with regard to passenger fares and rates for goods; and if it can be shown to the satisfaction of these Commissioners that either the passenger fares or the goods rates charged by any particular railway are more than is reasonable, the Commissioners can order those rates and farete 'to be lowered. That is one of the conditions of the railway monopoly in England. I hope that the American goods are conveyed from Liverpool at lower rates than are charged to convey English goods to Liverpool ? member might as well ask me what were the passenger fares on the London and Northwestern Railway in the month of April. I do not profess to be an encyclopaedia. I am simply pointing out how the monopoly -> is carried on : that the State has required all the charges to be reasonable, and that what ""reasonableness"" is depends upon the opinion of a Board of Commissioners. In England any individual passenger who thinks that an unfair rate is charged may Another consideration is that no appeal to the Commission. 0",66,Willis Tha T Is About Would Be I F The Railways Were Run By

Railways, therefore, whether in England or Australia, throw no light whatever on the practicability of nationalization. The honurhble member for Wide Bay used another illustration from the StateI represent, when he spoke of certain work being done more cheaply at the Government workshop, Fitzroy Dock, than it could be done by private individuals. It is only fair to tell the House that this particular workshop,-which was established by Mr O'Sullivan, whose name is everlastingly associated with day labour and the minimum wage, has undertaken at different times a number of important works, tendering against private enterprise. That practice was carried so far that a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate its accounts, in order to ascertain how it was that this Government establishment' could render at lower prices than those of private business establishments. The report of the Royal Commission went to show that and indispensable charges in a proper business concern had been wholly omitted from its calculations in making tenders. For instance, no charge was made for interest on capital, depreciation of tools, rent of premises or insurance; and yet, in many cases, although these important elements had not been taken into calculation, the works undertaken at Fitzroy Dock were completed at a loss. If the honourable member for Wide Bay chooses to place this before us as an illustration of the success of Government work as against private enterprise, I make him a present of his illustration, so long as those who rely on it will take the trouble to look into the matter for themselves. member for Wide Bay referred in almost grandiloquent language to the Government coal mines of New Zealand, and mentioned some enormous profits which they had produced.

I venture to say that if those mines made a profit, it would be well to ascertain whether the management acted in the same haphazard way as was adopted by those in charge of the Fitzroy Dock. Perhaps the two most instructive experiments in regard to naFionatization were, those in which bodies, of citizens agreed to establish Socialist communities on their own account.

I have mentioned two opportunities for experiment with regard to the idealistic theories of the party who sit in the Government corner; and, as the honourable member for North Sydney reminds me, they represent not merely the collapse of an in a great variety of legitimate dustry, but tiie collapse of a whole community. The most interesting part of the history of the Paraguay settlement was the news that came through the Sydney newspapers telling us that the community was nourishing because the members had divided the property and employed black labour, with the result that the population had doubled. I have too much consideration for the House to go at any further length into the nationalization question, although I had made one or two further notes on the subject. The honourable member for Wide Bay spoke here this afternoon as if he were announcing a new religion. One would have thought that the principle he enunciated was a great noveltv which he The honourable or his party had just discovered, and he spoke with bated breath in fear that w.e should think he was advocating nationalization in general. I noticed that, when sub. sequent speakers were contending that the I watch the progress of honourable member actually had revived the old cry of nationalization in general, a great many members of the Labour Partybecame very agitated and excited.

Buti f I have to make a choice-and to a free-trader it is a choice of economic evilsI should prefer a bounty. that, when a duty is imposed, the amount of money which the people pay, either in the form of duties or in the form of higher prices, is about seven times the amount which goes into the manufacturer's hands. Of course, whether money is paid directly from the Treasury by means of a bounty, or whether an Act of Parliament is passed which compels the public to contribute a sum of money in the shape of penalties upon the importation of goods, the effect is the same. But I prefer a bounty system, because we know at once what the public are going to pay. We know that if a bounty is given for iron there will lie no duty while the bounty is in force, and that therefore the local industry will have the benefit of the object-lesson which is constantly before them in the quality of the imported article, and the price at which it can be made in other countries in the world. Of the two, therefore, I prefer the bounty. including Mr Sandford, said that the Victoria, which has never had a bounty or bounty was no good to them without a duty or any other assistance. duty. by Mr Sandford must be taken with qualinever having had assistance.
