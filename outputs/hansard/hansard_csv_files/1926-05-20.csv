There is to-day no more vital need than to find some way by which our industry and commerce may progress smoothly, and better relations may be established between all sections of the community, that we may have industrial peace, progressive development, degree people. to accomjJish is not an ordinary lation which, if a. mistake is made, can be amended at the instance of the Government responsible for it, or some succeeding administration. tion of the Constitution, fundamental country, and can be altered only at the will of the people after an express appeal to them. tion such an important step as the alteration of the Constitution should be undertaken. with a feeling of full responsibility, the House to refer to the people a proposed alteration of the Constitution enable us to deal more effectively with a great question affecting industry, the industrial relations between sections of the community. the people of Australia to-day recognize that this question, which we now propose to submit to them, above all others affects the future prosperity of Australia, the realization of our ideals. It is of paramount importance. of great potentialities, the envy of every other nation. nations, like individuals, Mr Bruce. the manner in which they take advantage affects the present of their opportunities, and it is for and the future us to realize to the fullest extent the possibilities of this wonderful country. This we cannot do unless we solve the in or party dustrial difiiculties which are facing us to-day. We can ' develop this counthat try only by bringing people here, and economically absorbing them, so I that they may live according to our standards of living. We must thereWe fore develop our resources, building new railways and roads, and giving every opportunity to our people to settle our preand commerce progress, sent .great unpopulated spaces. We cannot bring migrants to this country unless we establish great secondary industries, Without this which, by manufacturing our own raw material, w ill ultimately make Australia a self-supporting nation, The well-being of all our secondary and primary industries is dependent upon the solution of this industrial problem; we cannot otherwise increase the country's capacity so to absorb population. Increasing population and industrial development and an enhanced necessitate increased production, if the of happiness among the newcomers are to become efficient units This measure is designed of the community. The first essential to those ends. But it increased production is that we should be piece of legisable to dispose of what we produce. Practically for the first time in the history of Australia we have to find a market overseas, not only for the wool and wheat It is an alterafor which the world is clamouring, and which is the which have been our staple products in governing ordinance of this the past, but also for those commodities which have to be sold in competition with the products of other countries. We shall It is only on a great quesbe able to compete successfully in the vitally affecting Australia that markets of the world only if we establish healthy relations between emunder which we live ployer and employee, so that the whole The Government, of our population may work contentedly, asks with the knowledge that, so far as is humanly possible, every class and every to section is getting a fair deal, and a reasonable opportunity. Under existing namely, conditions that ideal cannot be achieved. different The maintenance of the Whit e Australia. I believe that policy, and of the living standards of our people, are involved in the solution of this difficulty. Because we have progressed so far, we must not deceive ourand selves with the idea that we can continue indefinitely to advance the standards of We have a country our people without ensuring increased a country that is production on an economic basis One But factor that is bringing us to a standstill are judged by is the state of affairs that has developed in industries generally throughout Australia, and the lack of co-ordination under the idealistic economic system we have tried to establish. tempted something which no other country has tried to the same extent. Commonwealth started, 25 years ago, to give effect to an ideal expressed in the Constitution in the words "" conciliation and arbitration."" about the peaceful settlement, of industrial disputes within the law. framers of the Constitution, and those who subsequently sought to put into operation the industrial powers it contains, conceived it possible that Australia might by avoid the industrial conditions existing in other countries, and might afford its people opportunities to enjoy a decent standard oi living and to work under conditions which would effectively protect the worker against exploitation by the employer. That was a truly great ideal, especially if we consider it in the light of the social and economic condition of the world 25 years ago. This Parliament has progressively sought to realize it , but unfortunately in practice many things have happened to make us lose sight of the original conception. matter what his convictions in regard to ordinary recognize that something is radically wrong in the industrial sphere. The Commonwealth and State Parliaments have evolved systems for the settlement of industrial disputes, and for the regulation of wages and conditions of employment. But these systems overlap, with resultant duplication and confusion in industry, and, that worse hindrance to industrial progress, uncertainty. In almost any industry men doing exactly the same work are receiving in different States varying working through the operation of this unscientific system, they are subject to the jurisdiction of different industrial tribunals. One man under a State award is working certain hours aud receiving certain pay; another, working by his side in the same industry is under a Federal award. How can we hope to have industrial peace and contentment while such varying conditions obtain throughout the community ? To-day there are seven different industrial systems in [86] operation. Each of the six States has its arbitration court or wages boards, and above them all is the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which, however, is unAustralia has atable to co-ordinate or harmonize the conflicting State awards. Questions vital to The the workers are being determined upon different principles in different States. The basic wage is fixed by various tribunals upon differing statistical bases. DissatisI t sought to bring faction and irritation are bound to be created by such anomalies, and this ParThe liament has to consider, as a matter of urgency, how these evil conditions can be remedied. When the ideal of Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration was ' first formulated, duplication of jurisdiction and conciliatory processes conflicting awards in the same industry were never contemplated. Such things have happened largely because of the limitation of the Commonwealth's industrial power under the Constitution. Paragraph xxxv. of section 51 fixes the Federal Parliament power to make laws as to conciliation and arbitration only. One would think that the words "" conciliation and arbitration "" gave all the powers that the federal authority required to remove causes of industrial trouble, but in practice they have been found wanting. Those words pre-suppose To-day every thinking man, no a difference between parties, and vhe Commonwealth Court can deal only with political questions, must disputes between parties, and its awards are binding upon only the actual parties. Only a person or company cited before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is bound by its award. In one plaint there were 4,000 respondents, and I have heard recently of a pending case in which there will be 11,000 respondents, everyone of whom must be served with notices, and all other processes in connection with the proceedings of the court, or they w ill not be bound by its decisions. That defect in the federal power places an intolerable rates of pay, and possibly burden of expense upon applicants and different hours, because leads to irritating delays. An even worse result flows from this system. When an award which was binding upon, say, 4,000 respondents becomes out of date, and an application is made to the court for a variation of it , only the parties cited in the proceedings for variation will be bound by the court's decision. Some of the original respondents may bo omitted from the new citation, and new employers may have come into the industry since the original award, and may not be cited before the court. If notice is not served upon them the court's award is not applicable to them. Thus some employers continue to be bound by the first award, and pay the rates of wages it imposed. Others are bound by the award as varied; whilst some are not bound in any way. Arbitration Act, or of the Constitution? the whole structure has been raised is faulty. TheH i g h Court has decided that the matter is one between parties, and every party must be served. Whilst the -limitation imposed by the words "" arbitration and conciliation"" exists, only those who are parties to the proceedings are bound by an award. further difficulty which faces the Commonwealth Court is that it can deal only with those disputes which extend beyond the limits of any one State. It has no power to give an award in respect to an industry before a dispute actually exists. The practice has, therefore, grown up of creating artificial disputes embracing more than one State. The serving of a log is sufficient evidence to prove the existence of a dispute. That is certainly better than what is implied by a strict reading of the Constitution, but it is, nevertheless, hopelessly artificial. H i g h Court has given innumerable decisions interpreting the meaning of the Constitution, and those decisions have 'limite d the powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Courtf a r beyond anything that was contemplated when the Constitution was framed. A t the present time it is possible for employees or employers to approach both the Commonwealth and State Arbitration Courts and to adopt from the award of each that which best suits themselves. Look at the position which existed prior to the recent aecision in regard to the 44-hour week. Whetheri t still exists I do not know; that is a matter which I leave to the lawyers to settle. But certainly until that decision was given a union could obtain from a State court an award giving to its members a minimum wage of 90s. for a week of 48 hours and from the Commonwealth court a minimum wage of 85s. for a week of 44 hours. "" pick the eyes"" out of the two awards, accepting the wage of 90s. from the one and the working week of 44 hours from the other. It was able to do that because the H i g h Court had decided tliat, except so f a r as there was inconsistency between the two awards, the Federal award did not override that of the State. It w ill be realized that when one court fixes 44 hours and the other 48 requirements are satisfied by the adoption of the 44 hours. Similarly, if one court fixes the minimum wage at 85s., and the other' at 90s., .both are satisfied by the adoption of 90s. That position has arisen because of the limitation imposed upon the powers of the Commonwealth. The latest decision of the H i g h Cour^ apparently lays it down that there is inconsistency when the Commonwealth A award purports to cover the whole field. But these conflicting interests have led to hopeless and endless confusion. The further feature which has made the position almost hopeless is that the Federal court has no judicial power. We propose to remedy that under a bill that we shall bring down immediately. Lacking that judicial power, the Commonwealth court cannot, impose any penalties, and is unable to interpret its own awards. In the original act we purported to provide that the Commonwealth court could by injunction prevent a State tribunal from giving The a conflicting decision, but it has been decided that that power does not exist. These differences have led to such uncertainty that a spirit of unrest has been fostered in the minds of the workers, and the effect has been detrimental to the best interests of the community. Some remedy must be found for the duplication and overlapping of the two tribunals. The remedy urged by some persons is to abolish arbitration. I say that that is unthinkable. I challenge those who contend that the system has been an absolute failure to prove the t r u th of their assertion. We have difficulties, but they can be surmounted. A study of the history of labour throughout the world during the last 25 years w ill show a steady and progressive advancement. The great mass of the people the world over has come to a greater realization of what their rights are.

38,Mr Brtjce,"The basis upon whichdisputes? Notf o r a moment do I accept the view that because we have had difficulties Ave should scrap the whole machinery of arbitration and conciliation and revert to the old system for composing our differences. that of international affairs, efforts are now being directed towards the ideal of having disputes arbitrated upon by an international tribunal. If that can be attempted even in the international sphere, it is obvious that it can be achieved in the much smaller sphere embraced by the industrial affairs of one nation. If the Commonwealth Government scrapped the Arbitration Court our troubles industrially would merely be accentuated. Another suggestion is that we sliould revert to the distinct line of demarcation wealth and State spheres which was thought desirable when the Constitution was framed. A t that time there were very few industries with ramifications throughout AustraliaI suppose that shipping and shearing were the only industries of that nature then-and it is said that the arbitration powers of the Parliament were framed to allow the Commonwealth to provide for the settlement of disputes in such industries, because -hey could not be satisfactorily dealt with by the States. We are told that it was clear to every one at the time that it would be most undesirable for the Commonwealth to have anything to do with the. regulation of industry, or with the settlement of industrial disputes except those extending beyond any one State. While that may have been the general opinion when the Constitution Act was assented to, it ""disappeared very rapidly, for on the 28th June, 1901, within two months of the first meeting of the Commonwealth Parliament, Mr Higgins moved in this chamberThat, in the opinion of this House, it is expedient for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to acquire (if the State Parliaments see fit to grant it under section 51, sub-section (37) of the Constitution Act) full power to make laws for Australia as to wages and hours and conditions of labour. Mr Barton, who was then Prime Minister, suggested that the motion be amended by substituting the word "" accept"" for the word "" acquire."" H is suggestion was agreed to, and the motion in its amended for m was carried without a single dissentient. early in the l if e of this Parliament, it was realized that the idea of a distinct line of demarcation between Federal and State authority in regard to the control of industry would have to be abandoned, In the widest sphere, and the change of outlook has now become more general. Since federation, there have been at least twelve attempts to deal with this matter in Parliament, and on three occasions proposals to amend the Constitution in respect to industrial legislation have been submitted to the people by way of referendum. On each of these occasions, however, the people decided against any alteration. In 1911, the figures were 483,000 for and 742,000 against; the majorit y against being 259,000. In 1913, the figures were between the Common961,000 for and 987,000 against; the adverse majorit y being 26,000. In 1919, the figures were 911,000 for and 924,000 against, a narrow adverse margin in a vote of that magnitude. The defeat of these proposals for the alteration of the Constitution has been due, to some extent, to the number of other questions submitted to the people at the same time; but it may also be attributed in a degree to the innate conservatism of the people, irresnective of their political views. Whenever a great question involving a change in the fundamental basis of a people's national life is submitted' to them, they are naturally hesitant about adopting it . We have to remember also that there were very differing conceptions of what Commonwealth arbitration meant when an arbitration bill was first introduced into this Parliament. It was not at all universally accepted then that the industrial sphere of the Commonwealth embraced only two or three big industries. When the late Mr Deakin, as Attorney General, introduced the bill, he saidWe now substitute a new regime for the reign of violence by endowing the statewhich in itself posesses a strength greater than that of either or both contestants-wit h power to impose, within the limits of reason, justice, and constitutional government, its deliberate will upon the parties to industrial disputes. If he was visualizing only one or two industries, it is difficult to explain why he made that statement. I have taken a good deal of trouble to investigate this matter, and it is quite clear to me that early in the history of federation it was realized that the CommonTherefore, even so wealth would have to play a greater part in industrial affairs than some people understood would be the case when the Constitution was passed. isters believe that this great problem will not be solved by drawing a line of demarcation between State and Eederal authority, and declaring that three, four, or five industries are federal in their operation, all others being such as should be controlled by the State authority, and be altogether outside the Commonwealth jurisdiction. We are convinced that the only satisfactory solution of the problem is to equip the Commonwealth with greater power, to bring about a system of correlation of industry, with regard both to the regulation of wages and conditions and to the settlement of disputes. The first proposal of the Government is that the words "" extending beyond the limits of any one State'' be deleted from paragraph xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution. Although the deletion of those words will not do all that is necessary, it will remove many of the objections to the present system of conciliation and arbitration. It will give the Commonwealth authority over intra-state as well as interstate disputes, and remove bhe necessity for artificially extending a dispute over two or more Statesi n order to bring a matter within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. We intend to retain all the power that we have at present, because a great many legal decisions have been given in regard to the exercise of it , and it is undesirable that we should interfere with those authoritative determinations. The new powers which the Government proposes to take are contained in the proposed new paragraph x l . of section 51. If that paragraph is added the section will readThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constiwealth Government objects to what a tution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the CommonState may do? wealth with respect to(xl.)

That will give power to the Parliament relating to industrial employment, create the authorities to determine Mr Bruce. fined to industrial disputes, or wil l it be Minexercised generally ? MT . BRUCE It w ill, subject to the explanation I have just given, be an absolute power, as wide as any one can desire. I wish to stress an aspect of the question on which there may be a divergence of opinion. There are sound reasons for proposing that Parliament shall have the power to create authorities, but not the power to decide industrial questions itself, and I wish to state those reasons f r a n k l y and f u l l y . If full power to determine industrial questions were given to this Parliament it would have to deal with many complicated industrial problems in an atmosphere of political contention.

43,But To Mr Bruce,"I shall endeavour toabout uniform industrial legislation, but my immediate answer to tbe question is, ""Most certainly."" The final authority will be the Commonwealth Parliament, which will override every other authority. Leaving out of consideration for the moment the comparatively minor questions I have referred to, such, as factory and apprenticeship acts, I Avish to deal now with the fundamental industrial question of hours of labour. That is probably the most burning question in Australia to-day, ancl the difficulty of determining it has brought home to the people a f u ll realization of the duplication that exists, and the impossibility, under the Constitution as it stands, of eA olving r order out of chaos. I ask honourable members to consider the effect of giving f u ll pOAvers to this Parliament instead of to authorities created by it. I attention to an tical argument AvhichI hope will not be obtruded into the discussion of this subject. I ask honourable members to take a view soniCAvhat Avider than the political view. Government is proposing to create authorities to defeat the determination of the Governments of certain States to enact a 44-hour Aveek, and that the bill is a device to ensure that the 48-hour Aveek shall become the standard Avorking week in this country. I hope honourable members Avill use their political sense in dealpoints Avhich must be considered before it ing with a political question. If that Avere the Government's intention, Avould it not have proposed to give direct poAver of interference to tliis Parliament, instead of to specially constituted authorities? If that were done, there would be nothing to prevent any Commonwealth GoAernr ment that happened to be in poAver from fixing by legislation the number of hours in members should recognize that, and concede my point that the Government's We say that it is improper to deal Avith a question so A-ital to Australia as one of political controversy, allowing its settlement to be affected by political passion. If Ave are to come to a right decision, the question must be determined in u non-political atmosphere. The interests of the workers and their opportunities of employment depend upon its right decision. The question can be rightly decided only after the fullest possible investigation and examination of the economic results of the fixing of a new standard of working hours in this country. Honourable members must bear in mind all the time that the same considerations apply to the settlement of such questions as the basic wage, child endowment, and others vitally influencing the life of the people. HOAV could Parliament determine Avhether men in this country should Avork 48 or 44 hours as a standard working Aveek Avithout the fullest possible investigation and examination of the Avhole of the economic and industrial results that would flow from its determination? If Parliament were to do its duty conscientiously and properly, it could only determine such a question on the facts after a f u l l examination and the should like to direct hearing of all the evidence Avhich could undesirable polibe submitted on the subject. I have tried to set out some of the facts Avhich would have to be taken into account. There have been inquiries into this question in different parts of the world, and, geneI t may be suggested that the rally speaking, they have been conducted by economists, and have involved the consideration of very lengthy and complicated references to the productivity of industry and such matters, the bearing of which the ordinary man is not competent to appreciate. I have, therefore, tried to set out in the simplest way the is possible to determine what is a proper standard working week. I put them in this way: It is necessary to determine the effect of any decision of the question on the amount and the cost of production ; hoAv far it would hinder or assist the expansion of industry, or the establishment of new industries; Avhat effect it would have on the sale of Australian a working Aveek. Honourable goods ancl products in overseas markets; and Avhat effect it Avould have on the competition we are subjected to from imobjective is not political. ported goods and products in the Australian market. It would be necessary to determine generally its effect on employment and unemployment; on the condition and health of the Avorkers; on the cost of living: whether it would reduce the value of the' Avages Avhich the workers receive, lower the standard of living, and reduce the opportunities of employment. Will any member of this House contend that he has so examined and determined. During the last election the question, sifted the evidence, and concampaign I told the people f r a n k ly that sidered the economic and industrial of the determination any particular way, that he is prepared tion the Government has been considerconscientiously to go before the people of ing what decision will satisfy the Australia and say, "" I know that this will mass of the people. be for your benefit, because I have so move the feeling of unrest, and the apexamined the whole matter""? honourable member could claim to have too many hours to labour, to their own made so exhaustive the subject, he would be untrue to his one else. We must secure an authoritaposition if he commended to the people tive finding as to the hours of work which the adoption of a particular standard. would be impossible for this to call and consider the evidence, and been put forward. One was that there come to a determination adduced. To-day, in Australia, the question of what is a right working week is achieve nothing, because the two sides not a social question. men worked 60 or 70 hours a week, exand would fight for what they had precessive hours beyond human and so undermined stroyed their lives, the question was not suggested that there might be a conan economic, but a social, one, to be deference between representatives of the termined by the representatives people.

Theni t was suggested by examination trial can go on the social side.

I suggest that the whole of the tion was once previously considered by amount of evidence given by represenother great fundamental questions tatives of the workers. They put the be authoritatively dealt with fullest possible case for their side, and had obviously spent weeks and months in its preparation. The case was properly put, but, owing to a decision that the question could only be dealt with by three judges, the whole proceedings were abortive. However, that hearing showed clearly that it is possible to present the case fully and get all the evidence dealing with the economic and industrial questions involved placed before the court if employers and employees, after the necessary preparation, are prepared to go before tbe court and present their case. We have accordingly decided to give an opportunity to the two sides to present their case to the court. To enable this to be done an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is proposed. As I mentioned earlier, under the existing law, questions heard by the court can only be those between the parties to a dispute. But we are trying to obtain an authoritative finding upon the broad question of the proper standard maximum hours of work per week, and we must, therefore, havo all possible interests represented. To enable that to be done, and to enable the court to hear the case free from the atmosphere of a dispute between those parties present, a bill will be introduced to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, so as to give power to the Attorney-General to intervene in a case, in which the question of hours is being considered. As soon as he does so, it will be open to any interested party to appear before the court and ask to be heard. representatives of labour are in a position to present a full case, and to deal with the matter exhaustively from every angle. I know also that employers are in a position to do the same thing. I venture to say that if the parties are willing, we can secure an authoritative decision upon this question. One weakness in the present position is that whilst we may secure after the fullest investigation and hearing a decision from the court which all would be prepared to accept as authoritative, the court has uo power under the Constitution to give effect to its decision. amendment of the Constitution will allow that power to be given to the court. should, however, like to clear up a misunderstanding which is evident in the minds of a number of people. They seem to fear that the fixing of a standard working week must apply alike to every industry and trade irrespective of its conditions. Such a condition of affairs does not exist in Australia to-day. Quite 50 per cent, of the workers do not work for 48, or perhaps for 44 hours, per week. The only question that has to be determined is what shall be the standard basic working week in ordinary employment not subject to peculiar conditions. The court will have power, for example, to determine on a different basis the hours to be worked in tropical parts of Queensland and those fixed for the more temperate and possibly more healthy parts of Australia. The Federal Arbitration Court does that today. It does not lay down a decision applicable to every one, no matter where he may be employed: It only operates to co-ordinate the terms and conditions of employment of all men employed in similar circumstances. I wish people to get rid of the idea that what is proposed is that any decision arrived at shall, automatically and uniformly, apply throughout Australia. I have dealt with the question of hours of work, because it two parties, with only is a burning question at the present time, and affords a good example of the kind of questions to be determined by authorities created by the Parliament. Honourable members will realize the position in which we may eventually find ourselves. We have seen the question of hours of work made the outstanding feature in the political areua in the difI know that the ferent States. In saying this, I am making no comment, but merely stating a fact. Human nature being what it is, it is inevitable that this political card, which has been successfully used before, will be played again and again. But may not some one arise to declare that the principle of 44 hours a week is wrong, and that men should work only 40 hours? May not such'a politician lead his battalions to combat those who advocate 44 hours a week ? And if he succeeds, ma}' not some one else suggest 36 hours a week ? This intolerable state of affairs will come about unless we take steps to prevent it. This proposed If the offer of fewer hours is to be continuously used in the political arena, as I an incentive to electors to vote for a particular party, it will strike a vital blow at organized labour, and breed dissension throughout the whole movement. I have had an opportunity of speaking to a great number of industrialists upon this subject. There are in this country to-day a great number of men who believe that the principle of 44 hours' work a week, if applied throughout Australia, would give the best results, helping development, and promoting employment. and conscientiously believe that, and I pay respect to their conscientious convictions; but they undoubtedly believe that a working week of 40 hours or 36 hours would be too short, and would in jure the working classes. disagree with some of the views of those men, yet I believe that they are doing their utmost to lead Labour along the road of reasonable progress. Labour will surely be weakened if the question of hours of work is to be used in the political arena, and the passions of the workers stirred by men advocating a working week of 36 or 30 hours. such an event what hope would there be for the staunch industrialist who contends that men should work 44hours a week? Wc should consider that argument seriously. If the question of hours of work remains in the arena of party politics, it will give great power to the extremists, who care nothing about the result to the people so long as they snatch power from the honest leaders of Labour, who are trying to benefit the class that they represent. ment links up to a certain extent with the second amendment, which will give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws(xli.) Investing State authorities with any powers whioh tlie Parliament, by virtue of paragraph (xxxv.) or paragraph (xl.) of this section, has vested or has power to vest in any autliority established by the Commonwealth. It may be asked, seeing that the Government wants full power to deal with industrial relations between employers and employees, how shall we exercise these powers when we get them? as the Federal Arbitration long list of eases before it that cannot be dealt with for some time, the additional powers, if granted to the Commonwealth, will only mean greater tion, greater delays, and greater difficulties in settling disputes. clear the mind of anybody who takes up that position.

A bill is to be introduced at once to amend the Arbitration Act, and under it f u l l judicial power will be given to the judges, but apart from thatand one or two minor things, we do not intend to deal with the Arbitration Act or the arbiAlthoughI tration system, u n t i l we know whether we have additional powers.

It would be the final tribunal in the land on all indust r i a l matters. It is possible that there would be a right of appeal respecting certain questions from the lesser tribunals to that court, but that right of appeal would have to be strictly safeguarded, because nothing is more destructive to a system designed to establish industrial peace than to allow the right of appeal to hold up final settlement and to keep in This amenddustry in a state of unrest. from the Arbitration Court to the High Court? determined.

45,Mr Bruce,"That will have to bewith industrial troubles, but we know that there are inherent and grave dangers even with round-table conferences when applied to industry, without appeal to a tribunal and without co-ordination between it and other industries. The proposal is to have a central Arbitration Court. It may be that in certain States we shall have to appoint a court with its own judge, but that remains to be seen. It may be necessary, in order to bring about decentralization, to establish a court in a State so* far away as Western Australia; but the central court will really be the controlling body, and the system operating under it will embody the principle of the round-table conference.

We could not possibly wipe out the present arbitration system and start afresh without disastrous results, but we would have power to evolve a better system in co-ordination with the State tribunals, which, if necessary, would be vested with power under Federal authority. We must proceed carefully and wisely. The main thing is that with additional powers we shall be able to get rid of overlapping and duplication of awards, to bring about steadily a coordination of the whole system, and to deal with fundamental and vital questions such as the basic wage, the standard hours of work, and child endowment. The next amendment-paragrap h x l i i gives power to legislate for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth in relation to trusts and combinations in restraint of trade, trade unions, and associations of employers or of employees for industrial purposes, in chiding the formation, dissolution, regulation, and control thereof. tirely with State control. late to that effect. gives power to legislate. sary power in order to round off our proposals for ensuring industrial peace and generally regulating the relations between employer and employee. If a great trust or combine is acting directly in restraint of trade, or an association of employers or employees is taking action that is detrimental to the whole community, some authority must have legislative and administrative power to intervene. The tendency of modern industry is towards combination, which often proves the most effective method of maintaining and expanding an industry. There is no objection to combinations that are functioning reasonably and giving better and cheaper service to the community. But society must protect itself against combinations which obtain a stranglehold upon the community and proceed to exploit it for their own benefit. It is essential that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have some We are power to deal with an evil of that kind. There is need also for statutory power to deal with the trade unions and associations of employers. Trade unionism It w ill be. a has gradually developed into one of the most poAverful forces in the community, but for some reason, possibly the opposition and dislike of many reactionary employers, it has never received complete legislative recognition. To-day there are no statutory provisions to safeguard the rights of individual members of trade unions and ensure that their moneys arc employed as they desire. Many members of unions may have no certain knowledge of the use to which the funds they contribute are being applied, and. I think that the average unionist is beginning to recognize that he is entitled to the same protection as other sections of the community enjoy, and a guarantee that the affairs of his organization are conducted within the law. Each of the States has some legislation for the control of trade unions, but the power to legislate on the lines I have indicated has never been exercised. To those members who are sceptical regarding the Government's in tentions I give an assurance that I have no desire to interfere w i th trade unionism. On many occasions I have made it clear that I do not wish to hamper the unions in their legitimate function of collective The clause simply bargaining in order to improve the conI t is necesditions of their members.

The Commonwealth Government has a limited power to deal with any person who interferes with essential services contracted by tbe Commonwealth, but it has not the power to eusure the continuance of those services, and of others which are equally essential. The power to punish is of no avail unless the fear of incuiring such punishment operates as a deterrent. The Commonwealth must be empowered to ensure the noninterruption of essential services, and that is the aim of this proposal. I trust that it will never be necessary for the Government to take action in this direction; but any government would be recreant to its duty that did not safeguard the in terests of the people should the necessity for doing so arise. amendment is vital, and I cannot think it possible for any person to raise an objection to it . A few wild extremists may believe that they should be permitted to hold the country to ransom, and, by bringing the people tp the verge of starvation, effect the purpose that they have in view; but the vast majority of the people favour the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes. This amendment w ill improve the machinery by the use of which such a settlement is sought to be attained. vices < which industries are dependent for the continuance of their operations without interruption. In Great Britain recently there was an attempt to hold up the nation, but it was not successful. I cannot understand any one applauding action which is designed to destroy a nation in order that some persons may gain what else that may be essential they think to be their rights. No person in the industrial, and even the this country should be allowed to deprive the people of vital services. As the Commonwealth Government has not at present the necessary power to provide for this, it has brought down this amendment, which I feel sure the majority of the people will agree should be inserted in the Constitution. Let honourable members think of what might happen if such a vital necessary as coal were withheld from the nation. The principal source of our coal supply is New South Wales. The Government of that State could handle the situation within its own borders, but such a Government as that of South Australia could do nothing to protect its people in the event of a long coal strike. The only authority that could protect the whole of the people is the federal authority, and at the present time its Constitution does not give it the power to do so. It is essential that we should have that power. It is conceivable that internally a position might arise as disastrous as external war; yet the Commonwealth authority has now no power to intervene for the protection of the nation. This will be a separate question for the decision of the people. The first question deals with the ordinary circumstances of our everyday l if e ; the second with abnormal circumstances. are to be asked ? which a referendum is usually submitted is, "" D o you approve the proposed legislation for the amendment of the Constitution ? "" The specific points covered by that legislation are not put to the people in a series of questions; they are asked merely to give their approval to legislation that has been passed by the two Houses of the Parliament. The need for some authority which will ensure the continuance of essential services is obvious. I commend the bill to honourable members.

[4.35] -The amendment does not go far enough. I think it proper that the commission should control the actual running of the trains, the fixing of freights, and so on; but the maintenance and staffing of the railways should be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, who has built up an excellent organization. We need have little fear that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner will do anything to disorganize the Territory railway services. It would be much better for his expert officers to staff and maintain the service than for the commission to do it . It would be yeai's before the commission could build up a good railway organization. hone the Minister will not press his amendment. I entirely disagree with the view of the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson). I hope that we shall get first-class men on this commission. I am sorry I was not in the chamber yesterday when the proposed salaries were under consideration. I know one gentleman in Australia who toioaild make a first-class chairman for this commission if his serviees could be secured.

It is preposterous to think of allowing the authorities in Melbourne to interfere with the railways, or any other utilit y in ihe Territory, after the commission is appointed. This amendministerial control that I should like to see abolished. Ridiculous things happen when railways and other departments in these far distant places are controlled from the capital cities. There is one train a week running fro m Port Hedland about 115 miles to Marble Bar, in Western Australia. On one occasion, a boat, which called at the port once a week or once a fortnight, was prevented by rough weather from getting to the wharf by the time the weekly train was scheduled to leave, but the departmental Department. officers sent the train away right on time, and would not delay its departure u n t i l the boat was berthed.

The women had to board in the town for a week u n t i l the next ordinary train ran, and the owners of the stud sheep had to charter a special train to send them to their destination. I sent a long telegram about the matter to the Railways Commissioner at Perth, and he saw how absurd the thing was, and issued fresh instructions, giving greater powers to the local inspector. Similar things occur in Darwin. I sincerely trust that we will give this commission f u l l power over the railways. We ought to give them as much power as possible. We cannot give them authority to borrow large sums of money, for Parliament must decide what money shall be spent, but we ought to give them all other authority.

We have been endeavouring for a long time to work our railways with a view to defence needs, and it is necessary from that point of view that the Government should retain control of them. Rapid transit often means a great deal to a nation, and we should not do anything that might prevent us from making f u l l use of our railways at any time. would be quite practicable for the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner to staff and maintain the Territory railways, and for the rest of the management to be done by the commission. 1.4.45] -Much delay is due to the . policy of administering the Northern Territory from Melbourne. w ill be continued if an attempt is made to carry out railway administration from the Seat of Government. occasions I have advocated that the local authorities in the Northern Territory should be solely responsible.

Earlier in the same clause, there is the provision that the powers of the commission shall extend to "" the prescribed part of the Territory,"" which, evidently, is that part situated north of the 20th parallel of south latitude. The omission from paragraph / of the words "" the prescribed part of the Territory"" may imply that the commission will have authority in relation to matters affecting the whole of the Territory. Subclause 2 may clarify the position. It statesThe Governor General may, by proclamation, declare tliat, as regards any power conferred and for that reason they should be issued on the commission by this act, the power shall only by the department. Sub-clause 4 of not extend to the whole of the prescribed part the clause under consideration readsof the Territory, but only to a specified portion thereof, It would appear from this that, although certain powers in relation to the whole of the Territory may be conferred on the commission, it will be competent for the Minister to limit such powers to the prescribed part of the Territory. which, deals with the administration of Crown lands, give the commission power over mining? agreed that mining is usually administered separately from questions connected with land development. I should like the Minister to indicate what is meant by the word "" Territory."" According to the definition in clause 5, the word means "" the whole territory""; but a different construction seems to be placed upon it in other clauses. Amendment negatived. [5.1] I move That after the word "" harbours,"" paragraph e, sub-clause 1, the word "" m in in g "" be intory unless we give them a chance to serted. My object in moving that amendment is to give the commission power to advise the Government on the subject of mining, which, as a basic industry, should receive special attention. gest that the amendment should form a separate paragraph. The possibility -of an important mining development in the Northern Territory should not be lost sight of. It is quite impossible for a government department in Melbourne to control mining efficiently in that remote part of Australia. It could do so only at great expense, and with considerable difficulty and delays. Mining prospectors are usually not rich in this world's goods, and they cannot afford the delays arising from control by a distant government. To what extent it would be possible, under a mining ordinance, to give f u ll power to the commission I do not know. It is doubtful whether it would be wise to allow the commission to issue mining leases. Great care is necessary in the preparation of such instruments, In addition to the powers specified in eubseetion (1) of this section, tbe powers of the Commission shall include the administration tlironghout the Territory of Crown lands in accordance with Ordinances made or to be made in pursuance of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910 or in pursuance of this Act. If power to deal with all Crown leaseholds, subject to the ordinances approved by this Parliament, is given to the commissioners, there can be no objection to allowing them to administer mining and control mining development. The Public Works Committee visited Darwin some time ago, and in a subsequent report to. Parliament directed attention to the handicap imposed upon those undertaking developmental work by the high cost of materials. The committee recommended that for a number of years the Government should remit all port and harbour dues in the Northern Territory. The firm of Vestey Brothers, I understand, took a vessel there to load 309 head of cattle, and the port and harbour dues amounted to £90. It is of no use sending people to the Northern Terrimake good, and if we are not prepared to give them concessions we should not send them there. If the cost of production remains as high as it is the appointment of the commission will achieve nothing. The Government should have stated whether there was an intention to give effect to the Public Works Committee's recommendations. The question of concessions on freights along the coast, also needs consideration.",31,Northern Australia Bill

It is true that the commission w ill control Crown leaseholds, but mining has been specifically excluded. In these circumstances the Government cannot see its way clear to accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. -Had I spoken on the second reading of the bill I should have emphasized two points. One relates to the means of communication, which I conceive to be the greatest need in the development of the Northern Territory, and the other to the conditions that, in my opinion, have m i l i tated so strongly against its development. As to the first, I shall confine myself here to improved methods of transport, for the world has now moved beyond the stage at which the development of territories is dependent upon railways. We have now, in the internal combustion T h a t is not so. engine, a more flexible, convenient, and economical means of transport at our disposal. I stress all three advantages of motor transport: flexibility, convenience, and economy. The development of this territory by railways involves prodigious expense. I listened last night with in terest to the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), whose description of the Northern Territory inspired me with an insatiable ambition to go there myself in order to see what manner of place it is. The speech of the honourable member, as recorded in Hansard, might well be used as an attractive mining prospectus. I venture to say that on the views expressed by the honourable member there could be floated in 24 hours a company that would interior. As to the advantages of railbe way transport, to which the honourable member referred, I do not propose to do more than point out that obviously a railway from Alice Springs to the present terminus in the north will cost millions of pounds. It will take years to construct, and many years.more before it will become a revenue producer. As a means of transport for either stock or troops, looking at the subject from two widely different angles, both of which are vitally important, it w ill be useless u n t i l the connection between the termini is complete. The country can be developed W ill not the warden far more economically, and speedily by roads rather than railways. I should agree with the right honourable member. ported as readily by motor trucks as by rail. The honourable member for the Northern Territory, who speaks from experience of the country, knows, as indeed every one does, that if a railway is constructed from one given point to another, it has to traverse relatively empty and unprofitable areas from which no traffic can be obtained, and that it leaves much fertile land unserved. A service such as I have suggested, however, would not be open to the objection of being rigid and undeviating. I and, I am sure, the country would be glad to learn the policy of the Government w i th respect to road construction, as its means permit, in this great undeveloped hinterland.

But we come upon the scene rather late in the day, and are very much as were the children of Israel. We find that all the choicest areas have been taken up. If the Ministei would place on. the wall of the chamber a map of the Northern Territory showing the natural water basins, the means for watering stock, and the areas of fertile lands that are held under long leases by individuals who for years have not been doing anything with them, honourable members would be astonished. I remember very well that when this matter was considered last session we were all astounded to learn the extent to which lands in the Territory had been monopolized, and the way in which the choicest areas had been taken up. bad if those who hold the lands worked people demands for access .to natural them. things are now the honourable member If we make roads in the Northern Terriwill not deny that they are bad. leases were granted upon the unsay that an expenditure of far less than derstanding that the lessees would develop have If we are to have a policy of destructed.

These conditions are such as to give us pause, and if the commission is to be powerless to remedy them, I do not think very much w ill come of its appointment. I am not one of those who believe that very much w ill come of the appointment of the commission in any case. The development of this great Territory must await its natural course. Nothing can force it very much against its progress. We beyond the pace which the general circumstances and development of the whole the expenditure, not perhaps country will set. I have thought it well bo emphasize the fact that amongst the We are committed by factors which have most seriously militated against the development of the Northern Territory is the assignment to lessees, under long terms, of huge and relatively fertile tracts which embrace in some, if not in all, cases the only available water, or surface water at any rate. I have in my mind's eye now a picture of the Northern Territory as it has, been ""peacocked"" by the great lessees. I hope that the policy of the Government, which, I assume, will be regarded as a direction by the commission, will be such as to counteract as far as possible the folly of previous administrations. Honourable members will not forget that many of the Northern Territory leases were granted by the South Australian Government. 1 trust that the Government will carry out a policy of road development, and w ill impose conditions which w ill make it impossible for the great lessees to continue their present methods.

I could understand the opposition to this arrangement if the committee had failed to do its duty in the past. I point out, however, that the inquiries and recommendations of the committee have resulted in the saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds. The mere fact that proposed works of an important character have to be reviewed by the committee makes departmental officers careful in framing rheir proposals. Prior to the appointment of the committee, heads of departments were apt to submit their proposals to Ministers without thorough inquiry as to whether economies or improvements could be effected. If the proposed commissioners were given a free hand to spend money as they liked in North Australia without reference to tlie Public Works Committee, there would be clanger of a serious waste of public money. Although we are told that the proposals of the commissioners w ill be submitted to Parliament, members of this chamber would not be in a position to criticize them in the absence of a report by the committee. for all the members of the committee to visit the Territory to investigate proposed works; but a sectional committee could be deputed to do so.

RILEY No matter where public expenditure may be proposed, the committee could be of invaluable assistance to the Commonwealth. All that is allowed on the Estimates for it is a paltry £2,000 a year. I had the honour to be the first chairman of the committee, and in its first year we did not spend the whole of the money voted. The Government imported a man from America to design the Federal Capital. Mr Griffin had big ideas about Canberra, and proposed to spend huge sums of money on ornamental lakes. He desired to install septic tanks instead of an outf a l l sewer. The Public Works Committee rejected a number of his proposals of that nature, and saved the country hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr Griffin was described as an expert; but, when the committee examined his proposals in the light of expert evidence by other engineers, it was discovered that they were not worth adopting. The committee has not failed in its work in the past, ancl I am. satisfied that it can save money in the Northern Territory.

All honourable members have the highest respect for the committee, and recognize the splendid work it has done for Australia in many directions. There is not the slightest intention to infringe upon any of its rights or deprive it of any of the work that it can suitably do. But, looking at the matter from another aspect, Thei t seems to me that to bring important works in the Northern Territory under the control of the committee in any way would perpetuate one of the faults that the bill seeks to eliminate; I refer to control from Melbourne, and the consequent delay which is feared by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster). honourable members should support the Ministryi n this matter for",43,Pairs

There is a special stipulation in clause 23 that the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act shall not apply "" unless directs."" rately to say whether any particular work is of such importance that it should be referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report.

If it were the intention only to appoint a Australia, as in Central Australia, it probably would be advisable to have his recommendations investigated by the Public Works Committee, but it is in tended to appoint also a commission of three members. Presumably they will be the best men who can be obtained. Surely their recommendations ought to be placed before this Parliament without the intervention of another committee ! Such intervention would be an unnecessary duplication. A very strong argument in favour of the clause as it stands is the geographical If that Territory were not so f a i distant from the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, it might be practicable to submit to the Public Works Committee every proposition that was advanced. An additional safeguard is the provision that if a proposal is put forward which requires to be handled' cautiously, Parliament may refer it to the Public Works Committee. MT .

I trust that Ministers w ill use all their influence to resist it , and that, should the division go against them, they will withdraw the measure and have it recast. Last night I pointed out what I considered was a very great weakness in the bill. It seemed to me that it was proposed to set up a dual administration. There is to be a commission, which will deal very largely the Parliament otherwise with physical development, and there is The way is thus delibealso to be a Government Besident to look left open for Parliament after aborigines, police, and other minor services. Those two authorities will probably require expensive secretariats and separate staffs, with the result that there will be a good deal of overlapping. The Minister( Mr Marr), in defending the measure, emphasized the fact that the commission would be one essentially of development, that it would devote almost the whole of its time to the physical needs of the Territory. Now we are being asked not to trust the commission, but to insist that it shall bow to the will of the Public Works Committee, which is, and will be, composed of men living in the southern half of the Continent. AlthoughI have every respect for the ability and knowledge of the Public. Works Committee, I trust that the amendment will not be resident commissioner in North insisted upon. I was greatly surprised to note the support given to the amendment by the honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Biley). Last night an amendment was moved providing for the election of at least one commissioner by bhe residents of the Territory.

The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) argued that the geographical position of the Northern Territory rendered it inadvisable to refer the that this democratic Parliament shall proposals of the commission to the Public Works Committee. Its geographical position, in my opinion, is a very strong reason for the adoption of such a course. Whoever was appointed to the commission, I do not think he would be unwilling to have his proposals investigated. I expected apposition to the amendment from the honourable member for Boothby (Mi-.

Those who have visited the Northern Territory can vouch for the fact that no other portion of Australia is more suitable for the raising of cattle. It is not the Public Works Committee that some honourable members dread, but have a say in how public money shall be spent. We should control public expenditure, and I intend to< do my part in ensuring that we do it. I hope that this committee will rise to its responsibility. Works of an important character will need to be constructed in the Territory, and there should be a thorough inquiry into every project of any magnitude. No harm can be done by submitting the proposals to the Works Committee, and a good deal of public money may be saved by doing so. I ask the committee to give this plan a trial. If it is found to be unworkable it can be rejected.

A t present when an expenditure of more than £25,000 on any public work is contemplated, the Minister concerned submits the proposal to this Parliament, and moves that it be inquired into by the Public Works Committee, and Parliament says yes or no. that that could also be done with proposed Northern Territory works. member for Bass desired the Northern Territory to be developed rapidly. M t .

My reason for supporting the smendment is that, notwithstanding my earnest desire to see the Territory developed, I cannot agree to Parliament sacrificing its right to control f u l l y all public expenditure. In his excitement, before the dinner adjournment, the Honorary Minister( MrM a r r ) made some amazing statements about the Public Works Committee wandering all over the Northern Territory. My reply to his remark that that tour cost thousands of pounds is that it was the first big motor trip that was ever undertaken into the interior of Australia. The Works Committee pioneered the track. It was an entirely different thing to take a parliamentary party like that through the Territory from making a flying trip from Oodnadatta to Darwini n a single motor car. The position to-day is entirely d if ' ferent from what it was five years ago. If the commission wished to undertake some big water conservation scheme in the Macdonnell Ranges, and the matter I do not was referred to the Public Works Committee, the committee could go from Melbourne to Oodnadatta in three days by train, and it could get from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, which is right in the heart of the Macdonnell Ranges, in another two days by motor. Looking at the matter from the stand-point of No r t h Australia, I suggest that one of the first projects this commission w ill recommend w ill be the extension of the railway from 1 contend western Queensland to the Barkly Tableland. The Honorary Minister suggested that, in order to get to the heart of the I thought the honorableBarkly Tableland, it would be necessary to go to Darwin. kind. ter is that if the Public Works Committee had to inquire into a project like that, it could get to Brunette Downs, which is in the heart of the Barkly Tableland, quite I think I may say easily without going near Darwin. The only Territory projects that are likely to cost more than £25,000 are road making, bridge building, railway construction, water conservation, and I have delivered adharbour works. The expenditure of £25,000 on a public building is not likely to be contemplated in the Territory for Yet the honora long time to come. ture of £25,000 on bores? brought down a proposition to spend £25,000 in one year on bores, I should be greatly astonished.

If , however, thero was a scheme to construct a line as suggested by the honorning) much nearer the centre of Queensland, I would support it . ference to the attitude of the honourable member if the Public Works Committee recommended the line into Queensland? I believe that any Public Works Committee that traversed the country covered by the sub-committee a few years ago, would make the same recommendation.

The Minister has not done so. I have listened attentively to the speeches of various honourable members. If I thought for a moment that my amendment would in any way delay the important work that will be entrusted to the commission, I would immediately withdraw it . According to the bill the commission, before it puts in hand works other than ordinary development schemes will report to the Minister, so that either the Minister, or the Government, will f u l f i l the functions of the Public Works Committee. This, I submit, is entirely wrong in principle, and a serious evasion of the act. at rest the mind of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) concerning the personnel of the Public Works Committee. Members of that body do not pose as experts, and I think it is rather fortunate for the country that they are not experts. If the honourable member were a member of that committee for a month or so he would find that it is the experts who disagree with one another, and he would then realize how desirable it is that a decision with regard to important public works should be in the hands of men endowed with ordinary common sense. I agree that it may not be convenient to refer many Northern Territory works to the Public Works Committee for special 'investigation, but the Minister mentioned road construction proposals. I daresay that officials of the various departments can, whenever they deem it desirable, in form a Minister how to avoid referring any particular work to the Public Works Committee. I am inclined to think that this is done fairly frequently, and I have no doubt that sionally it may be prudent to adopt that course. But I submit that in connection with works such as railway construction, the more publicity that is given to any proposal the better. I am sorry that the debate on my amendment has taken up so much time, but T believe that the discussion has been justified, and .1 have no doubt that the committee is (Lilley) [0.8] I now prepared to vote upon' it . Much of. the discussion that has taken place on this amendment has been due to what I regard as an over liberal interpretation of the clause. I should have been surprised if the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) and the son), had not protested against such wide powers being given to the commission. Apparently, they see in this an interference with the special functions of the Public Works Committee. As a matter of fact, the bill does not propose to take anything out of the hands of that committee. The safeguarding provision, is to be found in the last words of the clause"" unless the Parliament otherwise provides."" What would be tlie use of appointing a commission specially to enI should like to' set sure the development of Northern Australia if every proposal made by that body had to be referred to the Public Works Committee? in the clause there is nothing inconsistent with the rights of the Public Works Committee. The Parliament may at any time specifically submit proposals to the Public Works Committee for in vestigation and report. If the bill proposed to take out of the hands of the Public Works Committee every reference to public works in the Northern Territory, there might be some special deprivation. But it does not. All that the bill proposes to do is to appoint a commission for the special purpose of i m parting some l if e into schemes fov Northern Territory development. If for some special reason, certain works should be referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report, Parliament w ill have the power to take occathat course. It is quite natural that the honourable member for Lilley should be jealous of the prerogatives of the Public Works Committee; but I think he is mistaken if he believes that, in respect of all Northern Territory problems, power is to be taken out of the hands of that body.",49,Pairs

217,Mr Rodgers,"As a matter of fact,Every recommendation made by the commission may, if Parliament so decides, be referred to the committee for investigation and report. important question that arises in this debate is, shall we hand the government of Australia over to commissions? If any honourable member will cast his mind back a few years and recall how many commissions have been created to do various things, he may be excused for concluding that there will soon be no duties for the Parliament to perform. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Other works, if their cost is estimated to liodgers) said that if the commission could uot spend the paltry sum of £25,000 on a public work without the consent of the Parliament, its appointment would not be justified. My reply to the honourable member is that this bill provides that the Parliament must authorize an expenditure of £25,000; but what the -honourable members who support the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) are insisting upon is that this Parliament shall give a considered opinion on proposals for the construction of public works. What machinery have we devised for giving an informed opinion? The only way in which the Parliament can inform itself is by submitting such questions to committees that have its confidence. This Parliament has again and again expressed its confidence in the Public Works Committee, and one of the departures made in recent years in the control of public works was the appointment of that committee, which is representative of both sides of the House and of both Houses of the Parliament. The Parliament places a considerable amount of trust in the integrity of the members of the committee, and from what I have observed in the last few years I am satisfied that that committee has saved this country a large amount of money. The Honorary Minister in charge of the bill argued that there would be considerable delay in carrying out public works while the committee was careering round the Northern Territory. I point out to the Minister that it is not necessary for the committee in all cases to visit the locality concerned to decide whether a certain public work is necessary. Many proposals could be examined without the committee leaving Melbourne. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) asked, ""What is the use of appointing a [87] commission if its work is to be supervised by a parliamentary committee ?"" The committee, however, supervises the recommendations of the .Canberra Commission, exactly the same procedure as is set out in the Public Works Committee Act. Proposals must be laid on the table of both Houses of the Parliament. a proposal shall not be submitted to the Public Works Committee unless the Parliament otherwise orders; but that is not the way we deal with other public works. exceed £25,000, automatically go before the Public Works Committee. If the commission is to submit proposals to the Minister, and the Cabinet and the Minister are to prepare bills and submit them to this Parliament, the Works Committee will not have a chance to investigate before the questions involved have been decided. If the Parliament orders that a proposal shall be investigated by the Public Works Committee, the bill must be hung up. If the committee presented an adverse report, the Government, which would have committed itself on the question before receiving the report of the committee, would have to climb downwhich is not likely-o r proceed with a scheme which would not be in the best interests of the country. the table of both Houses. a principle that when it is proposed to expend large sums of money on publie works, a committee that represents both sides of the House shall examine the proposals and report to the House on them. This House has more confidence in the investigations of such a committee than in any one-sided statement. There are other ' questions that ought to be ' considered by representative committees of this House. Taxation bills have been presented every year since I have been a member of this House, and periodically bills are brought down to amend the original bills, through which various people have been driving coaches and horses.

We know nothing of the personnel of the proposed commission, but we are asked to agree to abrogate a law which has stood this country in good stead. During the debate on this bill the Minister, in attempting to bolster up the practice of his Government of indiscriminately appointing royal commissions to manage this and govern that, proudly pointed to the Canberra Commission as about the last word in commissions. W it h much of that sentiment about the Canberra Commission I and many honourable members agree, but we hold quite different views with regard to many other commissions. quite a good case for the Canberra Commission, and before he had finished auy doubts that might have been entertained by honourable members about the ability of that commission must have been dispelled.

The system under which the Public Works Committee investigates proposals has not grown up haphazardly; it is not an accident. It was devised because of the early experience in the different States of incompetent officers, incompetent ministers, and incompetent governments embarking on costly works that ended in bungling. -committee to investigate proposals for public works came before the Parliament, a more sinister matter arose.

I am not sayingthat "" boodling "" or bungling will occur in the Northern Territory, but if bungling does not occur, there must be a departure from the methods of the past. The present Government is not free from responsibility in that regard. Proposals for the building of railways, the construction of wharfs, and other public works and utilities in the Northern Territory, should be subjected to the same scrutiny as proposals for similar works in other parts of Australia. During the time that I had the privilege and honour to be a member of the Public Works Committee, the committee took evidence The Minister made out from men possessing some of the best brains in Australia. We interrogated structural engineers and exnerts in water and sewerage undertakings. Many of those men were officers of the Commonwealth, and after being on the committee for any length of time one could not fail to be impressed with the calibre of the architects, engineers, and other expert officers holding important positions in Government departments. NotwithWe do not standing the undoubted integrity of these men, notwithstanding that they have the complete confidence of this and many previous Governments, and of all political parties, no one suggests that their proposals should be exempt from investigation by the Public Works Committee. When the first Public Works Committee was appointed there was a cold suspicion in the minds of some Commonwealth officers whose work had previously not been subjected to scrutiny and investigation. On one occasion two departmental officers treated the inquiries of the Public Works Committee rather contemptuously, but as Before the suggestion of a its investigations continued departmental officers realized the benefit, not only to the Government, but to themselves, of an inquiry by an impartial body. I can Honourable members reconceive that members of the commission will welcome investigations by the Public Works Committee into the tindeiy takings which they propose.

[9.55] -This clause deals with the division of the Northern Territory into North Australia and Central Australia. The proposed division w ill be more imaginary than real, because the Government Residents and the commission will between them control administration over the whole of the Territory in respect of police and police courts, postal matters; lands (including pastoral and agricultural) , mines, primary producers, railways, taxation, and Customs. All these services w ill be administered from the north, and yet we are told by this clause that North Australia and Central Australia shall be administered separately.

The clause goes further, and prevents tlie council from tendering advice on any matter relating to the powers of the commission, or under control of the commission. If the advisory council is to have no responsibility we cannot expect its members to work in harmony with the commission, because they will feel right from the beginning that their only function will be to let off hot air, as was stated in another place. We want a progressive council whose advice will he of some value to this Parliament and to Australia generally.

In another place, Senator Pearce said that it would be a safety valve to take the people of the Territory into the confidence of the administration, and get them to exhibit some interest in the work performed by the advisory council.
