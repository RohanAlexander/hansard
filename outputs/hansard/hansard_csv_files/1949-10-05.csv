11,Mr Chieley,"I am aware of -tbe <thM ,ike matter he has .raised is '.beingis being used for non-essential purposes, it has not been possible to obtain sumcient petrol to enable the' auxiliary power plants in that city to produce power for industrial! purposes. That position shows how inequitable the present situation can be. There should be a definite scheme of distribution!. In addition to such essential services as auxiliary power plants there are also the need's of many primary producers to be considered. -Under' the law, however, owing to the Interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court of Australia, the Australian Government at present has no poweT to control the distribution of petrol. The High Court has held that the States have complete power to control petrol distribution, and the Australian Government ha'"" put. the position very clearly to the States', aud has surpp'liedi them with all the infoimation available on the subject. The States reached a decision last 1 week. to ref er the necessary power to the Commonwealth, whilst others are prepared to pass certaiin legislation, as they recognize at last that the present system is inequitable. I shall examine the matter that tbe honourable gentlem-aii' has raised, but I must emphasize that under present conditions' the distribution of petrol rests 1 entirely with the dastrihutors and tlti 1 companies themselves, who alone have thc power to decide whether ambulances, auxiliary power plants, primary producers or other essential users shall receive petrol or not. I hope to be able to mwkt! a further statement on this matter, probably later this week. Mrs. BLACKBURN I ask the Minisform the Bouse who were his advisers m ter representing the Minister for Social this matter ? What is their status in the Services what provision is made for the cattleIndustry, aind what actual ex-care of widows and children of hntmiperience have they haidi of theearrtaige of grants' who have died since enteringAuscattle hy road for long distances in the traEa?

If,, after leaving the reception camps,, the women mentioned, should suffer the. disaster of losing their husbands, they would be eligible not only for widows' pensions but also for other social services benefits, that are enjoyed by the people of this country. I poiut out that some of the migrants now in reception, canips will be released and placed in industry this week. Eor the period they are in reception camps migrants are provided with' food, shelter, medical attention and other care, and the Department, of Immigration defrays expenses associated with the death aud burial of migrants whilst iu those camps. Presumably the honourable member is concerned about how quickly women migrants may obtain the widows' pension if their husbands should die aud they are left destitute. Under Certain States are prepared existing provisions, if the husband of a migrant was killed while working, in industry,, the widow would immediately become eligible for social services benefits similarly to native-born Australians in such circumstances. direct to the Prime Minister relates to the proposed expenditure of large sums of money in the construction of longdistaaiceroads in the Northern Territory for the transport of cattle.

13,Mr Blain,"The question that Icarry cattle successfully for lengthy distances and do not intend to again use that means of transportation? honourable member for the Northern Territory has previously advocated the extension of the railway system in the Northern Territory. There is a very wide difference of opinion on this subject. Whilst some people contend that additional roads should be constructed in the Northern Territory to provide for the cartage of cattle for long distances hy road vehicles, others contend that the position would best be met by the extension of the railway facilities. Another school of thought favours a combination of both rail and road transport of cattle in the Northern Territory. I can understand why previous governments during the past 25 years have not made a decision about this matter. When I presided over a large conference of people who were supposed to know something about these matters, particularly with relation to the Northern Territory, I found that there was a very wide diversity of opinion about the best method of transportation of cattle. In the light of the advice of the Cabinet snb-committee which is dealing with this matter the Government realized that, quite apart from the merits or demerits of the respective means of transportation, it would take a long period of time to lay down long stretches of railways in the Northern Territory, because the materials necessary would not be available for many years. This Government is anxious to develop that area as quickly as possible. I have discussed this matter with two men in high positions, closely associated with the cattle industry and meat production generally. I discussed the matter with one of them whilst T. was in London, and with the other in Australia. They both agreed that, in view of the physical difficulties involved, the Government should proceed with the construction of long-distance roads in the Northern Territory if it desired to further its plan for the developfer some of the new Australian women-, ment of that area for cattle production. Opinions have been expressed that certain roads may be built, but to construct very long stretches of road would be physically impossible. If we waited for such roads to be conr structed, the development of the Northerns Territory would proceed very slowly I know that the indeed. Some people agree with the honourable member's contention regardring the construction of railways, but others disagree with him. Many expertsbelieve that some railway constructionshould be undertaken and that otherareas should be catered for by road transport. Differing opinions have been expressed about the desirability of sealing such roads a3 are constructed. TheCabinet sub-committee includes the Minister for Works and Housing and the Minister for the Interior, both of whom know the Northern Territory very well. for Transport also a member? mittee also includes the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction, the Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture and myself.. In addition, a departmental committee has been established under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Department the Government in this matter. That, committee has sought the advice of per sons who are closely associated with thecattle raising industry. I want to make it clear to the honourable member that the construction of long stretches-of railw.""within a reasonable time is physicallyimpossible, and that, havingregard toall the circumstances, we must adopt the most rapid form of development available to us. Labour and National Service statewhether it is true that the work of thealready over-taxed staffs of our infectious diseases hospitals has been increased astho result of the infantile paralysis epidemic?

It is also true that something has already been done and that a good deal more can and will be done to help them. Recently, an investigation was made to ascertain how many women migrants in reception camps had had hospital nursing or medical orderly experience, either in their own country or in the camps in which they have been living. Some have already been selected and sent to hospitals. An urgent call was made for assistance to meet the extraordinary circumstances brought about by the infantile paralysis epidemic which is now raging and during the week before last, twelve migrant women were sent to the infectious diseases hospital at Fairfield, Melbourne. The matron of that hospital was very grateful for their assistance. We have notified the branches of the Commonwealth Employment Service in all States where such hospitals are established of the possibility of securto-day or any other day. ing assistance in this way and we shall send additional women migrants from the various camps, if it is possible to do so.

Is the House likely to have an Nations the same kind of charge or comopportunity to discuss international plaint as that which was made before affairs before the Parliament rises for the the Trusteeship Council several months forthcoming general election ? for Fawkner asked a similar question to that territory. Another complaint is last Friday. then. is quite clear. A state of acute tension tion of my colleague, the Minister for exists between Russia and the countries which are accurately called the satellites of Russia in eastern Europe on the one hand, and Yugoslavia on the other hand. Pressure tactics are being adopted in relation to Yugoslavia, including the denunciation of one treaty and alliance and friendship after another, first by Russia, and then by the other members of the eastern group. The position is quite clear, and it has been shown at the meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations at Lake Success, that there is a definite state of tension between the countries to which I have referred. Wliether it is likely to go further is just a question of calculation. It does not seem likely that it will lead to war. The General Assembly of the United Nations is now meeting, and if there is any. further development, I have no doubt that the whole matter will come before that body.

24,Dr. Evatt,"-The existing NationalistExternal Territories. The view of Australia on those matters has been stated clearly and explicitly. It is that the dominating purpose of the administration of New Guinea and Nauru is the welfare of the native inhabitants of those territories. trations in New Guinea and Nauru .have considered that the unrestricted additions of ""Chinese or other foreigners would destroy the tribal >and village life. The Chinese are in Nauru by agreement with the Nationalist Government of China, and the conditions under which they went to that territory for the purpose of producing phosphate -were approved by the very government that has made the complaint to the United Nations. The honourable member for Wilmot has referred to the views of church leaders about our administration of New Guinea. I noticed a few days ago that a bishop of the Church of England has emphasized the same principle as that upon which the policy of the Australian Government has been based in administering the territories. That principle is the welfare of the native inhabitants, and the introduction of Chinese must be subservient to it. That is the policy which the Minister for External Territories has applied, and I have no doubt that when the Australian answer is given to the Chinese complaint, it will be eonVmcing. The difficulty about these international gatherings is that only the complaints that are made against Australia are given publicity. For every complaint there are a dozen statements which express approval of what Australia has done. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has advised maize and grain sorghum growers that export licences' wiill he granted for quantities up to 50 per cent, of the production for the 1949-50 season as was done in respect of the 1948-49 crop, which is now being disposed of? If so, what conditions will govern the issue of the export licences and will such licences be issued to co-operative organizations which sell in the interests of the growers? has indicated that export licences will be granted for up to 50 per cent, of the sorghum crop and that licences will be available to growers' co-operative groups. to the Treasurer concerning trade with Russia and the balance of payments between Australia and Russia. In 1947-48 Australia imported from Russia goods worth only £59,0S9 and exported to that country goods worth £2,858,0S8, or about 50 times the value of what we received. In 1948-49 the unbalance was even greater. Imports from Russia in that year were worth only £189 707, and exr ports to Russia were worth £12,360,186, or about 60 times the value of goods that we received. As Russia obviously does not pay for goods with goods, does Australia hold a large .and accumulating rouble balance? If not, is Russia paying in sterling and, in view of the rumours that Russia had a dollar surplus and was able to sell surplus dollars to the United Kingdom, would it be possible for the Soviet to pay some of the unbalanced trade debt in dollars? If Australia has a rouble balance, is there any immediate likelihood that it will be honoured with goods ? honourable member has iudicated, that Australia has had a very favorable trade balance with Russia, particularly during the last two years. That has been due to the fact that Russian commercial interests, or perhaps the Soviet Government, have been buying, wool extensively in Australia. I notice that there has .been no very great objection to receiving Russian money for our wool. Australia does not hold a special rouble balance, although Russia is, iu effect, a semi-hard currency country. Russia has been able to earn considerable dollar balances iu the United States of America. It has accumulated more dollars than it has been able to spend because, although the Americans had been buying considerable quantities of manganese ore and chrome from Russia, they recently denied certain capital goods to Russia. The Soviet Government then reduced the volume of manganese exports to the United States of America. However, I",15,Trusteeship Territories

28,Mr Chifley,"It is true, as theunderstand 'Chat America recently came to some arrangement with the Soviet 'Government by which considerably increased quantities of capital goods are now being exported to Russia. As a result, America is receiving once more fairly large quantities of Russian manganese ore. Australia, of course, has imported about 10,000 tons of manganese ore, which was purchased by the Broken ffill Australia does not hold a special rouble balance. The Russian payments finally appear in our sterling balances. bave not seen any official statement on the su'bject, and I understand that Russia at one time sold surplus American dollars to the Bank of England for sterling so that it could obtain capital goods from the United Kingdom. That is an example of the anomalies that arise out of the present currency situation. With the sterling obtained by the sale of surplus dollars, Russia was able to buy capital goods from easy currency countries. We have not .asked the Russians to pay for our wool in dollars. I cannot see that the overall positiou would be relieved if they did pay in dollars. If Russia has surplus dollars, and sells them to the Bank of England, those dollars finally get into the sterlingberra, or have homes here, and they may dollar pool, so that, in the long run, we are just as well off hy getting the dollars in that way as if we received them in direct payment for our wool.

I hope that to-morrow the Postmaster General or I will be able to indicate to the Parliament the terms of the order that the board now proposes to make. No thought has been given to amending the legislation under which the board has been set up. It is most unlikely that t.he legislation will be altered. General say during the 1943 general election campaign that the Australian Constitution gave no general power to nationalize industry? Nothwithstanding that firm understanding, did the Minister for Air, less than two .years later, introduce legislation which, he said, was for the nationalization of the airlines? Did banking bills designed to further the Government's socialization objectives become law? Have further socialistic moves since been made ? In view of these reported. broken no-nationalization pledges of the Attorney^General, how can the right honourable gentleman give any assurance that there will be no further attempts at socialization next year? ber for Wimmera has asked a very important question. I treat it as important. WhatI said is perfectly correct, and I said it again yesterday. The Australian Constitution gives no general power-and those are the important words-to the Australian Parliament to nationalize industry. There is no single legislative power to nationalize -possessed by the Parliament, unless one can point to a specific placitum of section 51 of the Constitution which deals with the subject-matter. the honourable member for Wilmot asked me a number of questions about the nationalization of businesses, the iron and steel industry and rural industries. In view of very misleading statements by bodies called constitutional leagues, which ought to know something or pretend to know something about the Constitution the sooner the trutn is known on this matter and understood generally hy the public, the better it will be. As every honourable member of this House knows, the fact is that the Commonwealth's power of nationalization must be found within section 51 of the Constitution. It is quite consistent with that section that legislation was introduced to deal with a specific subject like banking, because that is one of the specific subjects referred to in section 51. The limitation on the constitutional power in relation to banking, as determinded by the High Court, was found in another section of the Constitution. I refer to section 92. Therefore the answer that I gave is indubitably correct. The fact that specific legislation has been passed on a specific subject only proves the truth of my assertion that there must be in section 51 of the Constitution some specific head of power before the Parliament can legislate; otherwise the legislation is invalid.

37,Mr Ohifley (Macquarie,"Prim eThe payment of these grants has heen recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its sixteenth report which was tabled in Parliament yesterday. In arriving at its recommendations the commission has adopted, as it has done in past years, the principle of financial needs which, in practical terms, means that the special grants are intended to enable the recipient States, by reasonable effort, to function at standards not appreciably below those of the other States. details of the commission's calculations are set out in the sixteenth report, which I commend to the attention of honourable members. It will be noted that, in assessyear 1949-50. This second part of the ing the grants, the commission has made a searching examination of the finances of the claimant and non-claimant States in 1947-48-the latest year for which audited the procedure that I have described, the figures are availahle-and it has derived certain standards based on the financial position and practices of the non-claimant States in that year. As in the last eight years, the commission has adopted a balanced budget standard in arriving at the initial approximation to the assessed grants. The commission has then made adjustments to these initial amounts to take account of differences as between the claimant and non-claimant States in standards of social services expenditure and in the rates of taxation and the charges of State business undertakings. The latter item is the subject of adjustment by the commission for the first time this year. The net amounts arrived at after making these adjustments aggregate £7,396,000 and represent the assessed grants for the year of review 1947-48. Tn recent years the finances of the States have deteriorated substantially between the year of review and the year of payment and the commission has, therefore, followed the practice of recom1949-50 will be very substantial, and will mending, in addition to the grants assessed on the year of review, advance payments designed to bring the grants into sidered the sixteenth report of the Comline with the indispensable needs of the monwealth Grants Commission and has States in the year of payment. Because decided that the commission's recomof the extent . of the deterioration in mendations should, as in past years, be recent years, however, grants recomadopted. The commission's report indimended for payment each year have cates that, while adhering to the general tended to be less than the grants subseprinciples which have been proved over quently assessed on that year. This has the years, the commission has preserved L30] left the claimant States with fairly substantial deficits. In order to meet this situation the grants recommended by.the commission this year consist of two parts. The first part represents the difference between the grants now assessed for 1947-48 and the grants actually paid in that year. The amount involved is £1,354,000 and payment of this amount is intended to recoup the States concerned for the deficiency in the grants actually paid in 1947-48. The second Full part of the grants, which amounts to £9,700,000, represents the commission's estimate of the indispensable needs of the claimant Status in the current financial grants will be treated by the commission as advance payments to be finally adjusted two years hence when, in accordance with grants for this year will be assessed on the basis of the final audited results. Last year the special grants to the claimant States amounted to £7,450,000. The grants now recommended to meet the indispensable needs of the States, therefore, involve an increase of £2,250,000, whilst the total grants recommended involve an increase of £3,604,000 over last year of which South Australia will receive an additional £1,324,000, Western Australia an additional £2,018,000 and Tasmania an additional £262,000. In arriving at the grants recommended, the commission has taken account of the prospective shares of the claimant States in the coal strike emergency grant and the tax reimbursement grant which together should give the claimant States amounts aggregating about £3,315,000 above last year. As the special grants now proposed involve an increase this year of £3,604,000, it will he appreciated that, the total increase arising from these three payments to the claimant States in amount in all to nearly £7,000,000. The Government has carefully condue flexibility in its methods in order to meet changing circumstances and to further the objective of maintaining a proper relationship between the financial positions of the claimant and non-claimant States, so ensuring that all members of the federation shall be in a position to operate for the greatest benefit of the whole. adjourned.

46,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [11.34],"Thisexamine the course of the Parliament during the period of its life, particularly to see whether the funds estimated to he necessary for its continuance next year are justified. I also consider it appropriate, so that the puhlic shall he fully intion, to give expression to the views of formed on these matters, to examine whether the funds proposed are adequate for the purposes for which they are intended,and whether the Parliament, as aa institution, is carrying out the purposes for which it is designed. At the end of the Seventeenth Parliament I considered it necessary to point to a serious decline of this Parliament as an institution, a decline that indicated that parliamentary government, as understood by the British people down through the centuries of its development, had reached a stage in Australia where its importance, influence and practice had considerably decreased. I pointed out then that the Parliament traditionally had been the allpowerful instrument. The Executive had been drawn from the Parliament in the course of the development of British parliamentary practice, was responsible to the Parliament and eventually, and from time to time, had to acknowledge the authority of the Parliament over it. 1 went on to say that such had been the decline in the conduct of this Parliament, as an institution, in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament that the Parliament itself had become a mere rubber stamp for recording the decisions of the Executive. I said that it had voluntarily surrendered a great deal of its traditional authority and control over national expenditure, and that its power had weakened as the power of the Executive had strengthened. If these criticisms were well-founded, as I believe they were in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament, we must ask ourselves whether this Eighteenth Parliament represents any improvement on that state of affairs. I say that the unhealthy trends that were evident in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament have continued so that the Parliament has degenerated, and that not merely has it forfeited a great deal of its proper authority to the Executive, but that the Executive in turn has become merely a recording instrument for one man who dominates it, the present Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). Mr Holt. elaborating this matter, I believe that my own conclusions will be confirmed by other honourable members. There was a time when the Parliament as an institution was able, by means of amendments to legislaminorities among the people who made their views known to their parliamentary representatives, and were able to have them adopted, if the reasoning behind them was compelling and if the facts were adequate. But what has been our experience in the course of this Eighteenth Parliament? Erom time to time bills have been presented to us with the intimation that no amendments would be considered or accepted by the Government. Those bills had first been presented by the Government to the Labour party caucus and had been adopted by the caucus tn to to. It is not the function of a government, merely by virtue of its Parliamentary majority, to adopt only the legislation of which its parliamentary majority has approved at a caucus meeting. A government should not represent only a section of the people but should represent all sections of the country. The views of minorities should not merely be heard but, where they are soundly based, they should also be reflected in suitable amendments to legislation. But what has happened during the lifetime of this Parliament? What opportunity has been given to members on the Opposition side or to independent members of the Parliament to have any useful suggestion adopted by a government which has merely presented its legislation to its own party caucus and refuses to adopt any alteration to it? Therefore I consider that the Eighteenth Parliament has failed the people as a true democratic instrument, and it is my conviction that that has not been an accidental development. I believe that this decline in the prestige, authority and the usefulness of the functioning of the Parliament has been a definite plan which was set in motion many years ago. There has been a good deal of discussion in this chamber recently about the objectives of the Socialist party, as outlined at the 1921 Labour party conference at Brisbane. Without My point of order is that we are dealing, in committee, with a certain proposed",21,Parliament
47,Mr Thompson,"I rise to order!vote, and that the honourable member is making his speech as a second-reading speech. He is not referring to any of the items before us. I contend therefore that he should confine his remarks to matters connected with the proposed vote before the committee. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr we should consider the implications Burke) -It appears to the Chair that the lionorable member for Fawkner( Mr the future of democratic government Holt) is dealing with the Parliament as a whole. He is entitled to proceed along that line. clear link between my opening remarks, which were of a general character, and the observations that I shall now make with relation to the institution of Parliament. My point is that we are here as the guardians of the Parliament. We have been entrusted by the people of Australia with the responsibility for continuing this democratic institution, which has been developed by the British people for the free expression of their rights and independence against the authority of the State, whether the State of a monarch, the power and authority of a d ietator, or an Executive entrusted with the functions of an administration. All of these things should bow to the authority of the Parliament. I understand that that is what we, the representatives of the people, have been entrusted to maintain. I was about to develop the point that the socialist objective of Labour that was set out in specific terms at the 1921 conference that this supreme economic council had been watered down to some extent by explanations given in this Parliament during recent weeks by Government members. To my knowledge no attempt has been made at any time to water down, either in this Parliament or outside it, other proposals that were adopted at that conference and which relate directly and categorically to this institution of Parliament. I refer to the proposal that was brought foward at that time to take important financial functions and to place them under the control of a supreme economic council. No one could allege that that is not a matter of direct concern to the Parliament and one that should not properly be considered wheni we are dealing with the institution of Parliament. If it can be established, as I believe it can, that the Government is pledged to support not merely the socialist objective of 1921, but also the other proposals that were adopted by the conference of the Australian Labour party held in that year, and that in doing so it will take from the Parliament a great deal of its authority, it is very proper that of such a policy and its effect on in this ' country. Honourable members opposite will need very little reminder by me that at the time the socialist objective was adopted, there were also adopted proposals for the formation of a supreme economic council, which coincides very closely with the presidium that has been established in Soviet Russia. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member can develop this line of argument only insofar as it relates to the diminution of the authority of the Parliament. the conference that reached this decision are at present in this chamber. I propose to show by specific reference that they dealt with the effect of the formation of this supreme economic council on the functions of Parliament. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN Although that may be proved, if we were to go from one conference to another the debate would be endless. would take the place of the political Parliament in all matters relating to industry. Surely the Chair will agree that that is not irrelevant. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -The honourable member for Eawkner may develop his line of argument only to that extent. the right honorahle member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who has not been in his accustomed place for a considerable time owing to ill health, expressed when he was a leading member of the Australian Labour party, and which were endorsed by other members of that party at the time who also are now members of this Parliament.

That honourable member's line of argument is not directly concerned w it h the Parliament. I submit that the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) is entirely out of order. The appears to the Chair that the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) has covered his point with relation to the diminution of the power of the Parliament as shown in the increased power of the Executive, and now seeks to strengthen his case by reference to an earlier decision. It is not permissible for whatever to the Parliament. The honorhim to have resort to previous conferences other than for that purpose. to canvass the general proceedings of the conference I shall refer to the language that was used hy the right honourable member for Yarra at the time that he referred to the effect of that development on the machinery of Parliament. Surely that is in order? If this Parliament, as an institution, is under attack either by members of the Parliament or by people outside the Parliament, and proposals to reduce the authority of the Parliament are advanced by responsible public men, surely we, as members of Parliament, have a right to refer to the impact of those decisions upon us as an institution. I have some knowledge of relevance in these matters, and I assure the Chair that I am not trying to abuse or circumvent the ruling of the Chair. I shall confine my remarks strictly to matters having a direct bearing on the power of Parliament. On the occasion to which I have referred, the right honourable member for Yarra, in moving the establishment of an elective supreme economic council by a l l nationalized industries, saidThis was one of the immediate things to be done under the scheme. The first step was to employ Parliamentary machinery to nationalize the industry to give the community and the workers control of that industry. Then they would have government by the workers in the industry. That industry would then become a group, and each group would elect representatives to the Supreme Economic Council, which it would have to do with the chain of workers of the whole workers in industry. So far as the industry itself was concerned under the socialized State, it would really take the place of the political Parliament for all questions of industry. The Council would come only after the initial stages had been reached after nationalization. In reply to Mr Power, who was present at the conference, the right honorable member for Y a r r a saidThe objectives rendered it necessary to further away than the objective. The proposal then was to appoint a council of action to function as well. The DEPUTYCHAIRMAN The Chair has listened to the honourable member's remarks very carefully. It appears to the Chair that they have no relation able member himself quite clearly cited an extract about an industrial matter. I cannot permit that line of argument to be followed any further beyond the right honourable gentleman's statement and the development of it.' to the Parliament a statement by Mr. Power, who askedIf you control industry by tlie Supreme Economic Council under a state of socialization, what are the functions remaining for the other Parliaments? The right honourable member for Y a r r a said that there would he quite a lot of things they could sum up as social that did not come under industry, and international matters which the industries could not control. AlthoughI do not wish to transgress the rulin g of the Chair, I desire to point out that the proposal that was adopted at that time, by the conference, many members of which are also members of this Parliament, envisaged the Parliament as an institution that would deal w it h some international matters, and certain social matters, hut not with the great range of problems that come under the heading of commerce and industry. They were to be taken out of the hands of the Parliament and placed in the hands of this extra parliamentary body. This proposal, which has never been rescinded and still remains part of the programme of the socialists, is directed at the very heart of the Parliament as an effective instrument for carrying out democratic authority. It is intended that the council, which is not to be elected by the people of Australia as a whole,",23,Parliament

53,Mr Holt,"I shall therefore presentshould have full authority to deal with matters of industry and commerce, leaving to the shrunken Parliament merely some attenuated authority to deal with social and international problems. Gone is to .be the historic responsibility of the Parliament for controlling the nation's purse strings. That is the objective wbich the socialists are pledged to carry out. That is the proposal which they adopted iu 1921 and have never to this day rescinded. Hand in hand with the objective to which they are pledged is the formation of a supreme economic council which is to rule with all the authority of parliament leaving in its stead this shrunken shell. During the eight years of Labour rule, there has been a steady diminution of the authority and prestige of the Parliament. The Parliament has become an instrument which merely rubber stamps the decisions taken in the caucus, which in turn, takes its orders from the Cabinet as the result of direct pressure from outside The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN -Order! The honourable member is getting very wide of the proposed vote before the Chair. very wide scope to discuss the authority of the Parliament, but he must not continue along those lines. man, opposite, may not share my view. I leave it to fair-minded observers of the institution of the Parliament to make up their minds about this matter. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Orde r I The Chair has no view on the matter. It is merely confining the honourable member to a discussion of the proposed vote before the Chair in accordance with the Standing Orders. That vote has no relation to decisions made by the caucus. minded observers will have to make up their minds on this matter The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! If the honourable member persists in pursuing that line of argument, I shall ask hini to resume his seat. upon which I began my speech. If there has been a diminution of the authority of the Parliament, it is due either to the dominant personality of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), who has been able to force through caucus measures which are never permitted to he amended by the minorities in this Parliament either in the Opposition ranks or among honourable members who support the Government, or to the carefully considered plan that was adopted by the Australian Labour party in 1921 which had for its objective the almost complete usurpation by some extra-parliamentary body of the function of the Parliament as the controller of the nation's finances and of commerce and industry in this country. It is rather astonishing that the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt) should have occupied the whole of his time in considering matters that have no relation to the proposed vote now before the chair. regard that remark as a definite reflection He has been given on the Chair. a reflection not on the Chair but on the honourable member for Eawkner, who poses as an authority onfinanceand takes up the whole of his time in dealing with and other honourable members matters which are outside the ambit of the proposed vote. state of the committee.

On this occasion I note that he got one of his ofTsiders to do this for him. The right honourable member for North Sydney called attention to the state of the committee just after the honourable member for Fawkner, who poses as a custodian of the rights and privileges of this Parliament, had concluded a speech in which he ranted about subjects that have no relation to the proposed vote now under consideration. The honourable member for Fawkner, who resumed his seat with the satisfied air of a man who had nobly discharged his duty as a member of the Opposition, must realize that during the detailed discussion of the Estistaff. Discussion of the estimates for the mates honourable members are obliged by the Standing Orders to confine their remarks to the proposed vote under discussion. The committee is now dealing cvith the remainder of the proposed vote for the Parliament. vision is made for financing the cost of administration of the Senate. The honourable member did not deal with that subject. salaries of staff and expenses of adminisproposed vote for the Parliament. Intration of the House of Representatives. As the honourable member did not question that provision I assume that he is satisfied that there is good reason for the ingrounds on which to criticize the budget. crease in the vote from £33,400 to £41,000. The proposed vote for the Parliamentary Reporting Staff is £21,000, but the honourable member did not refer to that item. Does he criticize the proposed vote of £28,000 for the Library? He has not endeavoured to show that the proposed vote of £57,000 for the Joint House Department is excessive. He has not criticized the provision of £2,400 for the Public Works Committee, and of £2,600 for the Broadcasting Committee. I admit that last night the houorable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) referred to the proposed vote for the Broadcasting Committee, but the honourable member for Fawkner has not done so. Mr Thompson. The honourable member for Richmond endeavoured to convince his listeners that the Government was wrongfully expending public funds on parliamentary printing for party political purposes against the interests of the people. References have been made to the cost of publishing a booklet which contains general information about social services benefits. Numbers of people have asked me for copies of the booklet in order that they mayascertain whether they are entitled to receive benefits. Because the Labour Government provides that service for the people, honourable members opposite seize the opportunity to query the cost. They do not seem to realize that expenditure is incurred in giving that information. The last division of the Parliament relates to provision for the conveyance of members of the Parliament and others, and the maintenance of Ministers' and members' rooms, including the salary of Parliament should be restricted to the items that are included in those nine divisions. Honourable members opposite frequently claim that they have a profound knowledge of parliamentary proUnder Division 1, procedure and the Standing Orders, but 1 challenge them to show that their references to decisions that were made at a conference of the Labour party in 192.1 Division2 provides for the are in the slightest degree relevant to the deed, the mass of irrelevancies which honourable members opposite have spoken prove that they have found no legitimate Instead of submitting constructive suggestions for curtailing expenditure, they have made wild rambling statements that are completely unrelated to the proposed vote for the Parliament. However, their statements call for a reply, because the absence of a refutation may lead some people to think that those assertions are accurate. The honourable member for Fawkner remarked that the manner in which the Government treated the Parliament reduced its importance and authority as the supreme legislative body in the land. Other honourable members opposite voice a similar opinion from time to time, but there is no substance in their contention. The honourable member for Fawkner bas complained that when the Opposition submits a proposal, the Government ov the Parliament does not adopt it -I should like to hear the honourable gentleman explain his conception of a democratic institution. Does he consider that when a minority group submits a proposal, the majority group should say, "" We are opposed to it, but, in order to please you, we-shall adopt your view""? The people liave given the Labour party an absolute majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, but the honorablo gentleman complains because the Labour Government decides what the legislative programme shall be. The lionorable member referred somewhat scathingly to caucus. I invite him to recall whether the Opposition parties, when they occupied the treasury bench, took heed of the submissions of the Labour party iu this chamber. The honourable member spoke feelingly about the fact that thc Labour Government seeks the approval of caucus before it introduces legislation. I recall that when the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) was Premier of New South Wales, even his closest supporters did not know what he intended to do until he actually introduced a bill. I am. certain that rank and file members of the Opposition parties when they were in power were not given such a preview of legislation as rank and file members of the Labour party receive. All the assertions to the effect that the Parliament is an instrument which rubber-stamps the decisions of caucus, which, in turn, is dominated by Cabinet, are so much cant and humbug. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party may truly be likened to rubber stamps, because they blindly supported in the Parliament legislation about which they had not been consulted. member will begrudge the amount that has been provided in the estimates for the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Library and the other departments that are associated with the official control and functioning of the Parliament. If honourable members desire to discuss their own parliamentary allowances, they will have an opportunity later to do so. member for Fawkner says is correct, the parliamentary institution would not have an opportunity to consider the Estimates. Expenditure would be determined by a supreme economic council. tory die-hards in the past were hardly in favour of the parliamentary institution as we know it. They preferred that a hand-picked bank board should determine the financial policy of the country. orable member propose to deal with the budget ? to consider the Estimates, I was prepared to confine my remarks strictly to the items under consideration. HadI been in the chair, I should have asked the honourable member for Fawkner to indicate the item in the proposed vote for the Parliament upon which he was speaking, and requested him to relate his remarks to it. However, the honourable member departed considerably from the subject matter of the items under consideration, and I desire to reply to some of the statements that he made. ber reflecting on the Chair? cussing the proposed vote for Parliament, honourable members opposite have opened up a wide field for debate. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has referred to a suggestion that was made at the conference of the Labour party in 1921 for the appointment of a supreme economic council. I remind the honourable gentleman that there are visionaries on both sides of the chamber. At various conferences held by the Opposition parties, delegates have made suggestions that have been adopted, but honourable No honourable members opposite have not attempted to give effect to them. Although the Labour Government has been in ofilce for eight years, it has not attempted to put into operation the policy that was adopted hy the Labour conference in 1921. tried hard to do so. .Labour Government to oflice is evidence that the majority of the people endorse",25,Deputy Chairman I T Have A Supreme Economic Council I T Was Not

72,Mr Thompson,"The return of thethe policy of the Labour party. One of the planks of the political platform of tbe example. Labour party is nationalization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. When the Labour Government attempted to nationalize banking, its opponents appealed to the High Court and subsequently to the Privy Council, io have the legislation declared unconstitutional. Membera of the Labour movement and the Australian people generally are aware of the objectives that vere laid down at the Labour Conference in 192-1, but they are nofc alarmed, at the ""prospect. Honourable members opposite ire not likely to succeed with that bogy. C regret very much that the honourable gentleman took advantage of the discussion on the proposed vote for the Parliament to raise matters that I consider ihould have been dealt with in a different ivay altogether. I admit that honourable ""Uembers opposite have a difficult job. L'hey have been unable to find any just >;ause for complaint in the budget, and fthe task of trying to gain the support of the people for their cause is too much cor them. Therefore, they raise irrelevant matters in the hope that they can livert attention from the fact that they lave been unable to produce any valid triticism of the budget. They have tried n work off old scores, but they have been msuccessf ul. The people know very well hat the Parliament has not been funcioning in any improper way, and they mow that the present Parliament has lone more for them than any previous jarliament did. Honourable members who leery this institution and say that it merely serves the purpose of a rubber itamp should read the history of the Mother of Parliaments, upon which we ilaim that this Parliament has been' modelled. If they do so, they will read about great men like Disraeli and Gladstone, not about less important men such as, perhaps, the honourable member /or Fawkner and I may be. History tells of the great men who controlled the des:.tnies of their country from positions of leadership in the Parliament. The names -)f such men are the only ones that survive in our memories. Our parliamentary institution has gained its place in his democracy as the result of great men n the past Mr Thompson. the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) must be in agreement with me. He basks to-day ia the warmth of public respect that was created by the great acts that he performed in the"" past, chiefly when he was a member of the Labour party. Labour party kicked him out? did not kick him out. I still have a great deal of sympathy for the right honourable member. Nobody has heard me gibe at him for holding to his views at the time when he left the Labour party, and I do not gibe at him now. The right honourable member knows that. But I repeat that he is judged, not on what he has done during the last ten years, but principally upon what he did when he was a member of the Labour party. He will retain his place in history for that reason, and will be remembered when most of his contemporaries are forgotten. To belittle this parliamentary institution, as the honourable member for Fawkner endeavoured to belittle it, is to belittle the Australian people. When the people place a government in power in order to do a certain job and that government honours its obligation and is returned to power again with a handsome majority, it ill behoves the honourable member and others like him to gibe at the achievements of the leader of the Government and his Ministers. The bogy of a supreme economic council is something like the New Guard.' The honourable member for Wentworth will remember the New Guard, although I was not in Sydney when it existed and have little knowledge of it. The honourable gentleman no doubt recallsthe occasion when the present honourable member for Reid, as Premier Of New South Wales, was about to perform an historic ceremony and a member of the New Guard came along and spoiled things for him by cutting a ribbon prematurely. The New Guard is almost forgotten now, and the idea of a supreme economic council has been placed in the same category in the minds of most people.

When the chosen candidates assemble in this chamber after the general election preparatory to electing a new Speaker, the Olerk of the House of Representatives will see gathered before him men and women elected in the democratic fashion that all true Australians know and depend upon. I am sorry that I have digressed as I have done, but I believe that I was entitled to do so because of the way in which the honourable member for Fawkner digressed. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" I call the honourable member for Richmond, but wish to state my views concerning the latitude that should be allowed to honourable members in discussing the proposed vote now before the Chair. I have given a great deal of consideration to the matter, and it is -clear to me that a wide discussion would extend beyond the limits contemplated in the Standing Ordei's. I intend to confine discussion to the items in the proposed vote and, if necessary, will allow references to the Executive as opposed to the Parliament as a whole. I shall not allow references -to conferences and other such matters to be made. Such a restriction is necessary, because otherwise the discussion could range over all phases of parliamentary and non-parliamentary history. i& not limited merely to the proposed vote now before the committee. I point out that the practice of this Parliament, when sitting in committee to consider the Estimates, has been to permit discussion of the proposed vote for any department to relate to the activities of that department generally, not merely to the items set out in the proposed vote. practice. permit a general debate on each department. Discussion has not been confined to the individual items. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -The discussion may revolve around the subject of the Parliament, but I will not allow it to extend, back over the years because, in that event, there would be no limit to it. I am glad that you have given that ruling, Mr Deputy Chairman, because the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson), whose remarks went back to Gladstone and Disraeli, did not go far enough back into history. The honourable gentleman should have referred! to Magna Carta hecause that was the basis, of our parliamentary institution, and it. is in order to preserve the freedom that: was bequeathed to us The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Orde r I have very clearly ruled that references, before he rises to speak I of that nature will not be permitted. develop that line of thought, Mr Deputy Chairman. I merely say that the Parliamentary institution is based upon the freedom of the individual to express himself without constraint. I propose to discuss a number of items in the proposed vote. Divisions 1 and 2 refer to the Senate and the House of Representatives, and I direct the attention of the committee to the Government's lack of sincerity in implementing its policy in relation to the Parliament. I shall not refer to the Labour party conference in 1921, but I think that I may reasonably be permitted to refer to the triennial Labour party conference that was held at Canberra in 1948. I wish to raise a point that The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -The honourable member's remarks must be confined to the proposed vote that the committee is considering. that were made at that conference concerning the institution of Parliament, and to nothing else. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Fo r practical purposes I have ruled out of order all reference to such matters. not refer even to the 1948 conference.

It is interested in the question whether the amount of the proposed vote is adequate or not. cludes an amount of £25,000 for the Senate. According to the platform of the Labour party, it should be reduced to nil, because the Labour party's platform provides for the abolition of the Senate. Ear from that being done, however, the proposed vote is to be increased, because the Senate is to be increased from 36 members to 60. Can there be any sincerity in a party which proclaims that, if returned to office, it will abolish the Senate, and then The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -There were opportunities during earlier debates for. the honourable member to make such points. The Chair has given a clear ruling on this matter. The debate could be endless if honourable members were allowed to proceed as the honourable member is attempting to do. we are discussing a proposed vote of £25,000 for the Senate, we ought to he entitled to consider whether the Senate is necessary. According to the Labour party's own platform, the Senate ought to be abolished. However, the party has shown its insincerity by not abolishing the Senate when it has the power to do so. The Labour party has a majority in this chamber and in the Senate, but it has introduced no legislation to abolish the Senate.

The committee is not considering party constitutions, or party conferences from which such constitutions emanate. evade your ruling. I merely point out that if this Governinent, which has the support of the Labour party, really believes, in accordance with the platform of the Labour party, that the Senate ought not to exist, then the item of £25,000 which appears in these Estimates for the Senate ought not to be there. The Estimates provide £41,000 for the House of Representatives. A considerable part of that money will be spent on maintaining the prestige of Mr Speaker, and the other occupants of the Chair. We know that the Speaker of the House is the chief executive officer of the Parliament and controls the staff. Perhaps, on this item, I may be permitted to discuss the qualifications of Mr Speaker for his job. If I am not permitted to do so, you will check mc, Mr Deputy Chairman. Mr Speaker is the custodian of the privileges of memhers of the Parliament, and he controls the various employees of the Parliament. Therefore, it is proper, I suggest, for us to consider the personality of Mr Speaker, and of Mr Deputy Speaker, also. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are by no means satisfied with the treatment they have received The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -The honourable member is out of order. The conduct of Mr Speaker may be challenged only on a substantive motion in the House itself. It may not be done in committee.

I should like now to refer to item 3 on the Estimates of the Parliament-the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, whicli is Hansard.

Hansard, as we know, issues the bound numbers a considerable It is proposed to time' after the debates to which they refer have taken place, and it also issues day-by-day records of the debates in proof form.

What is the function of the one and what is the function of the other? One, at least, is superfluous. I say that both are superfluous. But one at least is superfluous. There is no justification for the Government's placing £2,600 on the Estimates for the purpose of providing jaunts for members of the Broadcasting Committee. When I said that last night, the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) said that when I criticized the committee I was criticizing members of the Opposition who were also memhers of the committee. But I remind the Minister that when the committee was reconstituted at the beginning of this Parliament, the Australian Country party would have so little to do with it that not one member of the party would accept nomination for appointment to the committee.

The committee is only a nuisance to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to every one else. It is merely a vehicle to enable Senator Amour to ""get things over "".

I believe that all the statements that have been submitted about a supreme council are answered, in a democracy itself; that Parliament in a democracy is the supreme body; and -that Parliament represents the humblest persons in the community no matter how poor they may be or how low on the social ladder. No matter how distressing their circumstances may be they can be given a voice in the Parliament. I also point out that the King's justice flows from His Majesty the King down to the humblest and sumcient that that should be actually so; it must also appear to be so. In the same way, it is not sumcient for this Parliament to represent everybody in the community; it must also appear to do so. I suggest, is under discussion in the Parliament the greatest possible latitude should be given. That would be the answer to those who say that democracy fails. Having said that I desire to address myself to the Estimates under discussion. There is no provision in these Estimates for the re-establishment of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts, although the Auditor-General has recommended that it be re-established. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) promised me last year that he would examine that matter which is, I believe, one of great moment and great urgency. The Estimates grant the Government access to specific sums of public money but without stating the specific purpose for which they are to be used. Both the Government, as the executive body, and this Parliament as the legislative body must accept the responsibility for the expenditure of that bility of seeing that that money is not only properly budgeted, hut is also properly expended. We must be satisfied that machinery exists to supervise its proper expenditure. Those safeguards do not exist at the moment. Our financial affairs are being conducted in a slipshod fashion. The Parliament that votes this public money has no satisfactory checks or balances. I say deliberately that when this committee of the Parliament votes approval for this expenditure, it does so blindly. But after the Parliament meets and assembles, as we see it to-day, it is not absolved from the overriding responsibility of seeing that the money that has been extracted from the pockets of the",34,Deputy Chairman Man Of Committees But We May Not

I bope that the committee is not satisfied-that adequate precautions have been taken against maladministration, waste, extravagance and inefficiency. Precautions against those dreadful things do not exist to-day. They are all the more essential because of the revolutionary changes that have occurred in the field of public expenditure during the past few years. The Parliament, this committee, and the people should know that the Government expends almost half of £500,000,000. The Australian Government is by far the largest employer of labour in this country. item in the Estimates now before the committee relates to the Parliament. So far we have only heard from the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) about the total expenditure estimated in the budget, of the cost-plus system. Minor officials and the number of Commonwealth employees. Is the honourable member for Reid in order ? The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -A t the present time the honourable member for Reid is in order. Under the division of "" Parliament"" there is a committee the activities of which have heen suspended. Whilst it is not competent for the honorinvolves every member of this chamber in able member for Reid to move the re-establishment of that committee, it is pervoting for the expenditure of public missible for him to discuss the matter. ment has a huge army of temporary public servants and it has huge contracts with private contractors in every corner of this country. The old system of public tenders has been discarded in many fields. Instead we have variations of the cost plus the real say in determining the amount of system. discussing the various Estimates under the heading of "" Parliament"". There are nine divisions in this particular group of Estimates. I suggest that the honourable member for Reid must relate his remarks to one or other of these divisions, which refer to expenditure incurred as a result of legislative action under statutory authority. I contend that the honourable member for Reid is not entitled to deal with a subject-matter relating to the investigations of a committee for which, because it was suspended by legislative action, there is no provision in the Estimates. orable member for Reid ought to confine his remarks to one or the other of the divisions in the Estimates under the general group headed "" Parliament"". The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! It appears to the Chair that the honourable member for Reid is in order is discussing the national income of over tlie Public Accounts Committee. That committee, which at one time scrutinized public accounts, was suspended by an act of the Parliament. It appears to the Chair that that matter can be discussed, but no motion can be made at this stage to reconstitute it. Accounts Committee, we have a variation have authority to purchase huge quantities of stores, whilst Ministers have the backing of regulations and government departments without reference to specific items in this Parliament. They now regard millions of pounds as farthings were once regarded. All of these elements have created a financial position that very heavy personal responsibility when money. Unfortunately financial statements are too often regarded merely as irksome figures without meaning. They are not measured by the committee in terms of bread and butter, as they are measured by the taxpayers who provide the money. I point out that of the 75 members of this committee one man has money to be voted. He has all of the say with relation to how the money is to be distributed between the different departments, and what secret reserves are to be established. The man who does all of those things is the Treasurer. That is his job in the first place, and rightly so. But it is the responsibility of this committee to see that he carries out his job in the best interests of the taxpayers who provide the money which he expends.

124,Mr Lang,"Instead of the old Publicof trust. They have exactly the same responsibility to the taxpayers as have the trustees of an estate to the beneficiaries in that estate, and as has the director of a public company to the shareholders of the company. It is no defence for a director of a public company to plead ignorance if the financial affairs of the company are mismanaged. He is paid to watch the affairs of the company and to guard the interests of the shareholders. It is his duty to see that the nnancial affairs of his company are not mismanaged. In exactly the same .way it is no defence for members of this Parliament to plead ignorance of the way in which public money is being handled by the Government. Yet there is an abysmal ignorance in this Parliament of the management of our public accounts. there has always been a great awareness of how the pounds, shillings and pence that are supplied to the government are expended. Members of the State parliaments have a detailed knowledge of how money made available to the government is being expended. No stray millions are left lying around. During the last few years there has developed in the Commonwealth a rather chaotic jumble in the administration of public finance. The Treasurer is niggardly in matters in respect of which he should be liberal. He is nasty and unkind in matters in respect of which, as a Labour mau, he should be truly liberal. On the other hand, powerful bureaucrats are spending public money on all kinds of undertakings. Their attitude could be summed up as one of, "" ""What is a million here or a million there? ""What does it matter? Money is easy to get these days "". These are the people behind the Government. That policy is evidenced by the huge subsidies paid to international organizations, by the lavish expenditure . on embassies abroad and by the welter of boards that operate in this country. Prior to the outbreak of World War IL , the Auditor-General had a comparatively easy task. Public expenditure flowed in normal channels and in accordance with a fixed code of practice. That code was, of necessity, scrapped during the war, but it appears to be in danger of being scrapped permanently, notwithstanding the fact that we are now expending more than five times as much as we expended prior to the war. In voting this money, it is the duty of every honourable member to satisfy himself that all possible safeguards are being taken in the supervision of the subsequent expenditure. Recently, I placed a number of specific questions on the notice-paper directing attention to paragraphs of the last report of the Auditor-General in which specific action was requested to deal with certain matters which arose during the year 1947-48. The Auditor-General was not satisfied that the present system of audit provides all the safeguards that are needed. He made serious strictures regarding contracts entered into by the Governnient in connection with aircraft In the State parliaments production. honourable member's remarks are related to the question whether a public accounts committee should or should not be established under the administration of the Parliament.

The only way in which I can support my case for the recon stitution of the committee is to show that something that is not right has been or is being done. I make that statement without any intention of being offensive. If I say that I consider that the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted, I shall be asked to support my contention with reasons.

Should subsequent discussions reveal that the existence of the Public Accounts Committee would have prevented undue expenditure on a contract, would you rule that that contract should not he used as an illustration of the need for the reconstitution of the Public Accounts Committee ? The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN -Such circumstances will be dealt with as they arise. I desire to seek some information, and I shall not digress from the proposed vote for the Parliament, which is now under consideration. There are nine divisions under this heading and the proposed votes for eight of them show increases compared with the expenditure in 194S-4.9. In other words, the Government expects a reduction of expenditure only in respect of Division 8, "" Parliamentary Printing"". The first item in that division' is "" Printing of Hansard, including cost of distribution "", for which the proposed vote last year was £18,000 and the expenditure £30,304. The estimated expenditure on that item during this financial year is £23,000, or £7,304 less than the actual expenditure last year. As the number of senators and members of the House of Eepresentatives will be increased after the forthcoming general election, 1 should like the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction ( Mr Dedman) to explain why the Government anticipates a reduction of expenditure on the printing and distribution of Hansard this year. Will the honourable gentleman state whether more machinery has been Hansard? We know that the postal charges will not be reduced. In passing, I pay a tribute to the Hansard staff for the excellent work that it does; but I cannot understand why the estimated expenditure for the printing and distribution of Hansard this year should be substantially less than the expenditure last year, when the increase of the number of senators and members of the House culation of Hansard. I refrain from pointing out at any length that the Government, by reducing expenditure on the Parliament, could make this institution an example for other departments to emulate. Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction) [2.56] -The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) has stated that Division 8, ""Parliamentary Printing"", is the only one of the nine divisions under the Parliament in respect of which the .estimated expenditure this year is less than the actual expenditure last year. The reason, I understand, is that in the twelve months in which a general election is held, the Parliament does not usually meet so frequently as in the other years. Therefore, in accordance with experience, it is estimated that fewer copies of Hansard will be produced and distributed in this election year. That accounts for the difference between the treatment of this item, and the treatment of the other divisions under the heading of "" Parliament "". Last year, the vote was for the printing of Hansard £18,000, and the expenditure was £30,304. The increased expenditure was due to the fact that arrears of work in. the printing office, due to staffing difficulties, had to be overtaken. That situation is not expected to recur this year. It is regrettable that, within the precincts of this building, there should exist in the bar for use by persons other than members of the Parliament, conditions which are, to say the least, quite primitive.

I suggest that something should be placed on the Estimates for the purpose of improving conditions in the downstairs bar, which is used by officers of the Parliament, public servants, and pressmen. Some years ago, pressmen and others were permitted to use certain parts of the main bar accommodation upstairs,, but that no longer obtains. Conditions in the lower bar are appalling. [ say at once that it is not the fault of those employed there, but of the existing conditions. I ask that some notice be taken of my remarks, so that the position may be rectified. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [2.59] I have previously mentioned, during question-time in the House, the lack of provisions in this building for members of the various staffs employed here. I took the trouble to find out just how many persons are employed, and the list is as follows:Library -Joint House, including Tefreshincnt-rooins (in session) Senate House of Representatives Parliamentary Reporting (in session) Ever since I became a member of this Parliament, I have been concerned over the fact that there is no staff room in the building. Seeing that more than 200 persons are affected, it is time the matter was looked into. Some time ago, I asked that provision for a staff room be made while the alterations were in progress. There is in this building no canteen, or place where employees may have their meals. There is no rest room. There is no staff room with lockers. There is uo provision for recreation, or leisure-time pursuits. Members of the House of Eepresentatives and of the Senate are employees of the public just as are members of the various staffs employed in this building. We, however, have pegs on which to hang our hats, but some of the employees lack even this amenity. That may seem a small matter, but it is one of great importance. The work of the Parliament could not be done effectively but for the members of the various staffs. Members of the Parliament have quite luxurious dining-rooms and billiardrooms, as well as other amenities. Mrs. BLACKBURN -B y comparison, they are. Recently, a member of one staff employed in this building was taken ill . I went down to the lower part of the building to see what care was being taken of her, and I was shocked at what I saw.. Every member of the Parliament should; make it his business to find out about thesethings. There is here no first-aid room,, and no first-aid kit. There is no provision for taking care of any person who becomes ill . I have not mentioned the typists employed by members of the Parliament and Ministers, nor have I mentioned newspaper employees, because there is more opportunity for them, I understand, to have care taken of them. We have just heard that there is a downstairs bar, hut there are no other amenities for the men and women employed in the building, and it is time that something was done about it. A room should be set aside for them. There .. 64 should be recreation facilities. Lockers should be provided, and, if possible, a can.. 100 teen. There should he, at any rate, a .. 16 place where employees ean eat. At .. 27 present, some of them, have to eat their lunch at their desks, with their hats 24 under their chairs. I object to that situation. port the references made earlier to the need for the re-establishment of a public accounts committee in this Par]lament. It is too late, of course, in the life of this Parliament to take action along those lines, but I hope that it will be found practicable by the suoceedinggovernnient to do so. It has been pointed out by other speakers that the Parliament had a standing committee on publicaccounts until 1932. But that was not the most recent occasion on which such a committee has functioned. Honourable members will recall that during the war the War Expenditure Committee operated. It was broadly a public accounts committee. As one of the members of the cominittee, I am sure that I speak for those who had the same experience as I had when I say that we felt that it did an extremely useful job and provided a useful check upon departmental extravagance. It was able to inquire into many matters. When investigation proved that there was-",39,Deputy Chairman Of Eepresentatives Indicates A Larger Cir

149,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [3.5],"I supnothing amiss, at least we had the satisfaction of knowing that, and the publie in whose interests we reported also had had that satisfaction of knowing that matters were on a proper basis. Wheu the War Expenditure Committee was terminated, because its peculiar war-time function ceased with the coming ' of peace, all the members of the committee, conscious as they were of the usefulness of the work that it had done, combined in making a unanimous recommendation to the Government that a peace-time public expenditure commitr tee be constituted. There is such a committee in the House of Commons, of course, and one is very necessary here, particularly at a time when government budgets are covering more than £500,000,000 a year. Without elaborating the point, I content myself with saying that it is necessary to give back to the Parliament some of the control that it should properly exercise over most of us prefer it. Choice of means of the expenditure of public money. We should have a standing committee on public accounts in the new Parliament. I propose now to deal with the item under Division 9, "" Conveyance of members of the Parliament and others for which an amount of £96,000 is provided. I feel that there has not been a proper adjustment made in the accounts of the Parliament for the circumstance that so many members now travel by air on their parliamentary duties. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) -can correct me if I am wrong, -but I understand that the Government pays exactly the same amount now to the Stale governments for the use of the railways by members of the Parliament as it did before air travel was instituted. T understand that an amount of £160 a year is paid in respect of each member of the Parliament so that we may have the privilege of travelling on parliamentary duties, on omciai occasions, or for aDy purpose on the Australian railways. Most -of the travelling that we now have to do, is clone by air, either necessarily or by choice. We make use of the Government's own service, Trans-Australia Airlines. Mi. BEAZLEY -Most honourable memhers vvould not spend more than £1 a year on rail travel. would spend more than £1 a year on rail travel. In the last two years I do not think I have had occasion to use my own pass on the railways at all. There must be many like me. That means that £320 has been paid out unnecessarily on my account at a time when the Parliament is under criticism for growing expenditure, particularly expenditure on the privileges of members. This is a matter that might be properly examined by the Joint House Committee or by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson). I do not suggest that the opportunities for travel ought to be restricted, hut I think savings could be made if the Government instituted a system of travel vouchers whereby members could travel by rail or by air. Air travel is the modern form of travel. We have become accustomed to it. On the grounds of comfort and convenience, travel could be granted, provided that in any one year the amount thaf. has been paid previously on behalf of the member for travel privileges was not exceeded. That might not suit memhers from country electorates who have to travel long distances and for whom air travel facilities are not readily available. That could be examined. I believe that if my proposal were investigated, the overall cost to the Parliament could be reduced and that the facilities available to members for convenient and speedy travel might be increased. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to have the matter investigated. I believe that we are paying for privileges whicli are neither not available or are not used under present -conditions. Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [3.10] I desire to reply to the two matters raised hy the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt). It is true that the Government pays£160 each for the gold passes that all honourable memhers have. The honourable member for Fawkner has suggested that instead of gold passes there should he a system whereby members would have a series of vouchers which they could use for either rail or air travel.

I think that the matter should be examined, and I am sure that the Minister for the Interior will have it examined. The honourable member also raised the matter of the resuscitation of the Public Accounts Committee. The honorahle member for Eeid( Mr Lang) has dealt with that matter at some length. I make it clear that the Public Accounts Committee was suspended in 1932, not by this Government, but by a government composed of gentlemen now in opposition. Honourable gentlemen opposite, when they occupy the treasury bench, take one line of argument. They say, "" There is no need for the committee. We shall suspend it "" . But immediately they find themselves in Opposition, they take the opposite line and say, "" Yes, when we were the Government, it was not necessary to have a Public Accounts Committee, but now that the Labour party is in power, we need it "" . Accounts Committee not suspended as an economy measure? honourable gentlemen opposite take one line when in power and a completely opposite line when in opposition. The honourable member for Fawkner in referring to the resuscitation of the Public Accounts Committee said that it was getting towards the end of Parliament and that it was not worthwhile raising the matter now. Why then, did he raise it at this stage? He has had three years during I suggested an upper limit the life of this Parliament in which he could have raised the matter by resolution in the House, by a motion for the adjournment, by a censure motion, or by other means. ber could have raised the matter by any of the mean's I have mentioned and had it thoroughly discussed by the Parliament, and if there had been a majority of members in favour of it the committee could have been resuscitated long ago. But he has waited until the very last month of the life of the Parliament. Now following in the footsteps of the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Lang), who is the de facto leader of his party, he tells us that there is something of advantage to be gained by the re-establishment of the committee, although during the life of the Parliament up to now the honourable member had never said a word about it. should not have risen to speak on this item had it not been that the honorahle member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) raised the question of the parliamentary gold pass.

The position is quite clear and I do not think that it admits of any equivocation. Modern methods of air travel have plainly superseded railway travel. I have not used my gold pass on the railways during the last five or six years, although, apparently, the Government during that time has been paying £160 annually to tlie various State Governments for my privilege of holding that pass. The sole purpose to which I have put my gold pass during the last few years has been to obtain free entrance to race-courses. I consider that it would not be difficult to find some substitute medallion to take the place of the gold pass, if it is the intention that members of the Parliament Should have some badge or other means by which they w ill he able to identify themselves to strangers or to certain authorities. across the chest would be suitable. particularly applicable in the case of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), perhaps with the addition of a few feathers. I am only trying to assist the committee by re-emphasizing something that has been already put forward as, I am sure, purely a common-sense proposition. The gold pass as f a r as the great majority of members of this House and of the Senate are concerned is no longer being used for the purposes for which it was originally issued. That being so, it behoves the Government to inquire whether it is worthwhile continuing payments for a service which is no longer being utilized. do not desire the Minister or the House to take the opinions of the two honourable members who have spoken on the subject of the gold pass as being representative of the opinions of the committee generally. One of those honourable members lives at Randwick, in Sydney, and the other at Toorak, in Melbourne. Other honourable members who live away fro m the capital cities, and f a r from the [5 OCTOBER, 1949.] Estimates 1949-50. 929 havo served on the House hurly-burly of metropolitan l if e and who have no air transport operating between the country town3 of their electorates and the capital cities, have to use the railways. When Parliament is in recess, I travel 50 miles on six days a week more often than not from my home to the Federal Members' Roomsi n Brisbane. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will not accept the opinions of the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) and the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein) as the opinion of the committee as a whole. I consider that the matter should be examined, but not with a view to abolishing the gold pass as a means of allowing honourable members to travel by railway. I use the railways to travel to remote parts of my electorate. I consider that the object for which the gold pass was originally issued to members of Parliament was to permit such travel. Before anything final is done in relation to this matter the views of all honourable memhers should he considered. The matter should be referred to the House committee which should make its recommendations to the Government. I repeat, however, that I hope that the Government w ill not reach any decision to abolish the gold pass or adopt the suggestions made here to-day without giving the closest consideration to all aspects of the matter. I shall deal with, a point that arises from the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) in relation to the facilities in this building for the staff, which, she said, were inadequate. Parliament House, in Canberra, unlike the parliament houses in the States, is the seat of actual administrative governI ment as well as of the legislature. If one compares the Western Australian Parliament Housei n Perth, which is not a very good building, w it h this Parliament House, one finds that Ministers in that State have their offices scattered throughout the City of Perth instead of having them in the parliamentary building itself. Therefore, the problem of staff facilities does not arise there. When this Parliament House was built,",42,Deputy Chairman Of Eepresentatives Indicates A Larger Cir

170,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [3.21],"it was designed to be a temporary Parliament House only. It was not intended to be an administrative centre as well as a Parliament House. As a result of its use for administrative as well as legisdefinitely makes the Senate a weak house lative purposes, accommodation for staff in tbe building has always been inadequate. Only a very large building programme would meet the suggestions of the honourable member for Bourke. I was surprised to hear that honourable member say that the staff had no dining-room facilities in the building. If that is so, it is quite wrong that pressan objective fact that members of themen should be allowed to use the minor dining-room on the northern side of the member's billiard-room. If there is any ukase that excludes members of the staff from using that dining-room while pressmen ai-e permitted to use it, it should be altered. I do uot say definitely that members of the press should be excluded, because I am certain that typists from ministerial staffs frequently use the minor dining-room. I turn now to the accommodation provided for members of Parliament themselves, because I believe that imderlying the planning of this building was an idea which has led to discrimination against the House of Representatives in favour of the Senate. That discrimination, in view of the Australian Constitution, was based on fallacious premises. I am sure that if the honourable member for Bourke were not an Independent with a private 'room to herself she would have raised the subject of the accommodation of members of Parliament. Members of the three main parties have to share common rooms in which they have to deal with a very considerable quantity of mail. Only Independents, certain ex-Ministers and Privy Councillors have private rooms. The locker accommodation of members, the mail facilities and the opportunity that they have of peacefully attending to their correspondence in each common room, are necessarily poor. The reason simply is that when this building was erected it was considered that, apparently because the American Senate is more important than the American House of Eepresentatives, the Australian Senate would be more important than the Australian House of Eepresentatives. if r . Beazley. was no justification for that assumption other than that both the American Seriate and the Australian Senate bear the name of Senate. The Australian Constitution by comparison with the American Senate. Yet senators in this Parliament have private rooms in which to deal with their correspondence and to do otherwork such as preparing their speeches. It is an objective fact that the Senate meets very much lass frequently than does the House of Eepresentatives and it is also Senate, not being known personally within confined constituencies, get less correspondence than do members of the House of Representatives. I do not think that an honest case can be made out for the provision of private rooms for all members of the Senate and of only a large common room for members of the House of Representatives. I think that in disposing of the new rooms that will become available on the completion of the enlargement of this building consideration should be given to the allotment of rooms to members of the House of Representatives. A great many rooms in this building have been allotted to the press. I doubt whether in any parliament elsewhere such facilities have been granted to the press in relation to all the facilities available. I certainly doubt whether the facilities that are granted to members of other parliaments are as poor as are those made available to members of the House of Representatives in this building. I should like the Minister to state whether in the enlargement of the parliamentary building which is now taking place any consideration has been given to the allotment of rooms to members of the House of Representatives in the same way as, for a long time, rooms have been, allotted to members of the Senate. Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [3.27] I am not in the position to inform the honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) whether any provision has been made for separate rooms to be provided for honourable members in the new portion of the parliamentary building that is now under conThere struction. I shall ask the appropriate Minister, either the Minister for Works",43,Deputy Chairman Of Eepresentatives Indicates A Larger Cir
171,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister fo raiid Housing( Mr Lemmon) or the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson), to supply the information. I enter this discussion merely to contest, the acceptance of the point of view that -this chamher is now not only a permanent place of assembly for the Parliament of the nation, hut also a permanent place in which administrative staffs, other than the parliamentary staffs, are housed. This building was not planned for that dual purpose. You, Mr Deputy Chairman, having been a member of the Parliament since it was transferred to Canberra, well know that this building has not always been an administrative as well as a legislative centre. Up to the outbreak of World War II . , it was customary for Ministers to have their offices in their own departments, which are located in buildings scattered throughout this city. During the war when the War Cabinet and the Advisory War Council had to meet at very short notice and when continuous consultation between Ministers was necessary to deal with emergencies suddenly arising, a practice gradually developed in which Ministers left their departments and established themselves wholly in this building with one or two memhers of their personal staffs. The number of Ministers and their personal staffs who have remained in the building has increased with the years. I suppose that private members of this Parliament would face an extremely difficult task if they endeavoured to uproot those Ministers and their staffs and return them to their departments where they would be in the centre of their administration and able to exercise close and personal control over all their officers. To bring about that result would indeed be a difficult task. suggestion that we should accept as permanent this intrusion upon the proper purposes of a parliamentary building. I trust that when the new permanent administrative block is completed Ministers will immediately, either voluntarily or by the vote of their fellow members, transfer themselves and their personal staffs thereto. It is desirable that private proper facilities for members of the Parmembers should enjoy better facilities and privileges in the way of accommodation than they can possibly possess in this building as its rooms are now allotted. I happen to be one of the few members of this chamber who enjoys the privilege of a private room. I have a private room, because I live in Canberra and make Canberra my head-quarters for the conduct of my electoral business. I have a private room only because of considerable determination and insistence on my part that in these circumstances I should have a private room. The view was very clearly expressed to me that I had no right to a private room in this building and that I should ask the Department of the Interior to provide a room for me at Civic Centre, where I could conduct my business as a member of the Parliament. When the system was established of appointing typist-secretaries for each member, the typewriter which I had formerly used and which belonged to the House of Representatives was taken away from me. I made some protest about that. The officials said, "" You cannot have this typewriter; it belongs to the House of Representatives "". I said, "" I am a member of the House of Representatives "". They said, "" If you are a member of the House of Representatives, you should apply to the Department of the Interior for a typewriter. You are certainly not entitled to a machine which belongs to the House of Representatives "". That is the position in which I and all other private members find themselves. It is wrong that members of the Parliament should be beholden in any way to the Department of the Interior for the supply of facilities to enable them to carry on their duties as members of the Parliament. It is wrong that in the employment of our typist-secretaries, and in the provision of facilities which we Nevertheless, I contest the need for the discharge of our duties, we should be beholden in any way to an outside government department. Control over the provision of such facilities should be exercised by the President and Mr Speaker and the officers of the Parliament who are under their control. I add my support to the request that further consideration be given to the provision of liament who, as servants of the people, are required to work in this building.

Almost every day, we read in the newspapers advertisements inviting applications for various positions in the Public Service, but the fact is that the Public Service Board is finding it very difficult to get persons to fill permanent positions. The Government is already doing everything possible to make suitable appointments to permanent positions. ever, that in various Commonwealth departments, including the office of the Australian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, it is necessary to employ temporary officers upon duties which, by their nature, are themselves temporary. For instance, many persons employed in the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom are salary of the High Commissioner in engaged upon work in connection with Australia's expanded immigration policy to deal with the large number of immigrants passing through London on their way to Australia.

But there should be no necessity for any suggestion of that kind if the Government gave effect to the provisions of the Audit Act of the findings of the Auditor-General. £310,000 is to be voted, and properly so, for the protection of the public accounts so that no one may misuse public funds and there shall be no misappropriation or irregularities of like character. we find each year-I ferring specifically to this year, because the matter can be taken back over several years-that directs the attention of the Parliament, and particularly the Government, to some irregularities, his observations are completely ignored by the Government. He does his duty. the faults. more if the Government refuses to take any notice. Let us look at some of the things that he reported on, and about which nothing has been done, so far as I know. In the 1947-48 report, he made the point that the total loss by the services stand that appointments to all departdepartments for five years amounted to £470,536. So far as the Parliament has been concerned, not a thing has been done about that. A year or so earlier he directed attention to the misuse by Mr inquire why there has been such unseemly Speaker of certain motor car services and to improper billing of the department. So far as we know, that account was paid by the Government. Mr Speaker said, in efTect, that the Auditor-General meant nothing to him. If we are to expend the very great sum of £310,000, which is the best part of one-third of £1,000,000, to maintain the Audit Office, a highly necessary office, and then have the Auditor General's report, when it is submitted to the Parliament, completely discounted, the taxpayer gets very little value from Mr Anthony. the supervision exercised over the Government. As a matter of fact, the Auditor-General's report has frequently been withheld from this Parliament for a period long after it could have been presented to it. I therefore hope that there will be a little more respect for the proper supervision of the public accounts than we have enjoyed in the past. I think I shall leave it at that. On your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, I cannot discuss the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN At the proper time, you can. We see that have to accept your ruling, although T notice the sum of £870,000 The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

I do not know whether I shall be ruled out of order if I refer to particular departments, but I underments are made by the Public Service Board. They include appointments to the Patents Office. I have recently had occasion, on behalf of a constituent, to delay in dealing with applications for patents. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN That does not concern the Public Service Board. informed that the reason for the delays was that the Public Service Board had not made the appointments necessary to enable the Patents Oflice to carry out its duties. The people in charge of the office claimed that the office is understaffed and is two years behind with many",49,Prime Minister S Department

214,Mr Anthony,"Pardon me. I wasapplications. They say that the whole trouble is that they cannot secure the appointment of the necessary staff. I understand that only the Public Service Board can make the appointments. They told me that they were short of four examiners and that they have only one man doing the job of examining scores and perhaps hundreds of applications for patents. People who submit applications for patents, trade marks, designs and the like are entitled to reasonably prompt dealing. If appointments are not made because of the failure of the Public Service Board to make them, and no other agency can make them, there is a state of inefficiency in almost every department. The Public Service Board in its turn, will probably say that it has advertised vacancies. To be an examiner of patents in most cases a person must have had a university training; frequently a man with legal training is required. My opinion is that the salaries offered for the positions are so poor in contrast with what men with similar qualifications can get in other vocations, that no one, or practically no one, applies for the jobs. I say, therefore, that it is time that the Public Service Board reviewed the range of salaries that it offers in contrast with the range of salaries and rewards offered by outside organizations. Unless something is done about the situation, essential Commonwealth departments will be behind in dealing vvith the needs of the public in a score of ways. I have mentioned the Patents Office, but there is a back-log of applications in the Department of Trade and Customs and other departments, including, if you like, the Taxation Branch, from which it takes a long time to get a reply to a letter, as every honourable member knows. I refer to the administration of the Public Service Board, because each department is dependent for appointments to its staff on the salary range established by the board. I have had a little to do with the board in one way. and another. For a little while I helped to administer it. I know that the fault does not always lie with the men in charge of the board but it goes a little higher and involves government policy in relation to how far it will go in granting increased salary ranges or in giving the board authority to L31] widen the advantages that applicants may have. But the fact remains that there is inefficiency in a number of departments of the Public Service. There is a delay of up to two years in the Patents Office, because of lack of staff. I hope that something will be done. When we come to the appropriate departments, I may be more specific, but within the limits bf the proposed vote for the Public Service Board, I make the observation that unless some^ thing is done, we shall have a very much inconvenienced public for some time to come. Mrs. BLACKBUBJST (Bourke) [4.7] Division 12 deals with the Public Service Board. I direct attention to the fact that some members of the Public Service have been asking for increases of salary by 75 per cent, over the 1939 figures, so as to bring their salaries into line with those paid in outside industry. I hope that the representations that have been made by those persons are receiving consideration. If they are being paid at a lower rate than is paid by private employers, surely they have a just case. I hope that something will be done about it. I have before me a letter from a superannuated public servant, one who has been superannuated for more than twenty years. He points out some matters of interest in these termsIn 1922, when the Superannuation Act came ' into force, the then Auditor-General insisted upon all superannuated officers paying duty stamps each fortnight for their superannuation cheques, until one bright officer contested his action, when it was at once decided that the amount of all these duty stamps had to be refunded on the ground that all superannuation was "" to be paid in full without any deductions "". The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member, but she will have to await the Estimates for the Treasury before being able to deal with superannuation. Mrs. BLACKBURN -There are many things that may be said about the Public Service Board. From information that has been given to me from time to time. I can only conclude that there is a hopeJess state of muddle somewhere, and I urge that everything possible be done to clear it up. I shall not go into detail about that. 'The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has just given some information that seems to support a great deal of the information that haB been given to me. should like some information about the item "" Leasehold office premisesrental, upkeep and alterations"" that appears under Division 15, "" High Commissioner's Office, United Kingdom"", which shows an estimated expenditure of £56,820. Expenditure for this purpose last year was £63,460. That expenditure has nothing to do with the expenditure proper in connection with the High Commissioner, who is very well catered for and is by no means ou the "" bread-line "". The estimates show that this year he will have £9,790 for incidental and other expenditure. That has nothing to do with his salary. This item, which amounts to £56,820, or more than £1,000 a week, is apparently for some premises that the High Commissioner is using. Where are these premises? know Australia House in London know that it has sufficient accommodation for all the activities of this Commonwealth in that city. It seems to me that the Government is displaying in London the same habit as it shows in Australia of taking over public buildings to accommodate obscure departments. I put a question on the notice-paper some weeks ago asking what leaseholds were held by the Commonwealth in Sydney and Melbourne and what properties had been acquired in recent years. That question does not now appear on the notice-paper hecause I was told that it would take some time to compile an answer. I presume that I shall get the answer some time after ends and very often is expected to the next general election. It appears from this item that somebody has appointed a director of sorts in London and provided him with accommodation. I may, of course, be wrong. The premises may be in use for some very important department controlled-by some very important person in the Government. In any event, somebody has apparently appointed a director or controller or some other official with a high sounding title. In such cases an office is found for the official, a typewriter and two or three staff hands are obtained for him, and in no time he has a huge department. This must be a huge department if it accounts for £56,820 for rental, upkeep and alteration of premises. To be quite fair to the department I quote a footnote which readsIncludes wages of stafT employed on upkeep as follows:-1949-50 , Vote, £7,640. 1948-49, Vote, £6,680; Expenditure, £6,684. Will the Mmister tell the committee to what this item refers? that I shall have more luck than I have had in previous attempts to address the committee. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable gentleman will have all the luck he desires if he keeps within the Standing Orders. Estimates for a number of private secretaries. I refer you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to page 197 of the Estimates. Those private secretaries include not only Honourable members who those attached to the offices of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) but also to the leaders of other parties, and to at least one Minister. I should like some information regarding the industrial conditions enjoyed by the private secretaries that are employed by Ministers and other members of this Parliament. I understand that the private secretaries have some kind of an industrial association of their own which has been finding it very difficult to obtain any satisfaction regarding their industrial conditions. A private secretary is often at the beck and call of a Minister at all hours. When the House sits at night he has to stand by. He often works at the weektake an interest in the electoral affairs of the Minister. He attends meetings and frequently has no leisure time. The Prime Minister told us recently that Dr. Coombs, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, had had no holidays for eight years. Surely that was not in accordance with public service conditions. The 40-hour week is only a myth to the ministerial private secretary. Some private secretaries have been lucky enough to be appointed to higher positions, but the positions of others remain stationary. A Labour",50,Prime Minister S Department

217,Mr Lang,"Provision is made in thegovernment should he the first government to ensure that the working conditions of its own personal staff shall be above reproach. It should ensure the rigid observance of the 40-hour week in respect of its employees. A Minister is in a very different position from that of his secretary, because he is compensated for his long, hours of work. During the life of this Parliament Ministers have received a very substantial increase of their remuneration, but I am told that the only, occasion on which ministerial private secretaries received any recognition was during the very brief period when the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) was Prime Minister. I should like the Prime Minister to investigate the conditions of private does not come under any such provision. secretaries and to ascertain whether or not the Public .Service Board has ruled that they must take their annual recreation leave of three weeks within a calendar year, that if they do not do so they may carry the leave over for only one year on tlie authority of a certificate from the head of the department, and that the remainder of the accumulated leave shall be forfeited. Some private secretaries are no doubt in the same position as Dr. Coombs and have had no leave for many years. They might go for eight years without a holiday because Ministers could not release them, and they lose all their accumulated leave. In addition, applications for overtime on their behalf have been rejected. If a private secretary has to work at night or on Sundays why should he not receive the ruling overtime rates? Why should he he restricted to a flat weekly salary? Those are not trade union principles. I understand that applications by private secretaries for tea money also have been rejected. What other section of employees isi expected to pay for more than one. meal a day while at work ? It would be a very paltry action indeed to refuse teamoney in such circumstances. realize that these people are only temporary public servants; nevertheless many of them have very responsible positions. They are engaged in highly confidential work and are even called upon to make important decisions. They should be paid accordingly. When a government goes out of office the new Ministers have the right to bring in their own private secretaries, which I consider to be right and proper. If a private secretary has been a known political supporter of a Minister-and several of them are-the n he must expect to go out when the government falls. The jobs of private secretaries are a part of the spoils of office. For that reason, private secretaries have no security. They may be dumped on to the industrial scrap-heap after years of faithful service, without even having the right to claim holiday pay that is due to them and that has been due for many years. Many of them work on Six Hour Day. Other public servants receive a day's pay in lieu of such public holidays, but a Minister's private secretary As they are apparently expected at all times to promote the idea that we have reached the golden age, it might be worthwhile to give them a slight personal interest ih it. Most of them have performed, their duties faithfully for a number of years and there is no reason why they should not become permanent members of the Public Service. pointed by the Public Service Board. for them. is not doing it very well. for theunder-dog. It is essential that persons wh© are engaged in work of that kind should have some security of tenure. A government may remain in office forfrom five to ten years. Ministers' private secretaries who have done their work well should not be cast to the wolves immediately after the Ministers whom they have served have relinquished office-. Irrespective of what government they haveserved, the loyalty of these officers I has never been questioned. Why, then, should they be kept on a slave labour status? I ask the Government to give them a fair deal. If no voice is raised in this Parliament on their behalf, what can they do to help themselves? We may yet see private secretaries picketing Ministers and demanding the same rights as are demanded by members of self-respect^ ing trade unions.

Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [4.29] -The honorahle member for Reid( Mr Lang) has referred to the pay and conditions of employment of private secretaries generally. Only nine private secretaries are covered by the proposed vote now before the Chair. This vote does not cover the salaries of private secretaries to Ministers other than the Prime Minister( Mr ment knowing that' the conditions of Chifley) and the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully). The details are given at page 197 of the Estimates. It will he seen from a perusal of the details that provision is made for £7,422 for private secretaries, numbering nine, who are filling unclassified positions. It covers the two private secretaries cussed with the appropriate authorities, to the Prime Minister, both of whom are permanent officers of the Public Service; the private secretary to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who, I understand, is also a permanent officer; the secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Cooper), who, I believe, is a permanent officer; and the private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives ( Mr Menzies). I understand that the present private secretary to. the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber is a lady who has been seconded from the Public Service for that duty. It also covers the private secretary to the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), who is deputy leader of the Opposition, the leader ( Mr Eadden) and deputy tralian Country party and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). of the nine private secretaries concerned five are permanent officers of the Public Service. The salaries of private secretaries to other Ministers are included in the estimates of the department concerned. The honourable member could have had in mind only the nine private secretaries to whom I have leferred, and since the majority of them have been allotted to Opposition members, any criticism of their rates of pay and conditions should have been directed to those members. The rates of pay and conditions of service of the private secretaries to the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council are laid down by the Public Service Board. They have a right to appeal against thc conditions of their employment, if they desire to do so. They would not have applied for their positions when those positions became vacant had they not desired to occupy them. They applied for appointtheir employment had been laid down by the Public Service Board. Within the last twelve months or so the private secretaries have formed themselves into an association. As far as I am aware the newly formed association has not made any complaints about, nor has it dishours of work, overtime and the other conditions of employment that were dealt with by the honourable member for Reid. It is true that the association has considered certain matters affecting its members. I believe that in the near future certain recommendations will be made to the appropriate authorities in relation to those matters. Whether such recommendations will be submitted to the Prime Minister or to the Public Service Board, I do not know. When the submissions are made they will he carefully considered hy the Government. As I have said, if the honourable member for Reid has any criticism to offer of the conditions of employment of the non-permanent private secretaries covered by this item, he should direct it to members sitting on the Opposition benches. Of course, he would not do so because he is their de facto leader. I understand that The honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) referred to the claim for a 75 per cent, increase in the salaries of public servants generally, and then proceeded to deal with the position of superannuated officers. The Chair very properly ruled that the subject of superannuation could he dealt with only when the estimates for the Treasury were under discussion.

At Canberra House most of the representatives of the service departments are housed. expenditure involved be justified? obtain additional premises so that the staffs of the Department of Defence and of the service departments generally could be housed at one centre. These staffs have grown numerically as the result of the plans of the Government for achieving greater co-operation with the United Kingdom Government in defence matters. It would be impossible to carry out a plan such as this Government has conceived for accepting a greater share of responsibility for the defence of the British Commonwealth, without providing suitable office accommodation in London for the housing of the requisite staffs. The provision of accommodation at Africa House was made necessary because of the expansion of scientific research work in London. A British Commonwealth scientific research organization has been established in Great Britain, and at a conference held in London two years ago it was agreed that the interests of scientific research would be much better met if all the research omcers of the dominions and of the United Kingdom were accommodated in the same premises. Canadian research officers were located at Canada House, Australian research oflScers at Australia House, and South African research officers at Africa House, it would not be easy to make the contacts that are so necessary in scientific research officers come under the adminisit was decided that all the scientific research oflieers from the United Kingdom and the Dominions should be accommodated at Africa House. There is constant contact between the Australian research officers at Africa House and the officials at Australia House.

That should be a suflicient I merely wanted to know explanation of the reason for renting premises outside of Australia House.

Obviously, he does not know whether he is coming or going. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) referred to the staffing of the Patent Office. The Patent Office is administered by the Attorney-General, who can explain more properly than I can, why he has been unable to obtain the staff that is required to deal with the applications as they come forward. It is true that members of the staff must possess high qualifications, and that the Public Service Board determines the classifications that are applicable to those oflieers, and, therefore, has a considerable voice in fixing the salaries that are offered. In that respect, I suppose, it may be said that if the remuneration is not sufficiently high to attract a staff large enough to handle the work, the Public Service Board may be criticized; but I believe that the scale of salaries that is paid to employees in the Patent Office may be dealt with more appropriately under the proposed Obviously, if vote for the Attorney-General's Department., The Attorney-General himself is in a much better position than I am to give a detailed explanation of the shortage of staff iu that section. thought that the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) would give a reasoned explanation of this great expenditure in London.

230,Mr White (Balaclava) [4.41],"IA l l I wanted to know waa the reason for this proposed expenditure, because the amount exceeds the cost of the upkeep of Australia House itself. Honourable members who are familiar with Australia House know that it is a huge 'building capable of containing these extra military sections. Members of the Opposition strongly support proposals for the closest co-operation with the United Kingdom Government. During the war, when the position was really serious, the Army and Naval staffs were accommodated in Australia House. The Royal Australian A i r Force was housed in other premises, which it vacated at the end of the war. However, the Minister will not evade the issue by abusing members of the Opposition. His idea of providing adequate defence is to expend large sums of money. He has stated that in the course of a few years an amount of £250,000,000 will be expended on the Defence forces. What protection shall we receive for that vast expenditure? In the Royal Australian Navy, the number of non-combatants compared with combatants is higher than it has ever been. In the Australian army the number of the "" chair-borne "" troops is now out of all proportion to the total strength. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member must relate his remarks to the estimates of the Prime Minister's Department. a parallel between what is happening here and what is happening elsewhere. The Minister has stated that the Commonwealth has hired a portion of Africa House to accommodate the staff of the Commonwealth Scientific and In dustrial Research order that the omcers may keep in close touch with the scientific staffs of other dominions. WhilstI strongly support any move for closer co-operation between the United Kingdom and the various dominions, I point out that if the staff of the Council for Scientific and In the estimates for the Prime Minister's dustrial Research could be accommodated in Australia House during the war, they could be housed there now. The Minister has stated that Canberra House has been acquired for the Army staff. What is the size of the army staff that Canberra House should be required to house them? That is typical of the extravagance of this Government. We see evidence of it in our own cities, but overseas, extravagant expenditure is incurred for the glorification of some Ministers when they travel. The tittering Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) has not had an opportunity to travel. When he loses his seat at the next general election, perhaps he will be able to go abroad to some ministerial post in Brazil or Chile, on the maintenance of which the Government is expending dollars for no good purpose. The previous Minister for Repatriation, Mr Frost, who lost his seat at the last general election, was given a job as Trade Commissioner in Ceylon, so the Minister might yet have an opportunity to travel. The Minister for Defence should have explained in a reasonable manner the various points that have been raised by members of the Opposition. Our submissions deserve greater attention than he is prepared to give to them. remarks relate to the proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom. All that I desire to learn about that particular vote, which constitutes almost one-half of the entire vote for the Prime Minister's Department, is the reason for including it in the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, because the proposed votes for high commissioners to various dominions I was merely drawing are included in the estimates of the Department of External Affairs. Has the proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom been placed in this position in order to bolster up the Prime Minister's DepartOrganization in ment ? Wouldi t not be more appropriate if the votes for all the high commissioners were placed in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs?

The honourable member for Watson will realize that there is a great difference between our relations with the United Kingdom Government and our That is the reason why, traditionally, the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom has always been attached to the Prime Minister's Department instead of being under the jurisdiction of the Minister for External Affairs.

Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed vote, £1,005,000. notice that the proposed vote of £1,005,000 for the Department of External Affairsthis year is slightly more than the prodoubt that the expenditure this year will considerably exceed the estimate, because the history of this department over the not speaking years that I have been observing it shows that it is a constantly inflating body. It honourable inflates itself rather like a bladder is inflated. The pumping is done by an industrious gentleman, and, in the process, he inflates the importance of the department that he administers. My observations on this department will be very simple, homely and easy to understand. The day must come when honourable members will decide that the Commonwealth cannot continue to expend more and more money on this kind of department. I observe that the proposed vote for the Australian Embassy in the United States of America is £100,000. That estimate was made, of course, before the devaluation of the £1 in relation to the dollar, so I assume that the revised estimate of our expenditure on our embassy in the United States of America this year will be approximately £130,000. We must ask ourselves whether, in the light of the service we are getting, such an enormous expenditure can be justified. An amount of £70,200 has been provided for the relations with foreign powers. payment of salaries and allowances, whilst the estimate of expenditure on postage, telegrams, telephone serviees and cablegrams is £21,600. The Australian taxpayer will want to know whether that expenditure is justified. I yield to no one in appreciating the importance of Australia having proper representation abroad but we should have some feeling for the taxpayer, who must meet the bill. The Government should give a detailed explanation of the reason for these astronomical figures of proposed expenditure.

Perhaps he can tell us that the High Commissioner for Australia in Eire, who is a friend of mine, is living under comfortable conditions. I hope he is. For the moment, however, I want to know, not whether he is comfortable, but what he is doing for Australia's benefit. It is proposed to vote a large sum of money for the upkeep of the High Commissioner's oflice in Eire. It is not our money but the taxpayers', and sooner or later we shall have to decide that we are not going to continue voting large amounts of money for which we do not obtain value. ""When I say that, I make no reflection on the person who now fills the oflice of High Commissioner in Eire. I am merely indicating that much of our expenditure on overseas representation could well be pruned in order to save the taxpayers' money. The proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in Pakistan is £19,000. In 1948-49, the expenditure was £10,468. I want to know why the increased expenditure is necessary. I pass on from that, to make an observation, which I have not had an opportunity to make before, about our representation in Pakistan. Some time ago, a Constellation aircraft was grounded at Karachi, in Pakistan, because of engine trouble. ber was travelling in the plane? friends of mine were, and they told me the sorry story, which has already been related in this chamber. The story concerns a person who was at the time representing Australia in Pakistan. The aircraft was delayed for a week or longer. There was a full complement of passengers, many of whom had business appointments in Australia. It was learned that another aircraft with six vacant seats was coming through two days later. It was arranged by Qantas Airways, the company operating the grounded the honourable plane, that the passengers should choose among themselves those who had the most urgent engagements in Australia, and that those chosen should be taken on in the second plane. At this point, the person acting as commissioner for Australia in Karachi intervened, and forbade the captain to carry out that arrangement, claiming that four of the six vacant seats should be filled by government servants travelling to Australia. The captain and the passengers protested strongly, but the official said, "" We own the aircraft and therefore our servants shall havo priority to travel on it to Australia"". That was, in fact, done. I think it was a scandalous thing that a government official, purporting to act for Australia, should dictate who was to travel on the plane. Two of the persons nominated by him were Australian government servants, and two were government servants from somewhere else. In that occurrence, we see the shape of things to come. That is the sort of thing that we may expect in the bureaucratic and socialist state. The matter was brought to my notice by some of the passengers when they reached Australia. I asked a question about it in the House, and the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) wriggled and hedged in an extraordinary fashion. It was not until weeks later that I got an answer out of him in which he admitted the facts, and said that such a thing would, not happen again. It might not happen in the immediate future, but it will certainly happen if we get a socialist state, I wish to refer to an item in the general administrative costs of the Department of External Affairs. It is the item which covers postage, telegrams and telephone services, in which there has been an increase of nearly 50 per cent. In 1948-49, the amount expended under this heading was £67,405. It is estimated that for 1949-50, expenditure will be £102,800. That does not include expenditure on cablegrams and radiograms, which is estimated to be £40,000, as against £38,158 for 1948-49. We all know that the Postmaster-General's Department recently increased telephone and telegraph charges, a fact which would account for an increase for this",58,Department Of External Affairs

262,Mr Tuenbull (Wimmera) [5.4],"item in the costs of the External Affairs Department. However, I have examined the estimates for other departments, hut none of them shows an increase comparable to the estimated increase for the Department of External Affairs. should like to hear the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) endeavour to justify the gigantic increase. able members are uneasy over the continually increasing costs of our overseas representation, and they know that the increase will continue. A few days ago, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) informed the House that Australia was to have diplomatic representation in Cairo and Jerusalem, and that -representatives would be appointed later :to the Scandinavian states. That will involve increased expenditure in sterling, -as well as in semi-hard currencies. I suggest that, in order to save expense, the Government could consider how economies -one person might be appointed to represent Australia in more than one country. It would be convenient geographically few* ms to be represented by one person in Cairo ant! Jerusalem, hut in view of the bad relations between Egypt and Israel, it is very probable that any one appointed to represent Australia in both those countries would be regarded as a spy in one or both of them. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to appoint a representative to each country. The Scandinavian countries, however, are all on very friendly terms with one another, and there seems to be no reason why Australia should not be represented in all of them by a single officer. I turn now to the United States of America. As the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, our embassy there costs real money, not £100,000 in Australian currency, but its equivalent in dollars, and that, of course, is a great strain on' our economy. The most important place in which Australia should be represented after London is Washington, and I do not think the money that we expend on our representation in Washington is badly expended. In fact, I think that very soon the Government will have to consider increasing ' the emoluments of the Washington post. The schedule of salaries and allowances sets out the salary of the Ambassador as £2,500. The representation allowance to the Ambassador is £5,138. Translated into dollars, at the present value of the Australian £1, that I means that the Ambassador gets roughly 15,000 dollars, which, as every one who knows anything about the economy of the United States of America is aware, goes simply nowhere. The Ambassador has a special allowance for exchange purposes, but, even with that, he does not receive enough to cover his position. One thing that is true-and I have had experience of it-is that the less the head of a foreign mission is able to go ahout and entertain on a footing equal to that of the heads of other foreign missions, the more is his position placed in jeopardy. Therefore, the Government will have to consider increasing the salary and allowances connected with that post. The can be made in other directions. I agree that we cannot afford too large an expenditure on our foreign representation. I suggest economy in other places; for instance, in Brazil, and in some minor posts. I do not think that we should reduce our representation in sister dominions. It is most important that we should cultivate the closest possible relations with the United States of America. Heavy clouds hang over the Pacific, and Australia is the first country that will suffer if those clouds one day burst. Communist forces are sweeping down the south-east coast of Asia. I do not desire to enlarge upon that matter, except to point out that we no longer rely, as we did, on efficient help from Great Britain and the British Dominions. ( Mr Beale) The United Kingdom is extended in every conceivable way, militarily and financially. Therefore, we have to look for friends to help us to defend ourselves should an emergency arise. Naturally, the first nation that we look to is the greatest in the Pacific, the United States of America. It is the only nation that we can logically expect assistance from. There is a great difference between our approach to the United States of America and its approach to us. It is very much in our interest to cultivate friendly relations with that great, nation. It would not matter much to the United States of",59,Department Of External Affairs
263,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [5.7],"HonorAmerica if we were written off completely, for we have nothing to offer it. Therefore, it is up to us to cultivate in the Tjnited States of America interest in ourselves. That can be done partly by diplomatic means and partly by citizens. We must awaken in both the citizens and the Government of the United States of America interest in us. I pointed out in my budget speech that our relations with the United States of America have sadly deteriorated in the last few years. We were very closely in touch with the American people at"" the end of the war. We were very friendly with them and they with us. I do not think that friendliness has diminished to any appreciable extent, but they are taking far less interest in us than they did in 1945. There are many reasons for that. Of all our negotiations with the United States of AmericaI know of hardly one in which a satisfactory solution has heen reached, at least a solution satisfactory to part of the larger question of the relations it. I instance the ways and means of putting into operation the Fulbright Act. Then there is the matter of the navigation treaties between the two countries. Thirdly, there is double taxation, about which I recently put a question to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). wants to give everything away. question that financially we should be the Japanese people are concerned. I do losers, but what would the loss of a not think public opinion in Australia few hundred thousands a year matter if would welcome any change with regard we got the friendship, co-operation and to fraternization, but there are other understanding of the United States of matters that rise far above that.

Quite unnecessarily, the Austhink the future relations with the tralian Government has offended a great Japanese should be. No pronouncement many Americans who are far more has been made on our view on the changed tolerant than we are in immigration policy of the United States of America matters. I now come to the matter of our policy towards Japan as compared with that hope that the Minister for External of the United States of America. Ten Affairs will make some attempt to clear days ago, General MacArthur issued to them up when replying to this debate. the world which he called the new policy of the Americans towards the Japanese. He described it as one of friendliness towards and guidance of the J apanese. In pursuance of that policy, he relaxed the ban on fraternization between the American troops in Japan and the Japanese people. I asked a question in the House ahout what the Australian Government proposed to do. The Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) said that the Government proposed to continue the policy of banning fraternization by our troops in Japan. Proceeding with his, explanation, he saidI do not think that it is a matter of such' great importance as to require discussione on a government-to-government level at thia time. The policy adopted by our troops in Japan towards the Japanese, compared with the policy adopted towards them by the American troops in Japan, is only a between ourselves and Japan and the United States of America and Japan. As an ally of the United States of America in the occupation of Japan, surely we should co-ordinate our policy with theirs. I do not believe that there have been any discussions on a high level, which is really what matters, between the State Department about the Allied policy far transcends any question of fraternitowards the Japanese people. These are matters that should be cleared up and I",60,Department Of External Affairs

265,Mr Ryan,"Exactly. There is no in the occupation of Japan as far as theThere are one or two things about which I should like some information in this discussion on the proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs. Last year I asked the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt), in a written question for certain information, which he gave to me, but of course, last year we had no opportunity of addressing any further questions to the Minister personally in the chamber, because he was away in other parts of the world. I asked him what Australia's contribution was to the United Nations, on what grounds it was based compared with the contribution of other countries, how many Australians were employed in the organization ancl what was the salary range of those whose salaries exceeded £1,000 a year. ceived some very interesting information from the Minister, and from the Secretary of his department by letter. I wonder whether, in view of the changed monetary relations between ourselves and the dollar countries, because of the recent devaluation of the pound, and particularly in view of the fact that Australia must forgo the importation of many dollar goods, including petrol and machinery on that account we are justified in expending the huge amount that was voted to the United Nations by this Parliament last year. I asked the Minister last .year1. What is the monetary contribution of been present during a debate on the DeAustralia to the United Nations Organization? partment of External Affairs to answer 2. On what basis is such contribution deterpersonally some of the observations and remined, and what are the individual contribuquests for information that have .been put tions of all other United Nations members? 3. Approximately how much of Australia's by honourable members on this side of the contribution is payable in dollars? The Minister told me that contributions were broadly determined by capacity to staff of tlie United Nations organization, and pay, taking into account national incomes, what are the names of those in receipt of a &c. As a matter of fact, I imderstand salary of £1,000 pcr annum or more (Austhat some members of the United Nations tralian currency)? are not paying their levied contributions.

But Australia's direct contribution to the of the list appears the name of a funds of United Nations last year was no Mr Ian Milner whose salary range is less than 543,000 dollars, which was more from 7,450 to 9,200 dollars. Who is Mr than half a million dollars. The Milner? He may be a distinguished inMinister might justify that by saying dividual but at least hi3 name is not "" This is a world organization, struggling to establish better relations between nation and nation, and that contribution is a good insurance policy for the future "". But is it a good insurance policy for the future ? How far has the United Nations served the purpose that it was proclaimed it would serve when it was first formulated in 1945 in San Francisco ? I submit that iu the major matters that concern world peace, the United Nations is an inconsequential organization. For instance, the matter of the atom bomb has not been considered by the United Nations, except in a negative manner by the appointment of some kind of a commission that neither Russia nor the United States of America takes the least notice of. If in 1948-49 our contribution in dollars to the United NationsI reamounted to 543,000 dollars, what is it to be in 1949-50? We are given no information at all on that point. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has referred to the establishment of legations that absorb dollars in South America and certain other countries. I have made some fairly careful research into what justification may exist for the establishment hy Australia of dollar using agencies in those countries in the way of diplomatic representation and I have been unable to find any justification at all. This is the first occasion in the last year or two at least on which the Minister has chamber. Another section of my question to the Minister reads.How many Australians are on the permanent At the top",61,Department Of External Affairs

But the most interesting name of all is left until the last. Honourable memhers will recollect that a lady by the name of Miss Giselle Schneider was lobbying around Canberra for a long period. She was an alleged Polish refugee who was supposed to have had to flee from Poland at the time that the Nazis got busy in that country. She was a very qualified Polish woman. I understand that when she reached Australia she joined the staff of the Melbourne University and that she later found a job in Canberra and finally insinuated herself into the Department of External Affairs. Every honourable member will recall the way in which she used to be in and out of ministerial offices. orable gentleman was a Minister. the present Minister's term of office. in my time as a Minister. Many of us regarded with suspicion her story that she fled from the Nazis That story remains to be proved. She found her way into the Department of External Affairs during the present Administration. She became a lecturer to the student cadets of the department. She was missing for quite a period and now her name has turned up in this document with which I have been supplied by the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, who informed me in it as follows:The following Australians were employed on the United Nations Secretariat at the salaries shown aa at Slst August, 1947:Then appear the names of those employed. The last name of all is that of Mrs. P. Podbielsky, who is, in fact, none other than Miss Giselle Schneider^ aud wljp, this document tells me, is an Australian representing Australia, and is the mouth-piece of Australia in the United Nations. Yet she is a former refugee from Poland! She receives a salary of from 4,410 to 7,800 dollars. I do not know very much about what happened in Poland during the war or in what circumstances she came to this country. I only know from the observations of quite a number of honourable members that that lady's activities in Canberra were under suspicion and that more than one honourable member of the Parliament commented upon the facility with which she was able to gain entrance to all kinds of government departments. But this document describes her as an Australian! AVhen did she become an Australian? Was she permitted to become naturalized during the period of the war?

They are in no sense representatives of Australia. be side-tracked by the Minister's statement, because I asked the Minister a specific question which readsHow many Australians are on the permanent staff of the United Nations organization, and what are the names of those in receipt of a salary of £1,000 .per annum or more (Australian currency)?

These officials were also mentioned in the House by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Eankin) and he received a moat insulting letter from Mrs. Podbielsky, vvhich stated that whether he was a member of Parliament or otherwise, he should mind his own business. But I am very much intrigued by the appointment of this lady when there are many Australian women, who were highly trained at our universities and hold arts and other degrees, with who should have been qualified for a position such as this. I should like to know how it is possible for a lady with the background and status that I have mentioned to be allegedly representing Australia overseas, because it is quite obvious that she has been regarded by the Department of External Affairs, in view of the answer that it supplied to me, as a representative of Australia. I turn now to the matter of dollar allocations to United Nations organizations. I have no doubt that we shall be told by the Minister in his reply that the expenditure of that money is well justified.

I believe that the Minister's action shows how lightly he regards the United Nations, arid how unnecessary he really believes it to be.

The Minister for External Affairs, in his anxiety to demonstrate how extraordinarily valuable the Tjnited Nations is, was one of the first to hand over to the Trusteeship Council the trusteeship of territory that had formerly been held uuder mandate. As the result of his action Australia must in future send officials to Lake Success, or wherever the General Assembly of the Tjnited Nations may be held, to be subjected to all kinds of cross-examination by the representatives of foreign powers regarding its administration of New Guinea. Any foreign power which is a member of the Tjnited Nations may send its representatives to New Guinea to check up on our administration of the trusteeship and may subsequently pull our reputation to shreds in a ^manner it would not otherwise have a right to do. Contrast the action of the Australian Government with the more statesmanlike action taken by the Tjnited States Government. The Tjnited States made it clear that it would not accept trusteeship of the Marshalls and the Carolines except on the basis that those islands were of such strategic importance to the defence of the Tjnited States that that country had a right to administer them as though they were an integral part of the Tjnited States. Many questions were asked in the Trusteeship Council about Australia's administration of New Guinea. The representative of China saidMayI ask how the indenture system oi Labour is operated and why it will take five in Brazil. I shall deal with that in a years to effect a change in it? The representative of Mexico wanted to know what salaries were paid to the members of the police force in New Guinea and what were the conditions of service. Another representative asked what kind of sanitary conveniences were provided for the natives there. Mr Por.r.AitD -Ho w funny! for humour that the representative of Australia should be compelled to answer questions of that kind only because the Australian Minister for External Affairs gave away New Guinea without qualification. The right honourable gentleman should have emulated the example of the United States Department of State, and said: "" This territory is so necessary to the defence of Australia that we shall line ourselves up with the Tjnited States of America and insist that nobody may enter New Guinea without our permission. We shall not submit ourselves to the indignity of being questioned by the representatives of Iran, Mexico, the Philippines or any other country who may dare to take us to task. We shall not subject ourselves to questioning by the representatives of governments which cannot boast of a good record even in the administration of their own peoples "". These are some of the questions which the Minister for External Affairs might well answer. Perhaps he might begin by telling us what our membership of the United Nations will cost us during the forthcoming year, how much we shall have to pay in sorely needed dollars, and what value we shall get for our money. General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.48] -There are a few matters with which I should perhaps deal at once. Criticism has been levelled at the establishment of certain Australian legations abroad. No definite suggestion has been macle that any specific legation should be. closed. ance of the Australian Legation in Brazil. honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) referred to the Australian Legation moment or two. Only two legations were specifically mentioned either during the present discussion or on other recent occasions. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) and the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) have referred at different times to the legations in Chile and Brazil. Both are Latin-American countries, and some honourable members opposite have contended that Australia does not need diplomatic representation in them. However, it is important for the committee to understand that Australia has only two missions in South America,",65,Department Of External Affairs

300,Dr. Evatt,"It is true that theoue in Brazil, and the other in Chile. We recently withdrew our ckarge-de-affaires and staff from Chile us a temporary measure, largely because of the dollar position. I believe that, ultimately, it will be essential for Australia to be represented in South America on a larger scale than it is at the present time, and that relations with Chile are important. Although the Australian Legation in Chile is included in these Estimates, the amount that is shown is simply ior the purpose of winding up that particular mission, and paying the salaries of the officers who have been withdrawn from it. E desire to take this opportunity to point out that any criticisms of the Australian Legation in Brazil that are based upon dollar expenditure are beside the point. That post is financed, not with dollars, -but through the sterling area. However, there are serious considerations which, in the opinion of the Government, warrant the continuance of at least one post in South America. In the view of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, Australia has important trade prospects in South America, and we intend to conduct active trade negotiations in the near future mainly with Brazil, but also with Argentina and other South American countries. At the present moment, negotiations are being conducted by the Australian representative in Brazil with a view to making a trade arrangement with Argentina. A post for a trade commissioner in Brazil has existed for a long time, but it has never been occupied. The whole of the trade work has been done through tlie legation at Rio de Janiero, and, in fact, it is being performed hy the Australian rharge d' affaires there. He was previously an officer of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, hut, in practice, it is often impossible to separate comsents expenditure on behalf of other mercial representation from diplomatic representation. Therefore, it is often more convenient and necessary that the nommercial officer should also have diplomatic status. the normal foreign office tradition. practice because of the difficulty of drawing a line of demarcation between strictly commercial matters and other matters in which general political policy is involved. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) is aware of that fact. In my opinion, it is of considerable advantage that the commercial officers should have diplomatic status. Egypt provides a good example of that. Australia has its trade representative in that country, but often a matter affecting trade also has a political aspect, and it is impossible for trade representatives to discuss the subject unless they have some diplomatic status. In order to have diplomatic status the officials must be, accredited as representatives of the Department of External Affairs. In view of the potentially important market in South America for Australian products, especially those of our secondary industries, the cost of maintaining what is, after all, a very small diplomatic mission in Latin America is a small price to pay for the benefits which even from the limited trade viewpoint, must accrue to this country. I shall now deal more generally with the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. The estimated expenditure this year is an overall increase of £77,000 on last year's expenditure. I remind honourable members that expenditure last year was £50,000 less than the estimate and we hope to make similar economies this year. Actually, the estimates for 1949-50 are less than £30,000 in excess of last year's vote. The proposed vote has been increased because of anticipated additional costs that are quite unavoidable. The increases cover five items. First, overseas air-mail rates have been increased by 100 per cent., and 70 per cent, of those charges, which arc borne by the Department of External Affairs, repredepartments. Secondly, rates for cables between Australia and France, America, Russia and other countries have greatly increased. item. am dealing with the estimates as a whole, and not with the specific matter that has been raised by the honourable member.

The department is concerned mainly with overseas rates. In ternal expenditure on matters to which the honourable member has referred is comparatively small, but the overseas fates are heavy, and they have been increasing. Thirdly} Australia's contribu^ tionS to international organizations have increased. Australia has always been a member of that very important body, the International Labour Office,and we must maintain our membership of it. Its purpose is to increase labour stan dard's throughout the world* All political parties represented in this chamber have supported the International Labour Office. Australia's increased con=tributions to that and other international bodies amount to more than £30j000. Before leaving this matter, I should mention the Fobd and Agriculture Organization. Surely honourable members opposite, particularly members of the Australian Country party, will not complain because Australia is a member of that organization! I was horrified to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Eichmond on this subject. In fact, I think that we have to attribute to some of his remarks an over-estimated sense of humour. I do not believe that the honourable gentleman really considers that Australia should not be a member of the United Nations. Probably his purpose is to make a rather spoiling attack on a few items, of expenditure in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. Does any honorahle member seriously propose that Australia should withdraw from the United Nations? All political parties that are represented here are pledged to support it . Waste of time, is it not? feelings about the honourable member for involved the expenditure of an additional Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), whd £9,000.

314,Dr. Evatt,"The fourth reason j o restimates are £100,000 below those of last year. This saving has been effected by refraining from making appointments in dollar areas until it becomes absolutely necessary to do so. This has caused some inconvenience, because it is in the dollar areas that our representation is very important. Posts at Washington and Ottawa .are carrying on with inadequate staffs because of the dollar shortage. We have delayed the making of appointments and the purchase of vehicles, &c, as long as possible. The post in Chile has beeu temporarily closed for reasons of economy, and we have deferred the appointment of a Minister to Brazil. Thus, the utmost economy has been exercised, particularly in the expenditure of dollars. I now propose to discuss departmental expansionmore broadly. The Department of External Affairs has grown steadily according to plan since the Labour Government assumed office in October, 1941, nearly eight years ago. At that time, there were seven officers of the department in Canberra, and fifteen overseas. Besides London, in which we have had representations for many years, there were representatives at Washington, Ottawa, Tokyo and in China. With the exception of the London post, the others were created and filled after the beginning of World War II . The Labour Government has extended Australian diplomatic and consular representation to many parts of the world. The original five foreign posts have been increased to 28, and the diplomatic staff in Canberra has been increased to 64, while that overseas has been increased to 76. I speak now of diplomatic officers in the strict sense of the term. This great expansion was necessary, first, because of the war, and, secondly, because of the need to implement the international policy of the Government after the war. The war taught us that Australia had to exercise its status as a nation. It further taught us that Australia had to take an active part in all forms of interhave received in Australia diplomatic or national co-operation. Mention has been made of the United Nations, which is one of the most prominent forms of international co-operation. Australia must also maintain day-by-day relations with other countries. There is an enormous flow of information from abroad to Australia, and from Australia abroad. The promotion of such activities requires efficient oflieers to be available for duty every day of the year. That is of the very essence of a properly organized foreign affairs department, and is just one aspect of government. Active participation in the United Nations and associated organizations is the key note of the Government's policy. .One of the first planks of the Labour party's platform is unwavering and unfaltering support of the United Nations. We make no apology for that. It is the policy adopted by the British Commonwealth of Nations, and. it occupies a prominent part in the policy of President Truman. By a coincidence, those very words, ""unwavering and unfaltering support"", were used by President Truman in a recent important speech. He said that, in his opinion, the United Nations was the only bulwark guarding the ordinary people of the world against another war. It may be said that such a statement needs to be supplemented; and that, in addition to the United Nations, regional arrangements are needed. No one will deny that, but support of the United Nations has been the settled policy of this Government since we first sent our delegates to San Francisco to take part in the drafting of the original charter, which was inspired by President Roosevelt himself. There have been setbacks, even heart breaking setbacks, but aworld organization is bound to have such setbacks. After a war like the last one, it is not easy to condition people to the normal ways of peace. The proposed expenditure on the External Affairs Department, is little more than £1,000,000 a year, and it is less than the one day's expenditure by Australia during the height of the war in the Pacific. We must remember also that we receive something to balance our expenditure on overseas representation. It is not a one-way traffic. From 48 separate countries we consular representatives. When we speak of dollar expenditure by Australia on representation in the United States of America, we should remember the dollar expenditure in this country of American and Canadian representatives. dollars in Australia, they spend sterling. spend sterling, but actually their expendiand assistance and they are never turned ture over the whole field is in dollars. However, apart from the monetary side, which is an important, but not the most important, feature, there is the fact that Australia, as a nation, is entitled, by its international status and by its contribution during the first and second world wars, to take its place in the councils of the nations, and to discuss international affairs with the representatives of other countries, sometimes in Canberra, and sometimes overseas. We cannot say that we shall have representation i u one country, but not in another. overseas extended. preceded had to extend our foreign representation. It began with the establishment of a post in Washington. Later, posts were established in Tokyo, iu China and in Canada. The establishment of all such posts has been justified, and they must be properly staffed, and supported by the Government and the Parliament. In order to provide for their staffing, it has been necessary to establish a special scheme of recruitment which made allowance for the fact that, during the war, serexpense. vicemen were deprived of opportunities to make places for themselves in the Public Service. Therefore, they were specially favoured in the granting of cadetships in the Department of External Affairs. Now, many of them have finished their training, and have been appointed to various posts throughout the world, where they are taking their part as important units in the service. The Australian diplomatic cadet system has been followed to some extent in Canada, and has aroused interest in other countries. The system ensures that Australia's overseas representation, whether in the diplomatic field, or at international conferences, shall be based on specially selected and trained career staff. This administrative development has been in accordance with the development of the policy of Australia in relation to foreign affairs. It is designed to protect Australia's interests abroad and I refer not only to governmental interests, but also to private and not spend commercial interests, and that work is going on all the time. Australians abroad go to those posts for advice down. They are always getting assistance. The department receives numerous letters of appreciation of the work done in our posts from Australians who happened to be engaged in business or travel overseas. It is a fundamental part of our policy to have the closest association with both the British Commonwealth and the United States of America and to give whole-hearted support to the United Nations and its agencies. So, I submit that, looking at these figures and looking at these activities, they are completely Our justified. Indeed, in one sense, they have representation must be always been approved by the Parliament, The Government that subject occasionally to some particular the Labour Government form of criticism. Certain suggestions have been made of a practicable kind. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) suggested that we might consider the appointment of one officer to man two places. That is being considered. It is a suggestion that, is not particularly favoured by a foreign country that has a representative here. But it is being explored in order to carry out our obligations with the minimum The honourable member for Richmond raised the matter of contributions to the United Nations. He wanted to know whether the contribution of dollars that had to be made by other members of the United Nations was the same as that which has to he provided by Australia. The answer is "" Yes, it is "". The rules provide that a certain percentage of the contribution is to be made in dollars, and that applies to every one of the 59 member nations. Then he asked how the percentage was worked out. The percentage in the case of Australia is 1.97, which is practically 2 per cent, of the total contribution, or approximately one-fiftieth. It is reckoned in dollars, because the centre of the United Nations is in the United States of America. But that is a burden of dollar expenditure, not only to countries like Australia, but also to many other countries, and it has led to a desire, if not a. demand, by member countries at the",68,Department Of External Affairs

That is a difficult matter. Certain other places have been suggested for the next meeting of the United Nations. One is Cuba and the other is Great Britain. Edinburgh has been suggested as a possible place for the next meeting. The honourable member for Richmond then referred to the fact that a number of Australians are on the staff of the United Nations. There is nothing wrong in that. We should be blamed if Australia did not have its proper quota of persons who happened to he selected by the secretariat for posts with the United Nations and in any of its centres. Australian ? ber then referred to a list. I do not think it is necessary for me to go through it. I want the committee to understand that these persons are not the nominees of the Australian Government. They are not the representatives of the Australian Government. This is an international public service, and each member signs an undertaking or takes something in the nature of an oath to further the interests of the organization and not of any particular country. Some of those people have been reco.manended by the department and many have not. been. and many have not.

I said that she was not recommended by the Australian Government. substance. The person whose name is second in the list was recently appointed by the governing board of the Australian National University, of which the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) is a member, to fill a chair in the National University because of his special knowledge of trusteeship. Podbielsky? Was a member of the staff of Professor Copland at the Melbourne University. Subsequently she was appointed to the economic secretariat at Canberra. She was appointed temporarily at one time to the Department of External Affairs by the then secretary of the department. She received, her present appointment on an application made by her on her own behalf, and without any support from the Government, I might add. In any case, I would not admit that her appointment would be wrong, if she is, as I understand she is, a distinguished linguist. She has done excellent work on the staff of the United Nations. She has been naturalized as an Australian by the Department of Immigration. Is that any reason to complain that she has heen given a post by the United Nations? tralian woman available who is capable of doing the work? does not face the fact that we cannot make these appointments. behind doors. ber for Warringah rumbles and grumbles and says that he knows what he does not know. suspicion. . the department' that in quite a number of cases there has been no recommendation by it of any kind.

That brings me to the broader question raised by the honourable member for Flinders, and it is very important that it should be dealt with. He suggests-and it is not the first time that it has been suggested on that side of the chamberthat the relations between the Australian Government and the Government of the Tjnited States of America are not so intimate or so satisfactory as they were a few years ago. The statement is completely and absolutely untrue. rumbling and grumbling of one honourable member, we have the growling of the honourable member for Parramatta. I do not know why he does it. There is no advantage to be gained by not facing the facts. I shall deal with each point made by the honourable member for Flinders. First, let fine say quite definitely that the out of the fund. Negotiations between relations of the Australian Government with the Government of the Tjnited States of America have never been so intimate, so close or so friendly as they are at present. Mr Spender interjecting, on the left. Because the honourable member for Warringah does not agree with another speaker he growls. There is not much argument in the growling, and the bonorable member will not stop me from saying that Mr Jarman, the recently appointed ambassador of the Tjnited States of America to Australia, on the occasion of his arrival iu Australia and the presentation of his credentials to the Governor General, indicated that the relations between the two countries could not 'be closer or more intimate than they are. That is true. Honourable members know it is true. The only trouble that I know of is that on a few occasions in this chamber, one or two honourable members, in the corner in which memhers of the Australian Country party mainly sit, have suggested that differences exist between the two countries. The honourable member for Flinders asked why the arrangement for the agreement under the Fulbright Act had not been completed. I understand the position is that Australia, under the lend-lease arrangement with the Tjnited States of America, provided what was called reverse lend-lease and the accounts nearly balanced. Approximately, it was £1,000,000,000 on either side of the accounts, such was the contribution of Australia by reverse lend-lease. There was a balance in favour of the Tjnited States of America, which was settled by an arrangement to provide £20,000,000. should not mind having the pin money now. It was in dollars! In an agreement like that referred to, various matters have to be provided for. They include, for instance a fair system of taxation of the scholarships to be provided the Australian Government, particularly through the Treasury, and the United States of America, have been going on for some time. They are approaching completion. There is no complaint of any kind about that. It is suggested that there should he a system of double taxation. That is very important. What has to be considered by the Government in the light of its policy is the policy of other countries, particularly the United States of America. When an honorable member makes a speech to the effect that another government does not think the terms of an arrangement are very satisfactory, that does not indicate that any but the best relations exist between the two countries. The honourable member said' that Americans were offended by Australia's administration of its own immigration laws. There is not a tittle of evidence of that. The United States of America enforces its immigration laws under the quota system, or under the previous system, with complete rigidity. It would be unusual to have such a complaint from the United States of America. There has been none. Yet that is the basis of the suggestion that has been made by honorable members-",71,Department Of External Affairs

In fact, the only forum at whicli such a suggestion' as that has been' made is in this chamber on one or two occasions by one or two' honourable members who represent al small minority of the Opposition . 1 The honourable member for Flinders' referred to a more important quesfion about policy in relation fo Japan.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member for Richmond will disappear from the chamber if he is not careful. ment about whether the mandates system did or did not disappear when the League of Nations ceased to exist. When the conference of the United Nations met at San Francisco it was decided to convert the mandates system into the trusteeship system, and it is perfectly true that Australia voluntarily continued, under the trusteeship system, to administer the same territory that it had administered for twenty years under the mandates system. The British Government took the same action. government but a coalition government. In fact all the nations of the British Commonwealth that were concerned-the United Kingdom, New Zealand in respect of Samoa, and Australia-too k the same action. In relation to Nauru there is a tripartite trusteeship in which Australia is administrator, and the three parties to which are the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. It is almost like a summons to the Dark Ages to say that the administration of New Guinea, which had been conducted for twenty years satisfactorily and well by Australia under a system akin to the trusteeship system should not be administered in the same way according to a system under which Australia would undertake similar obligations. One of the most important functions of the -United Nations is to raise the standards of dependent peoples and to ensure that -colonies are no longer regarded as mere possessions of an imperial power, but are administered as British colonies were administered, according to the declarations of the great colonial administrators, in a spirit of trust. I see no degradation, and nothiqg except honour, propriety and justice in Australia answering questions to a committee elected by the United Nations, half of the members of which must belong to trustee nations themselves. All trustee countries are members of the Trusteeship Council, and I can see nothing wrong in Australia answering the questions of that council about what has happened during the previous twelve months in respect of the welfare of native peoples. I am quite sure that that opinion is shared by the majority of the Australian people. Representatives of all the churches have acclaimed the principle. Only recently in a broadcast a distinguished leader of the Church of England praised the principle of the improvement of the standards of native peoples. The Government adheres to that principle which is a United Nations principle. Yet we have the honourable member for Richmond saying, "" Ah, you should have done what the United States of America did, and treated New Guinea as a strategic area "". The United States of America treated as a strategic area That was not a socialistic the Caroline, Marshall and Marianas Islands which had been administered by Japan as mandates after World WarI . , and in respect of which the Japanese, by constructing fortifications there, did not honour their obligations. The United States of America succeeded in obtaining the approval of the United Nations for these islands to be deemed strategic areas. However, Article 83 of the United Nations Charter deals with that kind of trusteeship territory. It .provides that the Security Council shall, subject to the"" provisions of the trusteeship agreement and without prejudicing security considerations, avail itself of the assistance of the Trusteeship Council to perform those functions of the United Nations under a trusteeship relating to political, economic, social and educational matters in the strategic area.

I trust that the opinion which he has expressed is only his view on Wednesday and that it will be changed by Friday. He knows that the United Nations cannot be written down and sold short. I know something of the United Nations the fact that the honourable member for Warringah does not know anything about the United Nations. I have worked unsparingly for it. for Warringah asks, "" Why not for Australia ?"". The policy of the Australian Government, and the policy which will make Australia a great nation, involves unfaltering support for the United Nations. in the company of the UnitedStates of America and it9 great Presidents like the late Mr Eoosevelt and Mr Truman, when our policy is also the policy of the British Commonwealth, I say that service to the United Nations with its machinery of action is in the best interests of Australia and it involves a positive foreign policy on the part of this country. That is the kind of policy we are pursuing now. I have tried to explain the deveolpment of the Department of External Affairs. I had thought that in substance these things were not disputed. I know that they are not disputed by the overwhelming majority of tbe Australian people. Opposition members interjecting, orable members opposite, certainly only two or three of them, should object to that statement. I am glad that most Opposition members are silent. The overwhelming majority of the people of Australia favour the maintenance of international peace based on justice, the economic well-being of all peoples,"" and the doctrine of full employment, which is a part of the pledge in the Charter of the United Nations. The people are for the United Nations; the Government is for it and has always been for it ; and the committee will support what the Government has done in this connection. We have listened to the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) make one of his usual defences of the United Nations, but not until the last moment of his speech did he have very much to say about Australia, the country from which he sprang. Time and time again he has talked of Australia's interests being those of all the nations of the world. I dispute that contention. Some nation's would destroy this country if they were given a chance to do so. Yet the Minister, who is supposed to be our Minister for External Affairs, says that the best not for Australia ? path for Australia to follow is the path of internationalism. As I have said on other occasions, the -Minister, in his pursuit of internationalism, has forgotten his duty to this country. In all of his discussions he does not say one word about this country and its diffiWhen we find Australia culties. Indeed, he has used the debate on the Estimates very unfairly. Under the Standing Orders he is permitted to speak for an indefinite period, but Opposition members are limited to 30 minutes. Within that short period we are expected to sum up the whole international situation. I had hoped to hear from the Minister some statementof the particular dangers that confront this country at the present time, but he did not mention one word about them. In truth the foreign policy of this country may be summed up in the five letters of the alphabet, "" E.V.A.T.T."". That has been the policy of this country for the last six or seven years. To-night the Minister, in defending his department, has sought to turn this debate into a debate on international affairs and the vital interests I am amazed that honthat affect the world to-day. Not one word was said hy the right honourable gentleman in defence of his action in handing over New Guinea to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. He",75,Department Of External Affairs

359,Mr Spender (Warringah) [8.48],"seems to have forgotten that there lie dead in that country no fewer than 6,000 Australians. He has told us what the late President Eoosevelt and President Truman have said, but he did not say one word about what Mr Churchill has said. He did not tell us, as he could have done, that when the Tjnited States had to determine whether certain of its possessions or places occupied by it should be placed under the trusteeship of the Tjnited Nations it specified a special kind of trusteeship, known as a strategic trusteeship. New G-uinea, which is so vital to our interests, and in which 6,000 of our men laid down their lives, was handed over by the Minister to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations without consultation with the Parliament or even, I suspect, with the Government. honourable gentleman is a law unto himself. this country with no authority other than that which devolves upon him by virtue of the office which he holds. He has handed over to the inquiry and inspection of all other nations, enemy or friendly, a territory which is of the highest strategic importance to us. I am not prepared to follow the course that has been followed by so many persons, even on this side of the chamber, and say, "" What a great man this is"". In the pursuit of his own interests and in the cause of internationalism, the right honormatters. He did not say one word about able gentleman has sacrificed the interests of his country time and time again. I do not ask pardon for having made that statement. I stand hy it . If we examine the map of this gentleman slid over them because he part of the world we shall find that did not want to mention that country. Noumea lies within 1,000 miles of the whole of OUT eastern coast extending from Sydney to Eockhampton. It lies has always shown a strange desire within 1,500 miles of the whole of our to placate Eussian interests. When the eastern seaboard from east of Melbourne to light of publicity is thrown upon him Cape York Peninsula. Australia is 1,000 he stands up as a world figure. He is miles from Timor. Prom those two points even prepared ou occasions to stand up to alone, as any man who has served in the Vishinsky and make a bold statement in Air Force knows, the whole of Australia order to direct world attention on himself. is open to attack by a hostile power. I well remember the occasion some years Time and time again we have asked what ago in this chamber when, having walked the Government is doing to counter that with the mighty and spoken with the threat, but all.we get in reply is a speech leaders of Eussia, he said that he was by the Minister for External Affairs in satisfied that Eussia's foreign policy defence of the cause of internationalism. was founded on self-preservation and Similar speeches to the one he has just made were made after the League of Nations hajl been established. If we cast our minds back to the speeches that were delivered at that time, we will recall that they were couched in terms almost exactly similar to the speeches that have been delivered by the Minister for External Affairs; but at least some -had the virtue of having been made with a better sense of reality. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) did not take the view that this country should be sacrificed in the cause of internationalism. Let there be no mistake about our stand in this matter. We ou this side of the chamber believe in and support the principles of the United Nations, but we differ from the Minister in that we say that although The right we believe in the ideals of the United Nations, we must at all times put the He speaks on behalf of interests of our own country first, since there are hostile forces in the world which are still determined to destroy us and our way of life. Time and time again, the Minister has told the people of Australia how he is fighting for its interests. I deny that he is doing so and all thinking people will agree with me. Let us consider what is taking place to the north of Australia. Not long ago, when the Minister made a speech on international affairs in this chamber, he omitted to mention two very vital what was taking place in China nor did he mention the North Atlantic Pact. Honourable members will recall how, when questions were directed to him about the position in China, the right honourable The Minister for External Affairs on no other premise. What kind of nonsense was such a statement hy a man who puts himself forward as the only man in this country who really knows anything ahout this subject? He may be judged by his own statements. Later, he said that the foreign policy of Russia was based on a desire to live in peace with the other nations of the world and that it was designed merely for the protection of Russia's own boundaries. What has happened since then? The world has been divided into two camps solely because Australian, state how he proposes to serveRussia has not been prepared to compromise with the rest of the world. We have seen China overwhelmed. No doubt the Minister is waiting for the moment when he will be able to stand up in this chamber and say, "" We recognize the de facto Government of China "". He may avoid making such a statement as long as he possibly can, but it will not be long before it will be made. AVhat is the de facto Government of China but a government of force? During and since the war we have fought for the maintenance of certain principles, He believes in internationalism. He is one of them being the right of people to determine their own destiny. The Chinese people have not been given the right to determine their own destiny. They are now governed by forces which were aidedand protected by Russia. Let there he no doubt about that. turned towards the west and found that it could not penetrate western Europe beyond its western zone in Germany, it directed its attention to the east. As I have said time after time, we are a white people occupying a geographical appendage of Asia. Because we occupy what is, in substance, an archipelago of Asia we have a very special problem to meet. that the Minister would tell us how he proposes to protect Australia from that threat, but he did not do so. The idea of a Pacific pact emanated, not from the right honourable gentleman, but from this side of the chamber. The Government played around with the idea and used it for political propaganda, hut it did nothing whatever about it. So, to-day, the Government pursues its foreign policy at Lake Success and in all the capitals of Europe, but not in Asia, where our vital interests lie. Mr Spender. Our lack of a defence policy constitutes-' an open invitation to any aggressive hostile power. Only four years have passed since World War II . came to an end but on every occasion when the Minister for External Affairs has happened to be present in this chamber to make a statement on foreign policy he has delivered a speech which has been neither more nor less than an apotheosis of the Tjnited Nations. I have waited for a long time to hear the Minister, who proclaims that he is a great Australia other than through the United Nations. When members of the Opposition mentioned the Pacific Pact, he made two statements, one of which was quite inconsistent with the other. He said that the Pacific Pact would merely bo supplementary to the United Nations, and then he said that it would he an alternative to that organization. Every honourable member will recall his references to those matters. He was trying to compromise with an idea merely for a political reason. He has always stood for internationalism. an internationalist. He is not, in my view, an Australian, and that remark applies also to some honorablo members opposite who interject. enter into personalities, but I say that that is so. If the honourable members opposite so desire, I shall mention a few names. In point of fact, the Government has been infected for a long time by communism. Honourable members opposite pretend to dispute that fact, but there is no doubt about it. I remember perfectly well that just before the last election I had thought the Labour party issued the same kind of propaganda as it is pouring out today to mislead the people of this country. Honorahle members opposite said, "" The Labour party will fight the Communists"". The Labour party has fought the Communists only with words. Words are the only weapon with which the Lahour party will ever fight the Communists. The Minister for External Affairs stood up for two Communists whom I had interned when I was Minister for the Army. Those men had been engaged in treachery to their country in",76,Department Of External Affairs
360,Mr Duthie,Rot.,78,Department Of External Affairs
361,When Russia Mr Spender,"I do not propose towar-time; but tbe Minister declared that tliey should be released. As soon as he became Attorney-General, he released them from internment. But he did more tban that. When he became Attorney General, he supplied the Communist party with all the things that any government eould supply to enable them to carry out their treacherous and traitorous work in this country. That is the kind of man that the Minister is, and that is the kind of political party that the Labour party is. To-day it tries to convince the people that it is fighting communism. Let there, be no doubt in the minds of the people about the attitude of the Labour party on that issue. The Labour party will stoop to any action at all to try to persuade the people that it stands against communism. But, in truth, the honourable members who sit on the right of the Chair are nothing less than the political wing of the industrial movement of this country, and the industrial movement is split asunder because of a division between the Communists and the non-Communists. So, when I say that the Minister is an internationalist, it is simply indicative of the are very close, hut I take leave to doubt attitude of many members of the Labour party. That remark does not apply to all of them, because I know that some of them are as bitterly opposed to communism as I am. I know also that the Labour party is quite incapable of dealing with this treacherous movement in our own country. So it does not surprise me that, when we listen to a debate on international affairs in this chamber, we do not hear the spirit of Australia being breathed at all. All that we hear is international jargon, and it is a jargon which we have heard for a long time. I am not one of those who believe for a moment that the ultimate solution of the world's problems can be obtained finally other than through the comity of the nations; but I am quite satisfied that, in this world of uncertainty to-day, the important thing for us to do is to put our defences in order, and adjust our foreign policy along lines which will preserve our own security. Our own security must be the first consideration. The Minister, and Labour members who seldom make a speech but who always interrupt, state repeatedly that Australia is closer to Great Britain than it has ever been in the past, and, hy the same token, that we are closer to the United States of America than ever before. That statement is absolutely false, as the Minister himself ought to know. It is quite wrong to mislead the public of this country into believing (ihat there has been a smooth, harmonious relationship at official levels between the Australian Government and the representatives of the United States of America in this country. Those of us who have anything to do with these matters know that the contrary is the fact. For a long time the Americans have been seeking to consummate the Fulbright agreement and eliminate double taxation in order to encourage the investment of American capital in this country, but this Government has at all times placed barriers in the way of the fulfilment of either of those objectives. Yet we are told that our relations with the United States of America are closer than they have ever been in the past. I agree that the Government's relations with the Government of Great Britain whether our relations are closer with the people of Great Britain than they have ever been before. The Government's relations with the Government of Great Britain are close only because both governments serve au out-worn philosophy known as socialism. I now desire to make some observations upon a minor matter, although it reveals how the Minister himself is prepared to avoid giving a direct answer to questions on public affaire. This touches a small matter, hut the principle involved is important. On the 28th September, I asked the Minister for External Affairs whether any personal advances had been made to a certain high official in New York who was about to go to another post. I asked the right honourable gentleman whether it was a fact that between the 30th December, 1946, and the l l t h April, 1947, advances totalling 10,500 dollars had been made to that official without any authority from Australia to do so. My question continuedIf authority was given, by whom was it given ? I also asked what amount was outstanding to-day and whether those advances to a consular official constituted a permissible use of government funds. BeforeI proceed to deal with the answer that the Minister has given, I shall make a few preliminary observations. This Government imagines that any money which it expends belongs to it . The truth is that it holds the money only as the trustee on behalf of the people. However, the Government expends public money as if it owns it . BeforeI give the Minister's answers to my questions, I remind the committee that I did not mention the name of the official, but the Minister, who pretended a complete ignorance of the affair, mentioned him. He said that he was quite satisfied that the Australian Consul-Generali n NewY o r k had not engaged in anything irregular. I point out that I did not mention the Australian Consul-General, but hy a strange circumstance, the Minister who pleaded ignorance of the matter knew of the person to whom I was referring. said that the official was going to a post abroad. . there are many Australian oflicials who are going to posts abroad. The Minister shifts them all over the place simply by ringing a bell. He has them under his thumb. He pushes them hither and thither. It is becoming known that more and more officers of the Department of External Affairs are men who are under the Minister's personal dominion. The reply to my question continuedI have made inquiries I beg leave to refuse to accept that statement to its f u l l valueand have ascertained that the officer referred way of a loan? I should like to have to did obtain certain advances in 1947. AmI to understand that when I asked this question, the Minister did not know of this strange departure from ordinary practice, and that a senior officer of his department advances upon personal security? But the Minister said that he had made inquiries and had ascertained that those advances had been made in 1947. I point out the indirect, tortuous, clever, and, in my opinion, politically dishonest way in which the question has been answered. The reply proceededThe advance was made necessary as a result of accommodation commitments into which the officer had necessarily to enter on the expiration of an existing lease. It was considered to be in the interests of the Commonwealth service to provide the advance as against salary. There was more than one advance over a period of some months. The answer continuedThe alternative was to allow the officer to obtain a furnished apartment or house and to pay him a special rent allowance to meet the unusually high costs of furnished accommodation in New York. I pause at this point to make the observation that if , in point of fact, an officer is so badly paid that he cannot struggle along and keep up his position as a representative of this country, the proper course is to increase his allowance. In my view, that is a matter which should be tested ultimately in this chamber, because I want the file to be laid on the table in order that honourable members may examine it . The answer proceededThe advance was personally approved by the then Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, Mr W. E. Dunk, now Chairman of the Public Service Board. I supoose that I make two observations on that statement. The Minister has not said whether the advance was approved before or after it was granted. I want to ascertain whether this quite irregular procedure, for which I can find no justification in the Public Service Eegulations, was brought to the Minister's notice. If it was not, I want to know who runs the Department of External Affairs. ""Was the secretary of the department responsible? If so, who gave to the permanent head of the department the right to advance public funds to an official by that information, because it raises a matter of prime principle. The answer continuedTlie Treasury, to whom the matter was referred in the normal course was receiving personal What is normal about an abnormal transaction? I challenge the Minister to say that a transaction of this description has ever taken place before. The answer continuedThe Treasury, to whom the matter was referred in the normal course, concurred in",78,Department Of External Affairs
362,Dr. Evatt,The honorable member,80,Department Of External Affairs
363,Mr Spendee,"the arrangements for the repayment by regular amounts aud an appropriate mortgage over the officer's furniture. Honourable members will be intrigued to know that the Commonwealth has entered into the business of money-lenders and brokers. What kind of a development is this? Apparently an officer was in financial difficulties and could not carry out his duties as a representative of this country because of the meagreness of his salary and allowance. In that event, the Minister stands condemned because he did not pay the officer a sufficiently high salary to enable him to represent this country abroad. Alternatively, the full story has not been told and all the facts have not been disclosed. In any event, the idea of taking a mortgage over an officer's furniture strikes me as passing strange to say the least. The answer proceededThe original amount was 8,500 dollars and not the larger amount stated by the honourable member for Warringah. I asked another question, and I should be glad to receive an answer to it. I asked whether a number of advances had been made, seven of which were in the amount of 1,000 dollars, one in the amount of 2,000 dollars and one in the amount of 1,500 dollars. That question could have been answered clearly enough with a General and Minister for External"" Yea"" or "" Nay"". I gave specific Affairs) [9.17] -The honourable member amounts aud dates, and I am entitled for Warringah ( Mr Spender) asked to know precisely what those amounts without notice a question which referred were, when they were drawn, and to a consular officer who was about to be whether approval was given before or transferred to another post. I assumed after they were drawn. Finally, the that the reference was to the ConsulMinister statedAs a result of regular deductions, the amount knowledge that an advance of the kind outstanding in March last year was approximentioned by the honourable member had mately 4,000 dollars, and it has since been been made. I do not even now know further reduced. We are not told the amount by which it honourable member's question was referred has been reduced. The committee is to my department, and the answer that entitled to know why the department has was supplied to the honourable member allowed that extraordinary transaction. was provided by the department and by The answer continuedPresent practice is to provide senior officers ing to the incident. The advance was with furnished nccommodation wherever approved by Mr Dunk, who was then possible and to deduct a reasonable amount Secretary of the Department of External from the officer's salary. This avoids the Affairs, and is now Chairman of the expense of moving officers' furniture upon re-posting and also avoids the necessity to Public Service Board. It was also pay excessive rentals for furnished accommodaapproved by the Treasury. The case tion. Afii t was, the arrangement made in seems to be on all fours with that of relation to the home of the consular officer officers for whom furniture is provided, in question wau in accord with the same general principle. That is a tortuous and misleading legalism, because there is no relation between one. transaction and another. If furnished accommodation is provided wherever possible and a reasonable amount is deducted for rent from an officer's salary, it is different from making a personal advance to him to enable him to acquire his own property. Australia is desperately short of dollars, and I should like to know whether that official has been placed in the position of being unable to carry on because the department has paid him a miserly salary and allowance. If that is so, let it be said by the Minister. If not, what is the reason for using public moneys to make a personal advance to any officer of the Commonwealth? If , in faet, a Minister or a permanent officer is able to say, "" You may have an advance for this or that purpose"", what becomes of the boasted control by Parliament of public expenditure? The Parliament would be reduced to a mere shadow. This Government has been too long in power, and has come to believe that it can deal with the public purse as if the money belonged to itself.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Leav e that alone! sore point. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Do not pursue it, anyway! propose to do so. I always know whea. I get to a cliff and I have never gone over one yet. The Minister for External Affairs is a student of history. He has devoted a lot of his time to it. I have had to work hard for my living, and I have not had much time for avocations of that sort, but I recall to the right honourable gentleman the fact that there is nothing new in the idea of a united nations organization. This is no new discovery by a few Marco Polos. It goes back into history. I shall not take honourable members back further than Alexander the Great, who thought that he would achieve a united nations of Europe and Asia by spreading the Greek language. He was wrong. Not long afterwards Rome came on the scene. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honorahle member may not recite the history of the world. reciting the history of the world. I am going into the matter of the United Nations. The Chair gave the Minister for External Affairs an absolutely "" open go"". He was allowed to wander from the Sahara to the Gobi Desert and from the North Pole to Mount Erebus. All I crave is a small amount of the latitude that was given to him. I do not think that you, with your sense of fair play, Mr Temporary Chairman, would deny that to me. There is a historical novel called Quo Vadisl You will find, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the story is quite true. It is about an old Roman who, when he was celebrating a little unwisely and a little too well, was Western Europe and to the east the barnot sure whether 32 or 34 legions had guarded Rome. Charlemagne was another who thought he would Unite the world. The Mohammedan conquests of North Africa and Europe were designed to establish another united nations authority. People then were given the choice of the Koran or the sword. Macdonalds do to the Camerons? honourable member is wrong in his Scottish history. I advise him to look at the picture of Bonnie Prince Charlie and he will see what the McLeods did not do for the king of Scotland. He will want a much wider red stripe in his yellow tartan than he has up to date. We get down further. I do not intend to go into the whole history of the Holy Roman Empire. I mention only Charles V. when practically all Europe, the two Americas and a good slice of Asia were under the one king. That went overboard. There has been one league of nations that has been supremely successful. About it we seldom hear a word. It was previously known as the British Empire. One does not hear, it mentioned in this chamber very often. I have heard it spoken of disparagingly and most apologetically. I have seen it go into a form of voluntary liquidation since completing a successful war, an action for which there is no parallel in history. The Minister for External Affairs tells us about the successes of the United Nations, but he does' not seem to be doing much to increase the strength and cohesiveness of what has been the most successful league of nations, up to date. I refer to the British Empire. I ask the right honourable gentleman where he stands in regard to the Western Union. Does he think it is fated to go in the same direction as ancient Greece? He has read Lord Bryce's Greater Greece. Does he expect Western Europe to go in the same way as Greece went or does he think it would be better to get a united Europe than a United Nations? I point out that, before the 1939 war, the boundary between Europe and Asia was not the Ural Mountains, but the Vistula River. The boundary is far west of the Vistula to-day. It runs through Berlin. To the west is barism of communism and all that barbarism has stood for in the last 4,000 years. Before there can be any approach",82,Department Of External Affairs

385,Mr Falstein,"Let us call for thehas long been trying tb make apparent to this country as being essential for its clef ence. I propose now to say one or two things about the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Warringah. Half of his speech was taken up with a long dissertation and an allegation concerning the Consul-General in New York, who had some advances made to him External Affairs. the advances that were made to the Consul-General were made abnormally, the department was cautious enough to accept some security against the advances. I wonder what he would have 3aid regarding the abnormality of the transaction if the department had not taken that precaution. I consider that that portion of his speech was in bad taste in view of the fact that when the honourable gentleman was in New York he did not hesitate to accept the hospitality and generosity of the Consul General, or so J am reliably informed. Yet he is now seeking to vilify the Consulto accord de facto recognition to the General in this chamber. members may make their own judgment about what kind of a person the honourable member for Warringah must be when, after having accepted a man's hospitality, he comes into the chamber and vilifies him although he is thousands of miles away. The remainder of the honourable member's statements are not capable of analysis, and that remark applies also to the statements of the honourable member for Barker. One of the things that the honourable member for Warringah referred to according to a note that I took was the situation in China. He said, in effect: "" I wonder what the Minister for External Affairs will say when it comes close to the time to recognize the de facto government of China. Will he do so, and what will he tell us then ?"" The implication in his remarks was that there is something sinister in this recognition of another foreign government. to my notes the honourable member also used the words "" recognition of a government that has come to power by force."" The people of this country have not such a short memory that they forget that the honourable member who said that was a Minister in the Menzies Government Ur. which recognized the de facto Franco regime which came into power in Spain by force. The people are not going to forget that when the Soviet Government eventually assumed control of affairs in Russia in 1917 conservative governments of that time did not recognize what was a reality. I put this question to the honourable member for Warringah: What is the alternative, if v/e seek to preserve by the Department of peace, to recognition such as must be Curiously, although eventually afforded even to the new Government in China? I told the House after I returned from China two years ago that the Kuomintang government was rotten and corrupt. I told the House that Chiang Kai-shek, Dr. Soong and their minions were persons who retained power in China only by virtue of their corrupt practices and their maintenance of private armies. That was the only way in which they retained power but the people of China have removed them from a substantial area of the Chinese domain. If it appears that it is desirable or necessary in the interests of peace for Australia Honourable new government of China, that recognition must be accorded even although it may be ideologically unsavoury, OT foreign to our desires. The honourable member for Warringah referred to what he described as the singular failure of the Minister for External Affairs to say what were the particular dangers that confronted this country. Having made such a statement the honourable member himself neatly passed on to ths consideration of another matter without specifying what the dangers were, thus leaving the people to conjecture what the dangers were. The maintenance of a force of 100,000 men in New Guinea would not give us any greater security in Australia than we can obtain by our co-operation with other nations through the United Nations, by entering into obligations such as, According perhaps, a Pacific pact, and by our subscription to the North Atlantic pact and to the Western Union, as well as by our adherence to a form of collective security. No greater safeguards for peace than those could be obtained by our worrying about a few acres of ground in New Guinea, even although they may he held Falstein. by a squadron or two of aeroplanes and by an aircraft carrier and a few battalions of troops. The plain fact of the matter is that the proposed vote of £1,005,000 for the Department of External Affairs wonld provide . a far greater safeguard for peace than the maintenance of large forces and territorial stations in areas beyond Australia's shores. In case it has been forgotten I shall remind honourable members that the Minister is asking for the sanction of Parliament for the expenditure of a sum of £1,005,000 in the current year, which is the equivalent of 2s. 6d. a head of population per annum. That is a sum which some people spend by subscribing to membership of the Liberal party, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Let us examine what we shall buy for this 2s. 6d. each, because I consider that it is time that we had some practicality in this debate. What we shall buy for that 2s. 6d. is first, direct representation for Australia in all the other dominions of the British Commonwealth, which include Canada, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, the Republic of Ireland, and South Africa. Secondly, we shall buy direct representation for Australia at ambassadorial level in the countries of the permanent member nations of the Security Council of the United Nations. Those nations include the Soviet Union, France, China, Great Britain and the United States of America, f n addition to that we shall buy direct representation, through our office in Brazil, in all the Latin-American countries. I do not think that any one would doubt for a moment that the expenditure of such a small sum of money per capita is an extremely wise insurance from the point of view of both security and trade. No honourable member who has spoken in this debate has suggested that the amount for which approval is being sought is in excess of what should be provided. Nobody has suggested that it is inadequate in any way. A full explanation has been given by the Minister about what I regard as the successful attempts by the Government and the Minister to conserve expenditure in areas in which vve have to provide dollars to maintain our diplomatic representation. There has been no argument from honorahle members opposite about the importance of the vote for the Department of. External Affairs. The argument by honourable members opposite in this chamber to-day has been based upon a worn out case on foreign affairs that has been advanced on every occasion on which statements on foreign affairs have been presented to the Parliament, irrespective of the contents of those statements. Honourable members opposite have simply said the same old things over and over again. The Minister did not initiate a debate on foreign affairs himself today but was provoked by the statements of honourable members opposite. The same old arguments have been adduced again and again by the same few honourable members opposite. I refer to the honourable member for Barker, the honourable member for Warringah, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). We might as well have gramophone records made of their speeches, because having once been made they could be played over and over again and we should be just as well informed on the subjects that the honourable members speak on, as we are when they stand up and make a speech on them. If cacophony were to be accepted for argument, then we have been overwhelmed to-day, because all I got from the speech of the honourable member for Warringah was plenty of noise and not much sense. We also got that little bit of scandal about the Consul-General in New York that he threw in to make up the weight. I suggest that that piece of scandal was in the worse possible taste when we consider that the honourable member for Warringah had previously accepted the Consul-General's hospitality and generosity. able member know that? explained that to the committee. might have told a lie.

That is a small individual contribution for each taxpayers to make for a department that is as important as this one is. The total proposed vote for the department represents two-elevenths of one per cent, of the entire budget vote, and, therefore, it seems unfair and unreasonable that the time of the committee should be occupied with the trivial and frivolous amendment that has been moved to reduce the vote by £1.

In an address of that length, delivered on one of the rare occasions when he is present in this chamber, he should have explained his attitude to certain issues that are of vital importance, not only to this country, but also to the world at large. Instead of doing so, the right honourable gentleman made what can only be reasonably described as a political speech about our foreign policy. He did not give us an objective account of the policy of the Government in relation to the events in Europe and, pean and Asiatic continents, the outcome of which may well affect the fate of this country. What is the attitude of this Government to the trends that have unfolded in Europe? What is its attitude towards the North Atlantic Pact? What is its attitude towards the militaTy implications of that pact on the nations of Europe? Where does Australia stand in that regard? The right honourable gentleman did not mention those matters.

It certainly did not fit in with the Minister's proclaimed earnestness about Australia's status in the international arena. How could we expect a young man in his 'thirties who, ten years ago, was a junior cable clerk in the Prime Minister's Department, to wield influence when seated opposite a man of the international stature of General MacArthur?

What is the significance of replacing MrI f that were true, we should have reached Shaw by the senior Australian career diplomat, Colonel Hodgson? Does this change portend greater activity in the Japanese area, or does it indicate that Colonel Hodgson has been removed from his former post as Australian Ambassador to France merely to make room for some one else ? Those are some of the matters that we expected the Minister to discuss. This country is vitally interested in the conclusion which the Minister draws from the revelation that the Soviet possesses the secret of the atomic bomb. We shall not be brushed aside by the sneering statement of an honorahle member opposite that the association of diplomacy with the prospect and possibility of war is the task of the war-monger. accusations even from the ministerial bench. The truth is that the principal job of the diplomat is to avoid war. That is the raison d'etre of the diplomat. It is his task to do everything possible to avoid war. If war cannot be avoided, it is his job to see that his own country is so situated that it is not likely to bo defeated I remind him and the people that such and not likely to have to fight without the assistance of allies. That has heen the historic function of the diplomat. History carries many messages to us of the services that have heen rendered by skillful, assiduous foreign ministers to their respective countries, and of the disaster that has befallen some nations because of the failure of their foreign ministers. Where do we stand in that respect of the General Assembly of the United to-day? Are we merely floating along Nations have been completely irreconcilhappily in the belief .that, because this able. The office of umpire or judge and, That was the nation subscribes to the principles of the United Nations, it is safe from agression? I support the principle of the United Nations. It is the one organized hope for the preservation of human society. I hope that we may be able to avoid the horrors of war, but I do not rate the prospects higher than a hope. I remind the Government and the people that the whole history of mankind is one of conflict after conflict. I simply cannot believe that I just happen to live on the earth, which has existed for millions of years, and which has been inhabited by humans for 3cores of thousands of years, at the moment when war has ceased forever. the age of miracles. This nation requires its Minister for External Affairs to devote his talents primarily to the historic function of all foreign ministers, and that is, to see that his country has a sound recognizable foreign policy; that it knows where it is going and with whom it is going; that it knows who are its friends and who are its potential enemies; and that it knows-, too, that, if the catastrophe of war befalls it, who its allies will be. That is the function of a Minister for External Affairs, as I conceive it. There is another job of work to be done. I refer to the carrying on of a crusade for peace in the United Nations and its subsidiary organizations. The One hears such United Nations must have vast powers. The General Assembly must have a president. The Minister for External Affairs has enjoyed the congratulations of honourable members on both sides of this chamber on the high honour he has achieved in being chosen to preside over the General Assembly of the United Nations. an appointment places him in much the same position as that of a judge of a court or an umpire of a football match.. It lifts him above the level of partisanship. But we all are partisans in a partisan world. The task of our foreign Minister is to recognize that he is a partisan, and that his offices as Minister for External Affairs and as the President at .the same time, leader of his own particular team are completely irreconcilable. If the Australian Government or the Australian people are able to produce a man who is so highly regarded as to bo elected President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the honour conferred upon him is dearly bought. After the honour has been conferred upon him, he ceases to be able to take his place as a partisan. When our Minister for External Affairs was President of the General Assembly we were the only nation in the world without a leader. We should not be leaderless in this sphere in days when bitter, acrimonious and partisan argument has never been more acute in international affairs. That was our lot during a vital year when we, of all the nations of the world, were denied a representative to state our case, because the President of the General Assembly is like a judge or an umpire and cannot state a case for a litigant or for one of the teams. A judge must hold the scales of justice evenly between the contending parties. The Minister for External Affairs had to hold the scales of justice at the General Assembly of the United Nations, and sometimes it was his lot to hold the scales when they were tipped against the interests of the English-speaking peoples. I do not wish to be misunderstood on this matter. I am proud that an Australian has been chosen to fill such a high oflice, but I hope that never again will a Minister for External Affairs accept such an office. If , in the an Australian Minister for External Affairs is offered such a post, he should vacate his oflice as Minister and allow his place to be taken by another person who is not inhibited by his obligations to disregard the partisan spirit. ter for External Affairs does not misunderstand the point which I am endeavouring to make. Australia should be represented at the General Assembly of the United Nations by a Minister for External Affairs who can state a case for his nation, and fight for it in a manner which has not .been possible in the past, because of conflicting loyalties on the part of our representative. Affairs, whoever he may be, is our frontline advocate in conferences that discuss measures for the avoidance of war, and for formulating plans against the possibility of war. He cannot satisfactorily, occupy two offices at the same time. I refer to the office of spokesman for his country, and to the office of an objective and impartial judge. I regard that as an important matter. What should be the policy of the Australian nation. I certainly shall not attempt to cover in detail at the present time what I consider the policy of the Australian nation ought to be, but the Opposition parties say collectively and unanimously that the broad course of our policy is clear. It is to maintain a complete and unbroken alinement of all the elements of the British Commonwealth. This should not be done in the expectation of getting our own way on every occasion, and we certainly should not pursue any course either through theoretical or selfish national and personal motives that will weaken the alinement of the whole of the British people. That is the first and simple objective of Australia's foreign policy. The second simple and recognizable point of our foreign policy is to lend the whole of our weight of influence towards welding all the elements of the British Commonwealth with the rest of the English-speaking world, including our great cousin, the United States of America. Unless that unity is achieved, there is no hope for us in this future, kind of world. When that objective has been achieved, we should try to weld the English-speaking elements with those who see democracy with the same eyes as we see it. In the world to-day, there is a Hoc of satellites circulating around one tremendously powerful nation which I am sure that the Minispreaches the gospel of democracy but does not practise any principle of it We must ensure that we shall not drift into a position of weakness ms-a-ms that great bloc. The Minister for External Affairs and members of the Opposition have referred at various times to the territories of the Commonwealth. It is true, as has been stated, that the territory of New The Minister for External Guinea was held under mandate, not because we desired to administer it in that way, but because the League of Nations",88,Department Of External Affairs
395,Mr Mcewen.,"would not award it to us under any other conditions. Australia held New Guinea under the mandate system until the League of Nations dissolved after the outbreak of World War II . New Guinea is geographically our frontline of defence, tralian Government defends the'principle and with the disappearance of the League of Nations it came into the possession of this country. It cannot be denied that Australia has given away New Guinea under the trusteeship system. The Minister for External Affairs can rightly claim to be the principal author of the doctrine of trusteeship at the San Francisco conference. That doctrine was not well received by the representatives of the United Kingdom. Indeed, they resisted the doctrine, and, in doing so, they had the support of the representatives of the United States of America. However, the doctrine of trusteeship and all the arguments in favour of self-determination and the like can be wrapped up in such plausible language that they become almost irresistible. The Australian Minisdated territory should be left without ter for External Affairs, as the principal spokesman for that doctrine, was immediately supported by the delegates of Soviet Eussia and of all the little countries of the world which have not played a part of deciding national destiny but which were invited to the party at San Francisco. power as the larger nations. for Indi will recall that Mr Stassen, the United States delegate, was the chief spokesman for the trusteeship proposals. any such thing.

Last night, the Prime Minister said that the people of the United Kingdom were the same to-day as they were in 1939. May I express the opinion that members of the Labour party in this chaniber to-day hold the same views as members of the Labour party held in 1939? What was the attitude of the Labour party ten years ago to the defence of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea? When the Menzies Government introduced legislation to extend the provisions of the Defence Act to New Guinea, every member of the Labour party voted against it. They desired that the mandefences. The Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward), speaking either on that bill or on the defence Estimates in 1939, said, in effect, ""Let those who want to defend New Guinea go there and defend it themselves "". That gentleman is now entrusted with supervising the welfare of the backward peoples of the trusteeship territories that are administered by Australia. He had nothing to say in their favour in 1938-39, but to-day he holds the banner high aloft, or so he says. The scene has changed. We cannot put back the hands of the clock. Trusteeship is an actuality in the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that the Australian Government will realize that we cannot go along in the certainty that Australia will never again be involved in war, and that Australians will not have to fight again in New Guinea, where their fathers or brothers He in their thousands as the victims of the last war. I hope that this Government will start to take a more realistic view in relation to the defence of New Guinea, as the Government of the United States of America has from the outset taken a more realistic view in regard to the strategic importance df some of the islands which that country holds under trusteeship. I shall say no more on that aspect, but",90,Department Of External Affairs

402,Mr Mcewen,"I recollect clearlywill hearken back to the principal motif of my speech, which is that one cannot be both a player and an umpire. afford to be without a spokesman in the councils of the world to-day. We have been without a spokesman for a year, due to the high honour that was conferred upon our Minister for External Affairs. I argue most strongly that if ever again an Australian Minister is so honoured he should vacate his office as Minister for External Affairs during the time that he holds such a high position, and thus allow us to have a spokesman in the councils of the nations, as has every other country in the world. honourable member for Indi( Mr serve peace in the world. McEwen) has made a thoughtful and -useful contribution to the debate. If the -speech that he has just delivered represents Opposition policy there is very little difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition on the vital question of foreign policy. I think that the Leader of the Liberal party ( Mr Menzies) has from time to time expressed sentiments similar to those that have been expressed by the honourable member for Indi. The utterances of other prominent members of Opposition parties, however, give us reason to doubt whether they give such unwavering support to the agencies that have been established to prevent war in the future. We all know that in time of war, or threatened war, such agencies may break down. As the honourable member for Indi has truly said, he puts his faith fully in the United Nations organization as one of the few organizations from which peace might ultimately be derived. That is a faith and a hope that each of us who puts in that honourable member said that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) altered the tone of this debate so that there could be a full discussion on foreign affairs. That is not so. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) made a definite attack oh the United Nations as an organization. that he was completely without faith in the United Nations though he denied this later by interjection. The honourable This country cannot member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) also expressed lack of faith in the United Nations. Each of us could preach that gospel of despair. It is highly probable that we would be right if we said to-day that the United Nations will fail. As the honourable member for Indi has said, we must hope that it will not fail when a future crisis comes, as it surely will come. One of the major reasons why these organizations fail is that the nations of the world are not yet willing to sink their immediate national interests and sovereignty in order to give international organizations some real power by which to preThe honourable member for Richmond also made sneering references to the high honour that had fallen to the Minister for External Affairs. In order to high-light his view of that honour, which the honourable member for Indi acknowledges, he cited all of the nations-al l small nations -whos e representatives have been honoured in this way. He implied that the representatives of small nations were chosen for this honour, without regard for the ability of their representatives, probably because they were the only ones who would accept the honour. That is wholly false. It ought to be accepted that any nation, no matter how email, may make a useful contribution to the world's discussions, and may, as we did, produce a man who could with dignity and good results fulfil the very high positions to which he was appointed. The honourable member for Indi stated a quite false analogy when he set out the principal object of his speech, to prove that the Minister for External Affairs, as president of the General Assembly of supports the United Nations the United Nations, could and should be organization. The likened to a judge or umpire, because he was called upon to lay down or interpret Tules, and to give judgment on legal points placed before him. I think that the honourable member has misunderstood the nature of this position, at leastas it appears to him. Instead of heing in the position of a judge or umpire, it appears to me that the He indicated quite clearly, president of the General Assembly",91,Department Of External Affairs
403,Mr Burke (Perth) [10.26],"Th eof the Tjnited Nations plays a vital role as a leader in the councils of the world. He does not judge the issues or interpret the rules, hut gives a lead to a team of men and women who are seeking earnestly to spare the world the horrors of future war. The representative that Australia sent to the General Assembly last year was elected president of that body. In that position he played a vital role, and gave the lead in all of the Tjnited Nations discussions. He gave aid and assistance, and the benefit of his wide organizational knowledge, as well as diplomatic energy and sense, to the representatives of nations that were striving earnestly to preserve the peace of the world. I do not think that the argument of the honorahle member for Indi that Australia was deprived of a spokesman can be sustained. Rather do I think, as I have already said, that we have had our spokesman in the most vital role to which he could be elected. Apart from that there is little in the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Indi with which one could quarrel. The item of the Estimates which is now being debated deals with the total work of the Department of External Affairs. The United Nations is only one of the variety of organizations in which the department is interested. The General Assembly and the Security Council are vital parts of this new world organization which seeks to find a formula for continued peace. I believe that the specialized organizations to which Australia subscribes play a vital role. The failure of the League of Nations was due in part to its failure to establish such specialized organizations. There were other reasons, however, which were associated with nations that were jealous of their sovereignty. The failure to establish specialized organizations dealing with finance, trade and commerce, and a host of other problems, was one of the major reasons why the League failed. That fault the present organization has sought to correct. Australia has diplomatic representatives in various parts of the world. These diplomatic posts are, as the honourable member for Indi pointed out, agencies for peace. They perform three functions-to stimulate and expand international trade, to improve friendly relations with other countries and to promote peace. Therefore, there is no reason why the Government should be criticized for establishing diplomatic posts overseas. Rather should it be commended for so doing. In addition to relying on the United Nations, to which we have given our f u l l and unwavering support, we seek to maintain good relations with the United States of America and the United Kingdom. That has been Australia's traditional policy, and it is our policy today. The British Commonwealth, hy whatever name it may be called, has always been a major force for peace. It can still play an important part in the world. The United States of America is a bastion of peace and liberty. It could well stand alone. It is the strongest, richest and the most highly industrialized nation in the world, but it has given f u l l support to the United Nations. That ought to be sufficient answer to those carping critics who say that no reliance can he placed on the United Nations. Great Britain, with colonies and territories all over the world, has also, under Conservative and Labour governments alike, supported the United Nations. Yet we are told by some honourable members opposite that we should not be associated with that organization and that because similar organizations failed in the past, we should have nothing to do with the United Nations. The fact is that every country, great or small, that gives its support to the United Nations is seeking to preserve world peace, and to prevent the suffering and horror associated with modern war. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) discussed the work of the United Nations, and claimed that it had failed in every issue to which it had addressed itself. The reverse is the truth. It has succeeded in almost everything it has attempted to do. Most of the issues to which he referred were specifically excluded from the activities of the United Nations. For instance, the making of peace with Germany and Japan was specifically excluded in that way. It was to be left to the Great Powers to work out peace formulas, and only after that was done was the United Nations to take up its task. In some instances, work which had at first been specifically withheld fro m the Tjnited Nations, had to he handed over to it . All thc problems dealt w i th by the Tjnited Nations have not yet been solved, and some may not be solved for a considerable time. The honourable member for In d i made a valuable contribution to the debate. He has given almost unqualified support to the United Nations, and to the work of our own Department of External Affairs. I do not believe that we can spread our representation too widely throughout the world. Such representa-. tion should be the means of our getting to know other nations better, and of allowing other nations to know us better. We need to promote trade and good relations with other countries. It is proposed to expend just over £1,000,000 on the work of the Department of External Affairs, and I believe that the expenditure of even more would be justified. The Government has no case to answer. Its foreign policy has been wise, and the Ministerf o r External Affairs should be commended for his work, and urged to continue it . I notice that whenever we embark on a discussion on external affairs, the Ministerf o r External Affairs( D r . E v a t t ) , when he is here, which is not very often, rather cunningly seeks to turn thc discussion into one on the United Nations. It seems that the United Nations is with him a ruling passion, strong in death. Everything else is subordinated to the United Nations. Let me point out that the first duty of the Minister is no.t to ( Mr Spender) raised a very material the United Nations, but to the people of matter when he moved an amendment Australia. H is performances during the that the proposed vote of the Department last few years have indicated that he is. of External Affairs should be reduced by in truth, an internationalist, and noL, £1. The honourable member took that in truth, a good Australian. I made a action in order to draw the attention of similar statement when he was in the committee to a question that he asked the House during a fleeting moment on the 28th September, to which the last year. remark, and said that it was not true, written answer a few days ago. The. but he had fled back to Lake Success or honourable member has already discussed Timbuctoo or somewhere else before 1 the matter at some length, and I do not could j u s t if y my statement. endeavour to justify it now in. his attention of honourable members to the presence. With the exception of the answer supplied by the Minister. His honourable member for Watson( Mr. Falstein) and the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke), honourable members who support the Government have been strangely silent about the Department of External Affairs. The lionorable member for Perth was also completely obsessed by the United Nations. The committee is not discussing the United Nations. It is discussing the estimates for the Department of External Affairs, which amount to a little more than £1,000,000, as the honourable member for Perth has airly put it . This amount of the taxpayers' money is to be expended, at the behest of the Ministerf o r External Affairs. I do not propose to discuss whether the United Nations is any good, whether it should occupy this place or that in the heirachy or whether it should be first in our scale of values, or last. I think that it falls somewhere in between. The United Nations certainly does not come first in my scale of values. Mr Duthie interjecting, for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) should remain silent on this matter, which is outside the ambit of his normal activities. Australia comes first in my scale of values, and the British Empire next. I agree w it h the honourable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron) that the English-speaking peoples should come third, and the United Nations may come fourth. I do not know what place that body occupies in the scale of values of t.he honourable member for Wilmot.

405,Mr Beale,"The honourable memberanswer was profoundly unsatisfactory, more so because the question related to a matter of such importance. Surely it was a serious matter if a high consular omciai in thc course of his activities, used public funds without proper authorization. Warringah asked the MinisterHas the Minister for External Affairs given any direction that members of the Australian diplomatic or consular corps shall have the right to draw upon government funds as personal loans to themselves? The M in is t e r ' s reply to t h a t question was. . . no ministerial direction was given in relation to the advance, the matter being dealt with administratively between the department, the Treasury and of the oflicer concerned. . . .

The next question the honourable member asked wasIsi t known to the Treasury and to the secretary of the Department of External Affairs that a certain high consular official in New York who is now about to ' go elsewhere, arranged, between the 30th December, 1948, and the 11 th A p r i l, 1947, for advances to himself totalling 10,500 dollars without any authority from Australia to do so? The Minister replied. . . I have made inquiries and have ascertained that the officer referred to did obtain certain advances in 1947. The advance was made necessary aa a result of accommodation commitments. . . . There is not a single word in that reply to suggest that there was any authority whatever for the officer to obtain the funds. Was his action authorized ex post factol If so, why was not the Parliament informed of the fact? Eeading between the lines of constitute the evasive answer furnished by the Minister, I suspect that when some one had disThat question has not been answered. covered that the officer concerned had got The Minister has not expressed any -view the money, the Government sought to about whether the advances constituted a hush the matter up hy approving retropermissible use of government funds. spectively of the officer's action.

I have referred issued certain instructions to the finance section of the Australian ConsulateGeneral in New York to make out vouchers payable to him, seven of which were in the amount of 1,000 dollars, one in the amount of 2,000 dollars and one in the amount of 1,500 dollars V Again, the Minister failed to deal with The honourable member for the question. In fact, he did not answer the question at all, and we have not been told whether the officer concerned did give instructions to his own finance section in New York to make advances to him. We ought to be told whether he did so or not. It is highly important to know whether a consular officer, whoever ho may he, issued instructions to his subordinates to advance money to him. It does not matter whether or not his irregular action was subsequently ratified. Eveni f such conduc to be told how the officer concerned came to get the money. The honourable member also made the following inquiry:Isi t also a fact tliat in March of this year « sum of 8,500 dollars in advances to this official was still outstanding? In reply to that question, the Minister stated that the amount involved was now only 4,000 dollars. Then he was asked whether the facts were known to the Department of External Affairs and to the Treasury. The Minister replied to the effect that they wero known -to Mr Dunk. There is a cloud of doubt even now around the Ministers or senior officials to whom details of the transaction were known. I am still not clear whether the Minister, the Secretary of the department, the Chairman of thp Public Service Board, or any one else, knew about it. The honourable member also askedDo those advances to a consular official funds? a permissible use of government Finally, the Minister was asked whether he was prepared to lay the file It is clear, tlierefore, that the answers supplied by the Minister to the honourable meniber covered only part of the questions' and that some aspects of the questions were not answered at all. In those circumstances, I submit that the honourable member for Warringah was amply justified in moving that the proposed vote of the department be reduced by & 1. Are the public accounts to be dipped into by people in the manner suggested by the circumstances of this Case? If , and when, such irregularities Occur, are .they to be approved of subsequently by the Government? Is it permissible for a consular official to do such a thing as has been suggested? If a consular official is entitled to do such <i thing, why should not any other officer of the Public Service be permitted to do likewise? In other words, is any official who finds himself short of money and who deems his allowances insufficient for his needs to be permitted to draw upon the public funds? Is a senior official to be permitted to instruct his subordinates to issue funds to him? I repeat that none of those questions have been replied to in the answer submitted by the Minister. The matter shady and unsatisfactory state and the committee would be quite justified in voting for the amendment in order to show its disapproval of the Government's attitude. I turn now to Australia's participation in respect of New Guinea. tion was recently House about the matter, and a reply was furnished hy the Minister. To my mind that reply was quite unsatisfactory. I have already expressed my views on this matter in the House in the absence of the Minister, and I now propose to repeat, them while he is present, so that he may have an opportunity to reply to my criticism. I say that when the Minister, at various international including that which was held at Dumbarton Oaks in 1945, agreed to place New Guinea under trusteeship to the Tjnited Nations he betrayed the vital interests of Australia. I make that statement without any equivocation whatever. I remind the committee that when World Mr Beale. War II . occurred Australia was holding New Guinea under mandate, as distinct from Papua, which was a British Crown colony administered by Australia, and part of Australia's territory. New Guinea was held by Australia as a C class mandate from the league of Nations. At the peace conference of 1919, the Australian representatives, in common with the British representatives, desired that Australia should annex the territory as being strategically vital to it. That was opposed by President Wilson, who favoured a different arrangement altogether. He was entirely opposed to annexation. He had alongside him many advisors with great experience in his own State Department who did not share his views. One of them was Byers, the chief of his colonial department, who favoured annexation of New Guinea by Australia. He said that a country so close to Australia was vital to it and should be absorbed by it. However, the Wilson view was against annexation. A compromise was reached under which New Guinea and German South-West Africa became 0 class mandates. Those territories were to be administered as integral parts of the has heen left in a mandatory countries. There is ample evidence in the documents, most of which I have taken the trouble to read that it was understood by all concerned that ultimately the administration of those territories would lead to their absorption. That was the position from 1919 to 1939. It is true the trusteeship agreement in that during that time we made reA quesports to the League of Nations on our asked in the administration of New Guinea. Those reports did not receive the sort of reception that our reports have received since the the trusteeship arrangement of 1946. TJnder the mandate, it was clearly and widely understood that Australia's interest in New Guinea was vital and strategic, and our reports were accepted almost universally without criticism. The League of Nations folded up and died in conferences, 1939. When it died, the legal arrangement, if one may so describe it, under which we held the mandate for the administration of New Guinea died with it. Another factor emerged in 1942 when Japan invaded New Guinea. We had to fight for our life in New Guinea. Australian lives were lost there to defend it. The view held in 1919 by Mr W. M . Hughes, the Australian delegate, and by the British delegates was that New Guinea was essential to our safety, and this was amply demonstrated in 1942 when Australia was nearly overwhelmed. We had to fight for New Guinea. The blood of Australian manhood was shed there. A new situation altogether arose with the death of the League of Nations. At that moment, we ceased to be under any legal or moral obligation to regard New Guinea as a country to be held under any form of mandate or trusteeship. We had been administering it for the benefit of the natives as we had administered Papua for the benefit of the natives. Our administration of Papua was a model to the world. Every one knows of the wonderful work done by Sir Hubert Murray and others in Papua. We did the same thing in New Guinea proper. There was no reason to suppose that we should not go on doing it. So no argument can be based on the fact that we had an obligation to the natives. We observed that obligation. We did an extremely good job, and, when the war came, and the League of Nations collapsed and died, we were entitled to regard New Guinea as our country and to take possession of it and fortify it and exclude all other people on the ground of its being essential to our safety to the end of time. some people associated with him, by That is what the Prime Minister of our sister dominion South Africa did about German South-West Africa. South Africa held a similar mandate over German South-West Africa, and when the time came, the then Prime Minister of South Africa, Field-Marshal Smuts, declined, in one form of words or another, to accept the position that South-West Africa automatically came under the trusteeship of the Tjnited Nations. There has been argument ever since, but .the position has never been yielded. South Africa regards South-West Africa as strategically necessary to it. We have a much stronger case for the retenetion of possession of New Guinea, because of its geographical situation in relation to that of Australia. The learned Minister for External Affairs tries to justify the dumping of New Guinea into the lap of the United Nations. I quote the words that he used in 1946, when he saidThe future of native races 13 the subject of legitimate international interest. But what about Papua? On that ground, why did he not take Papua along, too, and dump it into the lap of the United Nations for trusteeship? What about all the British Crown colonies? What about all our own aborigines if the future of native races is a proper subject of international interest ? Why does he not dump Australia itself into the lap of the United Nations for trusteeship? Let us see what really did happen between the Dumbarton Oaks conference and the United Nations conference in 1946, because the Minister for External Affairs has not been frank with honourable members. He suggested that the British Government had acquiesced in the arrangements, but that is not so, for it was presented by him with a fait accompli. After objections had heen made, the original proposal was modified. The draft treaty prepared for the Dumbarton Oaks conference left a blank space under the headings indicating international mandates or trusteeships. That space was never filled, for the reason, as I interjected during the Minister's speech, that the Americans "" jacked up "". They were not going to have this proposal, which was apparently inspired by the Minister, and which all native races and their countries came under trusteeship. As the result, the Carolines, the Marshalls and Ladrones came under strategic trusteeship. The Americans said that they would take them over under that arrangement. That was done. To put the casr; at its lowest level that could have been done about New Guinea. Then we could not only have fortified New Guinea but could also have excluded other people from it, whereas under the trusteeship we cannot exclude other people as all honourable members well know. However, the ideas of the American State Department did lean towards an increased international control over colonies, including, by the way, British colonies. The Americans did not have many colonies, so some members of the State Department thought it would be a good idea to have increased international control over colonies. Department's views were not accepted by the American service departments, on the ground of American security. Those departments insisted that either the United States should annex the former Japanese mandated territories of the Carolines, the Marshalls and the Ladrones or at least that they should be available as "" floating aircraft carriers "". The service departments held that at t.he very least American control of those islands should take the form of a strategic trusteeship, and that was what ultimately happened. remind the committee that in the meantime a .treaty was concluded by Australia and New Zealand which referred to trusteeships in the Pacific. As the result of that treaty a declaration was issued early in 1945 by the Australian Minister for External Affairs and the New Zealand Prime Minister, the effect of which was to give approval to the trusteeship principle with international supervision by countries that were members of the Trusteeship Council. I also remind the committee that that declaration was intended to cover the British colonial mandates as well as the Australian and New Zealand mandates. To say the least it did not obtain the approval of the British Government. Shortly after that a conference of the Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth was held. Mr Edmonds interjecting, able members do not consider this matter to be very important, and the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) may be one of them. I should like to tell the honourable member for Herbert that it is of supreme importance to us on this side of the committee that the people of Australia should learn the history of this matter and discover how they have been betrayed and how our vital interests have been subordinated to other considerations. We have never been told the full story in the Parliament before. We have had to fossick it out for ourselves. Now we have heen told that the British Government has agreed to this, that and the other, but that is not true. The original pron? al for a ireneral colonial trusteeship a was not adopted by the British Government. Yet step by step the territory of The State New Guinea was brought into a position where is was handed over to the Tjnited Nations and we are now obliged to make reports each year to the United Nations on our administration. We have been obliged to submit ourselves to the humiliation of being criticized, on one occasion by the Chinese, on another occasion by the Patagonians or somebody and on still another occasion by some other nation, in respect of our administration of that territory which is so essential to our security. Russia. criticized us on every possible occasion, and every honourable member must know that under Article 76 of the United Nations Charter, pursuant to which we hold this territory in trust, any member nation of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations is entitled to send its representatives to examine the territory of New Guinea including its defences, if it so chooses. We are no longer masters in our own house. I believe that we should have taken the territory over and made it ours when we could have done so in 1939, just as the present right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) wanted to do in 1919 when he was Prime Minister. We should certainly have taken it over in 1939 or 1940 when we had the legal and moral opportunity to do so after thc League of Nations had collapsed and we had to defend it by force of our own arms. Our plain duty then was not to hand it over to the United Nations but to make it our own territory. One person to whom I mentioned my view on this particular matter said, "" But that is an annexation! "" I describe it only a., claiming a country that is geographically, strategically and on every other basis, essential to Australia. Anyhow at the very least we should have followed thf American lead, because the arrangement that the United States made in relation to the former Japanese mandates let it open for other members of the United Nations to adopt the same policy.

Dr. General and Minister for External Affairs) [11.14] -The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), has referred to New Guinea. In many respects he has been completely inaccurate. He has been most dogmatic ahout this matter. First of all he stated that by accepting trusteeship over the former Mandated Territory of New Guinea we had betrayed the interests of Australia. man says, "" Hear, hear! "" The facts do not matter to him. He will not study the debates. One honourable member opposite, I think it was the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), has suggested that no matter was brought before the Parliament in connection with New Guinea. That is completely untrue. Every stage of the proceedings before finality was reached, was brought before the House. afterwards . it in the Minister's absence a few months ago. ber states that it was debated a few months ago during my absence. I take it that that would be in 1949, when the Papua and New Guinea Bill was introduced. I do not desire to take up unnecessary time over this matter, but I consider that the inaccuracies of the honourable member for Parramatta should be placed on record. In rebuttal of those inaccuracies I refer the committee to the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Ohifley) on New Guinea trusteeship to this House on the 7th August, 1946, long before the arrangements for the trusteeship were made. The facts in relation to the San Francisco conference at which the United Nations Charter was drawn up, are quite clear. I stated them earlier to the committee, but was contradicted quite wrongly by one honourable member. I said that the trusteeship system agreed upon at San ""Francisco was worked out in detail by the representatives, not only of Australia, but also of the United States Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) attended that conference as one of the Australian delegates, and so did the honourable member for. Indi forgotten a]l about it. for Indi was absent from the deliberations most of the time. but apparently he has forgotten what happened at that conference. I said, by way of interjection during the speech of the honourable member for Indi, that Mr Harold Stassen, a leader of the Republican party in America and an American delegate to the San Francisco conference, was in charge of the committee which dealt with trusteeship. His suggestions were the basis on which the agreement was finally worked out. of Mr Stettinius and of the American service departments. United States representative at the San Francisco conference. Now we have another interjection by the honourable member for Parramatta to the effect that Mr Stettinius was one of the delegates at San Francisco and was actually responsible for the form of the trusteeship agreement. I cannot believe that the honourable member has even the sightest hasis for such an assertion. These things are part of the work that was going on then. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred to Dumbarton Oaks. Australia was not represented at Dumbarton Oaks. The honourable member has referred to it six times as though we were represented there, but that was simply a conference of great powers. It was a conference at Washington of representatives of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Russia and China simply for the purpose of preparing a draft for San Francisco.

419,Dr. Evatt,"I am speaking of thedrafting committee. The Dumbarton Oaks proposals were submitted to a conference of 50 nations at San Francisco. Trusteeship was of great importance. What was to happen about the mandated territories? dogmatizing as he so often does on difficult questions of international law, said that the mandate system had come to an end. That was the question. Had it come to an end? foundation for saying that the outbreak of war brought that system to an end. Such a doctrine was never accepted by any international lawyer. At any rate, it was a matter of debate. What had to be done in connection with these mandates? The matter was taken up at San Francisco. I am not dealing with the Dumbarton Oaks proposal now. I repeat, and the records of the San Francisco conference establish beyond doubt, that the main paper, the working paper of the trusteeship committee, was Stassen's paper presented on behalf of the United States delegation. That was a broad outline of the trusteeship system as it applies to New Guinea to-day. Mr under the international trusteeship system Strassen was the leader of the committee. As the proposals were put forward, he would speak as the leader of the house. The United States was active in support of the trusteeship system, and the United Kingdom delegate played an almost equally prominent part in the elaboration of it. It is perfectly true, as the honor1946. able member for Parramatta says, that Australia and New Zealand favoured the system. But then we had not just a few countries imposing a trusteeship system. We had the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand in favour of it. The working paper was, in substance, adopted with some modification. the United States did not put its own territories under the same trusteeship? did not at that time have any territories under mandate.. mandate in the Marshalls and the Carolines. altogether. If honourable members will follow the situation carefully, the position is that the United States was not possessed of any mandated territory prior The honourable member, to the occasion of which we are speaking. The countries that were directly concerned were countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. NowI come to the statement that was made in this chamber, because a full report was brought back and presented to the Parliament and debated here, I suppose four or five times before 1949. The House never divided on the issue. The Opposition accepted the principle. The present objection is merely something that has been thought of years later, I presume by the honourable member for Parramatta. Those are the facts. The Prime Minister made a statement to the House on the 7th August, 1946 which is reported on page 3853 of volume 188 of Hansard. The right honourable gentleman saidOn the 17th JanuaTy, 1940, The conference had been held in 1945the Australian Government declared its intention of placing the Territory of New Guinea established by the United Nations. Similar declarations were made by the governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand concerning their mandated territories in Africa and Western Samoa respectively. statement made? ment in November, 1946, and I took the first opportunity that was available to me after that to debate this matter. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Burke) -Order! The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has been persistently interjecting. That must cease. It does not contribute to orderly debate and does not help the statement of the case by the Attorney-General. pointing that out, then explained the system which applies now, although it had not been adopted at that time by the It had the Japanese United Nations.

429,Dr. Evatt,"The Prime Minister, inaccepted as a trust territory, and therefore there was time to withdraw. It was merely a statement of intention. The Prime Minister saidThere are two fundamental considerations on which the Government bases its attitude in the negotiation of the trusteeship agreement, namely, the fact that Australia will have complete and exclusive power in controlling the terms of the mandate providing for the administration of New Guinea and that the only limitation upon this control is the obligation to carry out the duties imposed by the Charter. The Commonwealth of Australia, as the administering authority, must have full powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction which restricted in any way our right to proover the territory. This was the position under vide for the defence of New Guinea and conthe mandate, and the Government is resolved that it must continue. The Territory of New Guinea, in which so many of our men died in battle against the Japanese, is of such importance to the safety of this country that nothing but'absolute control could be accepted by any Australian government. Moreover, the welfare of the native peoples demands such control. Then he quoted a statement that I had made on the 13th March, 1946, saying that I had made the point very clear when I declared thatIn order to be acceptable to Australia the new agreement must, like the present mandate, designate the Government of Australia as the exclusive administering authority in the ter.ritory. I shall not read the rest of that passage because it is substantially the same as the statement by the Prime Minister that I have quoted so far. The Prime Minister then continuedFurthermore, under the provisions of the United Nations ,Charter, to which this country is a signatoryThis is a very important point, because honourable members can see from this how the trusteeship system, from a defence point of view, represented an enormous advance upon the position under the mandate system. . . the administration may make use of volunteer forces, facilities and assistance from agree with the honourable member for the territory in providing for the defence of New Guinea. We could not do this under the old C mandate terms. The Government, moreover, intends to go farther and to ensure that itB complete administrative authority will be utilized to the full in providing, where necessary, for naval, military and air bases in New fortifications. In substance that was forbidden under the mandate. system provided for an enormous extension from the point of view of the defence of that important territory. fortifications subject to inspection by any foreign power ? altogether. Inspections to ensure that the welfare of the inhabitants are being observed may be conducted from time to time by the Trusteeship Council. The Prime Minister's statement continuedNo agreement would be considered by UB sequently for the safety of Australia. I must emphasize that such comprehensive defence measures were not possible under the old mandate. By bringing the mandated territory under the trusteeship system we are permitted to plan and carry out measures directly relevant to the security of Australia itself. Therefore, the arrangement did not contemplate any weakening of Australia's defences. It was the mandatory terms which limited defence in New Guinea. The mandate prevented the erection of fortifications in the territory and granted a very limited right of defence. However, under the trusteeship system, Australia is entitled to defend the integrity of New Guinea to the same extent as though it were Australia itself. Therefore, the assertion of the honourable member for Parramatta is completely erroneous. He has been misled by some statement. Erom the defence and security point of view, the trusteeship system gives Australia ample protection and ample security. The other question referred to was the welfare of the native peoples. Protection of the natives' rights was binding under the old mandate system. It is also binding under this system. The only other matter that I want to mention is the speech that was made by the honourable member for Indi, who, I Perth( Mr Burke), made a contribution to the debate on a level worthy of a proper statement on foreign affairs. The honourable member was critical of one or two aspects of policy. I think that I can Guinea and for the erection of answer him very shortly.

The United Nations had to be discussed because one of the largest of the proposed votes covers our contribution to the United Nations. I did not pretend to deal with our relationship with every other country. The honourable member for Indi has referred to our relationship with the British Commonwealth. I entirely agree with his remarks. Our relationship with the British Commonwealth goes hand in hand with our friendship for the United States of America and our unwavering support of the United Nations. There is no question of priority; these things dovetail together because it is the policy of the Tjnited States of America to support the United Nations and also the British The honourable member for Parramatta asked which we place first, second or third. I remind him that there may he occasions when a choice has to be made, especially in relation to questions involving peace or war. As the honourable member for ""Warringah has freely admitted, our relationship with the British Commonwealth is very intimate. Honourable members opposite will see the danger of arguments which tend to draw a distinction between the British Government ancl the British people. Britain remains the same to Australians whether Britain be governed by a Conservative or a Labour Government. Our relations with the present Government of the United Kingdom, intimate as they are, are the same as were our relations with the coalition government Churchill. hand. They are not contradictory. agree with the honourable member for Indi that we cannot rely on the United Nations and forget everything else. It is not fair for honourable members opposite to say that I am not carrying out my duties to Australia. I do not think that honourable members opposite really believe that I have not carried out a policy which is in the best interests of Australia. The honourable member for Indi made the astonishing suggestion that if an Australian Minister for External Affairs is ever again elected as President of the Dr. Evatt. he should immediately resign his portfolio. I point out that if he did so, he would no longer lead the Australian delegation. The President of the General Assembly is always selected from the leaders of the delegations from the different countries. As everybody knows, the first President was the Belgium Foreign Minister, M. Spaak. ""When I was at Lake SuccessI had the benefit of the advice of the Australian ambassador to the United States of America, Mr Makin, and of the other Australian delegates. During my term of office as President of the General Assembly they did not cease to put the Australian case, in regard to Nauru and New Guinea; indeed they fought very hard for it. It is not criticism that hurts the Australian case in relation to New Guinea. The Commonwealth. mere fact that the representatives of a few great or minor nations criticize Australia does not hurt us. The General Assembly is a place where there is criticism of one country after another. The fact that we have criticism of the Government in this Parliament does not constitute an argument against the parliamentary system of government. On the contrary, it is an argument in favour of the continuation of that system of government. Let alleged defects be pointed out. If they are proved to be true, they will be corrected. In all our activities in the United Nations we fulfil our duty to the Australian people and to this Parliament. There is no conflict between our obligations to the United Nations and our duty to safeguard the defence of Australia. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Parramatta speak of the led by Mr betrayal of Australia. Not one honorThese things go hand in able member who was in this Parliament I during the war against Japan can accuse this Government of ever having betrayed this country.

434,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [11.32]. Territory Of New Guinea.,"or who may wish to witness our destruction, have the right to go to New Guinea, and examine the territory and the circumstances associated with our mandate. In view of modern methods of espionage, can we not realize that a nation that has that right as a member of the Trusteeship Council could easily find ways and means of obtaining the information it might require with respect to the defences of that territory? Of course, we have, on paper, the right to do the things that I mentioned, but from a practical point of view, the trusteeship is a very weak thing and something that we should not rely upon. The United States of America was fully concerned with that aspect. That country would not agree to place the Carolines, the Marshalls or the Ladrones under a trusteeship similar to the one we now hold in respect of New Guinea. The United States of America insisted upon being granted a strategic trusteeship in relation to the islands I have mentioned, and under that class of trusteeship the representatives of any nation that it does not wish to admit to those territories can be refused admission to them. In that respect the United States of. America has adopted a. realistic attitude. It has not been prein respect of the Department of .External pared to sacrifice its interests on the altar of the United Nations organization. But the Minister for External Affairs is prepared to sacrifice Australia's interests He worked out the cost to his own satisin that way. He did a great disservice to this country when he did not insist that Australia should be given a strategio trusteeship in respect of New Guinea. I believe that the ideal of the United Nations is something that will be realized ultimately, but not immediately or even within a few decades. I believe that many world cataclysms will occur before that ideal can be attained. for step by step. I am aware of the attitude of the Minister on this matter. His attitude has some virtue in that he is aiming to attain that ideal, and towards the administration of the NewI do not wish to discredit him on that score. He has the right ideal, but in striving to attain it he has no right to sacrifice the interests of his own country or those of the people of any other country. In his approach to problems affecting Greece and other members of the Mr Harrison. United Nations, he has sought to interfere on the basis that the interests of the nations concerned must be sacrificed on the altar of the United Nations. This is not an age when he can in that way demand sacrifices for ideals; this is not an age when he as Minister for External Affairs can afford to sacrifice Australia's interests for that ideal. He must take the realistic view, as Eussia, the United States of America and each of the countries that can exercise the veto in the United Nations have done, namely, that they must first protect the interests of their own countries and then do all in their power towards the attainment of the ideal of the United Nations. However, in the immediate future, we must at all costs protect the security of this nation. Although the Minister can be commended for his idealistic approach to this matter he must realize that he must first do for his own country what other countries will first do in their own interests, and that is to ensure the protection and preservation of the Australian people, whom he claims to represent. The committee is discussing the estimates Affairs. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein) said that no honourable member criticized the proposed vote. faction and calculated that it amounted to only a few shillings per capita of the population. I say definitely that both the proposed expenditure and the policy of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) are being discussed. Within the last half-hour the debate has centred on the Minister's action in allowing the New Guinea mandate to go to the Trusteeship Council. We know the reaIt must be worked sons and the ideals that guided him in that matter. But he has let Australia down. Had Australia adopted a similar attitude in the League of Nations in 1919 Guinea mandate, we should not have been able to make of New Guinea a bastion against the Japanese in World War II . with the result that the Japanese would quickly have advanced to the Australian mainland. The Minister, apparently, was persuaded by the-",103,Evatt Barton Attorney Of America And The United Kingdom The
435,Mr White (Balaclava) [11.42],"representatives of other nations that the present trusteeship was a good thing and should be accepted. is natural that influences of that kind should be exerted in the councils of the nations, upon the representatives of individual nations; but he must remember his own loyalties first. Iri spite of his ability position is bad enough when Australian he has forgotten that his first loyalty is to Australia, his second loyalty is to the British Empire and his third loyalty is to the nations of the world as a whole. Let us work gradually towards the attainment of the last-named ideal but, at the same time, do not let us sacrifice our own vital interests. The Tjnited States of America may have supported the idea that the New Guinea mandate should go to the Trusteeship Council, but that country did not follow that course when it sought to protect the Marshalls, Carolines and other islands which it captured from the Japanese. In its own case, the Tjnited States of America insisted upon being granted a strategic trusteeship under which it has the right to prevent inspections of the territories concerned from being made by any other nation. We know that Bussia has refused to agree to any plan for the inspection of resources for the production of the atomic bomb. Russia advocates the complete abolition of the atomic bomb; but it will not agree to any system of inspection. Yet we have agreed to a proposal that the Russians themselves have refused to accept. Our defences in New -Guinea will be open to inspection by the representatives of othsr nations, including Russia, which has shown an extraordinary interest in the administration of our trusteeships. At meetings of the United Nations at Lake Success, the Russian representatives have criticized our administration. The Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) rules the rich and fertile territory of New -Guinea in a manner that is more in keeping with that of a tyrannical colonial governor or dictator than anything else one can imagine. He has been obliged to send his departmental officers post-haste to Lake Success to answer some of the questions that the Russians and others have asked about our administration of the trusteeships. Although we have the privilege of defending that territory, our defences are open to inspection by the representatives of other countries. InciIt dentally, I should also like to be given some information about the kind of defence works that have been undertaken in our territories. But we should not allow this "" snooping "" by Russia. The Communists sabotage our defence programme, but it is worse when the representatives of the power that threatens to uncivilize the world with its barbarous creed is able to inspect our defences. I regard that position as infamous, and the Minister for External Affairs must take the responsibility for it. Whatever his minions may have said, he advised the adoption of that policy. If , unhappily, war should occur, he alone will be responsible for the lack of secrecy in relation to cur defences in the trusteeship territories. I make that statement now because honourable members opposite frequently refer to Australia's unpreparedness for war in 1939. I recall that the Minister for External Territories expressed the opinion in that year that those people who considered that New Guinea should be defended should go there and defend it themselves. I point out that Australia had more squadrons in the field in 1941 than the Royal Australian Air Force possesses to-day. does not the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) answer the question in my name that has been on the notice-paper for so long? honourable member will go to sleep forever. deny the truth of my statement ? ridiculous. that Australia has as many operational squardons to-day as it had in 1941 ? pared to-day than we ever were in the past.

This is the last occasion before the general election that honourable members will have an opportunity to discuss the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs feels that some of the criticisms that have been voiced in this debate have been rather sharp and even barbed, but he must be able to "" take it "". He 'has been away in other fields, where he has received, very properly, a good deal of laudation and praise for the work that he has done in that sphere, but we are entitled to disagree strongly with his policy, and I definitely believe that the right honourable gentleman has made a colossal mistake. The Territory of New Guinea is in close proximity to a continent where one-half of the people of the world live. Expressed in another way, New Guinea is only two days' flight from 1,000,000,000 people, or one-half of the number of people on the face of the globe. Australia is an outpost for the white race, almost adjacent to the teeming millions of Asia, and yet the Minister for External Affairs, who is chasing an international ideal, throws away a valuable and realistic defence outpost. That is a cardinal error. In my opinion, the Department of businessman and industry generally will External Affairs is due for re-organizahave to submit to a severe form of petrol tion.

If , unhappily for Australia, the embassies, legations and consulates gives Labour party is returned to office at the Australia enhanced status among leading forthcoming general election and the nations of the world? In the past, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr United Kingdom provided those services Beazley) is defeated, the right honourable for us, without expense. I note that gentleman may find a position for him Australia has legations in Brazil and in in a legation in Patagonia or Kamschatka, Chile, and that the estimated expenditure with a staff consisting of a first secretary on those establishments this year exceeds the vote last year. I calculate that the I shall do so. If , unexpenditure on those two legations this year will amount to 42,000 dollars. Earlier, the Minister for External Affairs stated that the payment for one of those two legations was made in sterling. How was that possible? I agree that 42,000 dollars is not a large sum, but I contend that the expenditure on those two legations is unnecessary. We buy scarcely a bag of nuts from Brazil, and our contacts with that nation are remote indeed. However, the establishment of a legation in that country may be helping to enhance the prestige of the Minister for External Affairs. I do not desire to attribute dubious motives to him, hut he has most expensive ideas in the international sphere. What justification is there for having legations in Brazil and Chile? They should have been abolished long ago. In respect of the legation in Brazil provision is .made for a Minister, a first secretary and a third secretary. Australia is incurring that expenditure at a time when it is desperately short of dollars. If the Commonwealth could increase its petrol imports by 10 per cent.. the necessity for rationing would he averted. I realize that I am not in order in discussing petrol rationing when the committee is considering the Estimates for the Department of External Affairs, but the Government should seize every opportunity to reduce the expenditure of dollars. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! I ask the honourable member not to refer to petrol rationing at this stage. of dollars,' the primary producer, the",105,Evatt Barton Attorney Of America And The United Kingdom The

Perhaps the Minister will be able to arrange for the honourable meniber to have a second secretary as well. Among the politically slain at the last election was the Minister for Bepatriation, Mr Frost, who was appointed to the office of Trade Commissioner in Ceylon. Probably that gentleman had not previously seen Ceylon on the map. The former member for Calare, Mr ever since he has been a member of Breen, was whisked off to the Middle East, but he returned to Australia shortly afterwards and became secretary to the Minister. for External Territories. The former Minister for the Army, Mr Forde, was appointed High Commissioner to Canada, a highly lucrative post. Minister for the Navy, Mr Makin. was appointed Australian Minister to Washington. That is one method of providing full employment in the political service. But why should the Australian taxpayers have to foot the bill? The Minister for External Affairs, who has this retinue, does not bear the cost. The unfortunate taxpayer meets the expenses, although taxes have been increased by 550 per cent, since 1939 and the national income has not risen proportionately. Previous utterances by the Minister for External Territories show that he has not the interests of our trusteeships at heart. An extract from one of his speeches reads as follows:Having no clear evidence to the contrary Affairs believes that he is in the category and having during the last four years come of Palmerston, Castlereagh, or Joseph to know some of Russia's greatest statesmen, Chamberlain in relation to this matter, I take the view that the Soviet Union's policy is directed towards self-protection and security let him take a leaf out of their book.

Does he desire is to develop its own economy and to intend to abandon all that he ever learned ? improve the welfare of its people. Since that time, Czechoslovakia has come tical League of Nations, at the head of under the domination of Soviet Russia. which stands Great Britain, the country That great republic, with an industrial that fought the battle of Britain nine population, is now under the heel of years ago, and is now in its tenth Soviet tyranny and imperialism.

Does he not realize that if he difficulty. Has the Minister ever told were to devote some of his great energy us about the plight of the Greeks?

Eveni f the Minister has said a word about that matter, he has not told us where his sympathies lie. Does he know that the Turkish army has been mobilized in the Caucasus since 1941, and that a Russian army is facing it across a noman's land? The Minister for External Territories jeers at that statement. When he speaks, he will probably praise Russia, from which he has drawn his inspiration this Parliament. I note a strange change of front among honourable members opposite. They boast that they have a great friendship for Great Britain. The former doing so. If the Minister is not familiar with any of the subjects that I have been discussing, he may like me to refer to Bulolo and certain timber leases. The Australian Government now professes to be a great friend to Great Britain. That is a new love. The explanation is that a prominent member of the United Kingdom Government is Mr Aneurin Bevan, who attacked Mr Winston Churchill bitterly throughout the war. who, like the Minister, is in line with Russia.

Had there been Empire parliamentary conferences at which he and the leading men of Canada, New Zealand, and other countries got together to consider the economic the Netherlands East Indies, possibly we difficulties associated with defence, shipwould not now be so unpopular with the ping, and finance, we should be in a better position to-day. Honourable members know that devaluation is only an emergency measure, a break as it were, which gives us breathing time. Of course, it may have been necessary. within the Empire group should instead have been fostered and improved. Instead of the Minister devoting himself to international issues of a kind alien to our own peoples, and which were outmoded and unsuccessful, he should have applied himself to the subjects that I have mentioned. playing the game in accordance with an admission that he made about a Russian statesman, he is bringing about the chaos that must come the way of any democracy that adopts that line. deplore that the Minister has not seen fit to establish a foreign affairs committee in the Parliament as proposed by me in 1943. The Senate Committee in the Parliament of the United States of America has done great good for that country. If our foreign policy had been framed in accordance with a cross-section of the opinion of the people, and a foreign people appreciate the assiduity of the affairs committes composed of members of tlie various parties of both Houses of the Parliament had been established, it would have been continuous. That was done in Great Britain. Mr Bevin, who succeeded Mr Anthony Eden as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, carried out the traditional British policy. He is opposed to the Russians. He does not support Gromyko and Vishinsky and yet a representative of the Australian Minister at one so devoted his knowledge instead of purof the conferences stated that the Dutch action in the Netherlands East Indies was worse than Hitler's invasion of Holland. That was an infamous thing to say. Honourable members kuow who said it. I do not want to mention his name, because he must have had the authority of his Minister to say that. The Minister does not deny that his representative Mr White. said anything of that kind. If , instead of wandering around the world and sitting in conferences at what should be called Lake Non-Success, while never going to Israel, Java, or Greece, where the real trouble is, to study conditions on the spot, he had tried to elucidate the problem of Dutch. I point out that the Dutch colonized those islands 200 years before our ancestors came to Australia and have been our loyal allies. Trade Yet with the approval of the Government, the policy of the waterside workers in this country is in keeping with Communist policy. That is a terrible state of affairs, because before the war we were doing a trade of millions of pounds yearly both ways with the Netherlands East Indies. Yet, to-day, because a CommuBy nist leader in a trade union becomes a dictator and says that there should be no trade between here and those islands, the Min'ister abdicates and Mr Healy bpcomes the de facto Minister for ExternalI Affairs. This lamentable state of affairs has gone on for years! It remains for this man, who recently served a term of imprisonment for contempt of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, to say when that trade will again operate. Of course, some trading is going on. For instance, petrol, such an inflammable political subject, is coming through. Many Minister, and concede that he must enjoy very good physical health in order to be able to attend so many conferences and go from forum to forum and from banquet to banquet. However, he could have done greater good for his country had he treated the New Guinea issue as did the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in 1919. Had he suing wider international ideas some good would have resulted.

449,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [12.3,"to discuss foreign affairs when the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) has been present. The Minister has had a great deal to say to-night answering the questions that have been posed by various honourable members. I do not propose to deal with any matter other than the trusteeship of New Guinea, because the Minister has endeavoured to defend both himself and his Government for the handing over of New Guinea to a trusteeship council under the Tjnited Nations organization, to which Australia must tender an account of its stewardship every twelve months. The Minister's representative for the last twelve months has had to go to Lake Success to be subjected to an inquisition by various small nations about what Australia has attempted to do for the natives of New Guinea. I do not think that Australia should be under challenge at all by minor foreign powers in respect of its treatment of the natives. Nevertheless each twelve months the Minister for External Territories has to send Mr Halligan or some other officer abroad to answer all sorts of questions, many of which are not intended to assist Australia. Some of them are questions put to our representative publicly by Ukrainian or Soviet representatives in such a light that they are intended to place Australia on the defensive, instead of relating to its administration of the mandate. ter does not mind, but the people of Australia have a right to object. They are not so tough in the skin as is the Minister. The Minister for External Affairs, who sits beside the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) at the table, voluntarily sacrificed the right of Australia to tell these people to go where they wish. I remind honourable members that 6,000 Australians laid down their lives in defence of New Guinea in order to preserve it as Australian territory, and as an outpost for our protection. They believed that New Guinea was essential to our defence. The Minister for External Territories has said that the present arrangement about New Guinea has many advantages over the old mandate system. For instance, we have the right to fortif y New Guinea, and that is true. It iB also true that the mandate system lapsed when the League of Nations lapsed in 1939, and there was no obligation upon Australia, which held New Guinea by right of conquest, to surrender it to any outside tribunal. New Guinea is more important to the defence of Australia than are the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the defence of the United States of America. Honourable members opposite may smirk, but few of them have taken any interest in New Guinea. The Minister for External Affairs said to-night that there was not very much in the trusteeship which the United States of America exercised over the former Japanese territories in the Pacific. I have here a book entitled Trusteeship in the Pacific with which the Minister for External Affairs is probably familiar. It contains contributions by many notable Australians who are qualified to write on the subject. The Minister for External Affairs may laugh, but it was no laughing matter to give away a territory that cost so much to win. tradicted that this Parliament had no opportunity to decide the matter until it was an accomplished fact. The matter was not brought before the Parliament until the pass was sold. records of the Parliament will show. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) brought a bill dealing with the subject before the Parliament, but that was after the Government had agreed to hand New Guinea over to the control of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. That was done in 1946, and the bill was not brought in until two years later. The Minister for External Territories, who now unfortunately administers New Guinea, ought to know the facts. Australia should have insisted upon a strategic trusteeship of New Guinea, as the United States of America did for the Marshall and Caroline Islands. The records show that Australia and Great Britain, among other countries, tried to persuade the United",108,Evatt Barton Attorney Of America And The United Kingdom The

455,Mr Anthony,"It is true, as the States of America not to insist on a strategic trusteeship. I quote the following paragraph from the book, Trusteeship in the Pacific:The United States draft waa approved unanimously practically unaltered. Here again the main reason appeal's to have been the American threat to withdraw the area from trusteeship and to annex it on the basis of military conquest, if fundamental changes were States of America can also exclude the insisted upon. The United States of America was so insistent upon a strategic trusteeship that it was prepared to smash the whole trusteeship system rather than submit the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the control of the Trusteeship Council. I wish to point out the difference between the trusteeship that Australia has accepted over New Guinea and the strategic trusteeship which the United States of America has obtained over the Caroline and Marshall Islands, which are much less necessary to its defence than is New Guinea to ours. The United States of America has not to make a report each year to the Trusteeship Council on its administration of the islands, as we are required to do in respect of New Guinea. The Trusteeship Council consists of representatives of Iran, the Philippines, United States of America, Mexico and some other countries. Membership changes from year to year, but each year it is necessary for the Minister for External Territories to send an officer abroad to report upon our administration to the representatives of Iran or Mexico, or some other country. opportunity is given to some country-and from visiting New Guinea? there is usually some country that wants to put Australia in the wrong-to misrepresent the administration of the them. trusteeship. On the other hand, the United States of America is not required to been fortified, as it should have beenpresent any document at all to the and which, incidentally, the Minister for Trusteeship Council of the United External Affairs says the Government Nations, but only to report to the could do under its mandate-doe s not the Security Council.

The only honourable member opposite who is qualified to speak on the matter is the Minister himself, who is, of course, very well qualified. does not know anything about the matter. realize that what has been done is detrimental to the interests of Australia, and I have studied the situation sufficiently to convince myself that it is in the interests of Australia that these facts should be made public.

The matters mentioned by the honourable member concerning trusteeship were mentioned by bim in the speech that he delivered before the dinner adjournment. Isi t permissible for an honourable member to make an infinite number of speeches covering the same matter? The TEMPOBABY CHAIBM AN ( Mr Lazzarini) -The Standing Orders provide that the Chair may call to order an honourable member who repeats himself unduly in the course of a single speech. The honourable member has not repeated himself unduly in the course of his present speech. when I spoke before the suspension of the sitting I was not in possession of the eviI haye no douht dence which I now have to enable me to contradict the Minister's statement in respect of strategic trusteeships. Had the Minister desired, and had he displayed a little less enthusiasm for the United Nations, and a little more enthusiasm for his own country, he could have insisted on obtaining ship to those granted to the United States of America. I have endeavoured to point out that Australia could have held New Guinea as an integral part of the territory of this nation, and it could have told the rest it, but because of the type of trusteeship agreement into which the Government has entered, we are committed for all time to an unsatisfactory arrangement. The Parliament was not consulted until after the trusteeship agreement had been made with the United Nations. In spite of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs shakes his head, he was not here to state the case when the Prime Minister, acting on his behalf, placed the matter before the House. Members of the Parliament have had very few opportunities in this chamber to discuss foreign affairs in the presence of the Minister, who, had he been here could have corrected us if we had been wrong, or could have supplied information that was lacking. In this matter there is no douht whatever about the attitude of the Opposition. We believe that New Guinea was sacrificed. We believe that something was given away to the Trusteeship Council for which 6,000 Australians had laid down their lives. We believe that no good can come of the trusteeship agreement; that no advantage will be reaped from it ; and that what was done by the Minister for External Affairs was done in pursuit of his own personal aims and ambitions, and that it was to the detriment of Australia.

No. The agreement made with the United States Export Company assists Australian importers to obtain from that company 40 per cent, of their overall requirements. This quantity, together with the amount of suitable British tinplate available, does not exceed Australia's basic requirements. 3 and 4.

Mr Foot had no authority to enter into any agreement or commitments on behalf of the Government.
