A policy which burden of having to carry large bodies ofcountry, the men, even when periods of leave were short, would be able to spend their leave at home and help in their parents' industry. That is an aspect .which should be examined in a period when the rural labour problem is becoming acute. A third aspect is that, under the-present training system, the big cities benefit to the detriment of the small towns from the expenditure of .the trainees' money when short leave is taken, because the period of leave is too short to enable the troops to return to their home towns. WhatI have said about militia training applies also to the Air Force, because aerodromes have boen situated near larger centres of population, instead of being distributed equitably throughout the Commonwealth. I appeal to the Government to institute a moratorium for the primary producers who, through no fault of their own, have receivedia considerably-diminished income since the war began and now find' themselves in straitened financial circumstances. Having acquired the whole of the essential primary products of Australia, the Commonwealth Government should take steps forthwith to protect the growers by a moratorium. I agree that members of the Australian Imperial Force are entitled to the protection of a moratorium, but I submit that the primary producers should not be overlooked in this connection. regret that a few days ago I had to convey to primary producers in -my electorate the Government'3 intimation that my request for a moratorium for them had been disallowed The following extract from a letter which I have received from a 'primary producer"" at Moree sets out the position clearly:Unless something' is done in this direction, is desperate. Only a few days ago a and done pretty quickiy, too, a lot of farmers and graziers will be forced off their holdings. resident in a country district was called Tlie sons of many, of these men are away fighting, and are looking forward to returning to their father's properties, and in .many eases some day becoming the owner. Unless legislation is brought in to protect these holdings, and in many cases keep the interest T at reasonable rates. I am afraid many soldier sons w ill be sorely disappointed .upon their return in finding their parents have been forced off. The Government has taken over the control of vafiqus primary products-wool, wheat; meat, butter and fruit-and Mr Scully. obligation rests on it to protect the producers of these commodities without referring the matter to the States. As was stated by our leader, the Opposition gives general approval to the rationing, of petrol with a view to maintaining stocks of liquid fuel in order to meet an emergency. Since the war began, the Opposition has urged the provision of additional storage for petrol, because it has realized that petrol is the lifeblood of .the. nation's transport, and is, therefore, an essential commodity. We knew 'that the rationing of petrol was inevitable sooner or later. The Government sh&uld have exercised more foresight, and provided for the storage of larger quantities of liquid fuel in safe localities. Had that been done early in the war, the drastic rationing of petrol which has now been decided on would not have been necessary, and instead of a wholesale dislocation of industry, there would have been in this country a reserve of tens of millions of gallons of petrol, and trade and commerce could have been carried' on with less interruption than now appears inevitable. In fixing the quantity of petrol which motorists are allowed to use, no consideration appears to have been given to the special claims of residents in country districts. People who reside in cities and large towns are able to get from place to place by means of It was with deep trains, buses, and trains; but many persons who live in country districts have not been allowed enough petrol to enable them to make one trip a month to the railhead. It is not uncommon for a motorist in the country to live 40., 50, or even 100 miles, from the nearest railway station. In the event of sickness or other emergency, the position of these people case came under my notice in whicha upon to take his child 50 miles to the nearest doctor. The child was seriously ill, but the father had to beg petrol from a neighbour before he could undertake the -journey. I recently had evidence that two., settlers living-4 miles and 90 miles respectively from the nearest railway station had been granted the same allowance. The allowance of petrol tocountry motorists should be more liberal. an The form to be filled in by an applicant for .liquid fuel sliould set out the distance of his residence from the nearest town. These anomalies should be rectified without delay. Since petrol has been rationed, tbe proprietors of country filling stations have been placed in a serious position. They have to pay cash for all the petrol they obtain, with the result that most of them now carry only about one-third or one-quarter of their usual supplies. I suggest that the Government make arrangements with the major oil' companies to supply these filling stations, with all of the petrol that they can store, and that it should guarantee payment to tlie suppliers. That would not mean any greater consumption of petrol; hut as it would increase the storage of this essential fuel in widely-distributed places, it would be a distinct advantage to the nation in the event of an emergency. Several instances have come before my notice recently of the deregistering of filling stations by the Liquid Fuel Control Board in New South Wales. Some of these stations,which have supplied petrol to the public for ten or fifteen years, have changed hands, and the new proprietors have been refused licences. I ask the Minister to issue instructions that every filling station in Australia shall be licensed and allowed to store.petrol to its full capacity. As1 have said, that would not increase the consumption' of this commodity. The licensing of twenty filling stations in a town would not mean any greater consumption of petrol than if only one station were licensed. I trust that my representations will be given careful consideration by the Government. [11.42] -The Government is asking Parliament for £15,141,000 in order to carry on the services of the country for the first two months of the financial year 1941-42. Of that amount, £5,522,930 is earmarked for defence expenditure. That seems an extraordinary state of affairs in view of the fact that approximately £51,000,000 of the expenditure authorized for the current financial year has not been .expended. That-lag calls for. an explanation by the Government. The position-is so serious as .to call forimmediate attention. The trouble is' that although we are supposed to have coordination in relation to all defence matters, that co-ordination exists only in name. I hope that the War. Expenditure Committee which the government proposes to appoint will investigate this lack of co-ordination.. .L. (-understand that its function will be to deal witb such matters and to check -up ori defence ;1 expenditure generally'.""' If * it does no more than that it will, do a"" ""very good 1 job. There is also the problem of the centralization of defence activities. I , and other honourable members from Queensland, have been complaining for the last twelve months about the Government's lack of consideration for that State in the allocation of defence works. During the last four or five months the Government has endeavoured to give to Queensland a greater share of defence expenditure than was hitherto allotted to it, and amunition factory is being built in Brisbane. Unfortunately, that factory will not commence production for at least three months. However, as I and a number of my colleagues have said, there is ample scope for more defence work to ba carried out in Brisbane, because there are many factories and engineering workshops in the city which are capable of producing munitions and other war-time necessities. The small volume of defence work that is being done in Brisbane is in the hands of one contractor. He has sub-let many contracts to small engineering shops which,' if they obtained the contracts direct, could enlarge their staffs and modernize their equipment in order to handle a greater volume of work. It has been said that there are not sufficient skilled tradesmen in Queensland to undertake big defence contracts. That is not coi> rect. As the result of the bulk of defence contracts being allocated to Victoria and New South Wales, large numbers of skilkd. artisans have left Queensland for .those -States, and also South Australia^ I have been informed that approximately .5,000 Queensland workmen have accepted munition jobs in other States due to the fact that Queensland has not been given a fair share of defence expenditui-e. I am aware that the Government is endeavouring -to train men for technical jobs in .Queensland as in other States. This work is being, carried out at the",20,Fadden

I was very pleased to jsea the efficient way in which 1 the men were doing their, work. But in carrying out this training work, with the co-operation of the State Government, the Coniiuonwealth is acting detrimentally to the apprenticeship training system for Queen'sla-nd hoys-. The workshopthat is being used for the training of defence workers was used for many years for the training of apprentices, which has been considerably retarded'. Many apprentices are not able to continue their training satisfactorily hecause of the lack of facilities. surprised to notice that most of the machines being used in the . workshop were 25 years old. Only twomachines out of a la'rge numberwere anything like new. enough for -apprentices training for -ordinary civil occupations, but only the most up-to-date equipment should be used to instruct men for defence trades. The State Government, inco-operation with the Commonwealth' Government, has decided to build a new workshop, which is being erectedclose to the existing building. When I inquired whether new machines would be installed there, I was surprised to learn that the 25-year-old machines were to be transferred from the old workshops. That should not be done. The State Government was prepared to assist in providing proper equipment for the new workshop, but the Commonwealth Government refused to make funds available for the purpose. In doing so it was bound by a very short-sighted j>o!icy. If men are to be trained for highly-skilled work in munition factories, they should be instructed in the use of the most modern machinery that it is possible to procure. The responsibility attaches to the Commonwealth, because the manufacture of munitions is a Commonwealth undertaking. I have heard many complaints that, when the men are trained for munition work, the Commonwealth Government will not find employment for them in factories and annexes. I have here a letter from a resident in my electorate, who states that although he passed the necessary trade tests and paid for his own training in engineering, fitting and ilr.

There they could not even tell me when I would be called on. 1 consider that the timeand money spent on training myself for this job_ is .absolutely wasted.

Some of them, like myself; would not accept if called on now. Many young men whom I know have They might: have been good offered their services in various' capacities asmunition! Avorksbut their offers have not been accepted. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to this important matter. I believe that there are plenty of skilled, and semiskilled tradesmen in Queensland, and if that State is given more of the defence work to which it is justly entitled, our war. effort will proceed more efficiently and quickly than it is doing at present. I refer now to the Commonwealth Government's treatment of the widows of members of the Australian Imperial Force who have been accidentally killed. Only a few weeks ago in this HouseI drew the attention of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to a case which had come to my notice, but so far the right honourable gentleman has not given a reply to my representations. I have received many complaints from individual residents of Brisbane, and from returned soldier organizations, complaining of the Government's attitude towards these unfortunate women. Tlie case that I have in mind is that of Gunner W. John Simmonds, No. QX9651. He enlisted in the Australian. Imperial Force with the approval of his wife, who was prepared for him to go overseas in the service of the nation. 'Unfortunately, after he had been vaccinated he became very sick and was given three or four days' sick leave. During that period he was compelled to visit Brisbane, and -while he was there he was-knocked down . by a motor car. He died on the following day. His widow made representations to -the Repatriation Department at the suggestion of a numbe* cf returned soldier organizations which became very interested in the case. Her application to the Repatriation. .Department for a pension was refused on the ground that her husband's death did not takeplace whilst he was engaged on military duty. This unfortunate woman is now left .to provide for herself and her son, aged ten years, as best she can. When I last heard of her she was living on government rations. It is scandalous for the department to claim that the soldier was not engaged on military duty'at the time of his death. The Government has made no preparation to meet such cases. As I pointed out when I first brought this matter before the Prime Ministersuch cases are fortunately very few. Probably there have not been more .than two or three in Queensland'since the outbreak of the war. Nevertheless^-the Government should . either . amendthe Repatriation Act to provide for the payment of pensionsor make a compassionate-allowance to the dependants of soldiers killed in circumstances such -as I have outlined. The cost .to the Commonwealth would be-very small. I feel sure that the people generally would favour the granting of a pension to the dependants of these men. ' I propose now to direct the attention of the Government to the' differential treating the budget debate, however, we were ment meted out to service pensioners as told that service pensioners and invalid compared with invalid and old-age penand old-age pensioners would be treated sioners.. The Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) alike. he presented last year, provision was made for an increase of the rate of invalid,'oldthat the Treasurer will give earnest conage and service pensions of Is. a week, sideration to this matter. and the Invalid-and .Old-age Pensions Act' Honourable members on this side of the was amended to provide for automatic -House have repeatedly complained of adjustments of the pension rate in accordthe methods adopted by the Government ance with-the rise and fall of the cost of to finance our war effort. The Governliving. When the amending bill was ment claims -that it is following orthodox before the House, I asked whether it was methods of finance; but we believe that, proposed to adjust the rate of service instead of imposing higher taxes upon pensions in the same way, and I was in the people the credit resources of the formed that that was the intention of the nation should be utilized to a greater Government. Service pensioners should degree. The .Government claims that be placed in exactly -the same position as already our credit resources have been invalid and old-age pensioners because drawn on to the limit of safety. I have before a returned soldier can qualify for a service pension, he must be physically unfit and unemployable. The intention of the Government in granting service pensions was to provide for 'those burntout soldiers who, for some reason or other, were not entitled to a war pension, and who had not yet reached tbe qualifying age for an old-age pension. We find now, .however, that, although an automatic .increase has heen made in respect of invalid and-old-age pensions as the result of the increased cost of living, no similar advance has been made in the rate of service pensions. The reason given by the Pensions Department is that service pensioners are in an altogether different category from invalid and old-age pensioners in that service pensions are paid not only to the soldier but also to his wife. That is true, but I point out to the Treasurer that there are thousands of. service pensioners who are either bachelors or widowers. In my .electorate tliere isa war veterans' home which cares for a largenumber of former .members of the first Australian Imperial Force AH of the inmates are either bachelors or widowers. .They claim that, as they have no dependants, their position-is no different from that of an invalid or old-age pensioner.

Again, asked if tliat amount was available for productive purposes in time of peace, he answered in the affirmative.

Those proposals are certainly of wide significance and I believe that if they are implemented they will give to the country the lead that it desires. A t present the proposals are only words That, of course, is unavoidable for the simple rea-. son that the plans have to be stated in detail, organization has to be provided, and the necessary instructions issued, before we m a y look for results. country desires, and I believe that the Government w ill take, quick action to ensure a speedy implementation of the Prime Minister's proposals. The honourable member for Boothby remarked that the country would welcome the approval given to these proposals by the Leader of the Opposition ( MrC u r t in ) . I regret to say that I consider that the honourable gentleman's approval was somewhat cold and unenthusiastic. The country would have been better pleased had his utterance been more full-blooded and robust than it was. What we need to-day is a strong and resolute policy and only such a policy as that will meet the wishes of the entire population. I was also -disappointed, and -felt some concern, in consequence of two impressions made upon me by the speech of the 'Leader of the Opposition. It appeared to me that he viewed the position in the Middle-East with a good deal-of. un-. necessary pessimismWe all are-aware, that the position there is not as .satisfactory as it might be, but the Leader of the. Opposition, and indeed some -other honourable gentlemen who have discussed the subject, have seemed to me when discussing the . Middle East to be looking for a kind of back doorway of escape. If that be the case they are, in my opinion, quite wrong. I may be doing those honourable gentlemen an injustice, but that is nevertheless the effect that tlieir utterances have had upon me. I beUcve that many people in Australia who have read the reports of their speeches have felt similarly. Honourable-members of this House, who have served in the Army abroad,, some in the f r o n t line, w ill know that a soldier in the actual battle area who has his mind turned to a means of escape, is not of first-class value as a fighter. That .statement may be applied with equal aptnessto the leaders of political parties and of political thought in this country. The pessimistic outlook of certain of these honourable gentlemen concerning the situation abroad is not in conformity with the needs of the present situation. The Leader of the Opposition also spoke of the Middle East and Singapore as the outer bastions of Australia's defence. I The suggest that they are much more than that. In my view they are part of the main line of our defence. The citadel of Australia's defence is not inside of this country, as many people seem to think, but it is in the British Isles. As long as GreatB rit a in stands, and the British Navy controls the seas, I do not think that we in Australia have great cause for anxiety. There has been some suggestion, both inside of this House and out of it,"" of a possible withdrawal of our troops from abroad. The mere idea of such a thing seems to m_e to suggest the isolationist outlook, and the snail withdrawing into its shell. The history of this war has taught us that the isolationist policy has been disastrous in every country where it has been supported. . cating that policy in this Parliament? orable members have given me the' impression, that they favour it. If they do not, ' I am sorry, that I have'gained, a wrong impression. The truth is that the defence of Australia is bound up with, and is integral to, the defence of the Empire. We should keep that thought continually in our minds when we are reviewing the overseas situation. The second impression that I obtained from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was that he considered that the strengthening of our forces overseas was likely to be detrimental to our production of the essential materials of war in Australia.

We should simply consider whether conscription is necessary to our survival. That, point, has been argued, at considerable length. With the exception of Canada and South Africa every country Avhich is UOAV at war, or threatened by war, has introduced conscription, be it a dictatorship . or democratic country, and .regardless, of. whether it is ruled by a Communist,Labour or Conservative government. Each of those countries has come .to the. conclusion that conscription is .necessary, to its defence. We have had. universal training for some time, and, .so far as I am aware, no objection has been raised to that system either in this House .or outside. I-am unable to:discern AAhetherT the objection to conscription' in ; this country is .mainly .an objection to the compulsion of men to serve outside of Australia, or Avhefher it is purely an objection to the principle of conscription. We have unanimously agreed to. the principle of universal training, but some object to that principle in so far as service overseas is concerned. Surely, the real issue in this matter is whether the defence of this country can best.be ensured by fighting inside or outside of Australia. As a soldier I maintain that, in the present circumstances, our defence can be carried out much better abroad than inside of Australia. I say further that should Ave suffer reverses which compel us to withdraw our forces within our own country, our position will be desperate indeed. 1 believe that there is no one in-this country to-day who is not filled Avith anxiety as to the future. We go about our daily lives cheerfully, because cheerfulness is part of our make-up as a nation. Speaking for myself, however, I cannot say that I go about daily with the same light heart-edness and individualistic outlook on life as I did before the war came upon us. I do not mean that I am in any Avay down-hearted. I believe that if , -as a nation, Ave remain' really true to our traditions we shall win this struggle. History shows that'along with the many faults.of our race, we haA'e inherited the virtue of common sense, which not only enables us to see the essentials of the dangers which confront us, but also tells us how to pull together in combating those dangers. However, I sometimes wonder Avhether that A-irtue is not beginning to A\ ear a, bit thin. It is true that' : we. are completely united in pur determination to carry on this struggle and to see it through. However, Avhen it comes to putting our purpose into action, there becomes evident in not only this House but also in the country, very definite 6igii3 of dissension. We haA'e had discussions on the subject of a national go-' vernment. I shall not enlarge upon that point, because I"" know'of. nothing that I can say, or do, that Avould persuade honourable members opposite to change their views on-, that matter,Avhich, of course, is a matter, entirely for themselves to decide However, I feel, that a national government is not a cause, but an effect of national unity. . If this country as a whole' Avere as united as Impersonally, Avould like' to see it, a national gOA ernr ment would come as a matter of course. When I say united,. I do not mean being united in purpose, alone, but also in the manner in which that purpose is to be achieved. I remember that AvhenI was a young soldier and joined my first battery of artillery I met an officer of ""wide experience and much wisdom. He said to me: "" Many tasks you.Avill have to face in life.' Remember this, that out of the hundred ways it is possible to achieve success in a task there are at least 75 ways of doing it, provided you put into your effort all your forces and determination."" It seems to me that Avhat Ave require these days is to find some common denominator of action which Avill satisfy the big majority of our people.

93,Mr Ryan,"The Avorld to-day iswhicli have been disunited, and. this country, and every other country which values its independence and intends to keep it, can very well draw alesson from what is happening elsewhere. I had the advantage of travelling through Erance in 1939, just before the outbreak of the present war, and I have also had the further advantage of living in that part of the world for a considerable portion of my life. I have a large number of friends and acquaintances in France. I travelled through France on my return to Australia, partly to visit my friends, and partly to find out for myself just what the situation was in that country, and what was the feeling of its people after the signing of the Munich pact. My acquaintances include a representative cross-section of the community, ranging from politicians to business people and other citizens, and during my stay of three weeks I had 1 long conversations with various sections of the people. When I left FranceI was appalled at the situation as I saw it. I felt then-and my fears were soon confirmed-that France was not in a position to stand up to the powerful thrust by Germany which appeared likely to develop. strong Left wing, composed largely' of Oommuniste, and supported by what may be termed the extreme radicals of the Labour These people looked almost exclusively to Moscow for directions. At the other extreme was the Right wing, a very strong force, which looked .to Berlin. The Right wing adherents believed that France was breaking up under the influence of Moscow, .and they thought that salvation could be brought about only by the adoption of some form of Fascist regime such as that which they believed had brought about many beneficial results in Germany. Between those two extreme groups were' innumerable parties and smaller groups, all of which had their own views as to what was the best method to handle the situation, and to achieve the aims for which they were striving. In the welter of opinions I could see no definite unity of purpose, and no possibility of unity of action in the future. As I have said, I left that country completely appalled at the prospect which Mr Ryan. confronted it. I do not suggest that there is a basis of comparison between France at that time' and Australia at the present juncture^ but I docontend that there are elements in our national life which in some ways are very disturbing to any thinking man. It is useless to suggest that there is any unity of purpose as to the way in which the affairs of this country should be conducted at present.. We have all sorts of ideas as to what should and what should not be done, hut there are wide differences of opinion between primary producers, industrialists, Labour party adherents, and the hundred and one other small interests in this country. Our endeavour should be to bring about harmony between those sections so that each can devote its wholehearted attention to the winning of the and generals, war, which is the main job before the country at present. There are two, or possibly three,.major divergencies of opinion. I have already referred to one of them, namely, conscription. The second is the conflict between capital and labour. I listened yesterday with great interest to the honourable member for Oorio( Mr Dedman) when he was speaking of the way in There was a very which this country should carry on the war. If my recollection be right, he said tliat we could not achieve a full war effort under a capitalist system, and he movement. suggested ways and means, to alterthat system. He advocated amongst other things the taking over, by the Government from private individuals the control of all rents, profits and interest charges. I am not here to defend the capitalist system. That is something which may be argued interminably, but this is not the time to debate it. Under that system, whatever one may say,, this country has achieved not only .considerable success, but also avery large degree of prosperity. wars within the space of a few years. considerable prosperity after the last war, and the fact remains that we have enjoyed a measure of prosperity in this country which compares more than favourably with that of any otlier country under socialism or under any other form of government.",28,Fadden

The time is not opportune for an attempt to change the fundamentals of our present system, because such an effort would inevitably cause serious dislocation and disunity, which would impede our war effort. So far as I know, no country has yet given an impressive demonstration of whatever merits there may be in the system advocated by some honourable members opposite. We have read a great deal about socialism and many people talk' 1 of it, but when it comes to practical politics, its advantage's have yet to be proA ed. Many of those who advocate 7 socialism may be termed doctrinaires, ""who do not know exactly what is involved in the system which they are championing, or what it would' lead to if afc were put into practice. At present, we should avoid introducing controversial issuesinto the affairs of this country, beiuhis own country before showing so cause such action can result only in disruption.. I ' conclude by suggesting that we should try to find some common denominator uponwhich the whole country could base its war effort. If we introduce controversial matters, we shall only weaken the nation-. I suggest also that the proposal's put forward by the Prime Minister last week provide a very good basis on which to maintain and develop Australia's war effort. rise to offer some criticism of the Government'spolicy. It would of course be strange for me not to find one or twothings to complain of with regard to the control of tlie situation which at present confronts us. I join issue with the honourable member for Corio( Mr Dedman) and say to the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) that I also believe that, unless fundamental changes are made inour social structure, it will, be impossible for the capitalist nationsalone and unaided to succeed in this war.. The honourable member for Flinderssaid 1 that any change of the present system would divide the. people and', consequently, impede our war effort. I believe, however, that amy division that might: take place as a result of the introduction of a new order in our national life would not be amongst the people as such, but amongst the privileged few in the community who batten on the labour of others, and who, either collectively or individually, are not doing anything even, now to improve our war effort. this country would lose their enthusiasm for the war if they thought that their privileges and profits were to be taken from them. Why is it that the capitalists who run this country have to talk of compelling men to fight? It is not because the' people lack patriotism,, but because they are disgusted and dissatisfied with the way in which the present Government is conducting the affairs of this* country. quired in Russia? honourable member for Flinders paid a little attention to what is happening, much interest in what is happening in other countries. If the honourable member will bring himself back to Australia, which, after all, is what vitally concerns us at the moment, be will find ample evidence of why the people are not enthusiastically supporting the policy of this Government, and why the Government has to talk of compelling men to enter the various defence services.

Is the Government afraid to publish them? The personnel of the committee .included representatives of the government parties, yet, whenever members of this House endeavour to elicit information regarding the proposals submitted to the Government by the committee, they ""are met with ablank refusal tp disclose the nature of any of its recommendations. It now transpires that the Government is beginning to train women to undertake 'certain work in which men are at present employed. Whenasked a question with regard to this important matter, the Postmaster-General( Mr Collins) said that this was a matter of government policy. The Government will not .make known why women are being trained to-drive postal wagons,-but we can easily answer .the question for ourselves. The only possible conclusion to be reached is that the Government is training an army of women to take the place of men. The .employment of a woman as the driver of a postal van would displace a man who is probably not qualified to undertake other work. Could he be immediately absorbed in a munition factory? He would not be a skilled technician. I have no doubt, that the object of the Government is not to find work for such men in munition factories or similar avenues of employment, but, when a large body of women is available, reports will be called for from the heads of government departments as to the names of men under 40 years of age whose services can be dispensed with Then in will go the women and out will go the men. When the men ask for other employment they will be ilr. Ward. toldthat there is no need for them to be out of work; as a job is waiting for them at-the nearest recruiting depot. That is a dishonest way to bring about con.scription, but the Government is prepared to compel men to offer their servicesby starving' them into it. Men who might be inclined to enlist perly treated after the war. What happened to the men who served in the last war? When we visit mental asylums and other institutions we see many old solWhat diers who served in the last war who are now friendless and forgotten by the Government. We see men who receive no pension and have been cast aside as unwanted. Many young men are wondering .whether those who return from this war will be treated differently from those who served in the last war. How can they expect from the present Government any other treatment, than that received by many of those who returned from the last war? The honourable ""member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) recently stated that if -this war .lasts three years the national debt .will be increasedby at least £750,000,000. That means that the national debt will amount to over £2,000,000,000-when the war ends, and Australia will have fewer people than at present to bear the burden. The population was practically at a standstill when the war commenced, and, allowing for war losses, a reduced population will be -called upon to shoulder increased responsibilities. How are we to meet these responsibilities? Is the Prime Minister prepared to say that when the war is over tlie claims of the returned soldiers and their dependants, and of munition workers and other workers throughout the country shall have priority over the bondholders who merely lent their money to the Government at a good rate of interest? He will not reply to that query now. He will say that it does not require an answer, that we should wait until the war is over. If this Government is still. in control when the war is over, the workers will get a new order, but it will not he the order that they are expecting. While the Prime Minister was abroad, he stated that it would be very difficult to return to our old standards of living. "" But what does that matter,"" he said, "" so long as we secure victory "". It will not matter much to him, because he could suffer a substantial reduction of his standard of living without suffering, but it will be sad news to the great bulk of the people, many of whom suffered severely during tbe depression and since, to learn that when they have secured victory the standard of living which they now have will be even further reduced. Does that mean that old-age and invalid pensions will be reduced? Does it mean that the men who will be unable to find work after the war will receive an even smaller dole than is now prescribed? In face of these inquiries the Government regains silent. It says,. ""Let us first of all win the war. Let us co-operate in an all-in effort."" I say to the Government that it should lay its cards on the table. It should tell us what are its plans and proposals. It should let us know how much the private banks have contributc-d towards the war effort in loans without interest or by way of gift. It should let us know what the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, and those interests which support it, have contributed by way of gift or interest-free loans. Mr 'FALSTEIN' -It should also let us know the names of those who, it is stated, House that compulsory trainees are being are giving their services to the Government in an honorary capacity. gentlemen have been .provided with a wonderful opportunity to serve their own interests while acting as the advisers of the Government. We have been told that there is a shortage of man-power. If that is so, will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General explain why a survey of the records of employees during and prior to the commencement of their period of service has been made in his department, and those against whom anything can be found have been dismissed? In one case an officer had committed a civil . offence seventeen years ago. Later, he secured a position in the Postal Department, married, and now has a young family. He is a returned soldier of the last war, .and his service in the department has been eminently satisfactory. Yet the department, after going through his record, has said to him, "" Y o u have a criminal record, and out you go."" Many men have been discharged in similar circumstances. Why are the departments doing these things ? Because they want to force men out of employment and into the fighting services. member supply me with the names of these men ? to what some of the private employers are doing. In the Sydney Sun, of the 5th May, the following appeared:Employers in Grafton and. South Grafton will be asked by the local recruiting committee to replace all employees eligible for army service by older men or by women, unless the younger .men can show good reason for not enlisting in the defence forces. We are getting fo the stage where weak-, minded individuals are sending white feathers to eligible men through the post, and it is evident that a deliberate attempt is being made to force men into the fighting services. This should be a matter for individual decision. ""No outsider can understand a mam's private circumstances, and no one but himself is in a position to judge whether he should serve or not. I have heard it stated in this badgered in an attempt to make them join the Australian Imperial Force. Recently, I had brought before me the case of a young manwith a widowed mother dependent on him. No other member of the family is at home; there are just two of them. He desired to apply for exemption from training. I told him to go to the area officer and ask for an exemption -form, and at the same time. I dropped a note to the area officer. When the young man reported to pick up the form lie was asked why he had approached a. member of Parliament. The young fellow said that I was the member for his district, that he wanted advice and sought it from me. Then this military upstart said, "" You had no right to go near a member of: Parliament. What has it got to do with him?"" 'The man replied, "" I will go back and tell him what you have said"". The officer said,.""Do not do anything of the kind.

All that,however, is merely subterfuge. -Even when those who have lost their jobs approach the Government for relief none is forthcoming. I took one case up with -the authorities, and after it had been dragging on for some months, I received the following reply:I desire to inform you that this matter has been investigated, and on the advice of the Daputy Crown Solicitor it is not proposed to take tiny further action. This was the care of a boy who had been in employment before he was sent into camp, but whose employer refused to give him back his job after he came out. In another case an employer who.refused to' re-employ a trainee was fined £15, and ordered to pay £4 Is. costs. It was also ordered that £10 of the fine should be paid to the trainee. That is small compensation to a man for losing his employment. The penalty in such cases should be greater. We hear a great deal from. Government supporters about the efficiency of the war departments. Several nights ago I heard an ..appeal over the radio to motorists and others to hand over to the Department of Supply 200,000 oil drums for the storage of. petrol. The appeal was also published in the newspapers, and appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 23rd M a y ' in this for m : .

[Leave to continue given.] No sane parliamentarian' having the' welfare of -the ""country at heart can continueto support the present Government with its sorry record.' It has succeeded in strangling tlie Commonwealth Bankb y -placing all sorts of restrictions upon .its activities. ( -The Treasurer has statedthat the Government is utilizing to the f u l l the national credit resources of the country, and several days ago I-asked h i m how he could reconcile that statement. with tbe fact that the balance-sheet issued by the Commonwealth Bank on the 31st December last year .showed that Commonwealth securities held Iby the bank were £21,000,000 less than at the corresponding timethe previous year. The Treasurer did the best he could in the circumstances in extricating himself fro m a difficult situation. He did not reply to the question; he merely got around it in the fashion employed by many Ministers. A government of the same political colour as this one leased the Cockatoo Island dock to a. private company. A t that time the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) was the Ministeri n charge. When he was' asked why the Government was only leasing the dock in stead of selling it , he said that, should an international crisis arise, the Government would be able .to resume control of the dock. To-day it is still being operated by private enterprise, largely under the system known as "" cost-plus "". A t that dockyard there are trade unionists who -are anxious to give some return to the country for the money being expended, but they, although skilled men, are: walkt ing about the shops sweeping up, which is work that-should-be done by first-year apprentices. The company, however, is not concerned, over mounting costs, bereturn, and this applies to every other private firm whicli is working for the Government on. the same basis. Tbe Government proposes, not to take-vigorous aciion to remedy this evil, but to appoint a committee. So many committees are now in existence that, as tbe honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) remarked, honourable members have difficulty in remembering their functions. ""What authority will be vested in the new committee to inquire into wartime profits, I do not know'. Buti f it ever requests the head office of the BrokenH ill make available its books for examinationy Mr Essington.Lewis, the adviser to the Government, will order it off the premises. ' The record of successive 'anti-labour governments; which have been dominated by big-busiriess interests"", deserves a brief that letter was written I have no doubt reference. They sold all the available machinery for-' shipbuilding at Walsh Island, andwere responsible for closing down the Eeturned Soldiers' 'Woollen Mills. In the last war, they allowed the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and private banks to declare dividends ranging up to 120 per cent. In 1939, an anti-Labour government permitted the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited to give to its shareholders 12-J per cent, and 66 free shares, each worth 50s., for every 100 shares held by an individual. The Menzies Government passed the War-time (Company) Tax Act, which to a great degree exempts big companies. It endeavoured to grant a monopoly of motor car building to one firm. On the general manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Oompany Limited it conferred absolute power to buy at his own price with the people's money, materials to manufacture the kind of munitions most profitable to make. Recently the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited was allowed to make another share issue in order to prevent declared profits from forging too far ahead of the dividend of T£ per cent., which was then being paid on fictitious capital created by the free issue of 1939. In addition, it permitted the politically discredited chain-press dictator; Sir Keith Murdoch, who had to resign, the dictatorship of the Department of Information when his attempt to grab control of all newspapers, films and radio stations failed, still to [IS] dominate that department and to dictate the policy of the Government;Despite this bad record, the Government expects the Australian public to ""havecconfidence in it. <-r I have frequently communicated with the Minister for the Army (Mn&fSpender). on the subject of military pays The last reply which I received was daied the 1st March, 1941, and read-^ >. : I refer to your letter of.'the 19th February,on. .the question of payment of military -ProprietaryCompany Limited to trainees and the Australian Imperial Force, and desire to advise that this matter is under niy consideration""'and is the subject of discussion between my officers and myself. I propose to. bring the matter before Cabinet at an early date. Nearly three months has elapsed since that the matter will still be under' consideration at the conclusion of the war. Although the Government frequently deplores the shortage of skilled tradesmen, I have a copy of a notice of dismissal which was handed to an employee of the De Havilland Aircraft Company Proprietary Limited. It readsThe bearer, whose signature appears below, was ewploved by the above company from the loth April, 1940, to the 4th February, 1941, in the capacity of first-class woodworker, and the reasons for termination of employment are: reduction of stall'. That notice, which is signed by H . Walker on behalf of the company, was served upon the employee after he had given satisfactory service for nearly twelve months. The company did not declare that his dismissal was due to incompetence. Matters relating to the internment of persons in Australia require complete overhaul. Further inquiry should be made into the procedure followed by the department that is responsible. An internee has asked me to endeavour to ascertain why he is held in captivity. According to his statement, he was born in Australia of British parents, and served in the last war. For his services in 1914-18, he is now receiving a military pension. Military intelligence authorities interned him with enemy aliens, and refused to offer any reason for his detention. I am interested to know the explanation of the Government for this, and other peculiar decisions which have been reached upon various occasions. citizen of British_ parentage, who served in .the last war, should now he placed in a concentration camp among enemy aliens for no reason known to him, is to me astounding. As an Australian citizen he should have the right publicly td endeavour to clear himself of f suspicion before a civil tribunal. A few days ago, honourable members tad an opportunity to ventilate in Parliathe employers heated' the coins over a ment certain happenings in an industrial <lispute in New Guinea. Since then, I have learned that conditions in the territory are most unsatisfactory, and white residents are dissatisfied with the way.in oil in the Mandated Territory, the which affairs are being conducted. It is evident to many persons that the Administrator, Brigadier-General McNicol, who has held the office for a considerable time, is not a suitable man for the position. As his decisions are retarding the progress and development of the Territory, he should be recalled to Australia. Some of the actions of the Government iead me to suspect that it is not anxious to encourage the search for flow oil in the reports is prepared to bear the whole Mandated Territory of New Guinea. Although considerable mystery surrounds the alleged "" finds"" which are reported periodically, sufficient evidence is availto ensure that it does not ill-treat the able to warrant the Government taking immediate steps to verify the claims. But instead of doing so, it has adopted the unusual attitude of declaring that the regions must be considered closed areas. Private companies, which are prepared to expend their ow,n money and accept any risks that may be entailed in conducting an expedition into the terand two German expeditions conducted an ritory, are not encouraged to proceed with their plans. The Government asserts that, in accordance with the terms of the mandate, it must care for the welfare of the natives. That excuse is very flimsy. ment to grant substantial facilities to any If the Government were genuinely sincere in its desire to protect the natives, it would shield them from exploitation ""by private enterprise. Many of them, after working in the mines until they are of no further use to the private adventurers, return, broken in health, to their Tillages, to await death. Although their -work is most arduous, their payment is practically negligible. Some are given Mr Ward. That an Australian-horn a coloured silk handkerchief at Christmas. On one occasion, the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) described the difficulty of paying the natives who, when offered money, held their handsbehind their backs and refused to accept it. I cudgelled my brains in an endeavour to assign a reason to this curious conduct. I can account for it only by the possibility that on a previous occasion, fire before they offered them to the natives. [Further leave to continue given.'} To individuals who desire to investigate the alleged discoveries of flow Government declares that the country is wild, unexplored, and undeveloped, and that any expedition which ventures into its depths will encounter many perils. All reports about the discovery of flow oil emanate from one centre, which is in the vicinity of the Sepik River, near the border of Dutch New Guinea. The Government has declared this region a closed area. One company which offered to equip an expedition for the purpose of testing the of the cost of the search, and defray the expenses of a government official who would accompany the party in order natives. Lesti t be alleged that the expedition is merely a stunt to increase the price of the company's shares, the enterprise will withdraw them from the market until it has verified the reports. As to whether the region is unexplored, maps of German and Dutch origin show details of that part of the territory, exhaustive survey of the area. Obviously, the Government's contention that the region is unexplored cannot be substantiated. WhilstI do not urge the Governprivate company for the purpose of undertaking this work, it would be justified in expending a comparatively small sum in order to test the accuracy of the reports. The Government is always willing to subsidize private companies to search for flow oil in any districts where discovery is impossible. The expenditure of a few thousand pounds in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea in order to send government officials to investigate the reports would, particularly at this juncture, be fully justified. I hope that the Government will give consideration to my requests, and act upon the suggestions I have made. adjourned. Assent reported.

The honorable member for ""Wakefield expenditure by the Postal Department on the extension of mail deliveries in outback areas. He expressed the opinion that the advent of wireless broadcasting had reduced the dependence of people in remote places on the mails. The honourable gentleman would have had much better reason to attack the expenditure of almost £1,000,000 on additions to the Sydney General Post Office. able member looks at my speech he will see that I also dealt with expenditure onpostal buildings. covers a vast area and the people in the more remote parts of that electorate are clamouring for increased mail deliveries and I appeal to the Postmaster-General to accede to their request. In his recent broadcast speech 'the Prime Minister saidOur task therefore, is to concentrate-me n on war industry, machines on war production, and money on war ends. To do this we propose to set up an authority -which will drason behalf of this Government and tically review civil production. The worth of that authority will depend on the way in which it applies policy. The maintenance of the goldmining industry of Western Australia is vital not only to the State, but also to the Commonwealth, because of the great amount of wealth which that industry produces. Yet, mining companies are experiencing great difficulty in getting deliveries of essential machinery and machine parts. I have been told by the secretary of the Chamber of Mines that orders placed more than six months ago have not yet been fulfilled. That is a matter into whicli the Commonwealth Manpower and Resources Survey Committee could well inquire. I understand Easter, I received an invitation to attend from the chairman of the committee, the opening of the air training school however, that it will not be possible for the committee to visit Western Australia until late in JulyJ after it has concluded its inquiries in Queensland. I direct the attention of the 'House to the failure of the Government to give any substantial relief to the wheat industry. In my opinion, relief could best be given to that industry by tbe establishment ' of a mortgage branch of the Commonwealth Bank, "" as was recommended by the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking 'Systems. The wheat commission reported that the indebtedness of the farmers of Australia amounted to about £150,000.000, but I should say that they' now owe £200,000,000, the bulk of which is in short-term loans or on mortgage on which the interest rate is not less than 5 per cent., involving an annual interest bill of more than £10,000,000. The character of the debts subjects the wheat-farmers to the vagaries of the money market with resultant insecurity to himself and his dependants A mortgage bank which would take over those short-term debts and mortgages in exchange for long-term loans would give security to the farmers, especially as, on a long-term basis, the rate of interest would be reduced from 5 per cent, to about 2\ per cent., which would mean an annual saving to the farmers of about £5,000,000. I cannot understand why the Government has failed to set up a mortgage bank. Countless promises have, been made similar governments that effect would be given' to the recommendations of the banking commission. Sir George Pearce, a former Western Australian senator, made such a promise in August, 1937, and the then Prime Minister, the late Mr Lyons, repeated it a month later. The Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) gave a similar promise in October, 193S, and as late as May, 1939, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies.) re-stated it. I urge the Government to fulfil these promises to the wheat-growers so tliat they may be rescued from the burden which is crushing them. After this House had adjourned over",40,Ministerial Changes

I .do. .not know, whether in this-matter .the commandant of the. school followed the. usual procedure,, but, if so, I urge that-the procedure be altered immediately. That officer appears to be a law unto himself in respect of contracts for the camp. At first it was thought that most of the contracts to supply the school would not be of any great value, and, probably .for that reason, small farmers in the locality were able to obtain contracts for the supply of milk. Later, however, when the number of men to be permanently established at the school increased, the supply -of milk and meat became more important. The result was that when tenders were called for the supply of milk to the camp the farmer who had supplied milk from his farm, which was adjacent to the aerodrome, lost the contract, which was given to a man who brought the major portion of his milk from Perth,, a distance of about 320 miles. I sought the assistance of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) in this matter, but the only result of an interview whicli was granted to lis ""was an assurance that fresh contracts would be called. That the commandant is a law unto himself is shown by his action in declaring certain hotels in the Geraldton district to bo out of bounds. In other words, they have been declared "" black."" In this matter the commandant certainly exceeded his duty. It may be within his province to enforce discipline among recruits, but I doubt his authority to say that men on leave from the school shall not enter this or that hotel. For over six months the Australian Workers Union has been negotiating a claim on behalf of its members. While I was still branch secretary of the Australian Workers Union in Perth, I submitted, a claim on behalf of the workers at Broome to the local representative of the Minister at the Commonwealth'Bank Buildings, Perth. Last week, after lengthy negotiations, I received' a letter from the Minister for the ' Interior(Senator Poll), which contained' the following paragraph-:-T-"" In view of the fact that an amount of £540 was paid to the contractorby the Common-, .wealth', and the wages, holiday pay, and. a' compensation, claim.totalling £512 -2s. l i d : were owed to workmen by him, it.appears to me""that nt. least some action should have been taken -by -the -workmen -concernedregarding payment of tlieir claims, before, the contract: .was cancelled. We had been led. to believe that all con. tracts entered into with the Commonwealth Government contained a provision which protected the wages of tbe workmen employed. The belief was confirmed by an answer to a question which I received some days ago. I appeal to the responsible Minister to see that these men who performed their part of the contract shall receive tlieir wages. Yesterday, the honourable member for Swan"" ( Mr Marwick) referred to various deposits of iron ore and manganese in Western Australia. I referred to these deposits in a speech which I delivered in this House in April last. In his remarks yesterday, the honourable member for Swan made no reference to the huge deposit of iron ore near Southern Cross, and therefore, I now bring the matter before the Government in the hope that this deposit also will be given the consideration that it deserves. About 30 miles from Coolgardie is a deposit of ambygonite in the form of fluophosphate. of aluminium and lithium. In. view of the scarcity of aluminium and superphosphate, I suggest that the Government should: investigate these deposits also with a view to ascertaining their value to the Commonwealth. When the newsprint rationing proposals of the-Government are put into operation I hope that the errors associated with the previous rationing of newsprint will not be repeated.

123,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [3.57],"I have in my possession detailed information of the effect of these movements of population upon the economic situation of many country towns. Equities in businesses that have been built up over a number of years have disappeared, in some cases almost overnight. Many, of them have been closed down and others are hanging on by the merest thread. There are hundreds of empty houses in some of the larger country towns. Motor garages, foundries and. similar establishments are l y in g. almost idle, although a great deal of the machinery and equipment could 'be used for the war effort. The Government is unwise to 'allow the d r if t to the cities to continue. production in the metropolitan areas is not a sound policy. It has been condemned fro m a strategic point of view by the highest military authorities, but the Government appears to be ignoring the dangers to which its attention has been directed. The Governmentshould take advantage of the labour and mechanical equipment that are available in these country centres, so that they may be compensated in some degree for the disabilities that they have sustained as the result of war-time activities and-the loss of markets for primary products, which, normally are the mainstay of country towns I mention how, amongst other towns, Vfarracknabeal in my electorate has been affected. I do not know the exact pre-war population of the town, but I believe that it was about 2,000 or 3.000. I have here a statement prepared by the Warracknabeal Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the local Shire Council, which shows that the population has been seriously depleted as the result of enlistments and the d r if t to the capital cities. There are now 39 empty houses, 6 vacant shops and 4 idle garages in the town. Equipment in the workshops is lying idle. When applications were made for munition work it was suggested that the equipment should be removed to the cities. That is a suicidal policy in view of what we have been told by our military experts. are looking to the Government to change that policy and establish some of our war industries in rural areas. I could refer at great length to towns throughout the Commonwealth where large reserves of labour and equipment are, waiting to be' tapped. While this condition exists, the Government is not doing all that it can do in order to further our. war effort and provide our armed forces with equipment which is so vitally heces'sary to their success and to ultimate victory! I turn now to the Government's policy in regard to the Mandated Territories of Papua and New Guinea, which was referred to earlier by the honourable member for East Sydney( MrW a r d ) , and which I have made the subject of questions in this Housei n recent months. During the last sittings of ""this Parliament I asked the Minister in charge of ExternalT e r r i Centralization of munition tories ( Mr Collins) why the Government did not instruct the Administrator of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea to proceed with the construction of a motor road from Salamaua to Wau, the business centre of the Morobe gold-field, and so speed up gold production. The Minister replied that the construction of the road had been commenced in certain places. But I am informed by residents of New Guinea that road construction has not been commenced, and that all that exists is a rough foot track following the surveyed'route for the road; this is not even a mule track and cannot by aiiy stretch of imagination be regarded as a commencement of road construction. construct the road, and only £150,000 has been allocated for the work. ber does not appear to have any enthusiasm for the project. It is evident that the Minister has been incorrectly informed of the conditions existing in the territory.. I hope that the newly appointed Minister in charge of External Territories w ill investigate this matter, because .the development of New Guineaisimportant to the safety and progress of Australia. Other replies which Ministers have given to questions which have been asked in this House indicate that they suffer from lack of personal knowledge of the actual conditions in the territory. This demonWe strates the necessity for Ministers to gain first-hand knowledge of our territories by visiting them, so that honourable members may be adequately informed, instead of being obliged to rely entirely upon the",43,Supply Bill No 1 1941 42

125,Mr Wilson,"The honourable memstatements and opinions of officials. Such a strategically and economically important territory as New Guinea is deserving of representation in this House, so that the commercial, mining, planting and other interests of the country, which provide the revenue for its administration and development, could present their views. In-this connection, I am in accord with the views recently expressed hy the honourable member for Barker Archie Cameron), who advocated that Papua and New Guinea should be given representation in this Parliament on an equal footing with the Northern Territory. There are dangers in allowing a territory possessing the peculiar conditions and vast natural resources of New Guinea to be controlled by a body of public servants as is the case at present. A number of these public servants may be excellent men, but in a tropical country like New Guinea there is a tendency for them to become ""dug into"" positions in which there is no periodical review of their capacity or suitability to occupy them. It may happen that much more capable men are being denied the right to exercise the ability that they possess in the best interests of the territory and Australia. which the Administrator becomes virtually an autocrat in his own right should not be tolerated in a territory governed"" by a democratic country like Australia. At present the pcopie who are providing the revenue for the administration of New Guinea-and chiefly from the gold-mining industry and community-have shall be expended, and no means of restraining the Administrator and his officers or of guiding and assisting them in the utilization of revenue for the development and control of the territory along sound business lines. This is not right. Private enterprise, which provides the revenue to keep the mandated territory afloat financially, has no. representation or voice in the government of the country. This is akin to the adoption of the principle of taxation without repreextremely benevolent Native Labour sentation. It should be fully recognized by this Parliament that the mining in-dustry in New Guinea is to-day the most heavily taxed industry in the territory, and. in fact, provides the revenue for the Mr Wilson. cost of the expensive administrative services of the territory, so relieving the Commonwealth Government of what would otherwise be a heavy financial responsibility. The lack of knowledge of, and interest in, the territories displayed by many members is all too evident. It would appear that when the Government sends an administrator to New Guinea, it does not look about for a man trained ( Mr aud experienced in the development and administration of a tropical country, and possessing a broad outlook on business matters. ' Instead it sends some . exmilitary man with little or no special qualifications for the position. If . New Guinea is to be developed to the fullest extent, private enterprise must be given every possible encouragement and assistance to develop and exploit the natural resources of the country. No undue restrictions should be placed on those who are prepared to go into the unexplored parts of the territory to ascertain their possibilities. I have been informed by persons widely experienced in New Guinea and other tropical countries, that the greatest civilizing influence on the natives of New Guinea is not so much The present system under the Government 33 the employment of the natives in industry by private enterprise. This would indicate that the most logical way in which the Government can provide for the welfare of the natives is to encourage private enterprise to the fullest possible degree, and so bring more that revenue comes of the animal-like, stone-age natives under the civilizing influence of industry. no voice as to how it An opinion is current among people who have not lived and worked, inNew Guinea, and appears to be shared by some members of Parliament, that the white employer of native labour is some kind of ogre, whose sole object in life is to ill-treat and oppress the natives. That is wide of the truth. In a majority of cases, the natives enjoy working for white men, and it is to the interest of white men to treat them well. In any case, there is no alternative, as, under the Ordinance, the restrictive conditions imposed on employers are more harsh than those imposed on the natives. Experienced men who know the wilds of New Guinea have informed me that the most disgusting and repulsive examples of humanity they have seen arc to be found in the native villages, where the native lives his natural life, remote from the influence of the white man. ' The contrast in physical and mental alertness aud well-being is most marked six months after natives leave their villages and come under the influence of white industrial control. In .view of these facts there should be a thorough understanding of the relations between the white man and the native in New Guinea before any hasty or immature judgment is arrived at on New Guinea matters generally. Last week reference was made in this House to the conditions under which white miners were working in New Guinea in comparison with conditions in Australia. In this regard I point out that all underground mining in the Morobe gold-field, where the industrial dispute is in existence, is carried on at altitudes between 4,000 and 7,000 feet above sea level, where'the conditions are .not so arduous physically as are those existing on the steamy coastal areas. Further, white miners in New Guinea do not, generally, do tbe same amount of heavy ""bullocking"" work as miners in Australia. By this I mean that in New Guinea white miners are employed more as supervisors of gangs of-native labourers, and, consequently, are not required to withstand the constant heavy physical exertion that is the lot of the underground miner in Australia. At the same time, the living costs of the miner in New Guinea are very heavy, due to the Morobe gold-fields being entirely dependent upon aircraft for the transport of supplies from the coast. At present, when the Government is making endeavours to conserve its petrol supplies, we see the large community of whites and natives on the Morobe goldfields in New Guinea still relying entirely on aircraft for mining plant, supplies, food, &c, which are flown from the coastal aerodromes at Lac and Salamaua. During the past thirteen years the Government has refused to allow private enterprise to build a road from Salamaua' to Wau, and has itself failed to build the road. Such an unprogressive and procrastinating attitude would not have been tolerated had the people of New Guinea been given representation in this Parliament. The' skilled personnel tied up in keeping the aerial transport services operating in Morobe coiild be released for more important war work if the Salamaua to Wau road, which is about 50 miles in length, were constructed. Tho saving in petrol would also be enormous, as' producer-gas units could be used on motor-lorries travelling the route from Salamaua to Wau, and native drivers could drive the vehicles. Thirteen years ago the Government increased the royalty on gold produced in New Guinea from 1 per cent, to -5 per cent, in order to provide a fund to finance the building of a motor road from the coast to the gold-fields in the Morobe district. That the money so obtained has been paid into Consolidated Revenue and expended largely in unproductive channels is evidence that the Government has not played, the game with the mining industry. In this respect it has let the industry down badly, and has broken faith with those engaged in producing tbe revenue that keeps the administration financially sound. A wiso policy for the Government to have adopted-and it is not too late to start such a policy now-woul d have been to have utilized a portion of tlie revenue obtained from gold-mining for the construction of main developmental roads on the mainland of New Guinea in order to increase gold production and open up the rich agricultural and pastoral country existing, at altitudes of between 4,000 and 5,000 feet and extending from the Ramn to Mount Hagen. As honourable members are aware, this Parliament passed a bill several years ago authorizing the construction of a motor road from Salamaua to Wau; but tenders have not yet been called for its construction, and the administration of New Guinea has been fooling about on surveys for the road, and 'making excuses that, owing to war . conditions, it has not been able to complete them. The whole sorry story justifies a thorough inquiry, especially in view of the fact that the Administrator is reported by the Morobe News, a newspaper published at Wau, and circulating, throughout New Guinea and Papua, to have stated that he was not in favour of the road authorized by the Commonwealth Government. I suggest that had he, or his administration, not expended large sums of money in Rabaul, which, according to expert advice, is likely again to suffer the effects of a devastating volcanic. disturbance, and on the building of lavish houses for public servants throughout the territory, gold production would, had the Salaniaua-Wau road been constructed, be now much greater than it is at present. The whole subject of the administration of New Guinea should be given close scrutiny by this Government, and a policy initiated that will make the territory selfpectors and companies from exploring supporting after the gold deposits are exhausted not many years hence. One mining company at Edie Creek, a branch of the New Guinea Gold and Petroleum Development No Liability Company, based its mine development programme on the Government's undertaking to construct the SalamauaWau road, and now, after developing the mine by surface and underground workings, it hasa four years' supply of milling ore blocked out. The grade of the ore, however, is too low to justify the expenditure of taking in milling, hydro-electric and mining.plant and supplies by air. The company has consequently been obliged toclose down and wait until the road is constructed. This is surely an indictment of the Government. The fact must not be overlooked that the Morobe gold-field was pioneered by Australians, and its subsequent development was carried out, in the face of enormous difficulties, by private enterprise-in many cases by practical working miners. Those interested expended millions of pounds in prospecting, developing, equipping and working the gold areas. Incidentally, they have provided, over a number of years, the revenue which has made tlie territory self-supporting. realize that the present annual production of the gold-fields of New Guinea is greater in value than that of any State in Australia except Western Australia, they will appreciate what this means in dollar exchange. These gold-fields have produced gold valued at about £20,000,000 and the present production amounts to about £3,000,000 annually. One of the great disabilities under eering work in New Guinea, and has been which New Guinea has laboured has been endeavouring for a number of years to the frequent changes of personnel, and the obtain a permit to search for petroleum ' S f r . Wilson. ' ' ' : -> lack of-knowledge of Ministers administering the territory. I assert, positively, that, unless the Government wakes up to the potentialities of New Guinea, there will be a grave danger that some other people may challenge our right to retain it. Therefore, we should give to the territory wise and progressive leadership. The Government's policy of tying-up large portions of New Guinea under the Uncontrolled Areas Ordinance has had the effect of preventing Australian prosand opening up the hinterland. The world ismoving much too fast to justify -the continuance of such an unprogressive attitude. Although private enterprise desires to explore the uncontrolled areas by utilizing the services of men of wide experience in the wilds of New Guinea, it is being refused' permission to do so until the Government can bring the areas under tbe control of Government officers. Asked when this will happen, the Government replies that it has not the staff to do the work, and does not know when it will have men available for the purpose. In these circumstances I contend that the. Government should step aside and allow competent private authorities to do the job as it has been done in the past. Some of the best exploration work in the unknown and unmapped areas of the Mandated Territory has been done by individual miners such as "" Sharkeye"" Park, Preston, Crowe, the Leahy brothers, Dwyer, Belficld, the Eox brothers, Baum, Rowlands, Burke, Korn, Nasson-Jones, Duchatel and others who, without police protection, and long before Government officers were available, penetrated and prospected wild mountainous country, occupied by hostile natives. Assuredly the individual alluvial miner has been When honourable members the pioneer! One' well-known miner-cumprospector-cum-explorer has remarked: "" We do not need protection from the native. We know his psychology and can get along well with him. What we need is protection from the Government and its restrictive ordinances."" The company to which I have referred previously in this speech has already undertaken much prospecting and pionIu a portion of tlie uncontrolled area, but although it has undertaken to employ experienced men and to pay the full cost of any officers the Government considered necessary to accompany its expedition into the interior, it has been flatly refused plete insincerity of the oft-repeated permission! Such treatment is illogical, to say the least of it, and one begins, to wonder whether there is any other motive than the much-vaunted ""welfare of the natives"" behind such an unpro-gressive attitude. If Empire builders in other parts of the British Empire peopled by coloured races had met with similar treatment, they would most certainly, and rightly, have rebelled against it. I have been informed, inother than official quarters, that the demarcation some years ago of the international border between Dutch New Guinea and. the Mandated Territory was fixed owing to reported oil-drilling operations near the border by the Dutch. The Dutch are reported to have drilled wells which they thought were in their territory, but whicli subsequently were found to be in uncontrolled mandated territory. The Australian company to which I have referred possesses information relative to these oil exploration activities, and has endeavoured for a number of years, but so far unsuccessfully, to obtain from the Government permission to explore the area. certain confidential information in the hands of the Minister for External Territories in support of its desire to obtain prospecting rights. But still-permission is withheld! The correctness of the company's belief in this matter can so easily be tested, and can so simply be placed beyond all doubt that it is doubly hard to understand why the Government should desire to prevent the entry of qualified men to the area. The Government should be mors anxious 1han any private company to locate flow.oil, yet it is certain strong forces are at work to delay a fact that although the company has for years shown enthusiasm and determination to get on with this job of national importance, the Government has adopted an attitude that has been both illogical and uninterested, to a degree that is hard to imagine in view of the importance of tire project. The perplexing attitude of the that will be the case. At least we may authorities in adhering, especially in expect him to be actively inter.est.ed in war-time, to regulations so suggestive of stagnation, is a matter of grave concern to the public, and it is generally considered that this obstructionist procedure only serves to emphasize the comstatements that the Government desires oil to be discovered and will support the searchfor it. Why is it that the only area that, to my knowledge, is reported to contain payable oil in the Commonwealth or its territories is the only area where prospecting, or even entry, is disallowed? A searching inquiry should be made into this subject. If the Government intends to persist in locking up this area and in delaying the construction of the SalamauaWau road, it should say so definitely and without further humbug. The shareholders of tlie company interested in the undertaking would then, at least, have the satisfaction of knowing just where their company stands in relation to its objectives in New Guinea. I consider that, in view of the national importance of petroleum, the Government should give the company a clear "" Yes"" or "" No,"" to its request for a permit to 'enter lhat portion of the uncontrolled area of the Mandated Territory where it believes oil to exist. I have discussed this subject at some The company has also placed length because oil is so vital to our war effort. I desire the Government to take some definite action to ascertain whether oil-fields can. or cannot be developed in New Guinea, for anything that we can do to make oil available will be of immense service. The great importance of oil supplies has heen brought homo to us forcefully recently. I have prepared a lot of informarion about the proposed. Salamaua-Wau road, but I shall not speak at length on the subject at this juncture. It appears lhat the construction of the road, as well ns to delay an intensive search for oil in the Mandated Territory. appointed Minister for' External Territories will be able to take some effective action in regard to these matters.",44,Supply Bill No 1 1941 42

The honourable member has just read a long statement that was probably written by some one else Mi. WILSON -Why has the honourable 1 member said that? think. However, I assure the honourable member that I bave no desire whatever to hold up the construction of this road, for I think that it is a work of national importance. WhatI said by interjection while the honourable member was speaking was that only £150,000 has been allocated for the work and that it would probably cost £500,000. I have visited the locality several times and I have no doubt whatever that the road will cost nearer £500,000 than £150,000. The shortest practicable distance between the two towns is about 40 miles, but alternative routes have been surveyed for roads of up to 60 miles. The country to be traversed is of a razor-back mountainous formation. The ranges rise to an altitude of more than 6,000 feet and there is then a descent of 2,000 feet to Wau. It is possible to build the proposed road and I think it should be built, but I also think that the taxpayers should know approximately how' much money they will be called upon to provide for the work, The greater part of the revenueobtained from the Mandated Territory of New' Guinea is contributed from the -goldfields areas of Wau, Edie Creek and Bulolo, but unfortunately most of the money is spent at Rabaul, 60 miles distant from the gold-fields, Avhere, -inmy opinion, it is not needed. I consider that' it should be expended principally in the districts from which it is obtained, -and I tried to impress this view upon the I Administrator-while I was in New Guinea. At present the gold-mining companies are spending large amounts of money in constructing roads that are used by the general public as well as by the companies. A 5 per cent, royalty is collected upon all gold obtaiued in New Guinea and I suggest that part of the money for the building of the SalamauaWau road should be obtained from that source. If a road were built a considerable quantity of excellent timber of various kinds could be obtained from the Wau and Bulolo districts and marketed advantageously in Australia. I make it clear that I hope that the Government will provide the money necessary for the construction of this road and I am prepared to do all in my power to help forward the project. A road 12 feet wide has already been cut into the mountains between Wau and Edie Creek for a distance of twelve miles. I had the pleasure-o r otherwise-of riding over it in the first motor car to he driven on it. Only narrow track motor vehicles are used onit. The rainfall in the district is so heavy that landslides are frequent, with the result that at times parts of the road are traffickable only for a width of five or six feet. The party which travelled with me on the occasion to which I have referred would bear out my statement that at times our vehicle was scraping against the rocks on one side of the road, while the wheels on the other side of the vehicle was right on the edge of the made surface. The Salamaua-Wau road can and should be constructed. however, that the road .cannot be constructed for the estimate specified. After the road is completed a large gang of men must be employed on maintenance",48,Supply Bill No 1 1941 42

In addition, regardless of the material which might be used for construction, the road w ill have to be surfaced and that w ill be costly. I noticed that the road from Wan to Edie Creek was being continually serviced with, metal. Owing to the very wet conditions, the metal very soon disappeared in mud. Consequently, I urge the Government to ensure that the new road w ill be surfaced effectively for heavy traffic that w i ll require to use it . I now draw the attention of the Government to the problem of housing in Canberra. On a number of occasions in this chamber I have described the scheme under whicli workmen's homes are being provided in Adelaide. In the past the Ministerf or Health( Sir Eredierick Stewart) appeared to doubt my praise of that scheme. however, I accompanying h i m when lie inspected some hundreds of these houses. ""When I raised this matter in this House about two or three years ago, I made available for the perusal of honourable members plans, specifications and photographs of those homes. The standard house consists of four rooms and a sleep-out, and contains all conveniences, whilst each property is nicely fenced, the total cost -of a semi-detached pair of homes being £900. for the two homes? Government to adopt a similar scheme for Canberra. D u r in g the last year the Government has constructed 200 houses here. valuator on that programme practically guaranteed that the cost of these houses would not, exceed £1,150, or, at any rate, would compare favourably with that of the houses constructed by the Building Trusti n Adelaide. To my dismay, I now find that the actual cost of each of these pairs of houses is approximately £1,400. Whilst the rental of the houses in Adelaide averages 12s. 6d. a week, that of the Canberra houses, which are in no way superior to the former, is somewhere between. £1 or 22s. a week. This is hardly f a i r to the tenants of same time the taxpayers as a whole are not being given a f a i r deal in this matter. Some time ago I asked the Ministerf or the Interior (SenatorF o l l) to despatch two -expert officers to visit Adelaide to inspect the homes being constructed there. He promised-to do so, but, as usual, forgot all about it . The total cost of . the 200 houses that were constructed. at Canberra, last year exceeded that of a similar number of houses constructed in Adelaide hy from £40,000 to £60,000, after allowing a margin of 25 per cent, in respect of the Canberra houses to cover additional costs of bricks, labour and transport in the national capital. The price of bricks for a four-roomed cottage is only £7 higher in Canberra than in Adelaide. On this basis the eost of a pair of semi-detached homes in CanRecently, berra should not have exceeded had the pleasure of £1,200. I again urge the Minister for Health to take up this matter w it h a view to applying the Adelaide scheme' in the national capital, and, thereby, saving the taxpayers thousands of pounds. Under this bill we are asked to vote the sum of £15,141,000 to provide for services for ' two months after the end of the present financial year. !. do not object to that proposal. Indeed, I protest against the failure of the Government to expend the money previously voted to it , in respect of the current financial year, as expeditiously as existing circumstances demand. The Government budgeted for an expenditure in this financial year of £1S6,000,000, but up to the end of Mayi t had expended only The advising architect and £135,000,000, leaving a balance of £51,000,000 to be expended during the 'current month. The Government should have undertaken before now several urgent works in Queensland. A t present, although the war bas been in progress for over two years, it is doing only the spade work on a munition factory in Brisbane. The factory was supposed to be ready for production by next month. Now, I understand, it w ill not he ready until October or November. That, lag of five months discloses a radical administrative weakness.

134,Mr Conelan (Griffith ) [4.52],"to do is to produce move and more munitions. In bhe distribution of munition activities, Queensland has been badly neglected. The Government has also been guilty of unpardonable delay in the construction of a military hospital at Greenslopes, in my electorate. That institution should have been built several months ago in order that it might be ready to accommodate the thousands of soldiers who are now being invalided home. WP know that our casualties already total 20,000 whilst many men have been discharged from the Army as medically unfit. Because of the Government's delay in constructing military hospitals, it is now forced to provide for these casualties in not only the general hospital in Brisbane but also in the Rosemount military hospital. The result is that the wards at those institutions are overcrowded. Such a condition of affairs can only be to the detriment of the ordinary patients in those institutions, and also the wounded soldiers now being crowded into them. I urge the Government to take complete control of all munition factories and annexes in the Commonwealth. The private owners of such factories are making a good profit under the present system, as they receive profits at the rate of 1% per cent, of their costs. Obviously, the longer the war lasts the more money these people will make. Consequently, they cannot be anxious for the war to end. The disadvantages of such a system are obvious. So long as a man is kept on the payroll of any of these factories, regardless of whether his services are being fully employed, the greater will be the profit accruing to the owners. That system is radically wrong, and the Governmentshould remedy the position by taking complete control of those establishments. Australia is already feeling severely the shortage of shipping for the transport of our primary produce overseas. Several excellent shipwright works exist in Brisbane, the owners of which request the Government to give them orders for the construction of wooden ships. The Queensland Government is ready to cooperate in such a programme. It .has offered to make available a site on the Brisbane River for the construction of to agree with the honourable member, but Ilr. Conelan. wooden ships of up to 2,000 tons. Recently-, the Commonwealth Man-power and Resources Survey Committee visited existing shipyards in Brisbane, and the members of that committee were very impressed with what they saw. I should be sorry if the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Suooner), and the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), another member of the committee, are forced to relinquish their membership of that committee as the result of their elevation to ministerial rank. as members of the committee. I trust that as soon as possible the committee will furnish to the Government its report on its investigations in Queensland, in order that a shipbuilding programme can be quickly undertaken so as to relieve steel freighters now engaged on the coast for the transport of our primary produce to Great Britain. I am informed that the shipyards in Queensland can lay down six keels at once, and that, after the first ship is completed a new ship will be launched every few months. The Government coidd clinch this matter by placing an order for, say, twelve wooden ships with these works in Queensland which are prepared to combine in this venture. I congratulate the honourable member for Hume( Mr Collins) upon his appointment as Postmaster-General. I am sure that he will do very fine work in his new office.

The Commonwealth Government has concluded an agreement with .the British Government which w ill secure I moveforpost-war. reconstruction and restoration of international trade. , The New Zealand Government is making a similar of an agreement between agreement with the British Government, I shall now set out the nature of tbe When war broke out, the We must tiations with the British Food Controller necessary organizations and to bring to British Government for the purchase of various commodities The Commonwealth Government was assisted by the industry organizations in its negotiations with the British. Government. In the first year of war, the. total value of the foodstuffs and raw materials supplied to Great -Britain under bulk contracts was more than £100,000,000.. In that year, our products were transported to Great Britain regularly and-safely,>and that year's returns provedto be on'-the -whole satisfactory to Australian primary producers. In the second year of the-waralso,-we have been able to-dispose and ship the surplus of most products. In this second year, as in the first,our sales to Great Britain will bring in-an-income exceeding £100,000,000. Thus, during two years -ofwar-, notwithstanding a savage attack on Empire, allied, and neutral shipping, %ve have been able to sell and ship almost our total export surplus of certain specified foodstuffs. We have also sold our total wool .clip. Wool producers are paid as the-wool is'appraised, whether it be shipped or not. This favorable arrangement in regard to wool, under which the totalclip is bought by the British Government and paid for on appraisement, was made immediately after the outbreak of war, the term of the arrangement being the whole period of the war and one year thereafter. The Australian wool producers are relieved of anxiety regarding the disposal of their product whilst the war lasts. This is a great boon to the many thousands of wool producers in Australia, a large number of whom are also the producers of foodstuffs of different kinds. Unfortunately, wool was the only primary product in respect of whicha contract could be made for the disposal of the total surplus for the term of the war regardless of whether that surplus is shipped or not. In respect of primary industries which produce foodstuffs required by Great Britain, contracts have been made on an annual basis. In . the making of each year's contract, consideration has had to be given to the volume of shipping likely to be available. It is necessary that Britain should import some foodstuffs from the nearest countries in which they are available in sufficient finality negotiations with the quantities This adversely affects Australia and New Zealand.;but this sacrifice must be made* in the general interest of all concerned. The mutual recognition; ibyBritain and ourselves that we must face the realities of the shipping position, and revise the arrangements for feedingHhe British people, led to discussions between' the Prime Minister of Australia and the British Government during Mr Menzies's recent visit to Great Britain. In those discussions, the Commonwealth Government recognized the paramount importance of utilizing shipping to the greatest advantage in sending foodstuffs to Britain, whilst Britain recognized the importance of maintaining a source of supply in the southern dominions. The discussion -resulted in the adoption by the British and Commonwealth Governments of priiir ciples which should govern our policy in regard to food production, storage, and shipment to Great Britain, during the war. We have applied principles in the formation of a coherent plan to handle -all problems of production, storage, marketing and shipment of Australian .foodstuffs. These principles have been defined in an agreed document, the text of which is as follows:His Majesty's Government in Great Britainf u l l y recognize the grave .difficulty created for Australian industries by. the shortage of shipping. They are anxious to continue taking all Australian produce that can be shipped. i They also appreciate the serious effect upon the Australian economic and financial structure .which these difficulties are causing. W i th a yiew to minimising tbese effects, and preventing tlie impairment of the Australian war effort, the United Kingdom Government is prepared to join with the Commonwealth 1 Government in arrangements to case the burden falling on Australia during tbe war, framed on lines that w ill not prejudice the post-war position. The two Governments have agreed that the following principles sliould be applied as a basis for such co-operation:1. Tho United Kingdom Government to purchase Australian produce that can be shipped, and to pay for such produce at prices and' upon such terms and conditions as are from time to time agreed .with the Ministry of Food. 2. The Australian industries to make every effort to _adapt their .production to shipping possibilities, e.g. .by de-boning, canning or pressing meat. 3. Alternative markets to be developed wherever possible. 4 -Reserve '-stocks of storable foodstuffs to be created up to certain quantities to be agreed. 5. The quantities to he stored to be determined in relation(o) to probable demands during or after tlie war; (&) to the importance of the industries to Australia. C. The financial burden of acquiring and holding these reserve stocks pending their disposal to be shared equally between the two Governments. 7. The payment to be made for produce acquired for reserve stocks to be agreed, between tJic two Governments. W'hilfe it w i ll be necessary to take due account of such matters as costs of storage, depreciation, etc., it is intended that payment shall be fixed on such a basis as w ill , as far as practicable, achieve the object of keeping industry operating efficiently while avoiding the creation of unmanageable surpluses. 8. The detailed application of the above principle to be referred to competent representatives from the two countries. The Australian Government will be ready to collaborate in any discussions whicli may be convened within the British Commonwealth or internationally, to consider the marketing and related problems. TJiese principles are of tbe greatest and (2) provide that ihe United Kingimportance to Australia. Their applicadom Government will purchase Austion enables U3 to -work out a plan of tralian produce that can be shipped, and action for the duration of the war in will pay for such produce' at prices respect of all of oiir food-producing inarranged, whilst the Australian Governdustries whose export trade is curtailed ment will make every effort, incollaboraowing to shipping, and whose products tion with Australian industries, to adapt are capable of being stored on the joint production to shipping possibilities. We account of the British and Australian have reached an understanding with the Governments. It has been agreed beBritish Government that, in arriving at tween the two Governments that the the prices and other conditions in future shortage of shipping is, and will continue Contracts, consideration will be given to to be, the sole reason for the imposition the new and special steps necessary to and maintenance of the restrictions on prepare produce for shipment. foodstuff purchases from Australia. As additional shipping becomes available, referred to in the third principle is not more tonnage will be .allotted to Ausa simple matter, but I am exploring tralia. We should be deluding ourselves, some possible avenues of disposal. In this however, if we expected in the near future connection, the installation of cold storage any increased allocation of shipping befacilities in some overseas locations, and yond that at present planned. I cannot publish precise figures, but I ties, will help in the disposal of surplus can give to honourable members some idea commodities requiring this form of storof the problems we are facing, by stating age. that the total shipping space for AusGovernments will collaborate in examintralian foodstuffs in the third year of ing the possibilities of providing addithe war will be approximately one-fifth tional cold storage at places overseas, of what it was in the first year of the where it. would be. useful in facilitating war; that the refrigerated tonnage availthe development of the alternative able for the carriage of eggs, which was markets. Sir Earle rage. about 12,000 tons last season, is pr-actically eliminated from now on; that the refrigerated space available for dairy produce is less than one-half of that available in the first year of the war; and that the refrigerated tonnage available for meat is approximately one-third of that provided in the first year of the war. These figures give some idea of the magnitude of the task Ave have in re' organizing our food producing industries. It is in the light of this position that the scheme of re-organization for each export industry must be examined. Whilst this greatly reduced programme of shipping . must in general be adhered to strictly, we have an understanding witb the British Government that if , in some special case, the allocation of a reasonable additional quantity of tonnage would save an industry from economic disorder, or relieve the two Governments from substantial obligations in respect of the financing of reserve stocks, every effort will be made by the British Government to provide that additional tonnage. It will be noted that principles (1) The development of alternative markets the increase of existing cold storage faciliThe British and Australian The sixth and seventh principles contained in the agreement must be considered in their application to each industry affected, according to the peculiar circumstances of that industry. The' British Government has agreed that the Commonwealth examine exhaustively the circumstances of each industry, and then' formulate proposals for dealing -with the problems of that industry in accordance with the general principles already referred to. The Australian Government has indicated its preparedness to participate in international discussions regarding surplus products. Some of Australia's surpluses, a. part of which may he unsaleable in the near future, are of products which have usually entered principally into intra-Empire trade. These products are not likely to be the subject' of international discussions. However, some of our surplus commodities which will face a difficult time in the immediate future are normally of importance in international trade; examples are wheat, sugar, and copra. Australia is prepared to discuss the future of these commodities on an international basis; and we are, in fact, now participating in discussions in Washington in regard to the wheat position. Australia has thus far been fortunate in disposing of the greater part of its wheat stocks, whereas the United States and Canada hold between them the greatest wheat surplus of all time. Whilst the current international discussions are of greater immediate importance to those countries than to Australia, the post-war position of wheat is so important to all exporting and importing countries that the Commonwealth Government regards the discussions whicli have now commenced as sufficiently important to justify our participation in them. Concurrently with the negotiations with the British Government, and. its estimate of the amount of shipping space available for Australian produce, we have obtained from Britain an indication of the priority of its requirements. With this information we proceeded to plan for the objective of covering each commodity to the extent that is practicable for contracts for the duration of ihe war. Resulting prices to producers may be below export parity in some instances, but will be such as, to provide stability and enable the producer to plan ahead on the basis of a minimum guarantee. During recent weeks, the,' Australian. Meat Board, the Dairy Produce Board, Government should and other boards most directly concerned, have been engaged in surveys of their industries in consultation with me and my department. Long-range plans are being drawn up to meet the situation of adjusting the processing of our produce, andeven its production. It is obvious that major diversions in the form of manufacturing must he undertaken to adjust production in accordance with the priorities under the agreement, and to secure their most efficient working and the development of alternative markets. Increased cold storage facilities will be necessary to provide for surpluses accumulating owing to lack of shipping. We have already taken the necessary steps to deal with this problem. Contracts have been let; and buildings are already in course of erection. Goods placed in these stores will be jointly financed by the British and Australian Governments. Our national fodder conservation scheme will assist the plan by enabling us to deal with' certain forms of surplus stock production for which storage and shipping arc not otherwise available. The wheat stabilization plan also assists by placing production under a definite planned scheme. Our survey has also shown the necessity for positive action in dealing with the problem of internal consumption. The Australian people are being called upon to adjust their diet in accordance with food surpluses which must he consumed in Australia. The initial response to the lamb campaign has demonstrated that something may be achieved in this direction. Many of the problems confronting us can be met only by close co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. Methods of co-operation will be discussed with the Australian Agricultural Council during the next two days. The proposals for the national coordination of transport, announced by the Prime Minister in his broadcast speech, will assist towards the success of the plan. It is not my purpose to expound in detail the steps taken, or in contemplation, in regard to each Australian industry which' is adversely affected by the> re-an;angement of shipping Particulars of (the plans for re-organization of tbe meatjindustry have been published. Active steps are in progress to support the dairying and egg industries. These three industries produce perishable goods. Forward planning is necessary to cope with the flush of tbe export season in each case. Tbe problem of egg marketing is the least complex. Up to and including last season, the Australian export surplus of eggs was shipped to Great Britain in the shell, in refrigerated space. Last year, this export required 12,000 tons of refrigerated space. Early this year, we were advised that any future egg supplies must be shipped in the form of whole-egg powder. We have not, heretofore, produced whole-egg powder. Plant and personnel were immediately sought from outside Australia, to enable us to enter the industry on a' large scale. Fdrtunately, we were able to obtain from the Vestey organization eleven egg-di^ying plants then in China. These plants were dismantled and shipped, and are expected to reach Sydney soon. They will he installed and operated on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by Messrs. Angliss and Company. One plant of American design is being manufactured in Australia; it will be installed and used in conjunction with the other plants. It is hoped that the total capacity will be sufficient to deal with practically the whole of our export surplus of eggs. Negotiations are at present in progress with the British Government as to the terms of purchase of the egg powder. It is expected that the price will be based on last year's price for eggs in the shell, plus shipped will be bought at contract pricesthe cost of processing. The Commonwealth Government will buy the eggs in shell from the producers, who will thus be in approximately the same position as if their eggs were being exported in the shell. The Government scheme therefore protects and preserves the industry. The Commonwealth Government is fulfilling its undertaking with the British Government to adapt production to the shipping possibilities, as the total allotment of Sir Earle Page. ordinary cargo space will be less than one-quarter of what was previously required in refrigerated space. The basis of payment will allow for new costs of processing. Finally, and most important, the same volume of nutriment will be made available to the people of Britain in an easily handled and readily storable form. The arrangements made for the meat industry are also a practical, though more complicated, application of the agreed principles, Refrigerated shipping space to the Middle.East will be used for beef for our troops, and that to Great Britain will be used for lamb. The surplus of beef over and above the available shipping space will be canned. The Commonwealth Government will always be in the market for canned beef at prices that will support the stock market. This greatly increased output of canned beef will be shipped to the order of the British Government at prices to be arranged. . The problem of surplus mutton and lamb is more serious and complex. The reduction of the amount of shipping available is much more serious than in respect of beef. No frozen mutton will be exported, but the Commonwealth Government will be always in the market for canned mutton at prices which will support the stock market. This will dispose of large quantities of mutton which would otherwise be on' the fresh meat market. The gap in domestic supplies thus caused will be filled by lamb, which must be consumed in Australia in greater quantities than formerly. This increased consumption will be facilitated by a lower level of lamb prices. The Government will, at the same time, be always a buyer of specified classes of export quality lamb, at prices lower than current contract prices. Such portion of this lamb as can be by the British Government. The portion which cannot be shipped for the time being will be held in store in Australia, and financed jointly by the British and Australian Governments. The net effect of this, scheme will be to support the stock market at a lower level of prices than that to which producers have been accustomed, to make greater quantities of lamb available to the Australian consumers at reduced prices, to ship to Great Britain lamb in frozen form, and mutton in cans the-circumstances will permit. Certainly, totlie f u l l extent of available shipping the stability will in most cases be at a space,' and to hold manageable surpluses lower level of prices, and it may also in Australia on join t account: .

From what source did the Minister obtain the particulars of actual output of the Newnes-Glen Davis shale oil concern which the Minister, in answer to a recent question by the honourable member for Reid, indicated to be 3,500,000 gallons per annum? 2.

Has any agreement yet been executed in respect of tlie extra sums advanced to this concern without parliamentary authority? 0. Have any of the major oil companies acquired an interest in this concern or in the distribution of output; if so, to what extent? Mr .SPENDER -The S u p p l y a n d Development has, supplied the f o l l o w in g answers:1 and 2. The statement that the output of motor spirit at Glen Davis was at the rate of 3,500,000 gallons per annum was based on information, furnished by the company and checked ,by departmental officials. 3. Despite intermittent operation of the refinery, due to difficulties experienced with the -retorts, production is being maintained at the rate of 3,500,000 gallons per annum. If the refinery were able to operate continuously, the maximum output of 10,000,000 gallons per annum could be attained. Petrol is now being pumped from large stocks available at Glen Davis, a distance of 32 miles to Newnes Junction on the western line, from which distribution w ill shortly be made. 4. It is true that large sums of money have been expended at Glen Davis and that under certain circumstances it might have been possible to have saved some of this expenditure, but even though the expenditure has been heavy, it is not considered to ho unduly out of proportion to the magnitude of the undertaking. 5. An agreement covering the additional advances is in course of preparation by the Crown Solicitor, and it is expected to be ready invalid pensions, and petrol ration at an early date for submission to Parliament. 0. No other oil company has any interest in the Glen Davis project, hut distribution of output must bo made through existing distributing channels since the setting up of further distributing facilities would be quite unwarranted. All existing distributing companies w ill share in this. -FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SOLDIERS AND u p o n noticeWhat is tlie total amount expended by the Commonwealth since 1914 in respect of our fighting'services in the Great War of 1914-18 on each of the following:-(a ) war gratuity, (b) war pensions, (c) repatriation benefits, hospital and all similar repatriation payments including educational payments to children of members of the fighting services, (d) war service homes, and (e) any other payments? honourable member's question is as f o l lows :The total amount expended by the Commonwealth to '30th June, 1040, in respect of the war of 1914-1.8 is £875,000,000.
