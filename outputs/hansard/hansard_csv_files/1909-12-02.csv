What a difference is there between the sentiment underlying the utterance of the Leader of the Opposition in reference to a measure which should be regarded as non-party, and the appeal to our broad Christian feeling, made by the honourable member for Darwin! The more responsible members of the Labour party have already admitted that the proposed fleet unit is needed, and have assented to the ratification of the agreement concerning it. Some of them have even had the teraeritv to claim credit' for initiating the proposal, even while they now say that the matter is "" not urgent"" ! If it is not urgent, why is a fleet unit required at all ? Is the proposal merely a peg on which to hang land-tax oratory? Is it merely an adjunct to the party propaganda, or is it required for a practical national purposethe defence of Australia? If this fleet unit is necessary for the safety of our country, the urgency of this proposal must be gauged, not by our individual exigencies, or those of the -parties to which we belong, but by the preparations of foreign powers-ou r possible foes. Applying that test, --'-an honourable members opposite deny that the position is urgent, and that Australia has no time to lose.

If they admit, as in their odd moments of sober reflection they must, the zeal of foreign powers in unceasingly .preparing for the Armageddon that is to come, they must admit that there is no immediate way of providing funds for an Australianfleetunit but that now proposed.

But this is a time of crisis, ancl such times are occasions, not for generalizing, but for action. If honourable members opposite are sincere in 'their patriotic protestations, they must help the Government to raise the necessary money, just as a few weeks ago they seemed ready to endorse a borrowing policy for any unprofitable railway programme that might be put before Parliament. borrowing of mone'y the only thing to be done? can propose any other way of obtaining the necessary funds, let him place it before the House, but let him not do nothing but carp at the Government for its policy. What the Government says, and what we must all admit, is that we have no time to lose, and that, apparently, the only means of obtaining the necessary funds immediately is to borrow. says "" apparently."" have done nothing but sneer since they left the Treasury bench. I ask them to say what other means can be employed? Whilst on this subject, I should like to say that I think that sufficient safeguards have not been provided in the measure to prevent the repetition of borrowing for defence preparations. The proposed loan is to be redeemed in sixteen years by the establishment of a 5 per cent, sinking fund. But, at the end of that time, the fleet will be practically valueless as a fighting unit, and we shall have to replace it, probably with a much larger one, which will mean more borrowing, unless we have made other special provision out of revenue in the meantime. I put this business suggestion before the Government that we should decide, in the first place, what the actual fighting life of the unit will probably be. For the sake of argument, let us take it at ten years. years. opposition to the Admiralty authorities; but in my opinion, these ships will be practically out of date, though not obsolete, in ten years' time. of argument, let us assume that they will have a life of ten years. WeI agree with ought, then, every year to put aside out of revenue one-tenth of the total capital value of the fleet, arid thus provide automatically for the construction, out of revenue, of the fleet which will have to succeed that now proposed. will have to be made in addition to the proposed sinking fund and payment of interest on the proposed loan. fund is only for the redemption of the proposed loan. But long before the end of sixteen years the fleet upon which the money will have been spent will be practically useless, and new ships will have to be provided out of new funds. I propose the establishment of a trust fund, into which money must be paid out of revenue every year. If necessary, we should impose further taxation, to raise the revenue required to do this. Then, when the time comes, we can renew, I hope increase, our fleet without borrowing. Probably the best thing to do would be to open a special trust fund account, crediting to it so much every year. Personally, I should like to see not less than one-tenth of the probable capital value of the new fleet unit paid to the credit of such a fund, automatically every year, in such a manner that the Treasurer of the day could not deal with it. The money should be taken automatically out of the Consolidated Revenue account and paid into the trust fund. I think that a Trust Fund Act will be required, and I hope that although the session is rapidly drawing to a close, the Government will see its way to immediatelv bring down a Bill in order that this Parliament may do something which will show the electors how baseless is the charge that we mean for all time to meet defence expenditure out of .borrowed funds. I believe that every Minister and every honourable member on this side will unite in an effort to demonstrate that we believe that there could be no more suicidal policy than that of paying for national insurance with borrowed money. We only consent to adopt this course at the present juncture because we realize that a great crisis will face our Empire in T9H, that it is essentially necessary to make a start, and that six weeks, let alone six months, may make all the difference between safetv and disaster for AusFor the purposes tralia and the Empire to which we belong.

But do not let him throw himself across the path of progress as a sort of carping critic, pleased with nothing, willing to help in nothing, now that he has lost the opportunity of getting credit for what is done.

Surely we might well allow those to seek greedily for credit who find it most difficult to get credit.

The last' speech has furnished an instance of that. The honourable member insinuated a want of loyalty on the part of those who oppose this measure. Fortunately, the history of the past proves that there is not a scintilla of truth in his allegation. The sons of many men on this side went to South Africa to fight for the Empire.

If any one had suggested a few years ago that the first loin Bill of the Commonwealth would be for the purpose of defence, the suggestion would have ( been scouted on all sides of the Chamber. Of course, there is much to be said in justification for a loan policy for carrying out reproductive works. Some years ago, when a loan policy was proposed for certain reproductive works, I was one of very few who voted in its favour, believing then, as I do now, that there are large national undertakings which can never be entered upon if we have to depend solely on revenue. But to initiate a loan policy for defence is to write history capital at once. with a vengeance! If this measure be passed, and we enter upon, a loan policy for any such purpose, it will be regarded by future historians as a blot on our progress. I cannot believe that the patriotism we hear so much about is mere lip service. I may be wrong, but .1 believe that the property owners and wealthy members of the community generallv have no desire to shirk their responsibility in the matter of defence. If this country has to be defended, it must be by the blood and bone and sinew of the masses. When we have submitted to compulsory service, which has always been regarded with abhorrence by English-speaking people, and thus thrown the bulk of the work on the masses, surely the well-to-do will willingly contribute a fair proportion? well as others, will be compelled lo servethere will be no distinction. to that matter. said that the masses would have to bear the whole burden of defence. the masses would have to bear by far the larger share of the burden. said lhat the masses would have to bear all. torn away from their work in order to serve; and if there were war to-morrow, the greater number of the defenders would be obtained from the masses.

We are led to believe that the primary reason for the introduction of the Bill is a danger which is closer at hand than some probably imagine. But panic legislation is always bad, and should be avoided. There is not the slightest difference of opinion as to the necessity for preparing for an emergency; honourable members, by their support of the Defence Bill, show that they realize that we have for years been living in a fool's parad'se, and neglecting our duty in not establishing a permanent and efficient system of defence. The only difference of opinion now is as to the method by which the necessary money is to be raised. We are told that we cannot afford to wait, but must rush into the London market, and borrow £3,500,000. We must not forget, however, that under the financial agreement with the States, the Commonwealth will be something like £2,500,000 per annum better off than we were under the Braddon section; and as the proposal now before us",17,Forrest

This country is a wealthy one, and I have too high an opinion of the people to think that they would not respond readily to an invitation to contribute their quota. The objection I have is that 75 per cent, of the burden must fall on the masses. This Government, with their majority of ten to fourteen, and practically the whole of the press and other great influences behind am speaking of them, have not the backbone to introduce some other method of taxation in order to meet this cost. There is nothing to justify the borrowing of money for this purpose. Ministers cannot point to any country that has adopted such a policy.

It may be that the Chamber of Commerce has influenced the policy of the Government on this occasion. I do not profess to know. WhatI do know is that this Parliament has hitherto prided itself on the fact that it has existed for nearly ten years, and has not borrowed one penny. What a sad falling off !

Colonel FOXTON -Not necessarily. tleman may be able to convince himself, but were it not for party reasons, as the result of the Fusion, I venture to say that not twenty honourable members on the Ministerial side would support this policy. They can only defend it on grounds of panic. Why cannot they wait until the electors have been consulted, and until we ascertain whether they are patriotic in pocket as well as in sentiment? The cry behind this policy is that the enemy is not wait until the electors have been consulted. We must plunge into the money market, and besmirch the reputation of this Parliament as a non-borrower. We are to start our career of borrowing on the worse line we could have selected.

My regret is that we could not come to a unanimous decision in favour of a scheme financed on sound lines. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane-Honorary Minister) [11.57] -Honorabl e members will naturally expect to hear something from me on this question. I should have risen earlier except that I have been suffering from a severe cold. It was quite impossible for me to speak yesterday, and it may not be possible for me to speak at length this morning. But I feel that it is necessary that I should endeavour, at least, to place before the House my views as having represented Australia at the recent Imperial Conference. Before proceeding to the real question, I should like to make a passing reference to matters which occurred just prior to, and immediately succeeding, my departure to the Old Country. One can easily understand that there appeared to some persons to be an opportunity afforded by my being thousands of miles away to make remarks to my detriment. I was alluded to on more than one occasion in a less than complimentary way who the honourable gentleman was. from the Minister's own side of the House. It is just as well that he should know where the attack came from. Colonel FOXTON I think I know where it came from. I can also well understand that some honourable members were unable to resist the temptation offered by so favorable an opportunity might explain who he is, in answer to the inquiry Colonel FOXTON I hope that honourable members opposite will assist me as much as possible by refraining from interjections, because I cannot raise my voice. In some extraordinary way, my personal views in regard to naval defence have been wonderfully distorted. looked up any of my speeches on this subject, delivered in the Parliament of Queensland or elsewhere, prior to Fedeiation. Buti f any one takes the trouble to do so, he will find that I have from the first consistently supported the payment of a cash subsidy to the Mother Country, but only as a tentative expedient, to be abandoned as soon as it was possible for us to do something in the nature of what is now proposed. That is the full extent of the support which I gave to the subsidy. I also thought that, according both to population and to the proportional amount of our trade as a part of the Empire, we were not paying sufficient, but I always regarded the subsidy as being merely a makeshift. I am glad to think that I have had some hand in bringing about what I hope will prove to be a better state of things. During the whole course of the Conference, the consideration which was shown by the Imperial authorities, especially by the and by every official at the Admiralty, was most gratifying. The offers of Dreadnoughts by New Zealand and Australia had' naturally had a very marked effect not only on members of the Imperial Government and officials, but also on the public at large. No matter how we may disagree as to whether those offers should or should not have been .made, every one will admit .that the spirit-in which they were made was, from our point of view, correct, and that spirit prompted a reciprocal attitude on the part of the people in the Old Country. This rendered the whole Conference most pleasant in every way, and from beginning to end it was really not a question of bargaining, but a. question on either side of, "" How much can we do for you?"" It is unnecessary for me to go over the ground which has already been so ablv traversed by the Prime Minister. I could not do it half as well as he did it. ber could put it so that we could understand it better, at any rate. Colonel FOXTON I think not. At all events, it is unnecessary for me to go over the ground which has to be traversed in advocating this scheme, because, judging by the speeches delivered on both sides, there is practical unanimity as to the ad visableness of carrying out the agreement. majority-practicall y unanimously. I have not Colonel FOXTON I was saying that it was accepted practically unanimously as a very excellent scheme. It is therefore necessary to deal only, as a matter of controversy, with the method by which it is proposed to carry it into effect. Our position at this moment with regard to naval defence is that we pay a subsidy",20,Forrest

Treasurer spoke of our local naval expenditure as £80,000, but I have it in my mind that it is about £70,000, and at the Conference our total expenditure for naval purposes was ' mentioned as £270,000. Prior to the Conference, and during the early stages of the main Conference, it became evident, as it did at the Conference of 1907, that it would benecessary, in considering any scheme of Imperial navai defence, to deal on separate lines with the various Dominions, which were anxious to come in and contribute more largely to the naval defence of the Empire, on account of their different geographical positions, their varying degrees of advancement, their differing populations, and other varying circumstances. third meeting of the Conference, therefore, it became evident that Canada, Australia, and New Zealand would have to be dealt with on different lines, and matters of detail were then referred to the Admiralty, who were requested to deal separately and privately with the representatives of the three Dominions. I have now, of course, to deal, except in a very casual, way, only with those arrangements as they affect Australia. The offer of a Dreadnought by Australia had certainly this advantage in"" the negotiations, that it gave a clue or indication, to the Admiralty as to the extent to which the Commonwealth was prepared to go in augmentation of its existing contribution to Imperial, naval defence. Dreadnought would cost £2,000,000 or so, and that was an indication to the Admiralty that a considerable advance was rontemDlated and desired by us. On the strength of that, and possibly also on the strength of conversations which I had with various memhers of the Board of Admiralty before the Conference and during the first sittings, the Admiraltv prepared suggestions for proposals. They very naturally desired that the proposals should come from the Commonwealth, because they would mean greater burdens to the Commonwealth. But they did not hesitate, on the strength of the offer of a Dreadnought. and the indication thereby conveyed of the extent to which Australia was prepared to Colonel Foxton. go, to make practical suggestions as to the best .means of putting the desire of AusWe tralia into effect. On those suggestions, and after discussion and alteration of them, the final arrangement, which has been made public,' was come to. I need not further The allude to it except to say that, instead of a Dreadnought, it is proposed that we ; should provide an improved Indomitable, known as the Indefatigable type, which will cast about the same, and is practically a cruising Dreadnought. That ship is regarded quite unanimously by the leading officials of the. Admiralty, from the First Lord downwards, as the head and front and principal portion of the unit which it is proposed that Australia should provide for itself. The other vessels, in due proportion as to numbers, are the attributes of that vessel. They are necessary, as being complementary to it, to make up what is understood as the fleet unit, which is to form one-third of the great Eastern fleet of the Empire in the Pacific, consistAt about the ing of thirty-nine vessels. The great object attained, from our point of view, by the establishment of such a unit, is that we shall have within it practically every hranch of specialized work which is to be found in the British Navy itself. It will be, so to speak, a segment of the British Navy, and it will not be necessary to go outside of it to obtain every class of training which is to be found in the Royal Navy itself. In it we shall have the training which is to be obtained on the Indomitable, exactly similar to that on the Dreadnought or any other battleship; we shall have the Bristol cruisers, the destroyers, the submarines, and, of course, our torpedo boats, as we have them here at present, and as they may be improved. WA shall have every type of vessel and class of training, and the unit will be, in the opinion of the Admiralty, large enough to afford sufficient attraction to men to go into it and adopt the naval profession as a life's career. This would not be the case if we had only a small number of vessels, or even a large number of small vessels. Tn the negotiations t.nd conversations which I had with the First Lord of the Admiralty, it very soon became a question of ways and means. He realised that it would he scarcely reasonable, at. all events for the present, to ask that Australia should take upon -itself thp whole additional burden which would be incurred in the construction, maintenance, management, and direction of the whole of the fleet unit in peace time, amounting, including sinking this: That an estimate should be made of fund and interest on cost of constructhe annual cost of this fleet unit, including tion, to about £750,000 a year, or a con. interest and sinking fund. siderable advance on our present, annual members should always bear in mind that commitment of £270,000 for naval de*be £750,000 a year includes interest and fence purposes.

But what is the use of talking like that if we do not convert those resources into that which will enable us to do something when the emergency arises? It is idle to talk up to the last minute.

In that connection I would point out that renewals will necessarily be required at varying periods, because the lives of the smaller vessels are not as long as those of the larger ones. ence is as to the source of revenue to meet the interest charges. Colonel FOXTON -The money will come out of the consolidated revenue. day from Customs and Excise taxation. Colonel FOXTON -That is one point of view, but let me deal with another. I have explained that we are to receive, by the handsome and voluntary offer of the Mother Country, £250,000 a year as long as we choose to accept it. ing the position of to-day. Colonel choose to receive that amount for fifteen years, the money so obtained will approximately cover the interest and sinking fund, and will practically pay for all our vessels. In other words, interest and sinking fund will practically be provided for by the contribution of £250,000 per annum, which the Mother Country is going to make to us. Mr J. H . CATTS -There is no Australian Navy about that. tism. Colonel FOXTON I think that there is patriotism in it, because the Mother Country can well afford to pay us that £250,000 a year. Why? Because after paying it she will still be saving £400,000 a year, besides encouraging us to build our own navy, find our own footing, and, a few years hence, become a greater buttress to her than we have ever been. practically, to have doubled our navy. Colonel FOXTON -Yes. Under this scheme, not only shall we save the Mother Country at least £350,000 or £400,000 a year, but we shall also assume an, additional burden of £230,000 a year ourselves, thus completely reversing the position as it exists to-day. I think that that is patriotic. At all events, whatever honourable members opposite may think, we are certainly regarded on the other side of the world as doing the handsome thing. There, those who are best able to judge think that in what we propose to do we give evidence that we are not lacking in Imperial spirit. The £250,000 a year contributed by the Mother Country will-takin g 4 per cent, as a basis, instead of the 5 per cent., which we propose-jus t about provide interest and sinking fund on the capital cost of the vessels. Personally, I think that, it would have been a very excellent thing if New Zealand, instead of contributing an increased naval subsidy under the existing agreement, and providing for the gift of an Indomitable, had thrown in her lot with Australia for the establishment of what would have been an Australasian unit, perhaps of' larger size even than that whicb we now propose to establish. In this connection, it is rather curious to note that New Zealand will, I assume, have to borrow the money with which to pay for the Indomitable which she is presenting to the Mother Country, and which will be the cost New Zealand about £150,000 a year for about eighteen years. To' that £150,000 must be added the £100,000 which she will pay as subsidy to the Imperial Fleet. Assuming that she raises the money and pays it off gradually over a period of fifteen or eighteen years, New Zealand will pay the Mother Country exactly the sum which the Mother Country will pay to Australia by way of subsidy. business men. Colonel FOXTON -On e does not care to comment on what is being done by the Dominion. But that £250,000 annually will, in a sense, be practically applied to pay for our ships. ness for New Zealand* Colonel FOXTON -It may or may not be. The question has been raised as to when it will be necessary for the money to be paid to the contractors in connection with the building of the ships. I think we all recognise that it is necessary to proceed with their construction at once. The Admiralty are prepared to superintend, their construction through contractors in exactly the same way as they would do if the vessels formed part of the British Navy itself.

123,Mr King O'malley,"It is bad busiwhole of the work done in connection with the central administration of the Admiralty will be done quite gratuitously. BeforeI left England, I ' ascertained that it is the practice of the Admiralty, as the building of a battleship proceeds, to make about one hundred separate payments, so that if the construction of a vessel occupied two ancl a-half years, there would be on an average a weekly payment. But I also understand that it is possible to arrange for the payments to be made by five instalments extending over lhat period. If we adopt the latter plan, we shall undoubtedly have to pay an additional price. In my judgment, it is far better for us to face our interest bill in a business-like way, week or ten days ago. The greater porwith a view to making the capital cost of the ships as low as possible. If we follow the practice of the Admiralty we shall require to find, during the first six months that the vessels are building-that is, between February of next year and the following August-somethin g like £500,000, or possibly a sum which would represent one-fifth of the total expenditure. Honourable members will recognise the necessity for having that money if we are going to proceed with the construction of these vessels at all. That is all that I have to say oh the subject. I have not endeavoured to do more than give a business-like exposition of the position as it presented itself to me at the Imperial Conference. I sincerely hope that the results of that Conference will not be barren. From my point of view, this is practically the only way in which we can finance the scheme at the present time. I feel very certain that to the great body of the public it will be a' disappointment if anything is permitted to interfere with the adoption of this scheme. whether the scheme will be endorsed by the country. Colonel FOXTON -A t all events, it has been unanimously accepted by this House. Mr J. H . CATTS -What, the borrowing scheme ? Colonel FOXTON I am not speaking of the borrowing scheme,' but of the naval scheme. It will be a disappointment to the general public, and to a majority of honourable members, if we are precluded from proceeding with that scheme at once. As far as I can see, this is the only practical way in which it can be proceeded with. Further, our failurs to proceed with it will be a grievous disappointment to those in the Mother Country who are looking to its accomplishment, and I think that we owe something to them. They regard it as essential that the scheme should be carried out at once. The Admiralty authorties areabout to proceed immediately with the construction of their two fleet units in connection with the Eastern Fleet, and it will not be to the credit of Australia if we fail 1 to do our share in that great scheme. to be regretted that in the closing hours of the session so much time should have been occupied in discussing a proposal which was practically unanimously agreed to a tion of this debate has been occupied by Ministerial supporters in dealing with the scheme itself, which, as the Prime Minister has already pointed out, was unanimously agreed to some ten days ago. Consequently, there was no need to discuss it at all. Of course, these remarks do not apply to the Honorary Minister. I think that he was fairly entitled, as our representative at the Imperial Conference, to place before us his own views on the subject. I only regret that out of the Ministerial party of forty he was never favoured with the presence of more than a dozen listeners'.

At one period during that discussion, only ten Ministerial supporters were present. Of course, they have to Jo as ""they are told, but they might have paid the Honorary Minister, who was our representative at the Imperial Conference, the compliment of listening to him. I make no complaint about the Ministers having occupied any time to-day. He was entitled jto put his views before us.

129,Mr Wise,"The Opposition are notwe now have to consider is whether the proper method of raising this money is by loan. Had the debate been confined to that, it would have terminated last night. I regret that when we are about to start to build an Australian Navy we should have recourse to raising the necessary funds by loan. I was glad to hear the Honorary Minister frankly acknowledge that Great Britain was going to pay for this fleet. I think that in accepting their money we are adopting a very extraordinary method of taking upon ourselves our full share of Imperial responsibility in the matter of defence. The Treasurer stated that this proposal to strengthen the Fleet of the Empire was one which recognised to the full our Imperial responsibilities. But how are we recognising them ? We are asking the Mother Country to pay for the vessels of the Australian unit. The Treasurer has himself pointed out that, under this agreement, we shall get £250,000 a year from the Mother Country, in addition to which we shall be relieved of the payment of the naval subsidy of £200,000 annually for the future. That makes a total of £450,000 a year, so that, in reality, we shall be getting from the Imperial authorities more than sufficient to pay interest and provide a sinking fund upon the proposed loan. In, other words, the Mother Country is going to pay for the ships to which we proudly point as our contribution towards Imperial defence Sir member misunderstood me. Minister made a similar statement. He by cablegram, what amount would be redid not attempt to coverit up, because he quired, and surely have enough ability to knew that he could not. He frankly propound a scheme of direct taxation to obstated the position. scheme would cost us £350,000 per annum sponsible government, and they are supmore than we pay now. in his figures for both the £250,000 and cause we have seen their supporters voting £200,000; he said that the cost of the for measures to which they had declared scheme was £785,000 a year. He addedthemselves opposed. Any proposal which When the annual Imperial contribution of would therefore be adopted, and could be £250,000 a year is allowed for, it would be seen that the amount the fleet unit would cost brought into operation before the end ot us was £531,000 a year, and allowing for the next year. If £500,000 is required at present contribution of £200,000 a year, it meant once, it could easily be financed, but, ac£335,000 a year more than was paid at present. cording to the Honorary Minister, the first Sitting suspended from 1 io 2.15 p.m. instalment will not have to be paid until state of the House. [Quorum formed.] it cannot be rightly contended that in the from the Prime Minister down, have proposal before the House we are recognising to the full our Imperial responsibilities, seeing that, as the Honorary Alinister has pointed out, the British Government is to contribute towards the upkeep of theproposed fleet £250,000 a year, which will more than pay interest and the contribution to thesinking fund. In my opinion, our people, as Australians, and as members of the British Empire, are enthusiastic patriots, and quite ready to provide for a fleet at their own expense. I have arrived at that conclusion from the expressions of opinion which I have heard in travelling through the country. During the last three years, and at the time of the last election, whenever I advocated provision for defence being made solely by direct taxation on all kinds of wealth, no one objected to the suggestion, and on one occasion, to my intense surprise, half-adozen very Conservative land-holders said that they would be prepared to pay a land tax if the proceeds were to be devoted wholly to defence purposes. Personally, I cannot see why other sources of wealth as well as land should not be taxed. I advocate direct taxation on all forms of wealth for defence purposes. The wealth of Australia is estimated at £1,200,000,000, and its oversea trade at from £100,000,000 to '£120,000,000. We should therefore be able to provide by direct taxation on that wealth for its defence, as well as for the JOHN FORREST -The honourable defence of Our lives and institutions. There is no need for a loan. Ministers tell us that only £500,000 will be needed next tain the necessary funds.

134,"Mr Wise,","As I have already said, All the speakers on the Government side,apologized for this proposal. The honourable member for Wentworth hoped that the loan would not form a precedent, and the 'Honorary Minister said that it should not do so. But once a thing is done it is easy to make it a precedent. The Prime Minister said that, in his opinion, we should ontribute more than 5 per cent, to a sinking fund. It is rather singular that the Original proposal of the Government, as ihown by the Bill, was for a sinking fund of 4 per cent. Ministers must have changed their minds in regard to this matter between the printing of the Bill and its introduction. According to my calculations, it will require £298,000 to provide interest and a sinking fund of 5 per cent., though that leaves the statement of the Honorary Minister, that the British Government is virtually finding the money for ""a fleet, practically correct. I do not think that the Commonwealth is likely to contribute more than 5 per cent, to the proposed sinking fund unless its taxation is increased. In view of the payment which must be made annually to the St> theates Commonwealth will have difficulty in arranging for its lordinary needs out of its share of the Customs and Excise revenue. I protest against the borrowing of money for naval defence. In my opinion, there is ample time to raise what we want in some other way. It is lamentable that it should be proposed to put a seventh Australian Government borrower upon the London money market. Federation was to substitute one national borrower for the six State borrowers; but now it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall borrow £3,500,000 for a purpose which will not be reproductive-the object of our expenditure will, as a matter of fact, quicklv deteriorate in value-and there will still be the State borrowing. There is another reason for humiliation in connection with the proposal. It has always been the boast of the Treasurer, amongst others, that the Commonwealth could borrow at a much lower rate of interest than is paid by the States; but the amount of interest provided for in the Bill is that at which the States are now borrowing, namely, 3 per cent., 1 an acknowledgment that we cannot borrow any more cheaply than the States. According to the Honorary Minister, the Admiralty reckons eighteen years as the life of a warship, and writes off enough each year to wipe out its cost within that time; but he went on to say that the improvement in engines of warfare is so rapid that it is Mr Wise. impossible to more than estimate the life of a war vessel. If we can judge by what has taken place in the past, our fleet will be obsolete within ten years, and it is admitted that the smaller vessels, which are to cost £1,500,000, will have a still shorter life than the large vessels. It is practically certain that the Navy will be obsolete some years before the loan is paid off, a position which we cannot regard with pride or pleasure. When told that no country except Germany has borrowed to build a navy, the Honorary Minister mentioned New Zealand. As a matter of fact, New Zealand has not taken this retrograde course. Canada, we have been informed, is .prepared to put aside this year out of revenue £600,000 for the construction of war vessels. Had our finances been properly arranged, we could have easily raised £500,000 for this purpose. As I have said, the people would, frpm patriotic motives, agree without murmuring to direct taxation for defence. The measure is crudely drawn, and seems to have been prepared in haste. There are several provisions to which I shall refer in detail when we get to the Committee stage. The Bill is not such as we might reasonably have expected, seeing that it is the first of its kind. Arrangements should have been made for the appointment of trustees to manage the proposed sinking fund. No time has been fixed for the redemption of the loan ; and there is rather a peculiar One of the objects of provision in clause 8, which leaves it entirely to the Treasurer for the time being to decide when there has been sufficient money paid into the sinking fund. The Treasurer can vary his opinion to suit the occasion; and probably, if he strikes a bad year, he will decide that, it is wise to utilize the money that would otherwise be paid into the fund. The whole proposal seems to have been rushed, and placed before us in a crude way, without adequate provision for a sinking fund, the investment and management of which should be placed in the hands of trustees. With such a provision, we should have had a little more hope of the loan being paid off in the quickest possible time. I am enthusiastically in favour of the defence scheme; indeed, as the Prime Minister said, the House in this regard is practically unanimous. The only difference of opinion is as to whether or not the money should be raised by loan; and, in my opinion, such a method is wrong and unnecessary, and could have been avoided. [2.32] -Defenc e and finance are subjects in which I have always taken a good deal of interest, an interest which is enhanced on the present occasion. that we are near the end of the session, I anticipate that the debate will be brought to a close without that consideration which so far-reaching a policy as that proposed necessitates. There seems to be no division of opinion as between the Government and the Opposition as to the desirability of providing an Australian Navy. The Labour party, when in office, proposed that we should have a navy c-f our own, and we have heard something to that effect also from a prior Government. We now have the proposal of .the present Government, which, in regard to the class of vessel, only differs from that of the Fisher Government. When the policy of the Fisher Government was launched, the Admiral of the Fleet in Australia bent himself double in admiration of it ; and he is quite as much in favour of the present proposal; indeed, there has never been a scheme for an Australian Navy that has not met with the general approval of the Admiralty, as voiced by the Admiral here. The question now, therefore, is really one of ways and means; and I may say that, as to the scheme in its entirety, I disagree with it, because I regard it as contrary to the principle that was laid down by the States in conference before Federation was established. That principle was begun and continued for a number of years, until the policy of the Fisher Government was enunciated in Queensland. i86r Sir Henry Parkes proposed that there should be an Australian Navy, but, as he grew in experience, he abandoned that idea and favoured the policy of a squadron provided and maintained by the British Government, the people of Australia paying a subsidy in consideration of the squadron being added to and kept efficient. Under that plan, we could not be burdened by ships ineffective for defence-by ships which are known in the navy as vessels for showing the flag. It was not until 1886, when Admiral Tryon came to Australia, and advocated an Australian navy, that any serious attention was given to the question by the people of this country. The Admiral's suggestion was not taken up with any enthusiasm, but the ultimate result was the establishment of an auxiliary squadron, for which Australia paid a subsidy of £126,000 a year. That plan was continued until Sir Edmund Barton, during the Coronation ceremonies in London, met Mr Chamberlain and the Lords of the Admiralty, who propounded a scheme, Considering under which the vessels of the Australian squadron might, at the will of the Home authorities, be removed from Australia. That was a reversal of the principle that the Australian auxiliary ships should not be removed from these shores; but such was the step taken by the Barton Government, of which the present Prime Minister was a member. Sir Edmund Barton strongly urged! the necessity of such a provision in the agreement, and quoted authorities which proved up to the hilt that in naval warfare-and he went as far back as Nelson-the traditional policy of Great Britain had ever been to seek the enemy in the enemy's waters. However, I merely refer to that in passing, in order to show that the present Government have gone back on the policy of Sir Edmund Barton. While in some respects the proposals before us may be said to be a contiunation of the previous policy, they are a reversal in regard to the power to remove ships from these shores. The Naval Agreement, which came into existence in 1903, at the instigation of Sir Edmund Barton, provided for vessels very similar to those we are to have under the proposed agreement. All the conditions for which the present Government take so much credit are, almost in every line and feature, identical with those already in operation, in regard to the manning of the ships, the ships themselves, and the expenAs far back as diture in Australia. We are to have one armoured cruiser, as under the old agreement; we are to have three unarmoured vessels of the Bristol type, as against two second-class cruisers; there are to be six destroyers, as compared with four cruisers of the third-class; and there are to be three submarines of the C class, as compared with four sloops. Under the proposed .arrangement there are to be thirteen vessels as compared with eleven under the old agreement, which, I may say, will continue for a couple of years longer. Of the eleven ships, however, four of them were to be practically unfit for service, one to be held in reserve and three of them to be unmanned. We are told by the Honorary Minister that the proposed force is to be infinitely greater than the old, so that there would seem to be no limit and, notwithstanding this, we are further told that the new unit is to cost less.

Under the Barton Naval Agreement, we said that the ships must be manned by Australians, and that the money for their upkeep should be expended, as far as possible, in Australia. The Admiralty promptly replied, "" Very well. that as far as possible the vessels of the new squadron should be built in Australia, the Admiralty would say "" Very well, we shall do our best to give effect to your desire."" stipulation merely to assist the Mother Country, and quite apart from any question of trade. The adoption of such a course would mean the creation of a new national outpost dock, large enough for all emergencies. Under this agreement the Admiralty say that all the docks in Australia are to be taken over by the Commonwealth, so that we shall become possessed of Garden Island. As the honourable member for Dalley has said, we ought to have told the Admiralty that, in our opinion, every small ship, and, indeed, every large vessel of the fleet should be built in Australia. Let us take up a national responsibility. In Great Britain there are many large shipbuilding firms who would readily establish branches here if they were told "" There is trade in Australia."" If there were in the agreement a provision that the vessels of the new fleet should be built here, they ment would find the money at 3 per cent., and spend it here. a number of these vessels in Australia. After all, this is the policy of the Free Trader. that I advocate. The policy of the Free Trader is to make locally every!hing that can profitably, be made locally, and I hold that we could build warships in Australia. The demand, once created, will be met. These vessels will have to be renewed from time to time, and Great Britain would take away the worthless ones, as she has done before. She is constantly "" scrapping."" In a few days one of the largest vessels on the Australian station will be sent away, and will be replaced, probably, by a more powerful one. Great Britain sent us more powerful ships than she engaged to do under the existing agreement. the vessels would ultimately have to be "" scrapped."" to the Conference of 1886 agreed that AusI f we stipulated tralia should become responsible for the payment of £126,000 per annum in respect of interest and sinking fund charges on the cost of the Auxiliary Squadron. In that case, Great Britain found the money for the construction of the 1 vessels, and we provided for the interest and sinking fund. That is what we ought to do now. Great Britain can borrow at 3 per cent., and "" scrap "" and maintain with a 4 per cent, sinking fund. We cannot do so. The Treasurer says that a 5 per cent, payment to the sinking fund will be sufficient, but any one who has looked into the matter will agree that it will require nothing less than a 10 per cent, contribution to maintain an effective naval squadron in Australian waters.

153,Mr Henry Willis,"The delegatesof a speech made by Sir Edmund Barton in connection with the agreement that he asked this Parliament to accept. figures of speech which the Prime Minister used were employed then by Sir Edmund Barton. He said that the new ships would be able to blow the auxiliary squadron out of the water. That is what Sir Edmund Barton said in comparing the present ships with the former squadron. The Prime Minister always speaks well, but his speech was a re-hash of that delivered'by Sir Edmund Barton in moving for the acceptance of the naval agreement. Sir Edmund Barton moved on that occasion with much trepidation. He could not trust the Opposition, and feared that his proposal would not be carried. He found, however, that we were as one man in favour of naval defence, as is this Opposition. The Government have nothing to fear in regard to defence proposals. When the Fisher Government announced its defence policy, it made a master stroke. Those who were members of that Government are as well able as others to read human nature. They knew that their scheme would receive the imprimatur of the Commonw-ealth. Let me now say a word or two regarding the question of cost. The Government will not be able to find the money which is needed to successfully finance this naval scheme. The expenditure on old-age pensions, to say nothing of that on invalid pensions, which Ministers must provide for if the Government are to continue in existence, will be £1,000,000 more than it is now. The expenditure on military de'fence will be from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 more than it is now, and the expenditure on naval defence will be, say, £800,000. gives a total of approximately £3,300,000; while, under the financial agreement the revenue will be £2,273,000, showing that the Government will be short of £1,000,000 per annum on the present income. dent that it is so. If the Minister is correct and a deficiency which will continue over in his forecast, the deficiencv should be reduced by £500,000. The Government has been hoist with its own petard. Ministers adopted the proposals of the Opposition in regard to miiitarv and naval defence. T admit that the Prime Minister was formerly in favour of this course, but I was not. I favour the variation which T have explained, and which the Lords of the Admiralty were willing to continue. However, the party closed its ranks. It said, ' We will sink our differ1 The ences and arrange for an Australian navy, borrowing the money."" But they made their calculations without consulting the Treasurer. In big things the right honourable member for Swan is a big man, though in small things he is a failure. His water supply scheme will keep his memory green when some of us are dead and forgotten politically. Had he been consulted, he would have told the members of the party that they were on the wrong track. He would have said, "" Continue what the Premiers did in 1886. Then we shall be able to manage."" member voted for an arrangement for a term of vears. other shuffle of the cards with regard to the financial agreement referred to. I have on record a scheme which I could not get adopted, but if there were another shuffle of the cards, the public might accept it. . In that event justice could be done to the great State of New South Wales, whose interests I am proud to represent. The Treasurer will be able to tell us fairly enough next year that the Government will be £1,000,000 short. No doubt they think that many things will happen before then. They are reciprocating the action of the Fisher Government in throwing on their successors the responsibility of finding £1,000,000. It is the kind of , reciprocity which means financial ruin, and is sure to kill the Government in the end. They have still a deficiency of £1,000,000 to face. cn tea and kerosene. that proposal up their sleeve. No doubt in that way they could raise a large sum. But such a thing would not be popular. Nor will taxation on property generally, or on landed property, be popular. Ministers are face to face with financial confusion, a.number of years. They have shown us how they handle millions. The sum of £600,000 is to be given to them by the States, to meet the present deficiency. Then they will take a mortgage on the revenue that will be in their hands.

' I regard the Bill before us as representing the first fruits of thefinancial agreement entered into with the States. I recollect with pleasure the time when the view was held that the Commonwealth Government should be a pattern to the State Governments. It was felt that, though the time might come when it would be absolutely necessary to borrow for reproductive works, there had been too much borrowing in the past, and, with the full approval, I believe, of Australia, it was resolved that the bad example of the States should not be fol1 lowed. When the financial agreement was l:efore us I could see that the result would be, not only to leg-rope or hobble the Commonwealth, but also to leg-rope or hobble the Government-that if the agreement were adopted it would be impossible at present, and still more in the future, to finance the Commonwealth without resorting to loans. The Government are crippled now, and, unless Providence intervenes, they must in the near future be slaughtered. We were told that the financial agreement would mean a gift to the Commonwealth from the States of £600,000, and we were further told by the Treasurer shall save £2,500,000. No one knows better than, the Treasurer that, in view of the requirements of the Commonwealth, the necessity for a different kind of agreement with the States could have the honourable been demonstrated to the people at the next election. The honourable member for Robertson, who gives more thought anc"" study to these questions than most of us, and to whom I always listen with great pleasure, has pointed out some of the financial difficulties with which the Government have to cope; and I ask the Treasurer, where is the necessity to borrow In a young £3,500,000, in view of the saving under the financial agreement, and also under the new naval arrangement? member has evidently not studied the balance-sheet! balance-sheet, and I know that it shows a deficit of £1,200,000 to-day.

We have only the Treasurer's statement', and the documents laid before us, to guide us as to thefinancialposition cf the Commonwealth; but we all know that this saving of £2,500,000 must be a decreasing one, owing to the fact that, with the addition of every unit to the population, there must be a payment of 25s. to the States.

I agree with the honourable member for Robertson and others that if the question could be submitted, untrammelled by party ties or considerations, to the people, in a direct form, such as-""Are you in favour of defending Australia by means of contributions by yourselves, or do you favour borrowing money to meet the .cost, and leaving posterity to pay for it?""-ther e would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the first course. be a fair way to put it, unless it was intimated that it was intended to impose direct taxation. tralia knows that expenditure means taxation of some ikind. It would, therefore, have been fair to ask the people, ""Are you in favour of borrowing money for this non-productive work, or. do you favour some form of taxation to meet the necessary expenditure? "" The Treasurer spoke of defence expenditure as a form of insurance. It certainly is an insurance, being a protection for the lives and property of Australia; but what property-holder would dream cf borrowing money for the insurance of his property? Every man would so arrange his affairs that his property or business would find the amount necessary to pay the insurance upon it. In the first place, there is no necessity for the Government to resort to a loan, and in the second place, the fact that they have entered into an agreement, with the State Premiers which, by their own showing, will give them command within this period of about £7,500,000, which otherwise they could not have handled, intensifies and supports my argument that the scheme ought to be financed out of revenue. A few words in conclusion in regard to the two systems, and we must not forget that this question will be put to the people at the election. The Fisher Government submitted to the public a proposal which I know met the views of every member of the old party with which I wasassociated. It was that the navy should My contention must be be an Australian Navy, for the Australian people, financed with Australian, monev, and under Australian control. But is tin's, to be our navy at all?

That, absolutely puts us in the position of getting, not an Australian Navy o at all. but' a navy ""supplied by the money of the Old Country, to be placed and kept under the control of the British Admiralty, against the wishes of Australia. Colonel FoxrpN -No; that is utterly at variance with the fact. It is to beabsolutely under the control of the Commonwealth. quibbling about words? Of what value to us is the control of the Navv in time of peace ? The whole value of the control! is in time of war, when we want the ships, to defend Australia. Colonel FOXTON -We can keep it inAustralian waters in time of war.

The Government might consider, even now, whether it would not be well'to withdraw the Bill and let the people consider it. Let the people weigh the whole consequences to them of the Commonwealth embarking on a loan policy. This will form a precedent, and we do not know where it will stop. If the people consider the whole issue from every point of view, then whatever Government is in power after the election will be armed a hundredfold, because they will know what the wishes of the people are. There has been no mandate on this question. The only issue ever submitted to the people in regard to naval defence was that submitted by the Fisher Government. The people approved of that, but the present Government have no mandate for entering upon a borrowing policy. The last Government did not propose to borrow. Through their Prime Minister they told the people throughout Australia-and the people approved of it-that the Australian Navy which was to be built was to be financed out of revenue, and that the necessary money was to be obtained by way of taxation. on a class. the protection of property as well as of lives, those who possess the most property ought to pay the most-towards the cost of defence.

I have always been opposed in the State as well as in the Commonwealth Parliament to an extravagant system of borrowing, and I am very sorry that we are now creating in the Commonwealth Parliament a precedent which will no doubt be followed in the future, against the real interests of the people. I only hope that at the last moment common sense will prevail and that either the Government will withdraw the measure or the representatives of the people in this Chamber will be patriotic enough to throw it out and leave the question to be submitted to the people. I had not intended to address myself to this question, because of my anxiety to see the business of the session dealt with as soon as possible; but in view of speeches made by honourable members opposite, I feel it necessary to state the other side. remarks that have just been made by the honourable member for Riverina. I entered this Parliament absolutely pledged to oppose a borrowing policy, for I did not believe it wise to create in Australia a seventh borrowing power. It was said that, in all human probability, there would be a limitation of State borrowing; but that prophesy has not been fulfilled, and to-day we are called upon to launch a new form of indebtedness on the part of the Commonwealth. Whatever may have 1 been my position two or three years ago in regard to a Commonwealth borrowing policy, we must all recognise that circumstances alter cases. I have closely watched the financial drift of the Commonwealth that has been going on for some time, and no one can say that it has been the fault of honourable members on this side of the House. The nation's necessities have become more acute than they were a year I think that in or two ago. At any time, there may be a disruption in Europe, and it is necessary that we should make provision for our defence. Of late years the expenditure of the Commonwealth has been enormously increased.

The total expenditure of the Departments that we took over at the inception of Federation was £2,900,000. What is it to-day 5 It has grown to such an extent that it is utterly impossible for us to provide for this naval unit out of revenue. The time is not inopportune for the Government proposals.

WhilstI am prepared to support this BillI have no doubt that, should I return after the next general election to this exceedingly pleasant place-the most magnificent club in the world-m y voice will be heard in opposition to. borrowing unless for reproductive purposes that commend themselves to my business mind. It is said that it is difficult for a member of Parliament to change his views, and I wish it to be understood that I have not changed mine in regard to the undesirableness of creating a seventh borrowing power in this community. But in the life of a nation from time to time special necessities arise, and in the present circumstances I shall have pleasure in supporting this Bill. not know whether there is one honourable member of the Fusion party who has not changed his opinions. The latest to speak from the Government side of the House has openly confessed that, although he intends to support this Bill, he declared at the last general election that he was opposed to borrowing. A noteworthy feature of this debate is the scanty attention that has been given to the provisions, of the Bill itself. The Government seem to get their measures passed either by resorting to coercion or by putting up some honourable members to draw a red herring across the path and to cloud the actual issues involved. During this debate we have had the sectarian question raised, we have had the whole history of these naval proposals discussed, and hours have been devoted to the consideration of matters concerning which there is no division of opinion. There has been little or no justification for the Bill under which it is proposed to do something which I never thought the Government would dare to do. This measure will degrade, the national life of Australia. It will be remembered that not long since honourable members opposite were opposed to the creation of an Australian Navy as proposed by the honourable member for South Sydney; yet we now find them supporting that proposal. Ministerialists present. 1 think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.] say, but I wish to draw attention to matters which might be passed over altogether were it not for some of the speeches from this side of the chamber. I do not find fault with those who have been converted to a different way of thinking, because the change in their case is due to conviction. This is not the first occasion on which proposals first brought forward , at Labour Conferences have become live issues in practical politics. To two or three members of the Labour party must credit be paid for the adoption of the principle of military training. I am pleased to find Labour proposals being adopted. No doubt honourable members who have changed their views in regard to these subjects did so because they gave attention to matters which they had not previously considered. The breaking of pledges is a very different thing. For nine years the Commonwealth has set itself against borrowing, and should not change its policy until ah appeal has been made to the people. The Treasurer spoke mainly about naval defence, saying little as regards the Bill itself. What we need is a justification for the proposal to borrow to build a navy. No one has given that. We have heard a great deal about the desirability of naval defence, and the omission to justify the proposal to borrow leads me to believe that something has been hidden. I think that the honourable member for Indi let the cat out of the bag when he said that this proposal is being made to avoid the necessity for direct taxation. I am not surprised at what the honourable member said, but I was surprised to hear a politician of the experience which the Treasurer possesses say that we should borrow to build a navy because that is practically a reproductive work. By the same process of reasoning war, with all its horrors and losses, could also be regarded as reproductive. That is quite a new theory. The South Afrian war, which enabled the mine-owners of that country to bring in yellow men to work their properties, involved Great Britain in a debt of over £200,000,000.

Fisher Government proposed making a know, there is no provision for adding to commencement with the navy, and the the proposed fleet or replacing vessels; and people gave evidence of their readiness to it surely cannot be understood that the preassume these responsibilities. The honorsent proposals represent all that is to be Mr Spence. It is admitted that only £500,000 The Prime Minister said son for the Bill, that the taxation could Australia has advanced So far as we done for the naval defence of Australia. It would appear as though considerable influence had been exercised by money lenders, who see a splendid chance for advancing money to be spent on ships built by their friends. failed to face the situation or to show any necessity for borrowing; they have succeeded only in degrading Australian nationhood, and advertising to the world that we are a helpless lot of people. poor sort of story to go home to the Old Country, where the navy is provided out of revenue. Comparatively recently, the New South Wales Government abolished the income tax, which would have practically raised that State's share of the cost of the proposed navy. without any request from the well-to-do taxpayers; and we know that in Great Britain this is the source which is always tapped when money is scarce for the navy. But apparently we can expect nothing from this helpless Fusion Government, who put up supporters to delay business until pressure is brought on others to cause them to vote against their convictions. The measure under discussion is a mere fooling of the country, and it initiates the bad policy of adopting the line of least resistance. We have not heard where the ships are to be built or by whom, and, as I have already suggested, the capitalists and their friends see a good, opportunity for profit. I suppose it is of no use making any suggestion to the Government, though I may say that the Labour Government would have carried out the work without borrowing. The sum required is not large, and no need has been proved for any haste in the building of the .ships. own defence, it is time we considered the advisability of starting a war chest. We remember that Germany very wisely put all the money she received as an indemnity from France into a war fund; and some step in that direction would be judicious. It is impossible to impose taxation hurriedly, or to borrow with any advantage when trouble arises, and it is unwise to borrow beforehand and have to pay interest for no return. was utterly astonished when I heard that the Government proposed to borrow money in order to build a navy. In any case, we shall still be dependent on Great Britain for our naval defence. We know from previous experience of the steps taken by the Government tq secure, a majority that this Bill must pass; and we can only enter our protest, and appeal to the people to show their disapproval by casting out the present Administration. desire to say a few words in explanation The Government have utterlyof my position in regard to the proposal before the House. When Sir George Turner introduced a Loan Bill in June, 1902, it was for the purpose of raising money for reproductive works. I voted for that This is a B ill ; and that is one of two votes in this Chamber that I have always regretted. I gave that vote, I may say, against my better judgment, simply on the ground that reproductive works were contemplated, and though I regard it as inexcusable, still, it might be justified on that ground. That tax was abolished The proposal before us, however, is on quite a different plane, because defence works should always be paid out of revenue. In Great Britain, £60,000,000 odd is voted for defence purposes, and £28,000,000 for interest on old war loans, or a total of nearly £90,000,000, all out of revenue; and yet we in Australia are asked to resort to a loan for such purposes, although we are always boasting that thisis the richest country in the world. With resources only partially developed, we ought to be able to' provide for all our defence requirements. It is unfortunate that our predecessors in, Australia did not tap some of those resources in a more direct way for the benefit of the community as a whole, instead of allowing them to pass into private hands. However, they were no more far-seeing than we are to-day, if this Parliament accept the present proposal. Had our predecessors in Australia not been very short sighted, they would never have borrowed a single If Australia is to prepare for its 6d. We are told now that we are in a parlous position-so parlous that we cannot defend ourselves without resorting toloan moneys. If the Government cannot devise some means without borrowing or imposing additional taxation on the poorer classes of the community, let them giveplace to a Government who can. We know that taxation will he imposed later on, when the elections are over. Up to the present, the Government have not dared to I touch the question of taxation through theCustoms House-the Tariff question is dead.

221,Mr Bamford,"I will « « th.f .House have ever voted in any other direction than that in which I intend to vote to-day. [4-S5]-I a m i favour of a perfect sysn tem of naval defence for Australia, but I intend to vote against the proposal of the Government to raise a loan for the purpose. Doubtless we shall be told tliat, in voting against the loan, we are voting against naval defence; but it is not so. The money should have been obtained in some other manner. There was no necessity for the immediate collection of £3,500,000. I believe that -there is a possibility of international strife, but I do not believe it will come within the time which some of the alarmists predict. At any rate, L do not think there is any necessity for us to spend £3,500,000 of loan money in the way proposed by the Government This so-called National Government"" might have proposed to borrow £3,000,000 for a navy in such a way that it would be reproductive, although it may seem absurd at first blush to say so. If they borrowed money to establish national ship-yards for the building of a fleet, they would be on safer lines. They tell us that we may be able to build some of the small vessels, but could not possibly build a Dreadnought, because only certain yards in the world can do such work. I do not see the immediate necessity for a Dreadnought, or anything approaching it, and the money could have been well spent in establishing a national yard or yards. In that sense it would be reproductive, because it would establish the shipbuilding industry in our midst. If the Government had made a suggestion of that sort, I could have seen my way to vote for it. But to borrow £3,500,000 from the British money lender, and spend it on the construction of ships in British yards is simply perpetuating the old order of things and piling up debt, with no advantage to Australia either immediate or remote. It seems impossible, however, to bring Australian Governments, State or Commonwealth, to a thorough understanding of the Protectionist policy which the majority of the people of Australia have demanded. The production in our own midst of our own warships is only another form of Protection-, and we should be establishing the soundest possible system of defence if we could make ourselves self-contained; but we are far from that at present. The fact that we are making no provision for the payment even of the interest on the £3,500,000, much less for paying it off in a short time, does not indicate statesmanship. It is not even the exercise of ordinary common sense; hence I am compelled to vote against the proposition. Many of us may be frightened into accepting it, because of the plea of dire urgency; but I fail to see the question in that light. I am certain that those whom I represent are in accord with me on the question. The vast majority of my constituents recognise that no money is ill spent which is spent to advance the interests of Australia. Although many of them are against militarism in a number of its phases, they recognise that defence is necessary; but they also know the possibilities of Australia from a manufacturing stand-point. We shall never have a real National Parliament until our public 'men grasp the necessity for constructing in Australia everything that is essential to Australia, so far as we possibly can. There'are certain things the production of which we could not immediately undertake, and it may be argued that a navy is one of them; but I am not of that opinion. I believe that if the manufacture of iron had been made a national undertaking for national necessities, the money that is being spent now to foster that industry would have been beneficial to the country. The same applies to our mail service. The last Deakin Government had an opportunity of establishing a national line of mail steamers, built in national yards; but they would not take it. They are going on the same methods now, and offer us as a palliative the construction of three of the small craft in Australia, in addition to the one which is to be put together here. I may have too high an opinion of the Australian workman, and of thi genius of the Australian professional man, but I believe there is nothing that can be done in other countries that cannot be done here if we obtain the men to do it. I quite admit that it would cost more, because there is in it an element of experiment, and no slight experiment at that; but even if we were only partially successful, we should ultimately secure a higher standard of defence.

I hope that what is done will be that whicli is best for Australia : but I am confident that those who vote for this measure will live to regret their action in both a personal and a political sense. M.r. STORRER (Bass) [5.14] I intend to vote against this Bill, although I do not agree with many of the arguments that have been used in opposition to it, Some honourable members have said that there has been returned to the States, surplus revenue to the extent of nearly £7,000,000, which ought to have been retained by the Commonwealth. I hold that we have to take into consideration the needs of the States as well as of the Commonwealth, for the people of the States are the people of the Commonwealth. The States needed the money ancl the Commonwealth acted wisely in making as large a return as possible to them. The total public indebtedness of Australia is about £260,000,000, ancl of that amount, according to the honourable member for Darwin, £170,000,000 has been expended on reproductive works such as railways. I contend, however, that roads, bridges, waterworks, and other public conveniences, are, in reality, remunerative. Although these works may not be producing a direct return, they give a large indirect return. Witnout them, Australia would be no better off than she was when populated by blackfellows. If we have regard to the value of our railways, roads, streets, bridges, and other public conveniences, we must admit that we are in a very sound position. The business man takes account, not only 4 of the money to his credit in the bank, but also of the value of his stock and of his premises. depreciation. sum annually in keeping our public works in good order, so that they are worth more than they cost. But, to listen to the speeches of some honourable members, one might think that because Australia owes £260,000,000 she is insolvent. Her public works are worth a great deal more than that. The honourable member for Indi, when in Opposition, used to speak of the extravagances of the Commonwealth Government, though he did not mention any individual case. Since he has been supporting a Ministry, he has not had anything to say on this head, and therefore his remarks this afternoon must be taken as an attempt to injure those who supported previous Governments. I am not an apologist for past Administrations, but I contend that they did good work for Australia. It has yet to be shown that money was spent extravagantly by them. The Commonwealth, if it must borrow at all, should borrow for reproductive works. We have spent a large sum out of revenue on such works, and it is only on such works that borrowed money should be spent. Money should not be raised by loan to pay for maintenance. No business man would ask for an overdraft to pay for keeping up his home. He is able to secure credit only byconvincing his banker that he can employ the money in a manner which will return a profit. So the Commonwealth should apply to the money lenders only for loans for reproductive works. I would support such proposals, did I consider them necessary. But I cannot see my way clear to support this proposal. I think that we are inclined to spend extravagantly on defence, only and may regret it in the future. If we follow the example of the nations of the earth, we shall'impoverish our people by our defence expenditure, as they are impoverishing theirs.

This young nation was going verdict, the Government will get the deserts Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [5.32] proposed recently has been certainly characterized by its reactionary tendencies. This proposal to begin borrowing for the purposes of defence is most objectionable and the least justifiable. Whatever might be said for borrowing for reproductive works, which would pay interest and provide a sinking fund from the beginning, nothing can be said for bcrrowng for the purpose of insuring the protection of the trade and commerce of Australia. At the opening of the Imperial Press Conference recently, at which delegates attended from all parts of the Empire, Lord Rosebery asked them in his opening address to take back a message to the people in the Dominions beyond the Seas. He saidTake back to your young Dominions across viding for this further expenditure. the seas this message and this impression-that member that only recently the Minister of some personal duty and responsibility for Defence was talking all over the country national defence rests upon every man and about the necessity of Australia taking a citizen.

It may be that borrowing can be justified for certain purposes that would pay interest from the beginning and provide a sinking fund for renewals. But defence is not such a purMr J. H. Catts. pose. It is purely an insurance of the trade and commerce of Australia upon the waters, and that trade and commerce should be called upon to pay for such insurance. There is not a commercial man in the House who in conducting his own affairs would borrow money for insurance purposes. All the shipping of Australia is insured against damage or loss on the water, but is there one business man in the House who 'would borrow money for the purpose of insuring it? Rather, every business man would make it a charge upon the goodsa present liability which would begin and end with the transaction. But when it comes to doing the business of the country and dealing with the shipping of Australia as a whole, instead of in single shiploads or ton lots, they depart altogether from the wholesome principles upon which their own business success has been founded. In the conduct of their own private affairs they recognise well-established business principles, but in the conduct of the business of We shall find out whether the nation they propose to throw those principles overboard.

245,Mr Webster,"Whil e the honorableColonel FOXTON I think before that time; but I am not quite sure. Mother Country, whose obligations are so much heavier than ours, has never borrowed for defence preparations. The Government does not propose to pay for the naval unit out of revenue, because it knows that that would hasten the day when a land tax would have to be imposed. Ministers tell us that they desire to do many things which will involve the expenditure of large sums. If they are in earnest regarding the development of the Northern Territory, the construction of the Western Australian railway, and many of the other large schemes which have been put before us, they will find it difficult to pay their way, and, no doubt, will again propose to borrow, and to heap a load of debt on the Commonwealth. However, the day seems past for talking seriously on financial and national questions in this Chamber. All that is listened to is pretty sentiment. The Honorary Minister showed the worthlessness of mere verbal patriotism. told us, too, that the £250,000 which Great Britain intends to contribute towards our navy will pay the interest on the proposed loan, and establish a sinking fund which will redeem it within sixteen years. Is that all that we can do for the Mother Country? While we are professing to help her, we are practically letting her : provide a navy 'for us. I do not think it likely that the Treasurer will tell us that the Government does not intend to take the money. As to the proposal to establish a sinking fund, I have seen such funds come to nought under State administration, and have little faith in them. Invariably, when the money is wanted for some other purpose, it is taken by the Treasurer of the day. trols our trust funds. have not prevented the State Treasurers from commandeering trust funds when they needed money. should provide for the appointment of trustees to manage the proposed sinking fund in the interests of the people, if it intends to make honest provision for the redemption of the loan. We have been told that the revenue of the Commonwealth will increase by leaps and bounds. No doubt that would happen if a land tax were imposed which would make available for settlement land which is suitable, and accessible to [243]2 markets. Such a tax would bring about an increase of population, and provide us, not only with revenue to pay for defence preparations, but also with men who could be armed and trained to fight for the country. The Government, however, will not allow a land tax to be imposed to make these things possible. As I said some time ago, the Conservative wing rules the Fusion party. This is really a Conservative Government. Sitting suspended from 6.31 to 7.45 p.m. perpetrating a crime on the people of Australia, and their supporters have abandoned every principle they previously professed. The States have been given a first mortgage on the finances of the Commonwealth; and now the Government desire to mortgage the future of our children. The Minister of Defence, two or three years ago, would have no more thought of supporting a proposal to borrow money for the purposes of defence, naval or military, He than he would have thought of flying. To-day, however, he is quite happy in assisting to make the most serious inroads on what have hitherto been regarded as the fundamentals of Australian finance, Federal or State. The day must come, however, when such conduct will reap its reward. Whether or not that day be near at hand, I am satisfied that when the people realize that this is the beginning of a policy which is most pernicious and must in the end be ruinous, they will take a keen vengeance. Of course I understand that the Government are in a corner. They have made one false start, and like others in their position, they have to continue the wrong-doing. They have handed over to the States revenue that is required for the Commonwealth; and in this they have sacrificed' the constitutional privileges of the Parliament. Absolute control of Commonwealth affairs has been put into the hands of the Premiers of the States; and now the Government find themselves compelled to raise a loan in order to relieve a The Government possible pressure that may follow a change in our present prosperous condition. Throughout the debates honourable members seem to have closed their eyes to the condition of affairs six or seven years ago, when we were suffering all the terrible losses incidental to the severest of droughts.

There has been this evening a running fire of comments and interjections, which are neither creditable to the House, nor conducive to the proper conduct of business. merely to elucidate matters. lengthy speech would throw much more light on the subject now than can be emitted by the few considerations which I propose to put before honourable members. The fact that the proposed expenditure must take place within two or three years makes money an urgent and an immediate requirement. I ask honourable members who object to the proposals of the Government on the score that the expenditure should be provided for by a revised system of taxation or from the present sources of revenue, to remember that they are arguing about something of secondary importance, which is not pertinent to the situation. We need money at once. The last speaker spoke in vigorous terms about going to the Jews. 1 do not know that he is quite fair to them, because they are not the only race which has money to lend. The Commonwealth desires a fleet which will cost £3,500,000, which must be provided within two or three years. How then can we find the money ? Some honourable members have suggested a land tax. The imposition of a land tax is an important question of policy which I do not think will be very readily settled, especially in the circumstances in which the Commonwealth Parliament is placed. We know quite well, as I had occasion to point out recently, that the unwritten understanding is that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, it shall confine itself to indirect taxation. Federations. * wealth has not control of all the revenue derived from indirect taxation. right to tax, as has the Federal power in Canada and the United States. But here as there it is recognised that the Federal power should confine itself to the imposition of indirect taxation. The imposition of a land tax is not a matter to be considered in the last hours of a Parliament. If proposed it would have to be dealt with by a future Parliament. The desire is now ro finance the money at once, and we must either borrow, or at once impose heavy taxation, when we have not the necessary machinery, and when there will be an immense division of public opinion. While we settle these matters the enemy may be upon us. difliculty about an income tax. another branch of direct taxation. We do not desire, especially when there is no immediate necessity, to interfere with the line of taxation which we have left to the States. I hope the day is far off when this Parliament will break through that rule, exceptunder stress of some grave contingency that I hope may not arise. ls considered fair for war purposes. right, but we must consider that the States already levy income taxes which they have made an ordinary source of revenue. When Mr Gladstone introduced the income tax, he said it was a war tax, which would cease as soon as the warlike purposes for which it was imposed had been fulfilled. As a matter of fact, however, the income tax at Home, which at first was a luxury, has become an everyday necessity; and I am sorry to say that the Australian States already use an income tax, not as an emergency tax for extreme occasions, but as a means of income for ordinary purposes. We desire, if possible, to confine the Commonwealth to'indirect taxation. That, I think, has been the understanding all along, and has been one of the great objectives of our Federal arrangements. to by honourable members on this side. able member that that arrangement was arrived at by the people of the country before there were members on that side.

299,Mr Harper,"Quite so; but I amand not as a matter of contract, the Commonwealth Parliament has, on an understanding arrived at, met its necessities out of indirect taxation, leaving direct taxation to the States. I am not saying that we ought to confine ourselves to indirect taxation if the people of Australia ultimately decide to adopt a different principle; but we are now faced with the fact that we require £3,500,000, and require it at once. Any one who considers the present state of the world will admit that the sooner we have an effective navy, and effective means of defence, generally, the better. the £3,500,000 out of extra taxation during the next three years. Would it not very largely interfere with the whole finances of the States and the Commonwealth? It would create a strain which I do not think the people would submit ro for a moment; and if we acted on the suggestion of honourable members opposite, and waited until the money was raised in that way, I am afraid it would mean that we should never have any navy. In any. .private business, if it is desired to make a development, and further capital is required, it is perfectly legitimate to borrow, and repay as quickly as possible. That is a matter of everyday occurrence; and it is the proposal of the Government, who spread the repayment of the' loan over fifteen or sixteen years. If it were proposed to borrow £3,500,000, and never repay it, I could understand some of the arguments of the Opposition. proposed; no time is stipulated in the Bill. not gone through the Bill very closely; but rowed money for that purpose, I supI understand that there is to be a 5 per pose? cent, sinking fund, which will liquidate the debt in sixteen years. that the sinking fund shall be one of not less than 5 per cent. -little more.

The result was that a Conference that time, of course, will have all been was called, and a co-operation or co-partpaid off. A question raised by honourable nery was established with the Dependenmembers opposite is, "" Shall we take this cies of the Empire. In our case, we had money from the poor, or shall we take it from the rich and those best able to pay it?"" I submit, with all respect, that that question does not arise. Members returned to this Parliament at the next or subsequent elections, may alter the arrangement as they choose; and the money necessary to pay interest and principal may be raised in another way. What we have to settle just now is not how the money is to be repaid, but how it is to be raised in order to meet a necessity. about the paying! ber is again returned to the House, he will have full opportunity to advocate a different method to meet the position. At present, the Government are not asking us to do more than authorize them to borrow the money necessary to accomplish the object, and the question of repayment is one that a future Parliament may deal with as it thinks fit. I do not wish to go into the question at length; but the arrangement detailed by the honourable member for Brisbane seems to me eminently fair, not only to this Commonwealth, but to the Mother Country. It practically amounts to an arrangement for a co-partnership. In the past, we have had arrangements, some satisfactory, and some unsatisfactory. Of course, I know that some honourable members objected to the Dreadnought offer; but it came before the British people in such a form as to impress them with our sincerity in desiring, to be, not merely a nominal, but an. integral part of the EmEnglish Government borrow money when generous !",63,Bkown Specja L Taxation I Am Largely In Accord With Some Of The

As a matter of fact, it is a good, sound , business arrangement. -settling the question as to whether it is desirable for the Commonwealth tq go beyond what are understood to be the limits of its taxing powers, the next two or three years may pass, and we may find that we may have "" missed the bus ""-that we are ready some time after the need for our navy has arisen. We cannot have a navy without paying for it, and we desire to order it at once. If we have not the money, why should we not borrow it? in Australia. is quite right; but, as I could point out if time permitted, and the subject were relevant, we have plenty of uses for the money in Australia. If we apply the money in Australia to the development of Australia through private enterprise, Ave shall find we have uses enough for it, and that we can borrow on far more satisfactory terms abroad. Honourable members should look at this, and I trust they will do so, as not in any way a party question. It is a simple matter of business. The idea of laying down a hard and fast rule in this country that you will not borrow money in any circumstances is foolish. It all depends on your financial ability to accomplish the objects you have in view. We want a fleet, and we want .it at once, .and we must find the money at once to pay for it. That being-so, the question of repayment is the gravamen of the whole difference between us. My honourable friends -say"" We will finance it out of revenue,"" which means increased taxation. The Government say"" We will.borrow the money and, instead of making the burden on the people a million and a half for the next three years, make it about £270,000 for fifteen years. That is the whole issue boiled down. We ought to pass the Bill. The honourable gentleman who last addressed the House spoke of honourable members who were afraid to vote or speak, but I do not think he can apply that to me. I speak because I believe this is a sound business proposition, one that ought to commend itself to the House as reasonable, and as the only means available at present to enable us to complete the arrangement made with the Imperial Government-a n arrangement which I think is an exceedingly good business proposition. I am very glad that the Imperial Defence While we are Conference, which the honourable member for Brisbane attended as the representative of Australia, arrived at a decision to establish auxiliary fleets in the various dominions. That decision is quite of a piece with the policy advocated for a considerable time past by the party to which I have the honour to belong. It is a good thing that at last the chief naval advisers of the Empire have been brought to see that it is possible to have something in the nature of Colonial fleets which will be of advantage from an Empire stand-point, and at the same time keep alive that local patriotism without which any fleet at all is impossible. While one cannot help ex"" pressing pleasure at the turn events have taken in that direction, 1 must say that the means by which the Government propose to bring the auxiliaryfleetinto existence are absolutely beneath contempt. To hear the honourable member for Mernda talking, a stranger would gather the impression that we in Australia were so inordinately hard up that we could not afford to tax ourselves to the extent of £500,000, or even £100,coo a year. When the honourable member says that we must perforce borrow because we have no money, he is libelling Australia. Government.' Government's taxing powers for if not to be exercised? For what purpose are they intrusted under the Constitution with powers of taxation except to exercise them when occasion arises?

The only serious objection that can be taken to the proposal to construct this navy relates to the question of whether or not we are justified in embarking upon this policy in view of the extraordinary development that has taken place in aerial navigation. stopped its shipbuilding programme because of that advance? there has been any serious stoppage yet, but there is certainly a growing tendency in that direction. ing that aerial navigation will revolutionize modern warfare. Flying machines have been navigated from a given point over a course extending from 100 to 180 miles. They have been steered between goalposts and brought back to the starting point, and when such* a stage has been reached in aerial navigation, we cannot overestimate the value of flying machines as instruments In the same of warfare. In these circumstances does the Minister of Defence think that we ought to construct this navy on the lines laid down under the agreement made at the Imperial Defence Conference? Does he not think that we should, at all events, be setting aside at the same time a sum of money to enable experiments in' connection with aerial navigation for defence purposes the one is involved in the other. that within the next few years we may have perfected flying machines which may hover over our battleships, and from which bombs may be dropped upon our fleet and destroy it. but not likely. but very probable. the honourable member is doing himself justice in attempting to lead the House to believe that we ought to postpone the naval defence scheme because of the advance that is being made in aerial navigation.

This Bill is certainly the worse that I have seen since I entered Parliament, and I hope I shall never see such another.

I did not know that honourable members opposite were exhausted on this important question, and I had expected to hear one follow the last speaker. We are asked to accept a Bill authorizing the raising and expending of £3,500,000 for the purposes of naval defence; but I point out that honourable members, particularly on this side; have had no opportunity to express any views in regard to the principles or details of the defence scheme itself. I was amongst those desirous to speak when the Minister of Defence commenced to lay the matter before us, but, as we know, owing to the action of two or three members at the outside, entirely on their own responsibility, the proposal was passed in such a way as to preclude discussion by the application of the closure at the instance ot the Minister in charge. ber must not refer to that matter. scheme had been presented as legislation usually is, we should have been in a much better position to deal with it on its merits. As it is, we are asked to consider the It is rather striking that we financial aspect, without having considered the principles or details of the scheme; and that is a most unfortunate position for the Government to place the House in. It is a position which neither reflects credit on the Government, nor places Australia in a proper light before the people of the Old Country. If there is any question that appeals to the Empire as a whole, it is the question of defence; and leaders of thought in public life throughout the Empire are entitled to hear the opinions of the members of this Parliament. At the end of the last session of a dying Parliament, we are invited to consider a big proposal of this character, sprung on us without much previous information, and presented in a garbled and mangled form. I desire to enter my protest, and to say, at the same time, that I was prepared to give the question of naval defence fair consideration. HadI the advantage of knowing what the proposals of the Government are, I believe I should be prepared to afford them my support; but the Government saw fit in what seemed to me to be a spirit of petty and despicable spleen orable member must not refer to that matter. in keeping with the action of the Government in the earlier stages of the discussion of this matter, that a Bill of this character should be now introduced. The leaders, if not the rank and file on the Government side, had no desire to permit Australia to have a naval defence on Australian lines. They desired, and, to a certain extent, in the earlier life of the Commonwealth, gave effect to that desire, to contribute a mere pittance in the form of a subsidy, throwing on the Mother Countrv the whole responsibility for the naval defence of Australia.

434,Mr Thomas Brown,"It is quiteare prepared to provide it ; but, unfornately, there have been, and are, in this Chamber members who think that anything of that character bespeaks enmity to the Empire. Their ideas are so narrow and despicable that they regard nothing but some limited defence expenditure under the control of the Mother Country as genuine Australian patriotism. Anything else they consider to be tainted with disloyalty, and they have persistently endeavoured to belittle the desire of Australians to build up a system of naval defence suitable to Australian conditions and adequate for Australian needs. The late Labour Government placed the Commonwealth under a debt of gratitude by initiating a true Australian naval defence scheme which became so popular thai .the other side, despite their hostility to it, have felt themselves compelled to adopt it. It was owing to the representations of that Government to the Home authorities that the scheme now before us had an opportunity of being considered, and is now being actively initiated as a wise' and substantial part of the wider defence scheme of the Erppiro. During the time that this matter was under consideration honourable members on the other side, who took the narrower view, charged those on this side with being actuated by disloyal motives. They claimed that our scheme was put forward in order to give effect, in an underhand way, to anti-Imperial designs. In the early stages their cry was for the presentation of a Dreadnought or nothing. That was the original policy of those little Australians ; but when public opinion did not respond in the way they expected, it became' a Dreadnought or its equivalent. When, finally, they got into touch with British sentiment, and realized that the sound common sense of the political leaders of the Empire was against them, and in favour of the Fisher policy, theychanged their tune to "" An Australian unit."" this proposal submitted to us. When we consider the utterances of some members of the Ministry and of the Fusion party during the early stages of the discussion of the question when it was to be a "" Dreadnought or nothing"" ; when we read again some of their strong expressions of opinion against an Australian Navy, we cease to wonder why the motion submitted last week by the Minister of Defence was forced through the Chamber without debate. I have armed myself with the opinions of a number of leading authorities on the question of Australian defence. I do not propose to quote from them a l l : but every one must recognise that the opinion of British statesmen is that Australian defence can be best effected, managed, and controlled by Australians, and that the old system favoured by a number of the Fusionists of throwing on the British Government the responsibility of providing for Australian naval defence, and making a contribution to the Imperial Exchequer, was op-posed to sound principles of responsible government. They recognised that the old Liberal cry of "" No taxation without representation "" applied in that matter as forcibly as it had ever done, and that it would not be long before those parts of the Empire which were asked to contribute largely to the cost of the British Navy would demand a voice in the expenditure of the money which they contributed. They knew that when, as in all large concerns of this character, exposures of abuses were made, the Australian taxpayer would ask for a voice in remedying the abuses and punishing those responsible. Notable authorities such as Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, and others, expressed that view with no uncertain sound. I have here a short quotation from that eminent Bri&ish Admiral to this effectThe ^elf-governing Dominions can best help us, not by spending ^2,000,000 in the construction of battleships to serve in British quarters, but by making efforts to 'defend themselves. The only way the Dominions oversea can be hurt is by the cutting off the trade routes. . . . The investment of £2,000,000 in home defence and cruisers which would protect the trade routes would be a better investment than helping to defend Great Britain's shores. He there says, in effect, that the outlying portions of the Empire, including Australia, can spend their money better in local defence than in presenting Dreadnoughts We, therefore, have to the Mother Country; but in the following quotation he touches on the possibility that, if the offer was accepted, Australia would want a voice in the expenditureThere is one point that the English-speaking nations are very determined upon, and they will argue upon it considerably, and that is that whenever they spend money they like to ""have control of it. The Manchester Guardian, in an article published on the 2nd June last, dealing with the Imperial Defence Conference, published the following criticism upon the question of the presentation of Dreadnoughts to the Mother Country, as true permanent policy is for the colonies to against locally controlled defence:The Conference will find Australia strongly and Canada mildly interested in the formation of navies of their own, New Zealand committed on imperfect knowledge of the facts and without consultation of the Parliament to a huge subsidy, and South Africa with no desire to possess a navy of her own, and no power to increase her subsidy to the Imperial Navy. The New Zealand precedent, though most generous, is. not on the lines of ' true progress, and, so far from encouraging other colonies to follow it, we ought at the Conference to give New Zealand every opportunity of transforming her offer into something of more permanent value. The ideal to aim at, alike for military and for political reasons, is that each colony should make itself capable of defending itself at sea as on land for military reasons, because the whole tendency of the time is towards localizing naval defence and towards greater concentration 'of fleets; and for political reasons, because it is impossible, to accept colonial contributions to the Imperial fleet on any considerable scale without also giving the colonies a voice in Imperial policy. It is a common belief that our fleet is larger than it need be, because we have to defend the colonies as well as -our own shores, and that if the colonies did their share.in naval defence ours would be much less; but there is little evidence in suppoTt of it. The naval defence of Canada can hardly be said to cost us anything, for she is already protected against attack from any European power by the Monroe Doctrine, and the United States Navy is left out of our calculations of naval competition. W€ keep a small squadron in Australian waters, of which Australia Days abput five-twelfths of the cost, but if she kept four battleships there, it would make not the smallest difference in our requirements in home waters. The defence of our colonies then has nothing to do with the size of our Naval Budgets. But would Estimates be less if the colonies gave Dreadnoughts and made no conditions about where they should be stationed? We doubt even that Dreadnought should be knocked off our programme because of New Zealand's offer? Because every ""gift"" obligation. No number of Dreadnoughts in the North Sea would dispense with the need of local defence in the South Seas on the outbreak of war, and whatever New Zealand has added to our strength would then have to be given back. If we did not give it back the ;olony would have a just grievance. Our naval position would be no stronger, but rather weaker : on the other hand, the political risk would be very serious. A partu in the colonies would raise the cry that they were being taxed without representation or control; but no representation could be given without increasing the whip up public opinion than the proposal to responsibilities of the Navv, at least to the ex' present Britain with a Dreadnought.

If , when they have done that, they have the disposition to do more, then their gifts will be gifts in effect as well as intention, and not loans at interest which we may have to repay at inconvenient seasons. . . . The colonies . . can perfect their fixed defences, and they can develop in time fleets capable of keeping their own seas free from stray marauders detached from the main theatre of war. The service rendered in this way will have much greater and more permanent value than occasional gifts of Dreadnoughts to the Imperial Navy, gratifying as the spirit which dictates these is. Such gifts are soon consumed; but the value of a sound system of naval defence, with all the pride of nationality to draw upon, will increase with time. Nor need it be feared that the local navies thus created would not be placed at the disposal of this country in time of serious war. scribing to. a large measure of British sentiment.

The Minister of Defence has told us that when his proposed scheme is in operation, the Commonwealth will be spending £1,742,000 on land defence, and £750,000 on naval defence, a total of £2,500,000. Whilst, no doubt, it is desirable to have a vessel of the Indomitable type as part of the Australian fleet, it is apparently not contemplated to have more than one such vessel, it being thought that our defence can be better provided for by lighter and swifter steamers. A glance at our situation shows the wisdom of that. It is improbable that a large fleet would be sent from the waters of the Old World to operate the honourable member in reading that exagainst Australia. What we have to fear tract? are what are known as commerce destroyers. When there was trouble between Russia and Japan, the Russian commerce destroyers -no t their large fighting vessels-bega n to overhaul British merchantmen, and to act in a manner calculated to provoke a breach of the peace. Had war broken out, the efforts of Russia would have been directed to doing as much damage as possible in crippling our commerce. Apparently, the intention is to provide against this. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out that, while vessels of the Dreadnought type are now popular, they may become obsolete at no distant date. Naval and military experts hold that view. Recently. I read an article in a leading American magazine, in which Sir Hiram Maxim, whose knowledge of these matters is unquestioned, expressed the opinion that ten years from now, the methods of defence and attack will be so revolutionized that Dreadnoughts will be obsolete and useless as weapons.

452,Mr Speaker,"What is the ob'ect ofunwisdom of committing the Commonwealtb to a large expenditure on older methods of defence, particularly in the form of Dreadnoughts. J. should remind the honourable member of the fact that that matter has already been settled this session, and it would not be possible to make an alteration without rescinding the motion already carried. pity that the question should have been so settled. My only desire is to show the unwisdom of entering on a large expenditure for Dreadnoughts while newer methods are creating fresh conditions. While, under present conditions, ft may be advisable for the Commonwealth to commit itself to the construction of one large vessel, it would be most unwise to spend money in constructing many of the same character. Our real defence is to be found in newer vessels, more particularly the swifter, smaller, and less expensive River class and torpedo boats. The Government no longer appeal to the country to present a Dreadnought or its equivalent to the Mother Countryj but have really adopted the Fisher programme for the creation of an Australian naval defence scheme. not followed the Fisher programme altogether, because the latter not only set forth a scheme, but indicated the method by which it was proposed to finance it, as shown in the Gympie statement of policy. The present Government, in order to protect its wealthy friends, propose to establish an Australian unit by asking the Mother Country not merely to contribute £250,000 per annum, but to provide all the necessary money in the form of a loan. Is Australia to ""sponge"" on the Mother Country in that manner? That is not a nice epithet to use, but it is far more justiit must be recognised that any such step fiable under present circumstances than it was when the Minister of Defence used it. Australia, with all its wealth, instead of shouldering her share of the burden, proposes to ask the Mother Country for a loan; and that is a most despicable way of dealing with this Australian question. As between the proposed method and-that formulated by the Fisher Government, the comparison tells altogether, from the patriotic Australian stand-point, against the proposal now submitted. The scheme is practically to have these vessels constructed with English money. There may be circumstances under which a borrowing policy is justified, particularly in time of stress and trial as the outcome of war; but under conditions of peace and prosperity, such as at present obtain, it is neither patriotic nor in accord with Australian sentiment that our defence should be so provided. There are other reasons why the proposals of the Government should not be adopted af the present time. When the Commonwealth was in its youth, there was a proposal to initiate a policy of borrowing in order to carry out certain works which had been taken over from the States, and which, under State control, had been provided for out of loan moneys. This Parliament rejected the proposal, though it was far more justified then than it is on the present occasion. Parliament decided in the interests of sound finance that the Commonwealth should not be committea to a borrowing policy. The decision which was then arrived at has been respected ever since, and I think that the wisdom of the course which was adopted upon that occasion must be patent to all. At the time it was considered that our public works could not be constructed out of current revenue. But The Government, however, have experience has falsified that idea, because during the period which has since elapsed ti.i Commonwealth has actually returned to the States £6,000,000 in addition to the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, to which they were entitled under the Braddon section of the Constitution. The Commonwealth has thus been able to carry out important public works without resort to the money market of the Old World. But in addition to the general undesirableness of the Commonwealth invading the London money market to enable it to undertake other than reproductive works, would introduce a seventh Australian competitor into that marketa competitor which would have only the same asset upon which to borrow. Each of the States borrowed largely in the past, and is still borrowing for the purpose of carrying out public undertakings. As a result they are very heavily committed to the bond-holders of the Old Country. If the Crmmonwealth enters the London' money ma/ket and pledges the same asset, it is obvious that either the States or itself must suffer.

On the contrary, she desires to community. If the former are to contribute be on terms of friendliness, and to have in that connection they can do so only by a good commercial relationship with them. means of direct taxation.

It is Is that fair or The Labour Government wealth and special privilege should be defended by the joining of those who had politically sundered, and whose views that contribution to civilization willfoein an increasing ratio. I know of nothing that will put back the hands of progress and good fellowship to a greater extent than will a big war between those two great peoples. Some of the best of our farmers and agriculturists have been drawn from Germany, and whilst they have a keen love for the Fatherland, they are not unpatriotic Australians. They have cast in their lot with us, and are prepared to let Australian conditions, if need be, determine their future. Whilst that is so,. I think that anything in the nature of promoting a 'disagreement between the two peoples should be deplored rather than encouraged, and the people of Australia and the people of the Mother Country will be' well advised to do everything in their power to maintain the good feeling and the good relationship which have hitherto existed. It was said in the Old Country that the late trouble was largely fomented for political reasons, but I believe that it was largely the outcome of a feeling of commercial rivalry, and also a feeling of uncertainty with respect to a few individuals who control the destinies of the great German Empire. But apart from that, I think that there is no great feeling of bitterness or vindictiveness between the two great peoples. It is not the building of Dreadnoughts, and the fomenting of ill-will, which may lead up to a great war, which is going to secure to Great Britain her commercial supremacy. She must be prepared to adopt modern methods, to hold her own with her competitor by legitimate competition, rather than by the building of Dreadnoughts and fomenting ill-will between two great peoples. Whilst we in Australia are prepared to take a hand in defence purposes, we regard our provision as defence, not as defiance, or for the purpose of aggression. Defence is an expression of national preservation and patriotism. Australian self-preservation and patriotism are not necessarily antagonistic to British or Empire preservation or patriotism; but may, and should be, their complement. There is no justification for the innuendo, and. in some cases, the direct statement that Australian patriotism means or spells disloyaltv to the Empire, and that the desire to build an Australian navy, and to provide for Australian defence, is necessarily antagonistic to the best interests of the. Empire. Finally, Australian naval defence should be-fa ) naid for by Australian money; [245] (b) built by Australian labour and skill out of Australian material so far as possible; (c) manned by Australian men animated with Australian patriotism; and (d) an Australian Fleet under Australian supervision and control up to the point when Empire needs united action under central control. The cost of defence should be levied on the wealth, rather than on the poverty of the community; and, therefore, should be paid out of direct rather than indirect taxation or public loans. .

CATTS (Cook) [11.24] I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is proposed that the House should sit on Saturday and Monday? I heard a rumour to thai effect. If the honourable gentleman has made up his mind as to the arrangements which are.to be made for next week, he should give the House early notice of them. dealing with the matter has been given for to-morrow. A of days ago I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General the fact that owing to the strike the people living in a large district of New South Wales are not receiving their mails regularly. Cooma has been cut down by one-half. The residents of the whole of the Monaro district, at Cooma, Bombala, Dalgety, and Eden are left without their regular mails. I understood that the Postmaster-General would make some inquiries into the matter, but, so far as I can learn, no inquiries have yet been made. There does not appear to be the slightest disposition on the part of the honourable gentleman to make inquiry in order that the people of the district. I have referred to may be supplied with the mail service which they have enjoyed in the past. I do not say that it is always possible for the Government to rush in and employ motor cars for the carriage of mails. That might in some cases be found to be impracticable, but surely in an urgent case of this kind it is possible for the Postmaster-General to discover how much it vvpuld cost to carry out the service by using motor cars? If it is found to be a practicable scheme, it should be put into operation at once. I trust that the Postmaster-General will not allow this matter to remain in abeyance. He has already received wires assuring him that there are people who are prepared to give the Department a price for the work. If the work can be done at a reasonable price, these people should be no longer denied the service. I refer to the matter now in master-General) [11.27] Hail services have been considerably reduced in other districts in New South Wales, and also in Victoria. In many cases the reductions have been serious, and have involved great inconvenience to the public. In others less inconvenience has been caused. It would be scarcely fair to select one particular service such as that mentioned by the honourable member for Werriwa and give specially favorable treatment to that district by supplying a substituted service. Other districts are entitled to equal consideration. I promised to make inquiries, but I could not make inquiries and come to a decision upon an important matter like this in a day or two. One is hopeful, also, that the unfortunate strike may terminate before it becomes necessary to resort to heroic measures. If it is to be prolonged, the Department will, of course, have to consider the necessity of providing substituted serThe service from Goulburn to vices, but I do not think that we should rush into new arrangements unless specal and urgent circumstances would justify us in doing so. wish to ask the Treasurer whether he can give the House any informationwith regard to the appointment of. the High Commissioner, and whether he can say who is likely to be appointed ?
