The suggestion that forged bank-notes are not a prohibited import is quite incorrect. They are expressly prohibited under the terms of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Eegulations-and anything likely to deceive the public into thinking that it is a bank-note is also prohibited. A plate to make forged bank-notes would clearly be a probibited import under the general provision that anything which, in the opinion of tbe Minister, is likely to deceive the public or is likely to be harmful is a probibited import.

17,Mr Cramer,"I cannot say at thisGeueral aware that there is considerable disquiet among rank-and-file oflieers of the New South Wales Department of Railways who fear that their telephone conversations may be tapped by their own departmental executives? My question arises from the fact that two officers of the New South Wales Department of Railways were recently dismissed from the service, and reports are current that conversations they held with newspaper reporters were recorded. Will the Postmaster-General state his department's attitude to this matter? press, last week I think it was, some reference to the matter submitted to me by the honourable member for Mitchell. on a press report. friend, the honourable member for Canning, reminds me, the honourable member's question is based on a press statementand I have found that press statements are very unreliableI shall nevertheless give some information in reply to the question. Tbe position is that the Postmaster-General's Department has no knowledge of any action which might have been taken by the New South Wales Department of Railways in this matter. I want to point out to the House, however, that there is a provision in regulations under the Posts and Telegraph Act which imposes a penalty of, I think, £25, on any one who can be shown to have taken action designed either to tap, or to record, any conversation over a telephone which is under the control of the Postmaster General's Department. That provision is very strictly implemented by the department, and I want that fact to be very clearly understood. The act also contains a special provision, however, that the State departments of railways may install, maintain and operate within their own radiating from a central exchange provided by the Postal Department; but the Postal Department has little, or no, supervision of the operation of the telephone systems within the boundaries of the Department of Railways. Some further provision may be needed. As a result of the recent press reports, the officers of the department are preparing a full report for me. SinceI have not yet received it, I think it would be improper for me to make any comment that may imply that some one has been guilty of this practice. I do not know whether any one has been guilty of it, and I do not so assume. But I assure the honourable member for Mitchell, and those on whose behalf he has asked tbe question, that the Postmaster-General's Department religiously observes the regulations under vvhich it ensures complete privacy for telephone conversations. Trade aware that, in Victoria, at least one very enterprising gentleman has established a farm, or developed an area of land, where he keeps Australian animals and birds that he has collected, such as wallabies, opossums, emus, and, perhaps worse of all, the strawnecked ibis, which destroys large numbers of grasshoppers? Is the Minister aware, also, that up to £30 a head is offered for some birds, and that it is alleged that goldfinches are available for sale for export and that a very large export trade in this class of fauna has already beeu developed? I do not know what category of exports some of these creatures are included in, but, in view of the verygreat value of some of our native birds and animals, and in view of the fact that their numbers are rapidly diminishing, will the Minister take steps to ensure that no licences for the export of any of Australia's birds or animals are granted, except in approved circumstances, such as for the export of birds and animals to zoos in other cotvntries? As this matter is so important, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure you Avill permit me to say that I recently read that one enterprising gentleman had even boundaries telephone systems gone to the extent of caging frilled lizards and blue-tongue lizards, that a business in the breeding of these animals had been established, and that they were being exported, I think to Germany. .1 do not know whether these small",12,Eural Ba Nk Of New South Wales

The honorHaving said that, I have to confess that [ am not aware what regulations exist relative to it, nor by which department, whether Commonwealth or even perhaps State, they are controlled. But I undertake to ascertain the facts and to inform the honorahle member of them. Minister for External Affairs whetlier it is a fact that Soviet Russia has recently admitted the truth of what a number of us have been saying about the Soviet regime, and now professes penitence for the murders, tortures and slave labour that characterized Stalinism. Does the Minister think that any professions of penitence on Russia's part are genuine, and would any light be thrown on the genuineness of these protestations by the fact that tbe Chinese Communists, whose leaders have indulged, and are still indulging, in similar practices, are still in power, and are still in favour in Moscow with those Russian leaders who profess now to be so shocked at the Stalinism in which they themselves participated ? bave previously asked you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for a ruling on questions that seek expressions of opinion from Ministers. I have since read the Standing Orders, and I have found it clearly stated in them that such questions are out of order. Do you, sir, agree with me? with what Mr Speaker bas said repeatedly-that is, that if we were to observe strictly all the Standing Orders relating, to questions, very few of the questions sought to be asked would be permitted. that there has been an abrupt shift of major policy on the part of those in charge of the affairs of Soviet Russia. Far be it from me to give any interpretation of the genuineness of that change of policy. I think that all that any of us can be sure of is that nothing is done by Soviet Russia which is not done with a purpose. What the purpose may be in able gentleman linked that up with the attitude of mind, the policy and the practices of the Government of the People's Republic of China. I find myself unable to throw any light on the question that the honourable gentleman asks, although I appreciate the significance of it. The reason for that is that I do not happen to be at the moment in the confidence of the President of the People's Republic of China. Trade aware of tbe unfairness of the present system of import licensing, under which many licensees have very much greater quotas than they can possibly use in their own businesses, to the detriment of men in the same type of business, whose businesses, as a result, must suffer appreciably ? is, I think it is correct to say, a widespread sense of grievance in certain trading circles in respect of the impact of the administration of import licensing, as it is conducted at present and as it has been conducted for some time. I I think it would be impossible to administer this diflicult matter in such a way as to meet the requests and desires of all the interested parties and remove completely a sense of grievance. The twofold objective of the Government is to direct itself positively and urgently to constructive measures which will enable us to escape from the necessity for import licensing and, in the meantime, to keep administrative practices under constant review, so that the best can be done for",13,Australian Fauna

If you make up your minds which conference it was, I shall try to answer the questions. the Treasurer whether it is a fact that dollars have been expended for the purchase, out of government funds, of two second-hand Convair aircraft that ar« dtre to arrive in Australia within the next few days. If it is a fact, is tbere any good reason why dollars were expended for tbe purchase of what might be regarded as obsolete Convair aircraft as opposed to the use of non-dollar funds for the purchase of equipment that may have been obtained from the sterlingarea ? to which the honourable member has referred. I shall investigate the matter, and let him know the result. ted to the Minister for External Affairs, who is in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Disturbing rumours are being circulated concerning the alleged decline of the effectiveness of myxomatosis as a rabbit exterminator: Can the right honourable gentleman say what the actual position is? have already stated in the House and. elsewhere, that, there is grave danger, of myxomatosis losing its potency as a rabbit killer. The danger, arises,, first, fromi a falling off of the effectiveness of the virus over the years and, secondly, because of a rise in the resistance of the rabbit. That state of affairs has been reflected lately in some work that has been done by Professor Fenner, the renowned professor of micro-biology at the Australian National University, who performed large-scale laboratory tests that were designed to discover whether there was any such decline. The tests, which were performed on a number of rabbits in the Lake Urana district in the northern Riverina, showed; I think, the alarming fact that over three years there had been a decline of the killing power of the virus from 90 per cent, to 50 per cent. A decline from 90 per cent, to 80 per cent, or 85 per cent, would not be of very great moment, but a decline from 90 per cent, to 50 per cent', means that the writing is on the wall for Australian primary producers, and that they must do something about it. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is attempting to do something by re-introducing the original virus in as many districts as possible. That, however, is a. slow process; and is unlikely to keep pace with the general decline of the killing power of the virus observed in all rabbit infested? areas of Australia. PerhapsI shall be allowed to take advantage of this opportunity to point out, that; no matter what",14,Import Licensing

39,"Mr Casey.ri Can Only Repeat, As. I","the land-holders may do to exterminate rabbits by methods other than the use of myxomatosis, a lot still remains to be done by the authorities that are in charge of the implementation of vermin-extinction laws in the various States, perhaps not the least of them being the State governments. Very many people, including farmers, have asked me, "" What is the use of our doing everything possible to exterminate rabbits by supplementing the use of myxomatosis with other methods when in unoccupied adjacent Crown lands relatively nothing is done ? "" WithMinister's imagination. Why is it that out pointing the bone at any particular State governmentI think more than one is involvedI believe that all of them should wake up to their responsibility to the farming community of Australia and do everything possible to employ the accepted and orthodox means of exterminating rabbits; otherwise, within a relatively limited period of years, we shall find ourselves where we were originally. During the first two or three years of the use of myxomatosis, the discovery of which was one of the miracles that occasionally happens, Australia was saved at least £50,000,000 a year. But, as I have stated, the effectiveness of the virus is now falling off, and I think all of us, particularly the primary producing community, would be most unwise not to use every possible means to retrieve the situation. Myxomatosis will continue to have a potency, although it may be a declining one. If rabbits are to be wiped out in any and every area, which is the only solution, then every other meanstrapping, dogging, poisoning, and the rest -ba s to be used with the utmost vigour both by land-holders and by the State governments in respect of Crown lands. question to the Minister for Immigration. Do the immigration officers in Europe and England have a list of known criminals, with their photographs and records, taken from the local police files in order to make a check of all migrant applicants so as to prevent criminals such as forgers, currency smugglers and blackmailers from getting into Australia? Isi t a fact that while immigration officers are concentrating on political screening for subversive elements, undesirables such as I have mentioned are slipping through the screen simply because no one is looking for them? If BillyH ill , the English crook, could be stopped from getting into Australia That part of the honourable member's question is out of order. similar elements from other countries seemingly get through our screen undetected ? cluding sentence, the honourable member used the word ""seemingly"". I think there is a good deal of "" seemingly "" in the substance of the question. The fact that an impartial investigation by a group of responsible people has revealed a very much lower incidence of crime on the part of migrants proportionately to their numbers than is to be found in our own native-born community suggests that our screening methods are reasonably thorough. I believe they are as thorough as we can make them, unless we are prepared to establish so vast an additional staff for the purpose that the the results would scarcely warrant the additional expense. The screening methods have been examined by independent authorities and have been commented upon favourably by them. I do not claim that there is no opportunity for an ill-doer to slip through the screen, but we are not. powerless to deal with any who do come into Australia in those circumstances. As the honourable member knows, if offences are committed against our laws, then there is opportunity for deportation in cases where that drastic course would appear to be warranted. That power is exercised from time to time. I am always only too willing to look into any case brought to my notice, but I think there is a danger of reflecting upon a very large body of law-abiding industrious people if an impression is created that Australia is getting more than its share of wrongdoers from other countries.",15,Myxomatosis

The counter proposal, from the union side, was that it ought to be 4 per cent. That is my understanding of the proposal and counter scale yet. The department has been keepproposal made at the time. The talks finally broke down but it should now be abundantly clear to the union representatives that the overwhelming majority of the rank and file are anxious to have this dispute resolved and that, if their ofncials would withdraw tlie prohibition, within the next fortnight.

The Minister said that in Australia we had not reached the stage at which the matter was of real consequence to us. Is he aware that a large-scale strike occurred at the Standard Motor Company's works in England because automation was introduced without the prior application of necessary safeguards? Is he also aware that in Australian industry?

Indeed, I answered one only last week. the matter was not of real consequence in Australia at this time. WhatI tried to convey was that automation, as distinct from normal mechanized methods, has not progressed here to the same stage as it has in, say, the United States and the United Kingdom. The automotive process has been introduced in several instances and I have seen it in successful operation in the General MotorsHolden's Limited plant in Adelaide. I appreciate that it is a matter of real importance, even if its manifestations are not to be seen here on any considerable ing a close watch on these developments in the last few years, and at the last meeting of the Ministry of Labour Advisory Council, it was intimated that the subject would be on the agenda for the next meeting, which will take place have a discussion which will, I hope, make a useful contribution to our thinking on the question of automation.",17,Shearing Industry Dispute

Could the Minister ascertain, if the information is at his disposal, the percentage of immigrants who belong to registered trade unions in Australia? whether it would be practicableto take out any precise figures on that matter. I am not aware of any classification of immigrants into those who do, and those who d'o not, subsequently join unions. The honourable member will be aware that this Government's policy has been to encourage immigrants to accept membership of the union appropriate to their occupation. In recent years, I have had no complaint that I can recall from any official of the trade union movement to the effect that, generally speaking, this is not working out in practice. was rather to the effect that* the immiof £25 plus a certain, percentage of tbe grants were not aware of the position. impression, that what.

T am not aware of any suggestion that the. Australian practice-as I pointed out here the otber night, it is a very widespread practice-of accepting membership of the appropriate union has not been adopted by immigrants generally.

66,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [3.19]',"TheAs the law stands at the present moment, a radio broadcasting station pays a licence-fee of £25 annually plus a \ per cent, of the gross earnings per annum if a profit is made. The fee is to become £25 plus 1 per cent, on the sale of station time whether a profit is made or not. Tbe reasons stated by tbe Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) for this increase in the fees read as follows:The Government considers that some increase is justified by the fact that since the fee was fixed at the present level in 1942, the gross annual earnings of commercial broadcasting stations have increased from £1,330,000 to £(3,687,000 and their profits have risen from £81,812 to £1,449,000. The last part of tbe sentence indicates exactly the reason why the Government proposes that the fee should be increased. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to ask broadcasting stations to make a greater contribution than the sum of £35,000 which they are at present making to the cost of administering the broadcasting services which, of course, has risen very substantially since 1942. However, the cost of administering and running radio stations has also increased enormously and that has to be taken into consideration when one is dealing with the subject of licence-fees. stated that the amount contributed towards the cost of administering broadcasting services was £35,000 and it is probable that the computation of that amount has been based on figures that are not available to members of the Opposition. The last figures that were supplied by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board indicated that the amount that had been raised by licence-fees was £29,344. It is interesting to notice that the Minister said' . . . only four of the owners of the 106 nexion with the profits made by broadstations then in operation suffered a loss on casting stations, that the owners of the their broadcasting operations. Now, the information that is given in the their profits as everybody else. It does seventh annual report of the Australian seem to be unreasonable and u n f a i r to Broadcasting Control Board indicates suggest that, in addition to paying a that more than four stations suffered a licence-fee, they should be subject to an loss. On page 7 of that report, paragraph impost upon either their gross earnings, 18, which is headed "" Commercial Broadas provided in the act, or the sale of casting Stations-Financia l Results of station time, as provided in the b ill now OperationsstatesI t should be explained that seven of the twelve stations which made a loss were being operated on relay from capital city stations in the same ownership and that the combined accounts of the capital city stations and the relay stations showed a profit. Of the remaining five stations, three have in recent times been re-located in areas where they will have better prospects, and a fourth was operating for only part of the year and was expected to make a profit when its service was fully developed. The same report indicates that the number of stations in operation was 106 and the figures show that the number of stations showing a loss has varied fro m 44 in 1941-42 to twelve in 1954-55. On occasions, the number has gone as high as eighteen and has varied between eleven and 30, apart from the first year, when losses were experienced by 44 stations out of the 97 stations then in operation. I point that out because, at a later stage, it is my intention to deal w it h some aspects of radio that w ill indicate the possibility of many stations having a loss. The Minister has stated that profits for the year 1954-55 have been shown to total £1,060,000. It may also be pointed out that those profits have to be divided between 106 stations. If the stations which have been operating at a loss are excluded and the profit is divided amongst the remaining 94 stations that The Minister were presumably running at a profit, the average amount of profit works out at only £11,130 a station. It is quite true that some stations are extremely profitable. T h a t . statement applies, in the main, to stations in a metropolitan area. The profits of country stations are by no means so rosy as would be suggested by the total amount of profits of all companies, or even by the amount of average profit which, I admit, is not the best way of ascertaining what profits amount to. It should be pointed out, too, in constation are subject to the same taxes on before the House. While I am dealing w it h this question, I should point out that the stations that are making a profit have had to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on improved equipment and improved broadcasting arrangements in order to reach their present standards, and they bave had to spend money in quite a number of other ways in order to secure public support. It seems to me that tbe proposal in this b ill to f i x a charge in addition to a licensing fee is extremely unfair. I know of no other industry, calling, or occupation, in respect of which a licence fee is required, and in addition, a further fee is payable in the for m of a percentage of gross earnings. The Postmaster General has stated that the idea, underlying this increase is that the companies shall pay a greater proportion of the cost of administering broadcasting services. variance with the reason for which tbe additional payments were first fixed in the 1942 legislation which, in the main, followed the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Broadcasting. On page 59 of its report the committee make certain comments in respect of station licensees and, because of their importance, and becaiuse they seem to indicate that the present payments were fixed for a reason entirely different from that given by the Minister to-day, I propose to read to the House that section of the report. The section comprises paragraphs 402 and 403 of the report, and readsConsidering that the Government grants commercial stations what may he termed a measure of monopoly, we havo carefully considered whether or not we should recommend that they carry an increased licence-fee. We believe that one of the duties nf the proposed Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting should be to watch profits as the industry develops. returns are not excessive and the few cases in which they are high will be dealt with by the Taxation Commissioner. I interpolate there that eveh that committee was of the opinion that profits were a matter for consideration by the Commissioner of Taxation. The report continuesIn view of the services of the Post Office to broadcasting in general, however, we do suggest a slight alteration in tlie licence-fees pnyable by commercial stations, which at present are fixed at £25 per annum. We recommend that the flat rate of £25 be maintained, but that those stations which declare a profit pay an additional licence-fee of one-half of one per cent, of their gross revenue. We also recommend that this sum, which will probably amount to about £5,000 a year, should be utilized for radio research. So the intention of the Gibson committee, at any rate, was that the amount of one-half of 1 per cent, of their gross revenue, to be paid by commercial stations which declared a profit, should be used for radio research. I can find no evidence in the last report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board that any radio research has been carried on by that body. If it has been carried on it certainly has not been reported on. Neither does the board's report indicate that the moneys which have been collected from station licence-fees have been used as recomThat reason is totally at mended by the Gibson committee. We find, however, that the Government's intention is to take, in addition to the taxes that the companies controlling these stations have to pay, 1 per cent, of the proceeds of the sale of station time as a further charge over and above tbe licence-fee of £25. I suggest that, in view of the conditions that are arising, and are likely to arise, as a consequence of the introduction of television, this surcharge is both unreasonable and unfair. The Minister, in his brief speech on this measure, certainly gave no justification for a substantial increase of licence-fees in respect of either sound broadcasting or television stations. NowI come to a matter which I think is of great importance, and which requires the very earnest attention of the House. That is, whether or not. in view of the measure we passed last week and its effect on sound broadcasting, the proAt present, however, visions of the bill now before us can be regarded as reasonable and fair. There can be no possible doubt that the introduction of television as a new medium of entertainment for the Australian people will have a shattering effect on a number of other entertainment media. I suggest to the House that we might well learn from the experiences of other countries following the introduction of television. Sound broadcasting has beer; <i feature of our national lif e for well over 30 years, and, as a result of its monopoly of the transmission of sound over the air into the homes of people who possess broadcast receivers, there is apparently a feeling that sound broadcasting will continue for all -time to be a profitable enterprise for those who conduct it. Sucb a suggestion was made by the Minister. It was also suggested in the last report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The experience of other countries, however, shows the shattering effect of the introduction of television on a number of other entertainment media which previously were receiving considerable support from the public. One of tbe results of the introduction of television in the United States, and also in Great Britain and Canada, was a considerable decline in tbe amount of business transacted not only by sound broadcasting stations but also by a number of other entertainment media which had received strong public support and had been extensively used by advertisers. For instances, vaudeville shows once formed a very important part of the national life of the United States. There were scores of vaudeville theatres in every big centre in America. The introduction of television, however, bas led to the closing down of hundreds of vaudeville theatres. The effect on the moving picture industry, right through from the producing end to the picture theatres themselves, has been most pronounced. It is estimated that, after some years of the operation of television in the United States, Britain and Canada, 'attendances at picture theatres in -those cities have fallen by about 25 per cent. So, the cinematographic industry itself has been experiencing some very disastrous results as >a consequence of the introduction of television. Of course, that has not prevented certain moving picture entrepreneurs from concentrating almost solely on the production of moving pictures for screening on television. The same decline bas made itself apparent in respect of the 'reading of newspapers and magazines, and in a number of other ways. If honourable members wish to gain some idea of the effect of television in respect of these Obviously, people will prefer to watch media I suggest that they read the report headed "" TV Today"" issued by the National Broadcasting Commission of the United States of America. That report shows that there has been a tremendous fall in the use by the public of a number of other entertainment media. I simply point out that sound broadcasting stations will be the first to be affected by television. The commercial broadcasting stations exist on the revenue they receive from the advertisers and sponsors they can attract. But advertisers will always support the best medium for reaching the public, and if it can be shown, as it wiU be shown, that there is a greater response by the public to advertisements screened on television than to advertisements lieard over sound broadcasting stations, the inevitable result will be greater revenue received by television stations from advertising contracts, and a falling away of advertising business secured by the sound broadcasting stations. That is the pattern that has followed in the United States of America, Canada and Great Britain. Inevitably, the same thing is bound to result here, particularly since television broadcasts will be made during the hours that are the most attractive from the stand-point of the advertiser, although the broadcasting hours will be limited initially. Presumably, we shall find that television broadcast* will be made between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., during the hours when there will be most viewers, -and that, as a consequence, the big advertising contracts that provide a good deal of entertainment for radio broadcasts will, in turn, go to tbe television companies. The result will be an immediate falling off of the business of radio broadcasting stations. in the metropolitan areas, but not so much in the country. country to a certain degree. I am glad the honourable member has mentioned the matter. The range of television in both Melbourne ' and Sydney, which has already been illustrated, indicates that the fringes of the areas covered by a number of radio broadcasting stations will now be covered by television broadcasts. television in order to see and hear, rather than hear only, as they do at thc present time with radio. The tendency will be for the advertising contracts to go to the television stations. Secondly, most country radio broadcasting stations enliven",19,Davidson
67,Mr Mackinnon,That will happen,22,Davidson
68,Mr Clarey,"It will happen in thetheir programmes, as do station 3DB and otlier stations, by broadcasting particularly attractive programmes such as those of Bob Dyer and Jack Davey, and the Caltex programme and others. The listening audiences of the country radio broadcasting stations can be held by these exceedingly attractive programmes broadcast by local radio stations ootween 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. But the transfer of 3nch programmes to the television companies will mean that less attractive programmes will be provided on the country radio stations. The result w ill be a reduction of the listening audience, which enables the country station to pay its way. I suggest to the Postmaster-'}eneral, and to the House, that an additional licence-fee is not only unfair bnt also harsh to radio broadcasting stations. I suggest that, instead of persisting with this bill as drafted, it would be f a r better to amend it in order to protect radio broadcasting stations, which are about to enter an extremely hazardous stage of their history. Therefore, I move That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:"" the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide:(1) That the increased fees shall not apply in respect of any radio broadcasting station that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is satisfied(o) has not made a profit for the year concerned, or (6) would, if the fee were imposed and collected, sustain undue hardship; and (2) That the increased fees 3lmll not apply to any radio broadcasting station defined by thc Australian Broadcasting Control Board as a Country Station."" The House should consider the difliculties that will confront the radio broadcasting stations, and I believe my proposals w ill safeguard them from harshness such as would result from the in creased licence-fees proposed in this measure. amendment seconded? ment. General) [3.46] -May I state briefly that the Government does not accept the amendment. Is the Minister speaking only to the amendment ? self only to the amendment. I have listened with interest to the proposals of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr. Clarey). The position is that the Government considered it highly desirable that there should be a uniform basis for the licence-fees to be paid by all stations. I have just had time merely to glance at a copy of the amendment, but I take it that it applies only to radio broadcasting stations and not to television stations. £25 payable by radio broadcasting stations has not been altered since 1942, and the increase of the other portion of the licence-fee from one-half of 1 per cent, of the gross earnings to 1 per cent, of the earnings fro m the sale of station time is justified by present conditions. But the administrative costs of the governmental part of the service, which is absolutely essential to the development and preservation of highly efficient broadcasting and television services throughout Australia, have risen considerably since 1942. The financial returns of the radio broadcasting stations, as I pointed out in my second-reading speech, also have increased, During the last few years, the financial position of radio broadcasting stations has improved markedly. Apparently, this has been a consequence of the functioning of the Australian Broadcast; ing Control Board. I do not think it can be denied that the stations have benefited from the board's attention to the difficulties experienced by some radio broadcasting stations, particularly country stations, which have been greatly assisted either by the increasing of power in order to improve their advertising value, or by other means such as the adjustment of the I s the relationship between stations operating on clear channels and those operating on shared channels.

GOLD-MINING INDUSTRY Debate resumed from the 3rd May (vide page 1731), on motion by Sir That the bill be now road a second time. Mr E. V. JOHNSON (Kalgoorlie) [4.8] -The Opposition approves the bill. The existing legislation, which was passed in 1954, has proved to be very beneficial to the gold-mining industry in Western Australia. The Opposition had hoped that the Government, in view of ita experience of the operation of the act over a period of two years and tbe co-operation of the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia, would have taken into consideration statistical evidence furnished by that organization and would bave increased tbe respective bounties from £2 to £3 and £1 10s. to £2. I feel that, even at this late hour, tbe Treasurer (:--'ir Arthur Fadden) should onnsidpv rV"" evidence that has been furnished in support of an increase, and should alter the bounty at an early date. The position is that the act will have been in operation for two years at the end of June.. This bill, which amends the 1954 act, leaves the bounty at the same figure as it was in that year, and makes no provision whatever for the increased cost of production in the industry over those two years. The case that was submitted proved conclusively that an increase in the cost of production, exceeding 6 per cent., occurred over that period. As a consequence, it was felt that there was a committee (Consideration of good case for an increase of the existing bounty. There has been no increase in the price of gold since 1949. At that time, the goldmining industry received a substantial l if t in the price of gold, but since 1949 it has had to carry the steep increases associated with the production of gold. It was as a result of the case that the industry was able to put before the government of the day that the Gold Mining Industry Assistance Bill was introduced, and that legislation granted a subsidy to help the industry. As I have already said, it is generally acknowledged that the act, notwithstanding its limitations, did* provide some assistance to the gold-mining industry. This industry is of great value, not only to Western Australia, but also to the Commonwealth. Its dollar earning capacity is of great concern to this country. I suggest, therefore, in view of the fact that the price of gold ha? remained stationary since 1949, that more vigorous representations should be made to the International Monetary Fund in order to secure an increase in the price of gold. If this increase were forthcoming, the ills of the industry would be mended. That action is vitally necessary if small marginal mines are to be kept in existence-it is vital to the country generally that they be kept in existenceand if they are to be provided with the necessary capital to continue their development and progress. If whatever gold is in sight is"" dug out and no provision is made for developmental work, mines are often accounted dead before their true period of life has run. If the necessary capital is available to",25,Defence Foeces Eetieeme Nt Benefits Bill 1956
81,Mr Chambers (Adelaide) [4.3],,26,Arthur Fadden
82,Motion (By Sir Arthur Eadden),"unable underground research and development to continue during the working of tbe mine, then it may be kept in operation for a number of years. It is necessary to look at not only the quantity of gold that is produced, but at. the producanother look at the case that has been tion together with the developmental work undertaken to keep mines moving. A strong case should be presented to the International Monetary Fund for an increase in the price of gold. Such an increase would be of great benefit to the industry generally. The gold-mining industry is important to AVestern Australia, not only because of the 40,000 miners that are dependent upon it for their livelihood, but also because of the business people and the towns that exist throughout the Eastern and Murchison gold-fields. This country owes very much to those people because they come from pioneering stock. They went into the back country and opened up the mines, and as a consequence the adjacent pastoral country was developed. They did a great service to tbe development of this country. We cannot permit an industry like this to go out of existence; it deserves all the help that this or has made out a case for an increase in any other government can give to it. The Western Australian Government has been very sympathetic, as far as it has been able to go, in order to keep mines moving. Ft has established State batteries in various centres to encourage prospecting. This is a point that needs to be stressed in this debate. The question of the prospector and his services to this country cannot be over-estimated. To-day the work of a prospector is totally different, from what it was in earlier years. Easy gold-tba t is surface or alluvial gold-is not obtainable to-day and prospectors have to search for deeper gold so that new mines may take the place of otber mines as they go out of existence. Every person who has been associated with gold-mining or any other mining industry knows that a gold mine is a wasting asset. Gold, when taken out of tbe ground, cannot be replaced in the earth. Consequently, if new mines are to be found in order to keep the mining industry in existence, then the gold-mining industry must have encouragement, including financial assistance. 1 The present conditions are acceptable and will provide, for the time being, worthwhile assistance to the industry. However, I feel that the position could be improved if this Government would have presented. I had the opportunity to see the figures that were presented to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), and ] feel that the Chamber of Mines has made a strong case for an increase of tlwpresent bounty by at least £1 per oz. The chamber also asked that the act be extended for five years. Three years is not long enough to plan and make arrangements far enough ahead, but three years is certainly better than two years, the term provided in the act of 1954. Therefore, it is possible that three year? will be acceptable to the industry. The only fly in the ointment is that no provision has been made for the extra money that the industry deserves. I do not want to stress the point any longer. I just make this quiet appeal to the Treasurer to have another look at the figures that were presented. If he and his officers are satisfied that the industry the subsidy for each ounce of gold, I feel that it will not take very long to make a minor amendment to provide the extra allowance that we who are associated with the industry feel it justly deserves. -Very briefly I wish to speak in support of this measure, and I should like to draw the attention of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to an improvement to the bill which I believe should be included. The subsidy scheme was designed primarily to assist the mining industryand I emphasize mining. It was intended by tbe Government that assistance be given to people who are principally engaged in the production of gold-bparing materials from mines and from alluvial deposits. Honourable members may wonder why T, who renresent the larsre wheat-growing area of Wimmera, should speak on this measure dealing with gold, but my electorate contains an area thaf in the past was described as the richest alluvial gold area in the world. It produced the largest nugget ever found in Australia. As the honourable meinber for",26,Arthur Fadden
83,Mr Lawrence (Wimmera) [4.19].,"Kalgoorlie ( MrH . V. Johnson) said, gold mining deals with a wasting asset. I agree, but in my electorate is a man who is still producing gold in considerable quantities. He believes that with a staff of six men he can produce 900 ounces of gold per annum over a period of about ten years by treating old dumps. If his claim is correct, he would qualify for tbe subsidy on the basis of quantity, that is, he. would be producing over 500 ounces a year, but under the provisions of this nieasure he is not eligible for the subsidy because the gold comes from old dumps. I believe that he, and other men like bim, could be important contributors to the rectification of our balance of payments situation and 1 therefore ask the Treasurer to give sympathetic consideration to having included in this measure provisions to help people who can produce gold as this man expects to do.

In Committee of Ways and Means: In further amplification of what has Consideration resumed from the 17th been outlined generally by the honourable April (vide page 1369), on motion by member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Interpretation. 1 (1.) That, in this Resolution. . . ls. in the £1 has certain objectionable {vide page 13C7). [4.241 -The Opposition desires at this perience of proprietary stage formally to oppose the resolution which in the main are family concerns and to indicate its reasons in greater desirous, in the initial stages, of taking length when the bill upon which the advantage of the convenience of comresolution is founded is before the House. pany administration, know that it will Briefly, our reason for opposing the resobear heavily and unjustly upon small lution is not that we are opposed to companies. It is very doubtful indeed increases in company taxes, if such whether this tax will achieve the object increases are necessary, but that this parhoped for by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur ticular proposal is part of the anti-inflaFadden) and the Government. This tionary measures, so called, introduced by object is to raise approximately the Government in . its supplementary £33,000,000 per annum in addition to budget. These measures, so far as they the amount which we shall raise between apply to companies, will not take effect now and the end of this financial year. until returns are lodged after the 1st July, The problem that the Government is 1956, of the income, for the .previous twelve attempting to overcome is, in my opinion, months. So there'will be no gain in the revenue until those returns are assessed, which will be approximately between October, 1956, and the end of June, 1957. The Government claims that about £30,000,000 will be raised in the course of a financial year from the application .of this proposal. As the increase in rates is to amount to ls. in the £1 all round, this would seem to postulate that tbe Government estimates that company profits during the twelve months will aggregate about £600,000,000. The Opposition objects to this proposed increase because this crude, flat rate tax, which will bear equally on all companies, big or small, does not get to the seat of what tbe Australian Labour party believes to be one of the contributing causes of inflation, namely, the excessive prices being charged in the community. When the bill has been introduced, we propose to develop at some length, the reasons why we think the Government should have sought a better method of levying stage we formally oppose the resolution. When the bill has been introduced we shall argue our submissions at length. Mr R. W.

85,Mr Crean,"one of its own making. ""When, in 1953, this additional tax was removed, approximately £28,000,000 was handed back to the companies. Eepresentatives of the Chamber of Manufactures in Victoria have stressed that, because of the Government's vacillation, the effect of its financial policy upon companies is uncertain, and tbe results are chaotic, or tend to be chaotic. The tax is on, it is off, then it is on again. Provision for tax has to be made before the declaration of company profits and the payment of dividends therefrom, so tbere is every ground for supporting the accusation made that the Government's policy creates uncertainty and misgiving in industry generally. This is reflected in the action already taken by some companies to make provision for tax at the increased rates before declaring their profits and dividends. The method of declaring company profits after tax has been paid leads us the conclusion that, as f a r as company law and administration are concerned, income tax is a factor in determining the price structure to prevail in a particular industry. There is a tendency to take the tax into account when assessing tbe desired ' return and the dividend to be paid from over-all profits. I have taken out t h "" ratio of company profits to paid capital and one could draw an. analogv between ' that relationship and the position of the wage-earner, who is just as much a legal entity as is the company. He would be very pleased indeed to be able to receive, after paying taxation, a net 20 per cent, profit on the commodity that he has to sell, namely, bis labour. I am sure that he would be equally pleased if , even before paying taxation, he eould show a profit of 40 per cent, on his investment. That is the position that is disclosed here. Eecentlyi n tbe United States of America excessive profits earned by the General Motors Corporation were criticized in a Senate report. The same state of affairs applies in Australia. I shall not labour the point so far as this company is concerned, but an over-all review of its returns shows that the net profit, after paying taxation, is in the vicinity of 24 per cent, or 25 per cent. It is estimated that the dividend rate is about 18 per cent. That i? not a bad return after paying income tax. We have before us a measure wh'ish is ostensibly designed to prevent inflation. We oppose it on the ground that it w ill not do so. First, we believe that inflation would be checked by somethingmore, in the nature of an excess company profits tax. Secondly, the proposed tax does not go to the basis of the problem. It treats the effect rather than the cause. The underlying cause of inflation is excessive profits. I agree w it h the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) that this Government's policy is of a stop-gap character and is designed to cover up the cracks that have been created by the Government in the economic structure. Thirdly, the broad criticism of this tax is that it operates unfairly against the small company, the profit of which is in the vicinity of £2,000 per annum, as compared with the large company, the profit, of which approaches £50,000 per annum. When we consider that, of a total number of 2,300 companies, only 712 are in the higher income earning group we realize the unfair incidence of the proposed tax. It reminds one very much of the Government's flat sales tax rate, which is imnosed on all and sundry, rich and poorj high and low alike. N'o good purpose can be served by imposing this tax except that of bolstering up the tottering economic edifice which, the present Government has erected. I shall leave the more detailed criticism of the bill until it reaches the committee stage. should like the Treasurer to clear up one matter for me. I notice that ""cooperative company "" is to have the same meaning as it has in Division9 of Part III . of the assessment act. Then the schedule refers to the "" non-profit"" company. But the proposed increases w ill have general application. As I understand it , a "" co-operative "" society, under the Eochdale system, is a body of people banded together to purchase in bulk. Such societies have a balancing period of six months, at the end of which an examination is made to see whether there",28,Income Tax And Social Seevices Contbibution
86,Mr James (Hunter ) [4.35],"Ihas been, in effect, an overcharge for commodities, which could not be assessed at tbe time of the sale. If a society has accumulated a surplus a rebate is made for an overcharge on commodities that could not be accurately assessed at the time of the sale. Some persons who are antagonistic to co-operatives describe that rebate as a dividend, but it is not; it is a refund for an overcharge at the time of sale. It would be very wrong of the Government to tax co-operative societies as profit-making' companies. They have always been exempt from taxation in the general sense of the word. Therefore, I should like the Treasurer to say whether it is now proposed to tax co-operative societies. no alteration in the definition. The only alteration has been in the rate.

91,Lindsay. R. W. L . Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [4.45].,"honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr the companies will be sufficient to ensure ""Wentworth) presented some of bis ideas as to how the income tas legislation shouid be altered and gave some of his thoughts on saving in the community. When the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) explained this proposal in the Committee of Ways and Means, he estimated that an overall increase of Is. in the f l in the rate of company taxation would yield an additional £30,000,000 of revenue in the course of a complete assessment year. It would seem to me, from that statement, that his advisers anticipate that the aggregate amount of company profits earned in Australia for the financial year which will end on the 30th June, 1956, will be of the order of £600,000,000. I suggest that is a considerable sum in itself, and a considerable proportion of the national income. In Australia, as in a great number of --other countries, there are two kinds of ""Companies. There are companies, with a few minor exceptions, which we call private companies, and companies which we call public companies. The only 'difference in method of taxing the two types of companies is this: In the case of public companies, the first £5,000 -of taxable income is taxed at a rate which is ls. in the £1 less than the rest of the income; ancl in the case of private companies, the general tax is Is. less than that applicable to pnblic companies. But, in-addition, private companies are subject to a tax that is known as the undistributed profits tax. Apparently the genesis of the undistributed profits tax occurred in the early days of taxation in this country when many people found it convenient to form themselves into private or proprietary companies because, by so doing, they could evade a certain amount of tax liability. In order to close that loophole in the law, the principle of the undistributed profits tax was applied to private companies. No undistributed profits tax applies to public companies. Apparently, the -assumption underlying the taxing of those companies is that, because public companies have a lot of shareholders, the pressure of tbose shareholders on the »oards of management and directors of that they distribute the majority of their profits in the form of dividends. That might have been a reasonable assumption many years ago, but it is certainly not a reasonable assumption in this age which some people have described as. the age of managerial revolution where tbere is a divorce between what is called ownership of capital, for tlie one part, and thp management of capital for the other part. Nowadays, in many of our big companies, because there is a great number of shareholders who are not a cohesive unit, the shareholders exert very little control on the management of a company. The management becomes a bureaucracy of its own which is almost self-perpetuating. Therefore, the assumption that underlay the undistributed profits taxation in the past is, perhaps, no longer valid to-day. For that reason, I think that we need to look, sometimes, at the assumptions that underlie our taxation structure generally. This bill deals with the rateb of company tax and, again, we need to look at that particular form of taxation. At the moment, in Australia, something over £500,000,000 is being collected in income tax, which comprises tax on individuals and tax on companies. Approximately two-thirds of that total comes from individuals, and about one-third from companies. I think the budget estimate for this financial year is that £187,000,000 will be derived from tax on companies. That figure seems high until it is related to the fact that those companies, after allowing for depreciation, will be presumed to have taxable incomes of the order of £600,000,000so that, even after paying their taxes, there will still be £400,000,000 of profits left in the hands of the companies, out of which they can provide for capital expansion and for the distribution of dividends. There is, therefore, in the hands of the companies of Australia, a very important instrument affecting the future economic development of this country. When the Prime Minister spoke of tbe economic mea.sures for 1956, it is interesting to note that he pointed to the fact that there had been a large growth in capital demand in the private sector of the economy and which, he suggested, was one of the principal causes that had led to the infiationary situation. It is for this kind of reason that the Opposition suggests that the imposition of the crude flat rate of ls. in the f 1 company tax all round is not a means of tackling effectively this very important problem. Unfortunately, the statistics published by the Commissioner of Taxation are nearly two years behind the times, thus rendering it diflicult to obtain a complete picture of the current situation. Nevertheless, each year the Commissioner discloses in his annual report the details of the situation as it was some years previously. The Commissioner's last annual report is the 34th annual report, tabled in this House last year, which deals with the company income for the year ended the 30th June, 1953. There needs to be borne in mind the fact that the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure discloses that in that year the total profits from companies were of the order of £378,000,000. I suggested earlier that the taxation officials and the Treasury advisers are contemplating that this year taxable incomes from companies will be of the order of £600,000,000, an increase, in round figures, of from £400,000,000 to £600,000,000. I suggest that that picture be kept in mind when honourable members consider tbe figures that I am citing, and am about to cite. They are taken from the last report of the Commissioner for Taxation. Page 82 of that report discloses that there were 17,631 tax-paying private companies in the financial year 1952-53, with aggregate taxable incomes of £134,752,296. assessed after depreciation has already been provided for-and depreciation is expected to put a company in the same physical position at the end of the financial year as it was at the beginning of the same year. It does not allow for capital expansion, but it does provide for capital accretion and depreciation during the year. Tn the same year there were 5.242 public companies, with an aggregate taxable income of £270,505,020 after £25,315,187 had been allowed for depreciation. So, the aggregate picture in the year ended the 30th June, 1953, was that there were 22,873 tax paying companies, private and non-private, with an aggregate taxable income, of £405,257,316. There were a number of other minor companies that do not concern us here. Those private companies, whilst numbering more than three times the number of public companies, derived only one-third of the total of taxable income derived by the two sections together. That shows that the public company is by far the more significant economic unit. Further, the statistics issued by the Commissioner of Taxation give very important breakdowns of thosefiguresinto different levels of taxable income. I propose, for the purposes of this analysis, to take as the dividing line taxable income of £50,000 and to refer to companies as those with taxable income under £50,000 and those with taxable income over £50,000. In the case of private companies, 17,234 of them out of a total of 17,631 had taxable incomes of less than £50,000. Only 397« had taxable incomes in excess of £50,000. Those with taxable incomes less than £50,000 derived an aggregate taxable income of £91,455,507, and tbose which derived taxable incomes of more than £50,000 each had a total taxable income of £43,296,789. In the case of public companies, 4,247 out of a total of 5,242 had taxable incomes of less tban £50,000 each, and 995 had taxable incomes in excess of £50.000. Those with incomes of less than £50,000 derived a total taxable income of £39,874,496, and those with taxable incomes over £50,000, although numbering only 995 of the total of 5,242, derived an aggregate taxable income of £230.630,527. That is an indication that These figures are very few companies in this country derive the majority of the taxable incomes that are earned. Total company tax pajd by the two types of company aggregated £116,650,S67, of which about £33,000,000 was paid by private companies and £83,545,848 by public companies. Again, if the division into those earning incomes of more than £50,000, annually, and those earning less than £50,000 is used, the total tax paid by private companies earning less than £50,000 was £21,353,388, and the total paid by those earning more than £50,000 was £11,795,313. Public companies which earned under £50,000 taxable income paid £11,751,451 and tbose that earned in excess of £50,000 paid £71,750,335 in taxes.

I repeat that 1,392 companies, or 6.1 per cent, of companies in Australia earned 67 per cent, of taxable profits. They paid taxes totalling £83,545,848 out of total company taxes of £116,650,867, or 71.6 per cent, of all taxes. Thus, setting aside for tbe moment these technicalities which might surround an excess profits tax, it ought to be clear that two-thirds of all capital profits are derived by approximately 1,400 companies throughout Australia, so that if profits are excessive-and we of the Labour party claim that they are excessive -the n the bulk of them are concentrated wbicb is expressed in a form that is easy to follow and, witb the consent'of honourable members, I shall incorporate the table in Hansard.

Large profits and excessive profits may be presumed to go together. Let us look a little more closely at those companies wbich derive profits of more than £50,000-that is, 67 per cent, of the tax field. Tbe figures for the financial year 1952-53 wbich 1 have already cited indicate a concentration of profits in the hands of public companies with taxable incomes in excess of £50,000. Nine hundred and ninety-five, or 4.4 per cent., of public companies derived profits totalling £230,630,524, or 57 per cent, of all profits earned by companies. The concentration in the hands of private companies is not so great, although it is still disproportionate. Three hundred and ninety-seven, or 1.8 per cent., of private companies made profits totalling £43,296,789, or 10.7 per cent, of all profits. holders participated in those profits? I ask the honourable member to let me indicate, first, that a very few big companies derive the bulk of the taxable income in the community. I want to make that point clear. However, when we further dissect the number of public companies witb taxable incomes in excess of £50,000 into various income groups, we find an alarming concentration of economic power in the Australian economic system, as was indicated in the foregoing table. These statistics also are taken directly from the 34th report of the Commissioner of Taxation. The report discloses that, in the financial year 1952-53, 995 public companies had taxable incomes totalling £230,630,524, compared with a total for all public companies of £270,505,020, earned by 5,242 companies. ' This, of course, is the income after providing for depreciation. The 995 companies paid £71,750,335 in income tax out of a total of £83,501,786 paid by all public companies. in dividends £68,765,265 out of a total of £87,932,071 paid by all public companies. during the financial year, plant worth £69,271,409, out of a total of £84,098,208 purchased by all public companies. They possessed, at tbe end of the financial year, taxation returns at tbe central office. plant and machinery at book values totalling £240,256,360, out of a total of £295,096,143 possessed by all public companies. They had stock on hand worth a total of £430,927,570 out of a total of £550,663,376 for all public companies. [ submit that these figures show a considerable degree of concentration, but the concentration is intensified the higher we go up the income scale. I propose now to take tbe public companies in tbe largest income categoriesthose with incomes in tbe range from £500,001 to £1,000,000, and tbose with incomes over £1,000,000-and to indicate the position in percentages and in aggregate. Eighty-five of these companies, or 1.6 npr cent, of tbe total, made profits totalling £106,995,025, after allowing £9,232,917 for depreciation. These companies derived 39.55 per cent, of tbe total promts, nnd paid taxes totalling £33,782,893, r 40.5 per cent, of the 0 total tax paid by public companies. They paid dividends totalling £27,853,756, or 31.7 per cent, of tbe total for all publie companies. Tbey possessed plant and machinery at book values totalling £117,104,845, or 39.7 per cent, of the total for all public companies. They had stock on hand totalling £169,486,123, or 30.8 per cent, of the total for all public companies. They purchased, during the financial year, plant totalling £37,661,9-53, or 44.8 per cent, of the total for all public companies. They were allowed for depreciation a total of £9,232,917, or 36„45> per cent, of the total for all public companies. As well as tbe public companieslisted, there were three private companies with taxable incomes totalling £1,886,000, which paid taxes totalling £535,183, andwhich derived taxable profits in the range from £500,001 to £1,000,000. Tbere was also one private company witb a taxable income of £1,505,000. Let us look also at the interests from which these large profits were derived. They paid Again, this information can be obtained' from the 34th report of the Commissioner of Taxation. Of the 85 public companies They purchased, mentioned earlier-4 7 witb taxable incomes in the range from £500,001 to £1,000,000, and 38 with taxable incomes' in excess of £1,000,000-6 6 lodge their This means that they derive income from more than one State. In other words,, they are national giants. The four private companies that I have mentioned*, with profits in excess of £500,000 lodge their returns at tbe central office; They^. too, operate on a national scale. Among: the companies classified as agricultural^ grazing and dairying, two had incomes* in the rauge from £500,001 to £1,000,000. Among tbose classified as mining and quarrying, two had taxable incomes in thei range from £500,001 to £1,000,000, and three had taxable incomes in excess of £1,000,000. Companies classified asmanufacturing are separated into a number of groups. In tbe founding, engineering and' metal-working group, nine had? taxable incomes in the range from £500,001 to £1,000,000, and six had incomes in excess of £1,000,000. In thenext group-assembl y repairs of sbips, vehicles, parts and accessories-on e had* a taxable income in the range from",30,Temporary Chairman Mr Second Reading

93,Mr Crean,"I am coming to that,£500,001 to £1,000,000, and four had taxable incomes exceeding £1,000,000. Of course, we have a fairly good idea where a major part of that comes from. In 1952-53, the taxable incomes of four companies with taxable incomes in excess of £1,000,000 totalled £14,43S,000. In the last financial year, one company alone has recorded a taxable income in excess oF £15,000,000. I distinguish between what some companies call their income after taxes and the amount which the Coinrnissioner of Taxation regards as liable to tax, which is the concept that I nse here. In tbe textile and fibrous materials group of public companies, two had taxable incomes in the range from £500,001 to £1,000,000. In the rubber goods and leatherware group, three companies bad taxable incomes in excess of £1,000,000. In the food, drink and tobacco group, two bad taxable incomes in tbe range from £500,001 to £.1,000,000, and five had taxable incomes exceeding £1,000,000. In the paper, paper products, printing, bookbinding and photography group, three companies had taxable incomes in tbe range from £500,001 to £1,000,000. and one bad a taxable income in excess of £l;000,000. In all tbe other manufactures group, four companies had tax -able incomes in the range from £500,00.1 to £1,000,000, and two bad taxable incomes exceeding £1,000,000. That con-eludes the companies classified as manufacturing. In the classification of electricity, gas and tbe like, two companies had taxable incomes in the range from £500,001 to £1,000,000. In the shipping and stevedoring classification, one company had a taxable income in this range. In the wholesale and retail trade classification, five companies had taxab'lp incomes in this range, and three had taxable incomes in excess of £1,000.000. Tn the live-stock ancl primary produce -dealing classification, four companies had taxable incomes in the range from £. .00,001 to £1,000,000, and three had r taxable incomes exceeding £1,000,000. In the investments holding charge classification, two companies had taxable incomes in the range from £500,001 to £1.090,000. In the banking classification, -one company h'ad .a taxable income in this range, aud six bad taxable incomes exceeding £1,000,000. In the life insurance classification, two companies had taxable incomes in the range from £500,001 to £1,000,000, and one hacl a taxable income in excess of £1,000,00"". Altogether. 47 companies had taxable incomes iu the range from £500,001 tu £1,000,000, and 38 companies had taxable incomes exceeding £1,000,000. Three private companies had taxable incomes in thc ranj,e from £i 00,001 to £1,000,000, and one had a taxable income in excess of £1,000,000. It must be emphasized that these figures are more than two years old, because they relate to incomes derived during the financial year ended the 30th June, 1953. Oompany profits have increased considerably since, a3 tbe last ""White Paper on National Income and Expenditure indicates. In a document tabled by the Treasurer when he presented his last budget, the estimated profit for the year that ended in June, 1955, was put at £505,000,000. Apparently the Treasurer presumes that, for tbe year that will end in June, 1956, the figurr will be £600,000,000. The general trend, however, is clear. There is a considerable aggregation of profits in tbe hands of relatively few companies. We must consider, not only that concentration, but also the aggregate transactions passing through the hands of incorporated businesses in Australia. After all expenses have been deducted, clear profits amount to £600,000,000, so we can see that, if companies work on a turnover basis of 20 per cent, or something of that kind, transactions involving about £3,000,000,000 are passing through their hands. I have already indicated tbe kind of economic concentration that is taking place. It can be seen that the few very big companies in Australia must exert an influence out of all proportion to tbeir number. Published figures do not reveal everything, but tbey do indicate general tendencies. When we realize that in the financial year 1952-53 profits, before depreciation, were in the region of £450,000,000, the total national income then being £4,000,000,000, we see that the actual turnover of goods and services by these concerns .must be truly gigantic-possibl y of the order of more than a half of the national income. Further, during one year, these concerns purchased plant, as distinct from buildings, worth nearly £120,000,000a significant part of gross private investment in this field. In addition, aggregate holding of plant at over £400,000,000 and stocks at nearly £800,000,000 are also significant in influencing future economic development. As has been suggested, if tbere are excessive profits-w e suggest there arethe bulk of them are to be found among relatively few concerns. As profits, in any case, arise out of prices charged for goods and services, it seems obvious wuere vve should first look for the genus '-' excess profits"". When Labour suggested an excess profits tax during tbe last general election campaign, we were accused of being arbitrary because we took tbe starting point as at £25,000. It was said that we paid no regard to paid-up capital. That was hardly a fair description of what was intended, but it should be pointed out that the present basis of company taxation pays no regard to paid-up capital. The increases that are contemplated by this Government pay no regard to paid-up capital, but will be imposed at the same flat rate on all companies, irrespective of their paid-up capital and irrespective of tbe number of shareholders involved. The basis of taxation is profit made, irrespective of pa nihil employed. Apart from the first 000 of taxable income and tbe differential of Is. in favour of private companies-tbes e are subject to another tax on undistributed profits and represent only one-third of the field, in any casebig and small are taxed alike already. Labour's proposals at least had the merit of excluding the bulk of the taxpayers-but , of course, by no means tbe bulk of the tax yield-fro m the appli-tion of an excess profits tax. In the light of the figures that I have analysed, or must incline to the view that criticism "" ' our proposals was tinctured by concern for vested interest rather than actuated by principles of equity-unles s the critics were ignorant of the kind of figures that T have cited. What form an excess profit. 0 tax should take may be a matter for some difference of opinion, but this much, at least, is clear-that although it is big; interests which get the most profits, present tax methods treat big and small alike. Tbere seems to be a case for, at least, a better graduated system of company taxation. In Australia, profits before tax represent something in the region of oneeighth of tbe national income. Last year,, the figure was about £500,000,000 and this. year it is expected to be £600,000,000. In round figures, the national income, at gross product rates, is about £4,800,000,000. In the United States,, company profits aggregate about 40,000,000,000 dollars, out of a total national income of 320,000,000,000dollars, but in that country, which is regarded as the apotheosis of private enterprise, taxes take nearly 50 per cent, of profits, whereas in Australia, prior to the present increase, taxes took less thai: one-third of profits. If American rates were in force in Australia, the current additional yield from company taxation might be of the order of £80,000,000. The rates in force in America do not appear to bave brought bankruptcy and ruin in their train. As an indication of what a reduction of company tax meant in this country a year or two ago, let me quote a passage from the budget speech delivered by the Treasurer on the 9th September, 1953. In the course of that speech, the right honourable gentleman saidI t is proposed that the rntes of tax payable by public companies on incomes of the year ended the 30th June, 1053, will be 6s. in the £1 on the first £5.0°0 of taxahlp incmne and 7s. in the £1 on the ba'ance of taxahle income. Asi t is not proposed to re-enact the additional levy of 2s. in the £1 in 1951-52 and 1052-53, the proposed rates represent, in the generality of eases, a reduction in tax of Is. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income and 2s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. A reduction of. Is. in the £1 was also made in the rate of tax applicable hprivate companies. The effect of these reductions was that in the financial year 1953-54 the yield from income tax on companies was £134,000,000, as against £167,000,000 in the previous year. That represented a concession in that yeftr from the figures I have given we can see where the bulk of the concession wentof £33,000,000. I suggest that that concession, given then, aggravated the inflation that still rages unabated in this country, due to the policies of this Government. The Government proposes now to reimpose a half of that 2s. in tbe £1 reduction. It is estimated that the increase will yield another £30,000,000. In the year to which the figures that I cited previously referred, total taxable profits were about £400,000,000. The tax paid was about £105,000,000 and dividends amounted to about £120,000,000. So there was still left in the hands of the companies approximately £175,000,000, over the spending of which tbey had full control. That determined, very largely, the pattern of investment in this country. It is the pattern of investment here which certain people regard as being a disturbing element of the economy at tbe moment. On page 15 of the Treasury bulletin that was tabled a few days ago, it was stated that in the year ended in June, 1955, the net amount of cash raised from investors by Australian companies listed on the stock exchange was £S6,200,000. Let us assume that total profits this year will be £600,000,000, that tax will be £220,000,000 and that dividends will be £120,000,000. That means that the major portion of the finance necessary for company expansion in Australia does not come from new investment. It comes from profits ploughed back by existing companies. That means that in Australia, because of the aggregation of interests in very few hands, the' pattern of future economic development is dictated by a very small group indeed. Reinvestments of profits is about three times as great as new company investment. I submit that in this country, in whicli there is a need for national development, some private and some public, there ought to be rather more public and less private development, because private development is extending in directions that are not always the be3t for the economic health of this community. We have seen tbe dilemma in which the Government has found itself in trying to restrict the import of motor car parts while there is operating in Australia a company that earned last year a gross profit, after allowing for depreciation, of tbe order of £15,000,000. On this it paid £6,000,000 in taxes, and then remitted £4,000,000 to overseas shareholders, which was a drain on our dollar reserve. The residue bas been ploughed back to earn even greater profits in the future, and the company is following that course at a time when the Government is trying to cut down expenditure on motor cars and parts. That is the kind of difficulty into which a government gets when it practises the gospel of private enterprise, holding up its hands at any suggestions of economic planning. This great country cannot develop unless there is intelligent co-ordination of the various developmental activities. I wish to reply briefly to the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan), who suggested that the big companies were really the preserve of the widows and orphans. Unfortunately, the Commissioner of Taxation did not furnish us with very up-to-date information about Australian dividends. The Commissioner's 33rd report, which was for the year ended June, 1952, showed that in that year income from dividends amounting to £52,000,000 was included in taxable income. Of that sum, £41,000,000 was received by people with incomes of over £1,000. In the sarae year, of 2,700,000 taxpayers, only 270,000 had incomes in excess of £1,000, and 150,000 of those bad no income from property. Assuming that all the remaining 120,000 persons received some dividends, they would represent only a very small proportion of the Australian population. As a matter of reality, nothing like that number of persons are shareholders. Sometimes people try to advance the myth that these big companies are actually comprised of a large number of small people. I suggest that, so far as the major public companies of Australia are concerned, that is not true. If those companies were honest and published a list of their share holders-a t most of the State registeries such lists can be searched for a couple of shillings-it would be found that they are controlled by a very few people. In any case, because of what has been called tbe managerial revolution, there is a wide gulf between ownership and control. The average small shareholder has virtually no say in electing tlie board of directors of tbe Gompany of wbicb be is supposed to be a part owner. Tbe election is out and dried, from tbe start, and tbe shareholder bas virtually no control. Our principal reason fbr opposing the bill is that this measure, which the Government has introduced aspart of its anti-inflation proposals, is not hitting the source of large profitsI t seeks to impose a flat increase of ls. in the £ 1 irrea flat increase of company tax, is one of spective of the size of the companies. It bears with equal, force upon the 1,000 or more companies that earn, two-thirds of the total amount of company profits as it does upon the 21,000 companies, which earn the remaining, one-third. On that ground alone, this proposed increase of company tax' is unjust in its incidence. As the measure will not become operative until returns are lodged after the. lst July, and' as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has recently directed attention to tbe fact that one of the most disturbing factors making for inflation was the growth of capital demand in the private sector of the economy, the Government ought to give more serious consideration to this matter. I remind honourable members that the greater part of the growth of capital demand in theprivate sector represents the ploughed-back profits of these economic giants in our midst. The decision about how much shall be ploughed back and where it shall be re-applied rests with tbe management of these companies, who form a very small section of tbe community. It is tbey who determine how much shall be ploughed back or held in reserve, and how much shall be distributed in dividends. In Australia, the pattern seems to be that a little more tban one-quarter of profits is paid in taxes, approximately one-quarter is paid out as dividends, and slightly less than one-half is re-invested in the enterprise. We say that tbose profits are the result of excessive prices, and that one thing that the companies eould do, if they were philanthropic cowardsthe small people, would be to give some benefit to them in the form of lower prices for the goods that they sell over their counters. If they did that, they would be doing something to abate the effects of inflation and to restore the stanpressing problem in connection witb the dard of living of tbe average Australian, who isa wage-earner or pensioner dependent on a fixed, income. As an alternative to increasing his wages, one methodof raising his standard of living would be to charge lower prices for the goods and services upon wbich he chooses tospend his income. [5.29-]' -This bill, which seeks to impose tbe economic measures that were announced by the Prime Minister' ( Mr Menzies) on the 14th March. It is one in which, even supporters of the Government can take no great pleasure, butmust re*gard it as a. means of"" dealing witb certain economic problems witb which we are 1 confronted. I listened with considerable interest to the very scholarly speech of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), and. I sbould like to compliment: him on the amount of effort that he put into preparing the various statements that he placed before the House; but it waswith a certain amount of disappointment that I waited for the arguments that should bave proceeded from thepresentation of that mass of detail. Itseemed to me that, beyond sayingthat a flat-rate increase would be less disadvantageous to a large and successful company than to asmaller one, he did not suggest wby he opposed the measure: The honourable member, as far as I can-see, did not really touch on any alternative to solve the problems with which we are faced, although he admitted that be believes in development under Government auspices probably more so than under private auspices. When I analysethe mass of detail that be prepared in order to see what came out of it, I find', with a certain amount of disappointment, tiiat the eagle has hatched a very small eggI said before that I personally have no great pleasure in supporting any measurethat involves increased taxation, but I think everyone will agree that the development of certain economic conditions in Anstralia has imposed obligations on the Government. This increase in company taxis one of the measures by which the Government hopes to solve one bridgingof the gap between the available",34,Table Ii
94,Mr Mackinnon (Corangamite),"funds from public investment sources and tlie requirements of tbe States to carry on their developmental works, which the Commonwealth bas virtually underwritten. The bonorable member for Melbourne Ports said that he believed in development, so theoretically he should believe in any measure that would assist with that problem. This matter has been thrashed out fairly thoroughly in previous debates, so I do not want to dwell on the necessity for providing sumcient sums to bridge the gap between the money available from investment sources and the amount required to carry out State works programmes. I have been in this House when four alterations have been made in company taxation. If I remember rightly, it was reduced in 1950-51, increased in 1952, and reduced again in 1953, and now additional company tax is being imposed. So we can only hope that the pendulum will swing again in the right direction and that in due course, when the ship of State has steered clear of the rocks represented by lack of investment money, action will be taken to reduce company tax once more. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports made rather a sweeping generalization wben he said he considered that large profits and excessive profits went hand in hand. That is oue of the basic weaknesses of the Labour party in its approach to development, particularly the private side of development, in this Commonwealth of ours. There is a tendency to regard anything that is large and successful in the community as frightening, something that must be dealt with before it gets too big. Et seems to me that that is a basic weakness in a country like Australia which, to achieve its dynamic future possibilities, poly-provide s for security and makes must, by the very nature of things, build up institutions and corporations of great strength financially so that they can stand up to the recessions that may occur from time to time. man come in? honourable member for Yarra that out of small things big things arise. It would be hard to find a small concern in Australia to-day that did not hope in due course to expand and have a greater impact on the general financial structure of the country. If we were discussing that subject, I would say that the biggest monopolist in the community to-day is that person who believes sincerely in the form of socialism where the whole control of everything is under one great socialist structure. Let us have less of this rubbish about monopolies from those who support the State monopoly to the f u l l ! When this question of profits comes up, my mind turns back to the debates in this House when the last reduction of company tax took place. I recall that Opposition members said in indignant tones that this was a terrific windfall for General Motors-Holden's Limited and certain other large public corporations. In fact, Opposition members said it was wrong to reduce the company tax because the effect would be to return to a number of corporations-and Opposition members always pick on the big successful ones-some thing that they should not receive. It is an extraordinary paradox that they are now reversing their argument. They oppose an increase of company tax for the opposite reason. However, they are consistent in their inconsistency. Let me touch on the point I made before-the one that attacks the large corporation. I believe that large and successful corporations develop in Australia mainly because the public want that type of thing. I admit the socialist does not want it, but the general publie of Australia believe that the amalgamation of institutions within reasonable limits-no t to produce a complete monoa much better contribution ' to the general national economy. I believe that those people who work in big industries also support them because an institution, by its financial stability, can afford to provide better conditions of employment and, more importantly, will, by its own financial strength, guarantee employees a greater measure of security. Tbose people wbo attack such institutions as tbe large top-hamper institutions that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to, would find that",38,Table Ii

There is another point that must not -be lost sight of in connection with this matter. By virtue of their strength, the big companies can bring about a far higher degree of efficiency in production designed for the very same purpose. tion. That is possibly tbe most valuable .argument to-day, when Australia is trying to deal with rising costs and produce articles for export in competition with the manufactures of other parts of the world. The high degree of efficiency that can be produced by a bigger turn-over is a major point, and one that con-cerns vitally the national economy. I do not want to weary the House, but I should like to conclude on this note: I , for one, take no pleasure in increasing after payment of taxes. The committee taxes, and I hope that tbe pendulum will swing when this Government, by its -successful measures, has steered the ship -of State again to still waters. Mr R. W. HOLT (Darebin) [5.39] It is debatable just how long the economy, sunder the present system, can stand the Melbourne Ports has asked is that we -effects of the lack of direction over should have some similar legislation in private investment. Direction is necesthis country. In the absence of such sary to restore to theeconomy generally legislation, tbe Treasurer ( Sir Arthur that degree of stability which will engenFadden) has in his control, through the der a re-creation of confidence in tbe budget, a very effective means of imposnation and its ability to overcome the ing upon private enterprise the curbs difliculties that look like surmounting it which are so necessary to a proper social .at present.

If we accept as correct as an effort to bridge the gap between the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr the amount of money needed for public Menzies) that the measure is designed to works and tbe amount of loan money combat inflation, it is amazing to recall -available for that purpose. We conthat the Treasurer, in his budget speech "" -elude, therefore, that the success of the of the 9th September, 1953, in which he -effort is, to say the least, uncertain. On announced the lifting of this very impost, the one hand, this measure is revenuesaid that the reduction of income and producing, and on the other it is essentia] company taxation would benefit almost to combat inflation. The honourable memeverybody, and that the object was to ber alleged that honourable members on encourage effort, enterprise and saving. this side of the House believed in one Now, the very reverse procedure is heing great monopoly, but he also advanced the adopted in order to stop inflation and tc opinion that the Australian people prefer the formation of large concerns or monopolies in particular industries. It is indeed strange that in the United Kingdom there is an excess profits tax designed to produce tbe desirable state which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has so expertly described, and that America has anti-trust legislaTbe Sydney Morning Herald of the 26th April contained reference to the report of a United States Senate committee criticizing the profits of the General Motors Corporation. The corporation was called upon to cut its ill-earned profits and to give something back to tbe people. The Senate committee considered this advisable and desirable in the interests of the economy as a whole. The report noted that the corporation made a profit in 1955 of 31 per cent, on paid capital considered that, in view of the extremely high level of profits over such a long period, the interests of the consumer should receive stronger recognition by the company in the form of lower prices. All that the honourable member for encourage saving, and to achieve the effects which were then desired but wbich obviously were not achieved. In other words, the present situation is a kind of Frankenstein monster created by the Government by its inactivity and inability to cope with the problem. As the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) said, the measure is designed to patch up the cracks appearing in the economy. Tbe only other point which I desire to stress is the adverse effect which this tax will have upon the economy of the country generally. Companies can, to a certain extent, make provision for passing on this tax. The assessing of companies' profits after the deduction of tax does give them some means of making provision for taxation, and therefore this measure will have the reverse effect to that intended by the Government. Its effect will be to increase, not to reduce, prices. Eecently, various companies bave increased prices, but tbe wage structure has not contributed to these rises. I submit that increased sales and company tax will have exactly the opposite effect to that which the Government says is intended. They will not have an anti-inflationary effect. Figures cited by the lionorable member for Melbourne Ports show that we have approximately 23,000 companies, 60 per cent, of whose income is earned by 700 of them. This discloses a serious aggregation of. the nation's wealth in the hands of a privileged few. Mr R. W. HOLT -The honourable meinber may regard my statement as r r bish, but I submit that that is not the correct attitude to adopt when considering the proposed increase. The payment of terrifically high taxes is not rubbish, and I direct the honourable member's attention to some figures which I have compiled in respect of various companies selected at random. In all cases, these figures show a tremendous salting away into reserves of excess profits upon which tax has been paid. These reserves constitute an immense reservoir which could, in the hands of a capable Treasurer in an efficient government, be turned to the benefit of society as a whole. Humes Limited, which has a paid capital of measure to control inflation. The Prime £2,000,000, made a net profit of £705,000 Minister's analysis of tbe causes of the in 1955 after payment of tax, or 35 per cent, of paid capital, and declared a dividend of 17£ per cent. Waugh and Josephson Limited, with a paid capital of £500,000, declared a dividend of 12$ per cent, out of a net profit of £207,000, representing 40 per cent, profit on ""paid capital. Macphersons Limited, with a paid capital of £3,000,000, finished 1955 with a modest net profit of 22 per cent, on paid capital. Electrolytic Zinc Company (Australia) Limited, with a paid capital of £3,000,000, made a net profit in 1955 of approximately £2,400,000, after paying tax. It declared a dividend of 55 per cent, which, in ratio to the capital invested, shows a net profit of 80 per cent, for the year 1954. These figures show the truth of what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has said. They certainly show that tbere is ground for considering the imposition of a system of taxation which would take a fairer proportion from those most able to pay, and have a lesser impact on those least able to pay. On that ground alone, we believe, this proposal should not be supported. bill is designed to increase company tax by ls. in the £1. It is expected that this will produce in revenue about £30,000,000 in the course of a full financial year. Measures of this sort are vital to the policy of the Opposition. They reveal, as have so many other tax measures, the extent to which the Government is out to protect large cornorations and monopolies. Our opposition to them reveals the extent to which Labour desires to ensure that taxation shall be imposed in general relation to ability to pay. The main increases in tax proposed by the Prime Minister on the 14th March last merely throws the burden upon the consumer. But we are told that tbe purpose of this tax proposal: is, first, to control inflation and, secondly, to raise revenue. We take the view that it will not effectively control inflation, and that £30,000,000 revenue could be raised in a better way. Let us first examine the tax as a",39,Table Ii
97,Mr Andbkson,Rubbish!,41,Table Ii
98,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [5.52],"Tb epresent inflationary situation placed the greatest stress upon consumption expenditure. If this assumption is accepted there is a natural tendency to rely upon taxes on consumption, and to control hire purchase. The Labour party disagrees with that interpretation, and has shown clearly enough that our inflation is really a profit inflation. In the course of this debate the honourable member for Melbourne Ports enormous extent of company profits and the honourable member for Darebin( Mr inconsistent with that. I ask for leave R. W. Holt) has given us individual company returns. I do not think that at any other stage in Australian history have rates of profit been so fantastically higb, or have such huge aggregate profits been taken out of the Australian economy in the form of dividends or undistributed profits held back for later investment. Many of those who apparently support this kind of thing-for instance farmers and small producers-ar e more damaged by it than are otber sections of the community. ""Wages and costs have, only too obviously, risen less rapidly since 1953 than have prices and, consequently, the margin between prices and costs has widened. This has already been shown by thefiguresproduced during this debate. The Financial Review, a newspaper devoted to the production of such information, reveals that as at the beginning of this year 1,080 companies had received an average return of 18£ per cent, on capital invested. They included a great many small companies, the net profits of which were considerably less than 18-^ per cent., and large companies such as were described by the honourable member for Darebin, and the returns of which were more than 40 per cent. Therefore, the Opposition says that the type of company taxation that is proposed in the bill is inappropriate to cope with excess profits, which are the real cause of our present inflation. It is inappropriate because it is a flat-rate tax which imposes upon the companies with small rates, and small aggregates, of profit the same burden as it imposes upon mammoth concerns which are profiteering so extensively. A flat rate is the opposite to tax on excess profits. We say that there should be a graduated tax upon profits. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) asked for certain information, but was so disinterested in the debate that he left the chamber after making his contribution to it. I have now much pleasure in providing the information that he sought. To check inflation the highest taxation should be imposed on the companies earning the highest profits. It is upon that fundamental point thai has shown the we base our case for the control of inflation. The tax proposed by this bill is to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. Debate resumed from the 3rd May (vide page 1764), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. measure has been cited as the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1956. We learn from the preamble that the measure is designed to promote export trade with otber countries and that the medium for the promotion of this trade is to be the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. It is intended that the corporation shall function in such a manner as to provide insurance against tbose risks wbicb are not normally covered by ordinary commercial insurance. That is, briefly, the ostensible purpose of this measure. I think that it can be confirmed by a perusal of the second-reading speech of that the real reason for the introduction of this measure at this time is the critical position in which the Government finds itself in regard to the balanco of payments position. It is perfectly obvious that the terms of trade between Australia and the rest of the world are not good. We have been importing, and, I believe, are still importing more goods than we are exporting, in the monetary sense, to pay for them. In those circumstances, any government must cast",41,Table Ii
99,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [8.0],This,42,Mcewen
100,The Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen),"around to see by what manner of means it could remedy such a state of affairs. Among other steps which the Government proposes to take is this measure. It will be readily seen from the MinisHe probably insures against risk of shipter's explanatory speech that sometliing is to be undertaken which will involve this country iu an obligation to the people who export goods from it. In order to emphasize that fact, the bill indicates that the measure of assistance or relief proposed will directly fasten a responsibility, eventually, upon the Government and the people. In the first instanceancl it may be final in some oases-the responsibility of a financial character will reside with the Australian Government itself, l t is strange but, nevertheless, true that the measure provides a cover only for that type of insurance risk which the commercial insurance companies do not normally undertake. Tn other words, in the state of society under which we live, when the Government bumps up against a difficult financial problem that is due to the fact that private enterprise which is ordinarily engaged in the covering of insurance risks will not undertake a responsibility that may become unpayable, the Government-unde r tbe terms of this measure, anyhow-says , "" We shall undertake the responsibility. We shall set up an organization. We shall back it to the extent of £500,000 initial capital. And we shall see to it that at no one stage shall the liability undertaken by this guarantee corporation exceed £25,000,000."" May I say, at this stage, that it seems strange-bu t I suppose it is understandable in regard to a government with the political philosophy of this Government -that the Government should seek to undertake possibly unprofitable business which uo commercial concern woulcl undertake and, at the same time, avoid and evade the undertaking of commercial insurance? stances, when private enterprise needs the Government to carry the baby, a wise government will ensure that it also enjoys the pickings which are available in tbe form of ordinary commercial insurance. Every exporter and every primary producer knows that there are types of risk in relation to our export trade wbich are fi -[78] covered by commercial insurance companies. The exporter goes to an insurance company and insures against marine risks. He insures against risk of theft. wreck, and he can obtain other forms of insurance. But be is not able to insure against the type of risk which is to be undertaken by the corporation which is to be set up and backed by the Australian Government. We bave been told that the types of insurance that the Government corporation will undertake will cover risks that, occur in regard to the insolvency of a purchaser of Australian goods in an overseas country. An overseas purchaser might go insolvent. An overseas government might change its exchange rate. A government might block tbe exchange of its currency. There might be rebellion. There might be war. There might be revolution. That is the type of risk that the Government proposes to cover in this measure. Her Majesty's Opposition does not object to a coverage of that type, but we do say that if the Government undertakes the most risky business, it would be good business and wise practice also to engage in the ordinary, very profitable marine and other insurance in which commercial companies engage. old story. Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) would say, "" TeU us the old, old story"", because this Government believes that all the pickings, all the profits, all the high dividends, and all the profiteering activity should go to private enterprise. If one makes a wide and wise survey of the present situation, one finds that we are involved in our present balance of payments difficulties, directly and indirectly, by virtue Surely, in these circumof the lack of business acumen of this Government, which believes in leaving everything to private enterprise, including the payment of excessive dividends and including the right to reap excessive profits; including the right to put up prices to any level that is desired; including the right of interstate shipping companies to bleed the primary producers;",42,Mcewen
101,Sir Ekic Harbison,Tel l us the old.,43,Mcewen
102,Mr Pollard,"I knew that theincluding the right of every faction that desires to take advantage of the common people in order to suck their blood. The Government believes that private enterprise should have an open slather. If one reason is more important than another for our adverse balance of trade, it is that. I am not surprised that the Vice President of tbe Executive Council glories in that state of affairs, but tbe time has come when drastic measures have to be taken by tbe Government, measures of a character which w ill substantially harm primary producers and which w ill substantially harm commercial concerns in this country. And more important still, they w ill substantially harm the workers of this country-the labouring, tbe artisan, the professional, the clerical and the scientific sections of tbe community. Tbe Government's remedies w ill bring hardship to those people, whereas, if the Government had intruded its measures at an earlier stage, such hardships would not necessarily have had to be imposed on them. When the Government comes to the last ditch, it talks about remedial action. course, is of a rather arduous and difficult character. Strange as it seems, Mr Deputy Speaker, we find that this type of legislation is not exclusive to Australia. The United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany-tb e Minister himself has confirmed this-hav e been from time to time over the years-som e over a long period of time and some over a shorter period of time-engagin g in this kind of insurance to assist their exporters to gain markets in other countries. In some instances the terms of the insurancn cover, the guarantees given to the exporter, are substantially better than are the terms of the guarantees to be given under this measure. As a matter of fact, I understand that thp. Cauadian export authority can engacre in all forms of export insurance, including marine and fire risks. But this Government is more narrow in its approach. It, takes the first step, and I may sav that tbe Opposition looks on the bill as what nri.<rht be called a TUP^R ha"" of b""""ps with no meat-jus t a skeleton! Desiring to be constructive in relation to this matter, because we favour the general principle involved, realizing the need in this poor old world for us to compete in overseas markets and establish export credits in order that we may be able to pay for our imports, we support the measure, in general terms, but on to this bag of bare old bones, before the debate is concluded we shall endeavour to put more meat and muscle. We shall try to improve i l . I have dealt with the general principle of the measure. BeforeI go further let me say that it would appear, at this stage of human development, that in every country where there is a capitalist government, or a dictatorship either of the left or the right, mankind, particularly in what we would call the most civilized section of the world, has shown itself capable of solving, and indeed has almost solved, the problems of production, but has not solved in any country, including Australia, the great problem of distribution. We have the shocking state of affairs that many countries, particularly the United States, are producing surpluses of goods and, as was pointed And tbe remedial action, of out. by tbe Ministerf o r Trade in his speech on the Address-in-Reply, are throwing their surpluses on to tbe world's markets. . In that great country which has probably solved more of the problems of production than any other country, production is now so extravagantly high I refer, of course, to the United States -that it is throwing its surpluses on to the world's markets, in some cases giving them away, to the detriment of the producers and exporters of Australia and other countries. To some extent our primary industry is producing in excess of our own needs, and the time may come when our secondary industry also will be producing in excess of our need3. Over-production is now common to many countries, and I think it can be said without fear of just contradiction that none of those countries has so f a r shown that it can solve satisfactorily any of the great problems of distribution. All of them have to resort to measures of this sort. They have to resort to dumping and other unfair trade practices, to all sorts of pact arrangements, barter arrangements, three-way traffic arrangements and so on, with each and every one striving to take some unfair advantage of its competitors in the export field. So desperate has this competition become that we Australians have at last found that we have to take some positive steps to look after ourselves. During the war years to an extent, and in the immediate post-war era, and up to recent years, whereas we had ready markets in any country in the world that could find the chips to pay for our products the bill? member can explain all about the bil l later on, and say whether he likes it or not. I am explaining it in my own way. It is quite obvious that the honourable member is perturbed because I have illustrated the fact that no country in the capitalist world to-day has solved the problem, which ought to be easy to solve, of distributing in a fair , equitable and just manner without resort to unfair trade practices such as those in use to-day, the goods produced by its workers. A t this stage let me remind the Minister for Trade that Australia, under its present Government, is one of the countries that have been complaining of unfair trade practices. speech that he made during the debate on the Address-in-Reply the Minister criticized in the severest terms the United Kingdom Government-peopl e who are our own k it h and k in . fie even went so f ar as to say that in the post-war period, in government-to-government trading between the United Kingdom and Australia, the United Kingdom had enjoyed substantial trade advantages over Australia. I question very much indeed the accuracy of that statement, because my belief is that in government-to-government trading betAveen the Labour Government in Australia and the Labour Government in Great years, vantageous trade agreements and prices for our primary products, in terms of then money values, that we had enjoyed-and more advantageous than we are likely to enjoy in the future. That is perhaps one reason why conservative governments in the United Kingdom threw aside government-to-government trading and resorted to trading between private traders in the United Kingdom and Australia. The Minister even complained bitterly that the United Kingdom Government was subsidizing the production of foodstuffs in Great Britain. All those things are wrapped up in tbe causation of this measure. That was one of the Minister's main complaints. He certainly complained of the Ottawa Agreement. Just fancy a Minister of the Crowni n Australia complaining of what he called unfair subsidies on home-grown foodstuffs in the United Kingdom, a honourable country which, in this unsettled time, faces the possibility of war at any tick of tbe clock! The United Kingdom Government must have the very security, the very lives of its citizens, always in mind. It has to protect them against the sudden advent of war, because in a war Great Britain's food supplies from overseas could be cut off almost i m mediately. If the British Government did not subsidize and encourage the production of wheat, sugar beet, butter, meat, eggs and other products in the United Kingdom, it would possibly be confronted with a situation in which one-half of the British population would face starvation. The Minister knows that himself, yet when he found himself in difliculties, In that astonishing because he thought that some propaganda of this sort might place him in an advantageous position when be makes his forth coming t r ip overseas, be uttered these criticisms, which were substantially unfair. One should not forget that this country itself, under various governments whose political colour it is not necessary to name, has from time to time subsidized unprofitable and uneconomic industries. One has only to instance two or three such industries. A t this moment the Government is possibly paying a guaranteed price for the Australian-produced flax, Brit a in in the post-war not because it is enamoured of flax, or we enjoyed the most adbecause farmers like growing it , but because it realizes that the outbreak of war could cut off almost immediately, as ever happened during World War IL , our supplies of that most essential product.

After those few general words, wbich I do not know what is. I am sure Gohave some relevance to the bill, let us vernment supporters will not suggest that consider some of its provisions. We find this matter involves socialist doctrine. that the people who will insure with the export payments insurance corporation will obtain an 85 per cent, cover. An exporter wbo takes goods from a vast least of all the Minister for the Army variety of manufacturers will not be able ( Mr Cramer), can accuse the Canadian to insure one class of goods, or one parGovernment of being a socialist goveraticular transaction, with the corporation ment; yet it has adopted this very policy unless he insures all the goods that he in Canada. sends to the risky purchasers of Australian goods in other countries. I take has it wrongly. it that that is so, and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. This is where government instrumentality could cover tbe affirmation of the Minister and the the ordinary commercial risks that most purported purpose of the bill have appliexporters provide against. I notice, from cation. According to the Minister, who, a perusal of tbe measure, and from the I suppose, has been advised as a result Minister's second-reading speech, that the of the readings of departmental experts, corporation is not compelled, but must who are very capable people, and, no try, to obtain sufficient revenue to cover doubt, according to those who have had aU its risks; that is to say, it must experience of this sort of thing, the cover endeavour to increase its business.

I am not saying that this is a risk which, in the interests of general trade promotion, we should not take, but I point out to the House that the Minister indicated in his second-reading speech that the scheme will cover the various marketing instrumentalities. It will cover, for instance, transactions by tbe Australian Wheat Board. The corporation could very well be caught for £25,000,000 in..regard to wheat. It may so happen that the Australian Wheat Board, being confronted with very serious difficulties in the marketing of Australian wheat, will see an opportunity to sell wheat either to the government of or to a private individual in some shaky country overseas. It may go to the commissioner of this corporation and say, "" The board has received an offer from somebody in another land to buy 100,000,000 bushels of wheat. As a board, we do not feel prepared to take all the risk of selling to him. We ask this corporation to assume 85 per cent, of the risk involved in the sale of this quantity of wheat"". Although the legislation provides that policy sball be deterrun this organization. But when we mined by the commissioner from time to time, the Minister and the corporation might say, ""We will take the risk, because we might not be able to sell that wheat anywhere else"". In due course, the corporation might become liable for a loss up to the limit of £25,000,000. Then, in tbe absence of sufficient premiums from otber insurers, up would come tbe Commonwealth, with responsibility for paying, if not the whole of the £25.000,000, a substantial part of it. to giving away surpluses? methods and the psychology involved are will not permit, the Minister has it in entirely different. I do not hesitate to his power to disallow the existing policy admit that I am one of those who bave suggested from time to time that we should give away our surpluses, when we can afford to do so, as gestures of goodwill to starving people in other countries. But that would be very different from trying to drive a hard bargain with somebody who was hard-up, and then, having failed to secure payment, fallsort. In such circumstances, the opportunity to earn tbe goodwill of tbe people to whom the goods were sent would be lost entirely. What applies to wheat could apply to many other primary products. That is a very interesting possibility. Let us have a look at the administration of this corporation. The commissioner will be appointed for a period of seven years. He will have the assistance of a consultative council. One of the most interesting features of the measure is that it provides, if not in words, then in effect that the Minister shall be a complete dictator of the whole of the operations of this instrumentality. I am wholeheartedly in favour of that. The Minister is responsible to Cabinet, and Cabinet, in turn, is responsible to the people of Australia. In the final analysis, ' (the 'Minister must shoulder tbe whole responsibility. I could not help but notice that, in the course of his second-reading speech, the Minister went, to great pains to point out that the commissioner would, in effect, control and read the speech thoroughly, we find that policy must be determined with the approval of the Minister. At any time, the Minister may, so to speak, disallow the policy then in force. In other words, he is the final controller of the whole organization. What the Government has done, of course, is to put up a facade. It appears at first sight that the corporation will be allowed to go its own way, but we sec that if the representatives of a powerful commercial interest go to tbe Ministhat they be given an insurance cover",47,Mcewen

That is witbin the Minister's power. I do not quarrel with that, but I point out that tbe present Minister is one wbo has said always that he disagrees most firmly with ministerial interference with most organizations of this type. We note also-thi s indicates the philosophy and the attitude of mind of the Government-tha f there is provision with regard to the assets of this organization. Nobody hopes more than I do that its assets will become very substantial and that it will become a very solvent body. But we note that provision is made that the corporation may bank with or invest its money in tbe Commonwealth Bank or any other bank. I am not referring now to the corporation's day-to-day transactions. Tbere is a provision which states that the corporation may bank witb instrumentalities otber tban the Commonwealth Bank. That is a reasonable provision, because it might so happen that a small sum of money was received at some outlandish place where there was no branch of the Commonwealth Bank. In sucb circumstances, one could understand that whoever received the money would want to pay it into a private bank, if there were no branch of the Commonwealtb Bank there. But very different considerations arise in relation to what might be from time to time the very substantial assets of this organization. In that respect, the Government has given the corporation an "" open slather its money on fixed deposit either witb the Commonwealth Bank or with any other bank. country are the shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank. any advantage in investing money with a bank on fixed deposit, the money of this corporation ought to be invested, not with a private bank, but witb the bank that is owned by the people of Australia. I know that my friends opposite dissent from that view, but the trend of events is such that, if they continue to follow the course they are following now of shutting the people out from participation in all these sorts of things-that is very largely the cause of their present difficultiestbey will see the day when tbey will be supplanted on tbe treasury-bench by people who will protect the assets and the property of the people of Australia Will not the people who insure with this corporation do so only because they will be unable to get accommodation from a private insurance company? They will not have a chance of getting a penny piece or a "" razoo "" from a private company, so they will go to this corporation, vvhich will have the backing of the people's assets and the people's money, and ask to be covered for up to 85 per cent, of the risk they are taking. But tbe view of the Government is that, if the corporation is successful, its profits and accrued revenue shall be invested, not witb the Commonwealtb Bank, but with private banks, which, in most cases, are bound to insurance companies. So private enterprise will "" cop "" it both ways. It will ""cop"" it through tbe private banks and also through the private insurance companies. The people be left holding the baby. Will the Government go on for much longer selling profitable public undertakings? It might sell this undertaking one of these days, when it is well on its feet. Tbe Government will probably come to this Parliament later and say, as it did in the case of the Australian Whaling Commission, "" This Export Payments Insurance Corporation "" It will be able to invest The honourable gentleman is getting very wide of tbe bill. The people of this parallel. I say that it ia not beyond the bounds of possibility that in due course If there if the Government will say, "" This corporation has a substantial credit balance. Premium income is flowing in splendidly. It could pay a dividend or, alternatively, reduce its premiums. It is so good that our friends in the private insurance companies are very interested in it .

I undertake to provide some interesting discussion for the Minister during the committee stage. We want to see this scheme succeed. We know that this country is facing difficulty, and we want to co-operate. We shall indicate our beliefs by moving, in a spirit of co-operation, amendments that will be designed to improve tbe bill and to put some meat and muscle onto it. rise to support the bill. Indeed, Mr that at all stages during its preparation Deputy Speaker, I welcome it, because 1 believe that it is a really constructive measure which has been designed to encourage trade with otber countries. Having listened to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) for nearly three-quarters of an hour, I feel that the Opposition seems to be supporting the bill in principle, because it has not advanced one constructive suggestion in stating its opposition to it. Al l it can think of is nationalized insurance. By introducing this measure, the Government is helping private enterprise, as far as possible, to carry out its job, and to do so in the face of risks that it could not otherwise afford to take. We do not see how a form of completely nationalized insurance would benefit this nation at the present time, or indeed at any time in the future. The people have already shown what they think of nationalized banking, which has been proposed by the Opposition from time to time, aud they would act likewise if the Opposition were to propose a nationalized insurance scheme. Mr J. E. FRASER -No w conclude on that note. Interjections had better conclude. There have been too many of them. Deputy Speaker. The purpose of the bill is to supplement private enterprise insurance. Let me say to critics of the bill outside the Parliament that the Government will not in any way be competing with private enterprise by effecting insurance that private enterprise itself would wish to effect. No private unless he desires to do so. The bill also provides for the setting up of a corporation that will be as free as possible from ministerial direction. controlled by the Minister. tion of the honourable member to clause 11, which shows the freedom of action that will be allowed to the corporation and the commissioner in carrying out the day-to-day business of export insurance. In reply to other criticisms that have been levelled against the bill, let me say private enterprise has been consulted, and that the private banks and the private insurance companies are in complete agreement with the policy that bas been adopted by tbe Government. Private insurance companies did not want to enter this field for very obvious reasons, witb which I shall deal in a moment. As] have indicated, the bill seeks to help traders who wish to enter the export field. The honourable member for Lalor has also criticized the Government for the degree of risk that it is undertaking. By limiting the liability of the corporation to 85 per cent., the bill ensures that the private trader shall still have an incentive to help to recover any debts that may be owing to him. He will not be able, therefore, to sit back and to say that recovery of the debt is no longer his responsibility. The honourable member has also stated that, when Labour was in office, government-to-government trading with overseas countries was profitable, but he forgets that trading on that basis was carried out during the easy years after World War II . when Australia had for sale many goods that were in short supply overseas. How different it would find things to-day if it tried to adont that policy! It would find the boot to be very much on the other foot. trade with certain countries has been expanding.

Tbe bill is designed to cover a trader against the risk of insolvency on tbe part of overseas traders wbo desire to pay over a long period. Would-be Australian exporters often are able to operate only on irrevocable letters of credit, but, in the face of the fierce competition that is emerging, it is becoming increasingly necessary to offer longer terms of payment. Wo private insurance company could be expected to underwrite tbe risks that might be incurred over long periods. I remind the House that certain currencies suddenly become blocked, as happened in the case of Brazil only two years ago. Nations that traded witb that country suddenly discovered that their payments were completely blocked. counterfeit £5 notes. day the honourable member may be paid in that way. If we want to do business witb our neighbouring countries, we must offer them longer terms. Certain risks are incurred in such trade and, accordingly, this Government must help traders. The greatest risk of all is that of blocked in the act. The honourable member for currencies. This measure will do more than anything else to help traders who want to offer long terms of payment, not expecting to be paid for, say, a year or eighteen months. No bank would cover individual Australian firms for such a long period. If the traders are able to obtain a guarantee from tbe Government that at least 85 per cent, of any debt incurred will be paid, the banks will be prepared to lend the extra sum of money that is required. In that way, therefore, business can go on and the banks will bo able to help the traders with their day-today operations. We know of countries, particularly the United Kingdom and Canada, which have been trying to trade with South American countries, and of the problems they face if they have to operate without any form of governmental guarantee. We have seen it in Brazil [15 MAY, 1956.] Corporation Bill. 2055 and in the Argentine. If we have to deal with other socialist governments, then wis must take certain steps to help our own private enterprise system. Fnally, thera is the risk of war. No private insurancR company can be expected to insure, or ever has insured against tbe risk of war. Yeti f we desire to continue and to expand our overseas trade to-day, those risks may have to be incurred. Again, it is a corporation of this nature that can help in such difficult circumstances, I say to the Opposition that proof of the need for a corporation of this sort is to be found, first, in the United Kingdom from 1919, and then in Canada since 1948. But I should like to take issue with tbe lionorable member for Lalor when he talks about the Canadian Government and the Canadian Corporation. I bave been informed indefinitely that the Canadian Corporation does not deal witb any type of insurance other than that proposed in this bill to be undertaken by the Australian corporation. It does not enter into the normal field of private enterprise insurance to any extent. I feel that, possibly, the honourable member for Lalor may have been slightly misinformed wben he was dealing with this matter. act to prevent it.

They could also help in another way by the preparation of a general leaflet as a guide to exporters. In many ways it is at present possible for the Government and private enterprise to co-operate in this very great national need. ""We support the principle of free trade, but as otber nations now find that governments must increasingly help private manufacturers in their exports, either directly or indirectly, so also are we finding that it is necessary for us to do the same. This bill show3 bow we can get the most out of government benevolence and individual initiative and how they may be combined in a constructive measure. Let us hope that this will be the forerunner of other constructive measures of S similar nature. Private enterprise will find this measure of very great help in its endeavours to expand exports. I hope that every would be exporter will make use of this corporation at as early a date as possible. -Tb e Opposition regards this, measure as being a timid step in the right direction of encouraging Australia's export trade, which needs considerable encouragement because the whole pattern of our balance of payments has been thrown into discord by tbe vacillating policies that have been followed from time to time by the present Government. As my colleague, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), has indicated, we do not oppose this measure, but suggest that it does not go far enough in the fields that it has in view. In fact, it seemed obvious from the speech of the Minister for that the Government was in a certain dilemma about the extension of Australia's import trade. He said that some exporters have not been able to meet tbeir competitors' terms of sale in certain markets because of the payment risks involved, and the difficulties of financing sales on credit terms. In other words, be realized that one mason why Australia was not exporting -s much as it should export to markets that are potentially open was because Australian exporters were not in the same favorable position of being able to offer extended credit as were some exporters from such countries as the United States of America. It seems to this side of the House that this measure does little to remedy that deficiency to wbich the Minister pointed. Equally, it seems hard to imagine that there is, as some persons have indicated, available for Australian exporters about £25,000,000 worth of trade annually in which they have not participated in the past because of the absence of sucb a scheme as this. One or two newspapers stated, after this bill had been introduced-in fact, even before it was introduced-that it could be expected that, as a result of this measure, Australia's export trade might improve by about £25,000.000. The Minister did not indicate in what direction, or in what markets, these sales were to be sought, but he seemed to imply that the existence of this kind of scheme would stimulate trade to a considerable degree. Two examples have been cited of other countries where such schemes do operate. In Great Britain, the Export Credit Guarantee Department's history goes back nearly to 1919, and in Canada a scheme with a similar name has existed since 1944 or thereabouts. Statistics published in tbe brochures issued by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department indicate that in 1953 individual exporters numbering 3,500 used the facilities of the scheme, from which was financed trade worth about £400,000,000, or approximately one-seventh of Great Britain's total export trade. This is quite a significant proportion, which, if matched by Australia, would warrant the existence of such a scheme, bnt it seems to me that while the Australian measure is modelled on the experience of Great Britain and Canada, the Government has failed to provide in it the very real teeth which exist in the corresponding legislation of Great Britain and Canada. In both countries insurance is effected in respect of what they describe as risky trade. It seems to me to be doubtful whether Australia bas not embarked on a great deal of",52,Mcewen
136,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [9.1].,,53,Mcewen
137,"Trade ( Mr Mcewen), On The 3rd May,","this risky trade. The big gap that exists for Australian exporters is the lack of adedrafted to make it capable of embracing quate credit facilities for export trade. I refer to such facilities as are found in America in an agency known as the Export Import Bank, wbich finances trade to the value of several hundreds of millions of dollars annually, in comparison with which the Australian example is puny. ber's complaint is that it is not big enough ? that it does not reach down to the roots of the difficulties that face the Australian entirely different kind of problem because exporter in certain markets, particularly in the Asian countries adjacent to us. Those countries would be willing to take exports of a capital nature such as have been suggested here, and tbe real risk is not a political one for Australia. It is not a risk, for instance, that the Indoin an entirely different measure. nesian Government will run short of sterling or that tbere are likely to be violent revaluations of its own currency in terms of ours. What is lacking is provision to meet potential importers in such countries who may say to Australia, ""We give you this order.to the value of £1,000,000 for certain equipment, but we are not in a position to pay, except over a term of three, four, or more years"". Apparently, in order to encourage this kind of trade, an organization has been established which seems to me to cover only short-term activities. If such markets do exist, and this scheme encourages tbem, well and good, but looking at the matter with a longer view, it seems that this is not the real gap in the pattern of Australia's expanding trade, and that this measure does not go far enough in the directions in which it ought to go. That is the first stricture which we place upon this measure. The examples of Great Britain and Canada have been cited with approval, but the important sections of tbe relevant acts in those countries have been overlooked. One of my colleagues will discuss that matter at greater length later. of those acts there are two parts, devoted to short-term transactions and long-term transactions. I do not know whether the bill before us is sufficiently loosely both types of transactions. The Minister did not indicate anything of that kind in his speech. In fact, I suggest that his speech was deliberately vague aboul the possible application and implications of the measure. Some people have suggested that trade worth £25,000,000 annually is there for the taking, but the Minister gave not a single example to show where it existed or what our likely markets were. The only specific instances that he gave were in relation to the marketing boards, which were cited by mr colleague. Tbey seem to present an in Australia marketing boards are in the nature of Government organizations. Negotiations tend to be conducted on a government-to-government, rather than on a private-trader-to-private-trader basis. That matter could be dealt witb Those who support this scheme have claimed that its mere existence is likely to make the banker more ready to extend credit. That would seem to indicate a lamentable attitude on the part of both the Government and banks, l t seems tliat a system has been condoned under which bankers can be induced to underwrite trade only if there are what are called ""very limited risks"". It has been suggested that the bill covers not ordinary commercial risks, but risks of an extraordinary, and mainly political, kind associated with war, exchange problems, currency revaluation and so on. It is said that the banks have not encouraged certain trade because no such scheme has existed. That is an indictment of business as we understand it in Australia. We are told that the inducement of a small premium will make all the difference. In Canada the premium rate is $ per cent, or 15s. per £100 of trade. In Great Britain the figure is lower for certain kinds of activity and higher for others, but the average is of the order of l is . per £100 of trade.

139,Mr Crean,"No. I am suggestingcent, of the value of the transactions involved? Is that suggestion seriously made by the defenders of the scheme? If that kind of jiggery-pokery is needed in order to stimulate trade it is a sad commentary on public affairs. Labour is anxious to encourage any practical move to expand our export trade because the volume of our exports is the criterion for the volume of goods and services that we are able to import. It has been said all around the House, and particularly on the Government side, that if Australia is to develop we must have more and more imports, yet this pussyfooting kind of measure is put before us as though it were the thing for which the Australian nation had been waiting for years. It does not seem to me to deal with the basic problem at all. What is needed is not to be found in this bill. There should be assistance, perhaps on a bigger scale than is contemplated in the bill, for the long-term type of venture, [n Great Britain this has been recognized as the direction in which the stimulus is needed. Mr Robert Owen, a member of the Export Credits Guarantee Department of Great Britain, spoke on the subject to the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce in December, 1955. He is reported in The Times Weekly Review, a survey of banking and insurance, on Thursday, the 16th February, 1956, as having saidWlmt we therefore seek tn do is to enable the insured exporter, in conditions of security, to offer such credit terms ns are current and justifiable. I believe that this is where our iluty to the export trade lies. We are of course muoh preoccupied with what other countries are doing; were we to assist in holding down terms ofTered from the United Kingdom to a point where our oversea competitors offered longer credit and scooped the k it ty in consequence, we should lie acting against the interests of our export trade. We must not do that. I would suggest that, equally, we must not fall into the trap that has been clearly seen by the people on the other side of tbe world. Our inability to compete on some overseas markets is not due entirely to high costs. To some members of this House, of course, high costs mean only high wages, but if they have listened to what has been said by my colleagues this afternoon they will realize that high profits are just as important. Other countries can compete against us because of better credit facilities alone. An overseas firm may wish to buy an Australian article on the score of cost, but it may be prevented from doing so because the Australian exporter cannot give credit terms to compare with those offered by Canada. Great Britain, and the United States of America. The Government should give serious consideration to that very real gap in our trading arrangements. From time to time there is much talk of what is called the "" cold war To-day the emphasis in the "" cold war"" seems to be shifting from military assistance to economic assistance through the aiding of export trade in the way suggested in the bill. I should like to refer honourable members to an article that appeared on Sunday the 15th April, 1956, in the New York Times Weekly Review, which by no means could be considered a radical journal. The article, which is headed. "" Russia Steps Out as World TraderSoviet is telling Europeans that she can supply their needs in the future"" was written by Mr Michael L. Hoffman, a well-known expert in this field. He indicates that Russia is offering some of the Asian countries much-needed food and equipment. It is also offering to take certain goods off their bands in exchange for goods that tbey need. Moreover,, these offers have found a very receptive audience in Asian countries. I suggest that a more ambitious approach such as that should be undertaken by this Government, even if only on the selfish ground of future security. Surely we are entitled to adopt that attitude. The challenge is there. This great country of Russia has reached a stage of economic development where it can o.ffer economic assistance to countries that we regard as near neighbours. If we fail to give assistance of this kind the iron curtain countries will step in and fill the vacuum. I suggest that modern forces tolerate a vacuum no more than nature does. If we do not fill that vacuum by means of economic aid, as I feel that we are in t.he position to do, somebody else will do it, perhaps by a means that it less economically desirable and which may possibly be unfortunate for us in the future. That is another count on which vve criticize this measure. As I have said, posed along tbose lines. Another amendit is a timid measure which ought to be a ment will suggest that tbe scope of the visionary, ambitious and expansive corporation should be broadened in order measure. The problem-to expand our trade both and the United Kingdom.

I am not confused terms from it. Let us provide the public with the choice of insuring with a private company Or the government corporation when they wish to obtain cover against .. jiat are called the commercial kinds of risk. Let the Government admit that that is not a field only for private concerns, anrl give tbe corporation a chance 'to expand' to otber 'fields in tbe same way as the joint venture that operates in the United Kingdom, where the approved exporter, in co-operation with the corporation, engages in transactions on the basis, uot of an 85 per cent, guarantee, bnt on the basis of a 50-50 guarantee in a joint venture. Again, this timid measure does not provide for that kind of tinner. I suggest that it is in the kind of market in which we bave to advertise und develop new contacts that we are more likely to find this field; not in the area where an 85 per cent, cover is guaranteed if the insurance policy should fall in, but in some of those areas where one needs the enterprise that these people are so prone to talk about from time to time. An amendment to the bill will be proto give it what we call tbe teeth that are possessed by the corporations in Canada on that point. member must appreciate that £25,000,000 is the limit of tbe risk that the Government corporation can undertake. Surely, the honourable member would not subscribe to the introduction of any measure without a limit being placed on the extent of the risks that it could undertake. The honourable member went, on to talk about the type of risk which this insurance corporation would undertake, and said that there was very little likelihood of a country's failure to pay. May I remind the honourable member of the situation which arose in Brazil, in 1952, when that country blocked its sterling currency and people who had exported to Brazil were unable to secure payment for tbeir exports? I suggest that that eventuality will be covered by the bill. May I also draw the honourable member's attention to. the fact that he said that the bill was designed to cover revaluation of currency? The bill does nothing of the sort. There is no mention of cover for the revaluation of currency either in the second-reading speech of",54,Mcewen

I quote from the second-reading speech of tbe Minister, as follows:It is proposed to provide insurance, broadly, against the risk of non-payment whether arising from causes such as insolvency of the overseas -buyer or his failure to pay within a certain period, or from actions oi overseas governments such as blockage of foreign exchange or the sudden imposition of new import controls in markets abroad. Secondly, tbe honourable member was not very secure in his grounds for debating this bill because he has not a knowledge of the situation. I say that his objection, which he stated very broadly, is tliat the bill is not radical enough for the Opposition, which considers that it should cover additional risks, including marine, fire and other forms of insurance. this Christmas. I believe that that is an inherent risk in this bill to those of us who believe in tbe system of free enterprise.

Now, Mr Acting Deputy of mental reservation, the reason for Speaker, this bill is novel in its approach which is not hard to find. I think that as applied to Australian conditions, and he damned the bill with faint praise. it may appear somewhat revolutionary to When we look for the reason, we find those who view with trepidation the. Gothat, in 1946, a Mr Dedman, well known vernment's entry into thefieldsof business for his socialist tendencies, endeavoured and commerce. The first reaction one to promote this type of insurance, but might have is that the Government bas he found that it was not acceptable to sufficient bother of its own in the sphere the commercial world. At that time, of government without going into the ineither the type of insurance was not surance business. One immediately asks required, or there was a genuine mistrust what experience the Government has to of Mr Dedman and tbe brand of enable it to conduct this type of insurance, socialism that he represented. tion then. covered that eventuality, as the honourable government-sponsored member would know if he had followed intrusion of the Government into the my remarks, but he lives in a world normal province of private insurance apart. I said that at that time either companies. the type of insurance was not required or there was genuine mistrust of the socialists. Naturally enough, if the able member has been assured of that. insurance was not required, it was, firstly, because there was no competition and, secondly, because there was ample honourable member for Yarra( Mr opportunity to sell goods. Consequently, Cairns) believes himself to be an this particular kind of insurance was not economist of great distinction, and thinks desired by manufacturers. But, if, in that Providence has sent him here to give 1946, this insurance scheme was promoted by this arch socialist, Dedman, there would arise that mistrust. A mistrust, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that would, I suggest, be shared by you and any other male in this community, since that gentleman even went to the extreme of removing the tails from our shirts, banned Father Christmas and pink icing, and performed various other high-minded acts of statesmanship. There may arise an uneasy feeling in regard to this measure that if this is the same as Mr Dedman's idea then it is diluted socialism, which may be harmless, but useful, in the hands of a Liberal party government, but dangerous if left in the bands of a socialist government. sents a very serious problem for the honourable member, and all I can say is that if which will deal particularly with foreign credit, and whether or not this class of private enterprise.

I do not think that even if be subscribed the 85 per cent, that this bill envisages he would get a company to underwrite him. Erom the inquiries I haA'e made. I find that the type of risk to be covered under the bill is normally not undertaken by private insurance companies. The bill, therefore, seeks, I hope, to provide cover by the Government only of risks that would not normally be covered by private enterprise. Tbat is the basic difference betAveen my vieAvs as a subscriber to tbe principle of free enterprise and those of honourable gentlemen opposite Avho subscribe to socialism. Eire and marine insurance, for instance, may be accepted as covering goods against physical damage, but the form of export insurance provided for in the bill is designed to cover the insurer against non-payment by the buyer, or by the buyer's country. Consequently, I accept the bill as a constructivemeasure, but I hasten to add that skilful administration Avill be required to make a success of tbe undertaking. As well as being constructive, the bill offers a service, or facility, not avails able at the present time. There is inherent in it, however, thc danger that the very introduction of this kind of insurance, as I have indicated, may lend itself, in the future, as a means by which a socialist-minded government couid enter the existing insurance field. It would appear, on the surface, that the likelihood of that will be made perfectly clear by the amendments to be moved at a later stage by the Opposition; but I am glad to see that every precaution has been taken in the bill to guard against the eventuality I have mentioned. Viewing this matter witb realism, however, one must accept the fact that such precautions in the preamble of the bill and elseAvhere in it Avould not be worth the paper on which they are printed if a socialist government wished to use an existing organization for the purpose of entering ni her insurance fields. The otlier immediate question which poses itself is whether or not the bili will set up another government department, with numerous secretaries, secretaries of secretaries, typists of secretaries of secretaries, and under-secretaries-in short, all the people apparently required by a government department to enable an organization to function. But in this regard I have been enheartened to read a report that a similar insurance organization in Canada requires a minimum of staff to administer it. I hope that our Australian experience will be similar iu that respect. The first requisite for the success of the corporation would, in my opinion, be the appointment of the right man as commissioner. He would need to be an experienced man. As I see it, tbe position calls for many qualities. The commissioner will need to be a diplomat who is a specialist at one and the same time in foreign affairs and a master also of the problems of insurance, banking and foreign exchange. If the right man is available I think the Government should not quibble at paying him an adequate salary. HoAvever, there is another immediate difficulty in the appointment of a commissioner. As this kind of business is new to Australia it may be difficult to find an Australian with the necessary qualifications. that the honourable member for Yarra would be a suitable appointment, but others may not share that vievv with me. llr. Cairns interjecting, member for Yarra Avill cease interjecting, or I shall ask bim to retire from the chamber. He has been warned before. less. The commissioner will require to be a man of Australian outlook, and in that regard the honourable member for Yarra will be a lamentable failure. I repeat that we should want a commissioner with an Australian outlook. To put it bluntly, what we are trying to do is to improve our export position as against other countries which are competing in the same market, and it so happens thaf",57,Mcewen

154,"Mr Wheeler,","He is quite barmsome of the competitors with whom we must contest our overseas markets are aot only British dominions, but, in respect of some commodities, Great Britain itself; so, if we must bring a commissioner from outside with experience in tbese matters, I suggest that we should immediately begin to train an Australian to take over the position, and that he be installed in it as soon as he is trained for it. I pass from that situation to the preparation that bas preceded the introduction of this measure. I am sure that in the preparation of the measure we have had the advantage of tbe experience of similar schemes operating in Great Britain, Canada and elsewhere. These operations have been successful, and it should follow that most of the pitfalls have been guarded against in this measure as far as possible. However, it is obvious that great skill will be required in selecting the risks to be covered and in fixing the premiums to be charged. Thef >remiums must not be so high as to oad an already high cost of production with another burden. It is absolutely essential that no compulsion should, be applied to insurers to insure, yet it is essential if the venture is to be profitable, that good as well as bad risks should be covered. The inevitable tendency will he for bad risks to seek cover while the good ones hold aloof. Securing the right spread of business Avill be quite an art, and, as I have said, it will call for the experience of a highly qualified man. As I see it, one of the great dangers of the measure is that the fund may be subjected to continual pressure from people who want to engage in wild-cat export schemes at the taxpayers' risk. This has been guarded against, partly, hy the provision that the exporter must bear a minimum of 15 per cent, of the risk involved, bnt I hope that, in the great majority of transactions, he will bo required to bear more than this percentage. exporter engages only in business that he considers sound. However, as I have indicated, the Teal safeguard is to have a commissioner of capacity and one who is free from political pressure. The Minister is to be congratulated on the pains he has taken to prevent ministerial direction of any individual transaction and to restrict bis own functions to the laying down of general lines of policy. I have no doubt that, under tbe administration of the present Minister, the commissioner would be left free from pressure anyway, but what would happen under a socialist administration is not pleasant to contemplate. The bill itself does not indicate the estimated revenue and the probable, or possible, loss or profit. This is a new field of activity, and I think it would have been prudent to indicate what the establishment expenses were expected to be. We have had one sad experience with the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, with which the Government entered the commercial field without a full appreciation of the dangers and difficulties ahead. To all appearances, the volume of business of the corporation will be small in the initial stages. I expect that, even witb the best of commissioners and the best of administration, losses will be incurred. We must prepare our minds for that contingency. It is hardly likely that the venture will make high profits, and, in fact, it is indicated in the bill that it is proposed to steer the rather difficult course of making neither profits nor losses. I suggest that this is certainly a rather difficult course, but, if the corporation pays its way, we shall be very fortunate indeed. If the losses are small, and the stimulus to exports is great, the effort will have been worthwhile for the future. As I have saidI tbink it should be stated again and again, so that there shall be no misapprehension about it-the corporation will provide insurance against political risks and actions in other countries. That, is one reason why this class of business may be partieularlv suited to government operations. It offers a great chance for the chain of trade commissioners that we have already established abroad to show their usefulness and their This will ensure that the effectiveness by giving an accurate and fast news service telling of the risks involved in the countries where they are stationed. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Howson). I think, referred to that matter a short time go. n This measure should receive the support of manufacturers' organizations, which must see in it a means of improving the export situation. Yet this measure alone will not solve the problem of exports. ""When goods were easy to sell, no one wanted this type of insurance, but, now that prices are becoming highly competitive, new markets are being sought. This bill is not tbe cure-all for our export problems and worries. The solution of tliose problems depends on the reduction of costs of production, which themselves depend on emcient management and the will of factory employees to produce goods at costs that will enable U3 to compete vvith overseas prices. It is interesting to note that the ""Minister stated, in his second-reading speech, that he had discussed this type of insurance with representatives of various sections of the community such as exporters, marketing boards, manufacturers, primary producers and banking and insurance interests. He stated that all these representatives towards the proposal, and he added that the Government looked confidently for the co-operation of the banking system in the day-to-day operations of the export payments insurance corporation. May I say, in passing, that it is strange that the supporters unanimously favour the Government looks confidently to the banking institutions when it needs their support. I am sure that, in this matter, the banks will give their ready co-operation, even though I feel that our private banking system has not always received the best of co-operation from the Government. However, that is another question. Suffice it to say that I believe the measure will receive the approval and approbation of those engaged in commerce and industry. This is more than the previous Labour socialist administration could command. The proposals envisaged in the bill merit a trial, and therefore I commend it to the House. Mr R. W. HOLT (Darebin) [9 AT] The honourable member for Mitchell( Mr reflected in the bill itself, which is circumWheeler), who has just resumed his seat, scribed and very limited. It does not said that the type of risk entailed in touch the basis of the problems and difficurrency revaluation was not covered by culties which confront our export trade the bill. In other words, he said that it to-day. It may be fairly said that the does not cover the loss that an exporter Minister's approach to this matter, as may sustain through revaluation or any well as to other matters of trade, lacks adjustment of the exchange rate. The honourable member's statement is borne out by the observations made by the page 4 of the roneod copy of his second reading speech. However, clause 13 of the bill makes no express provision in this matter, nor can it be taken by inference that it does not cover this type of loss. On my reading of the clause, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) was correct when he said that this loss is covered and that, therefore, the provisions of the bill are contrary to the express intention of the Minister as stated in his second-reading speech. I wish to mention also the affirmation of the honourable member for Mitchell that the insurance business provided for in this measure is a type of business that private enterprise does not desire to undertake, and that, therefore, it must be undertaken by the Government. Why is this so? Although the honourable member, on the one hand, denounces anywere favourably disposed thing that smacks of socialism, he condones and approves, by implication, and even by express statement, legislation that smacks of socialism. When it comes.to a matter of private profit, as opposed -to national interest, Government right to make private profits regardless of the effect upon the national economy. That remains uncontroverted by honourable members opposite. In fact, it has been confirmed that, when faced with a choice, they prefer private profit to the national interest. I agree with what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said about the bill. It is true that we support it, but we support it with the reservation that it seems to us that tbe Minister, in mid-winter garb, has placed his toe gingerly in the water, but has nottaken the plunge. Metaphorically speaking, he has put his toe in the water of assisting the export trade, but has gone no further. His approach to the whole matter is",58,Mcewen

157,Mr Actingdeputyspeake E,"we consider the kind of trade that we could develop with our neighbours in the Near-East and with countries in the Middle East that we see a very limited need for legislation such as this. If the amendments foreshadowed by the honourable member for Lalor were adopted, they would have the effect of increasing the scope of the bill considerably, and it would be possible that, witbin the next few years, we should be able to improve our trade to the extent of the £25,000,000 mentioned in the Canberra Timex. But that will happen only if the amendments are carried. Before that improvement can be made, we shall have to do a lot of pioneering work which, obviously, because it will not be profitable-ou r friends opposite stand self-condemned -in this regard-privat e enterprise will not handle. So that pioneering work will have to be done by the Government, in the national interest, as opposed to a selfish personal interest, t refer to the development of our trade witb the Middle East, South-East Asia and the Far East-o r the Near East, as we know it. Does this bill cover those cases? I subAppendices to the bank's latest report, mit that it does not. The Government recognizes, obviously, that there is some national aspect of the objectives which the measure is designed to achieve. The honourable member for Mitchell has mentioned the Brazilian transfer difficulties which cost the United Kingdom Government £3,500,000. We find that, according to the United Kingdom trading accounts and balance-sheets for 1954, under the special guarantee scheme, the accumulated balance at tbe end of that year was a debit balance of about £8,000. The next year's trading resulted in a surplus of approximately £304,000, so the cumulative balance at the end of that year was a credit balance of £296,000. The deficit of approximately £1,500,000 in .1954 was wiped out, aud at the commencement of the next financial year there was a small credit balance. With regard to the total schemes covered by the British legislation, the revenue has exceeded the outgoings, but the British legislation covers a number of types of insurance guarantees which, apparently, this bill does not cover. The type of insurance to wbich the United Kingdom and Canadian acts refer is, in my opinion, not envisaged in this bill, otherwise express provision would need to have been made for it. For the corporation to take powers in regard to the determination of the type of policies that it will grant without express authority to do so would be ultra vires. Therefore, express provision should be made in the bill to cover the types of insurance that exist under the United Kingdom scheme, and to which I shall refer later. Such schemes are not new. Britain has had a form of insurance since the turn of the century. Canada, Sweden, Germany, Holland, Belgium and France all have such schemes, but, significantly, the United States of America has not one. [ shall deal now with the position in the United States, because it deserves special consideration. Tbe honourable member for Melbourne Ports has mentioned the operations of the export credit guarantee system in that country, an extension of which to this country will be sought in an amendment to be moved by tbe honourable member for Lalor. Those functions are dicharged by the Export-Import Bank. which covers the period January to June, 1955, indicate that loans that have been guaranteed to foreign importers to enable them to take advantage of the offer of American imports to cover such things as highway construction, buses, railroad spare parts, construction for grain storage, construction of canals in India, dams and the production of manganese ore. Insurance coverage for numerous other things is further evidence of our inability to compete recently for the supply. of farm equipment to the Indonesian Government. Because we were unable to give competitive terms, we failed to obtain a large contract amounting toI speak subject to correction-approximatel y £3,500,000 for the supply of agricultural plant and equipment. Our exporters could have coped with such a transaction if we had been able to give them the necessary facilities. The assistance that members of the Opposition have in mind would be designed to give, not only a safer guarantee on existing trade with other countries in regard to consumer goods and possibly some services, but also a system of guarantee, with adequate credit support, to foster, encourage and open up new markets for services and exports of manufactured goods and also exports of primary products. Let me refer briefly to the position that obtains in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom found that, on a national basis, there were certain considerations which it was desirable to include in the exports credit guarantee legislation. Accordingly, amending legislation was introduced in 1949, sub-section 1 (1.) of which providesFor the purposes of encouraging trade with places outside the TJ.K., the Board of Trade, -lifter consultation with the Advisory Council, may, with the consent of the Treasury, make -arrangements for giving guarantees to, or for tbe benefit of, persons carrying on business in the UK., being guarantees in connection with the export, manufacture, treatment, and distributio n of goods, the rendering of services, «or any other matter which appears to the Board"" of Trade conducive to the said purpose. Sub-section 2 (1.) providesFor the purposes specified in sub-section (1.) consists of the Minister of Finance and -of section 1, or for the purpose of rendering -economic assistance to countries outside the the Minister of Trade and one other UK., the Board of Trade, may, with the consent member. The relevant provision, which -of the Treasury, make arrangements for the is contained in Part II . of the Canadian .giving of guarantees to, or for the benefit of, Act of 1903 bas not been applied since persons carrying on business in the TJ.K. as appears to the Board to be expedientAnd these are the operative words in the national interest. That is one of the facets of the United of the Export-Import bank at WashingKingdom act which will lead Opposition ton. The Canadian act makes provision -members to move an amendment to make whereby payment for the goods by the the corporation capable of carrying out a importer is guaranteed by the exporting national job as opposed to such a timid, government in an endeavour to foster petty, and short-sighted objective as was trade on new markets. Section 22 of that indicated by the Minister in his secondact provides, amongst other things, thatTeading speech. The British Board of Trade and thc dation of the Ministers of Finance and Trade Export Credit Guarantee Department and Customs may authorize the Financefound that they could use that piece of Minister tolegislation as a means to encourage a particular type of trade which it was desired, in the national interest, to encourage. I refer particularly to trade with the dollar areas as represented by the United States. Canada and Latin America. To do that, it Tias found that the English exporters required a particular type of policy which they called a joint venture policy. Under the joint if the governnient of such other country venture policy, 50 pcr cent, of the risk requests -was accepted by the United Kingdom loss under such a guarantee. Government. The joint venture schemes made provision for services in the nature of advertising campaigns in the importing country, the very real cost of which had to be borne by the exporter immediately he signed the contract. To enable him to sign the contract it was necessary for him to have some assurance of the assistance that he would receive towards financing a considerable outlay in the initial stage. Such a provision in the United Kingdom or in Australia, as the case may be, would mean that the exporter would have to forgo a relatively safe home market that he had been exploiting in the past, and put all his eggs in one basket, l n order to encourage export trade with the dollar areas, it was found necessary to jack up the type of insurance granted under the British scheme, and for that reason, as I have indicated, the act was amended in 1949. Similar amendments should bf included in this bill. Tbe Canadian scheme has a similar provision. The Canadian corporation 1948, simply because that function has been taken over by the Canadian Bank which acts, in relation to export credit guarantees, in a manner similar to that The Governor-in-Council on the recommen(a) guarantee the obligation of any foreign government or its agent, to pay for Canadian produced goods, (6) make a loan to such a government to pay for the Canadian produced goods, (c) purchase or acquire for value any securities laid down by such a government in support of the contractsuch a guarantee and undertakes to indemnify the Canadian Government against in that provision. Mr R. W. HOLT I agree with the worker, who really has the final handling honourable member for Lalor. He himof them physically on this side of the self has pointed out the reality of the contract. substance. The accent in this debate so far has been on manufactured goods, and services.

I rise to support this measure because I was first to mention it in this House more than eighteen months ago. remember very well when tbe original announcement was made by the Government just prior to the 1954 election that such a measure would be introduced. As everybody knows, the investigations that have had to be made, and other details, have caused the introduction of the bill to be delayed until now. Before dealing with the measure generally, I should like to have something to say about the interjections of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Pollard) gave me the impressionI feel Cairns) when my colleague the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Howson) was speaking. My colleague mentioned the Canadian act, and you will recall, Mr ment of a corporation which could engage Deputy Speaker, that you had to call the honourable member for Yarra, to order because he kept interjecting iu respect of the Canadian act. I have taken the opportunity to have a look at the Canadian act, and I have no doubt that tbe honourable member for Yarra has done likewise. The real purpose of the act is covered on page 5, chapter 105, section. 13 of the Export Credits Insurance Act. I am quite prepared to admit that that portion could lead one to believe that the Canadian Export Insurance Corporation could enter into any kind of insurance. But as we read through section 13 we find at the end of sub-section (2.) that we are referred to the 1944-45 act, chapter 39, section 13. If we take the trouble to look at that section, we find that it reads in practically the same way as does the 1952 act, but it describes the word "" loss "". The_ 1952 act says that the corporation may insure an exporter against any risk of loss in connection with the export and so on. When we look at a definition of the word "" loss "", we find the following:In this section "" l o s s "" means loss accruing to nn exporter upon non-payment, when due, of thc purchase price of goods exported, by reason of insolvency or 'delay of the importer or his inability to secure the currency with which the purchase price is to be paid. That section precludes the corporation The honourable from entering into all types of insurance, as the honourable member for Yarra would bave had us believe by his interjections during the speech of my colleague the honourable member for Fawkner. I feel quite sure that if the investigation made. I by the Government and its departmental officers over tbe period that this matter has been in their minds, showed it was possible to insure any ordinary business, as, according to the honourable member for Yarra, the Canadians have done, obviously very serious consideration would have been given to it, but the purpose of this legislation is to assist the exporters. As the Minister said in his opening words,, this measure is designed to promote Australian export trade. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr certain that most honourable members would have gained the same impression as I did-that he wanted the establishin all manner of insurance-the thin end of the wedge to bring about the complete plan of socialization of insurance which has been mentioned in this Parliament time and time again. I am reminded that some years ago in this Parliament members of the Australian Labour party said that they were interested in everything except rag shops and ice-cream carts. To-night we have other evidence of that in the words of the honourable member for Lalor. He went further to say that the Government had introduced a bag of bones with no meat on ita mere skeleton, and that it would therefore bring no profit to this country. I have never heard such utter rot from any member of any party, let alone the honourable member for Lalor, a member of the Australian Labour party of the present day, because if any measure is designed to increase our export trade it must obviously do some good for the whole of the Australian community. If members of the Australian Labour party would stop to realize just what it means to this country to improve our export trade, I am certain that they would not agree with the words of the bonorable member for Lalor. They come to this Parliament with the idea, as they often express it, of representing the workers. 1",64,Mcewen
160,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr C. F.,,65,Mcewen
161,Mr Hamilton (Canning) [10.17],"Does the honourable member, ancl do those who sit behind him, not realize that any increase in our export trade must obviously benefit a great number of those persons wbom they claim to represent in this Parliament? To hear such words coming from the man who is leading in this debate for the Opposition shows very clearly that if Labour has this viewpoint it has completely missed the point. During his contribution we heard him discussing the export of 100,000,000 bushels of wheat to some unspecified country. Coming from an honourable member who formerly was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in this country, that is somewhat astounding, as by and large the bulk of our exportable surplus of wheat is about 100,000,000 bushels. I have yet to hear that we have ever exported the wliole of our surplus wheat to any one country or that we are ever likely to do so. For the honourable gentleman to base his argument on the export of 100,000,000 bushels of wheat, which would account for the .£25,000,000 of insurance which this corporation is permitted to write, shows that he is scratching very hard for material with which to bolster his case. Finally, I should like to say something else about the comments of the honourable member for Lalor. He gloried in the fact that the bill provides, he said, for ministerial control. It is very obvious that the bonorable gentleman did not read the bill. Clause 11 does provide that the Minister and the members of tbe corporation shall get together to hammer out policy, and that if there is a disagreement they shall try to reach agreement, but if in the final analysis agreement is impossible tbe Minister shall lay down the policy. As he is the responsible member of Cabinet, responsible to Cabinet for tbe operation of this partienlar piece of machinery, that is right and proper. The honourable member for Lnlnr indicated that the Minister had almost complete power, yet clause 11 (4-.) snvs quite definitelyKnthimr in this section shall be construed us rei""ivin<r the approval of the Minister to lht> ontpvi r hv the Corporation into a pnrnC lifi'Incn""tr[tft of insurance or as empowerin"" thp Minister todetermine that the Corpora t'ni shall or shall not enter into n particular contract of insurance. . . . That provision definitely prevents the Minister from exercising his authority and telling the corporation that it shall or shall not enter into certain types of insurance. That shows, further, that the honorable member who is leading for the Labour party did not even take thetrouble to read the Minister's second reading speech, because at page 5 of the roneo-ed copy of the Minister's speech he used almost the. same wordsas appear in the bill. He saidI also invite the attention of honourable members to the express provision in clause11 (4.) of the bill that the approval of the Minister is not required in relation to any particular insurance contract, nor is he empowered to determine that the corporation shall or shall not enter into any particular insurance contract. The contribution of the honourable member for Labour was very clearly and blatantly an advocacy for government insurance. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) then entered the arena. He said that this was a hotch-potch bill, .suddenly brought in to correct our balance of trade, which had been thrown into discord by the vacillating policy of this Governinent. I feel certain that that same honourable gentleman knows only too well that this matter is not the result of some sudden inspiration of the Government but has been under its very serious consideration for some considerable time and that rather than introducea hotch-potch piece of legislation the Government investigated this matter considerably and thoroughly. The honornble member continued by saying that tliere is no evidence of any languishingof this country's export trade. If that is the opinion of the Australian Labour party, it is obvious that its members have not been watching the trends of our economic position over the past eighteen months or so, nor have they studied any of the reports of exporting manufacturers and' other persons whose very livelihood depends, in the first instance, on their being able to export their products. Even in the Minister's second-reading speech, reference was made to that matter. TheMinister saidFor some time past the Government has received rpwreopnfqt'nns from Aii«trnlinn exporters and manufacturers who have claimed! that export payments insurance would greatly help them in building up export trade. This is a matter which, I repeat, has been causing the Qovernment some concern for some considerable time, and I am very pleased to know that at long last it has been dealt with in this bill, which will at least do something to improve the export trade and help those manufacturers and primary producers who at present are finding it most difficult, because of certain problems, to export their goods. I certainly hope that this legislation will help manufacturing and secondary industries in the export trade, because statistics show that 96 per cent, of our overseas balances-if my memory serves me -correctly, but the figure may be 94 per cent-ar e brought about by the export of our primary products, and only 4 per cent -ar e brought about by the export secondary products. We have heard much from the Australian Labour party about the bill not going far enough, that it has no teeth in it. We are referred to PartI I . of the Canadian Act of 1944, wherein tiie Governor in Council is empowered to make loans to the importing country to -enable it to purchase from the exporter the goods it requires. The last speaker referred to the countries immediately to our north, and told us how they needed goods and services, including machinery, that are available here. I remind honourable members opposite that for some time tbe Government has been doing exactly what they are now advocating: it has been making goods and services available to tbe Asian people to the north of this country. Strangely enough, the greatest -critics of any attempt to develop our trade in Asia are the members of the Australian Labour party. Honourable members will recall how vehemently they opposed the introduction of the -Colombo plan, to which this Government has now been contributing for some years. The Labour party endeavoured to tear to shreds a proposal in one particular year to pay £S,000,000 toward the fund. They suggested that tlie money could be better spent in Australia. is no doubt referring to former members instance, as does the Canadian legislaof the Labour party. member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) is in this Parliament as a result of an accident of politics. But for a domesticproblem within the Labour party he would still be working somewhere in Melbourne. He defeated a prominent former member of his party. If he had been here when tbe Colombo plan was put forward by the then Minister for External Affairs, now Sir Percy Spender, he would no doubt have ardently supported his Labour colleagues' opposition to it. If it were possible for this country to embark upon a programme such as has been undertaken by the Canadian people it might be a very good idea to do so, but why have not Labour supporters given us evidence of the amounts that have been lent by that Government of Canada to other countries, or how much has been given by way of goods and services? The last speaker was alone in giving examples of the advancing of money or goods and services to other countries. He mentioned the Export and Import Bank of Washington, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics, which lent money to India for the building of canals, electrical installations and so on. One is tempted to believe that the action of the Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics was prompted by a desire, not to benefit the Indian people, but to get them within its grip and subsequently exercise control over them. This is the first bill of its kind to be introduced into this Parliament. It has been brought down at the request of people who are more concerned with Australia's future than is the Labour party. One Labour supporter called the bill a bag of bones that contained no meat. Another said that it was a hotch-potch that had resulted from the vacillating policy of the Government and the adverse balance of trade. If this represents the real attitude of the Labour party, it is obvious that Part II . of tbe Canadian legislation has been dragged in in an attempt to create as much confusion as possible.

Unfortunately, he and his colleagues are still at the "" wailing wall "". The Canadian legislation was introduced in 1944-45, when the Labour party was member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in office in this country, and when its says that it is not true. If he would members were talking about the coming refer to some of the Hansard reports of ""golden age"". Surely, if they had had the proceedings of this Parliament when auy business acumen, they would have the Colombo plan was introduced, he brought in a similar bill. Instead, they would see that the Labour party did preferred to ride on the crest of the wave oppose it . and not worry about the future. No one can deny that the bill is an honest attempt to correct a position that has been evident for some time now. ' The every time honourable members opposite Government, instead of bringing in a had the opportunity to do so, they hotch-potch bill of the kind described by opposed it . Now, when this legislation the honourable member for Melbourne is brought down to assist tbe exporter, Ports( Mr Crean), first considered the they trot out the Canadian act in an matter seriously. I am reminded of a visit, not so long ago, to Asia by a trade mission. One of the Asian governments wished to buy second-hand tractors from Western Australia for clearing work. Because of the financial position of both the importer and the government concerned, a possible contract was lost. If this bill had then been on the statute book, the contract could have been accepted. This would have helped the farmers of Asia and brought revenue to Australia from the sale of tractors and spare parts. I shall not detain the House much longer. I merely wish to support this right direction. I do not know what is behind the move by Labour party supW e w ill export porters to confuse the issues.

New measures to assist the export the ordinary insurance field. That is not trade are long overdue, because the Goprovided for specifically, but the legislavernment has been too timid in this field, tion does not prevent it. In comparison, as it is in this measure. Present practhe situation here is that the Australian tices in connection with the export trade legislation, brought down by a doctrinaire in primary products are old-fashioned private enterprise government, does preand outmoded. Certainly, new measures vent the projected Australian corporain this field are necessary. Because of tion from entering into that field. This the sufficiency of the Australian market, legislation provides for only very limited only a very small proportion of Ausmeasures. It provides for measures which tralian, manufacturers are concerned are concerned with the risks of non-paywith the export market. Another factor wbich influences the vency, failure to pay within a given Australian exporter is the extent to which period, a blockade of foreign exchange, companies manufacturing in Australia the imposition of import controls overare subject to franchises or agreements seas, war, rebellion, hostilities, revolution which exclude them from the export or other disturbances in the oversea market. I refer particularly to chemicals country, or any other cause outside the and to the motor car industi'y, in which control of the exporter and arising out the Australian product cannot enter into side Australia. But. as the Minister the foreign market because the Australian pointed out in his second-reading speech, company is restricted by franchises and it, does not extend to these two other most agreements with the parent company of importantfields-fields which the Miniswhich it is a subsidiary. So, for all these ter acknowledged to be of great importreasons, there is a great call for new ance. He said that the main types of measures in this field. The criticism that the Opposition vvith non-payment. He also referred to makes of the bill is that it does not go the difficulty of promoting sales on credit. nearly far enough. It has been shown In relation to this second most important overseas that the most important thing matter, the bill does almost nothing. The needed in this field is the provision of Minister stated that policies or contracts long-term credit-somethin g more than of insurance should help the exporter insurance. This bill does not touch that to advance his export operations where field at all. Let us compare the relative sales on credit were necessary. I suggest costs. The Commonwealth has already that the bill should extend to insurance advanced £40,000,000 of £50,000,000 this against all risks in connection with the year on wheat that has not been sold. contract or transaction insured-no t to When will it be sold? I suggest that, all forms of insurance. The honourable by the application of a small fraction of member for Fawkner( Mr Howson) took that £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 to the wheat, a great deal of the surplus could be carried off the Australian market. ment arising out of matters like insolrisks dealt with in this bill were associated",68,Mcewen
172,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [10.41],"It But the honourable member for Canningconsiderable time to deal with this matter as though we were proposing to cover all sorts of insurance-to nationalize insurance, as he put it. ""What we were concerned with was to provide in this bill means whereby an insurer who was insuring for a special risk could also insure, if he so desired, against other normal risks. This Government is so doctrinaire in its free-enterprise attitude that it will not permit such an extension of the scheme. The second kind of risk that the Government should cover by insurance is the provision of credit to exporters to enable them to offer long terms to overseas buyers. Obviously,, that could be done only at very great cost. But, as has been pointed out, in the British and Canadian schemes, precisely these things are provided. They became the substance of the legislation, not the ancillary insurance provisions with which this bill is concerned. As the honourable member for Melbourne PoTts( Mr Crean) has said, this bill is a step tn tbe right direction, but it is a very timid step, indeed. The British scheme provides for guarantees to persons carrying on business in the United Kingdom in connection with the export of goods. Another provision is that of guarantees for the purpose of rendering economic assistance to countries outside the United Kingdom that carry on business in the United Kingdom as appears to the Board' of Trade to be in the national interest 30 to do. That is covered by section 2 of the United Kingdom bill. No such provision appears in this legislation. How important would it be and how valuable woulcl it be if we could provide at this stage, when we are spending £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 in subsidizing wheat growers because their wheat cannot be sold or can be sold only on the open market, guarantee legislation of that sort in order to help in the disposal of wheat. One of my colleagues says that the Government has taken the wheat provision out of that act. The Government has taken only the insurance provision, and has left the substance of the act as though it was not aware of the substance. When one turns to the exports credits insurance scheme in Canada, one finds that the Canadian corporation that has been set up under this legislation may insure the exporter against the kind of losses envisaged in the bill now before us. Section 13 of the act relates to that matter and, as I pointed out before, there is no specific exception that the corporation shall not do ordinary insurance business. The corporation has not the power under the act specifically to do that although the Canadian act does not go so far as specifically to accept it. The most important part of the Canadian bill comes next. Under section 23 of the Exports Credits Insurance Act 1944-1945 the Governor-in-Council may make loans to any person in another country to enable such person to pay the coBt of Canadian-produced goods purchased from an exporter. In section 23 of that act is the substance of the legislation. When one refers to the legislation that has been enacted in Sweden and in Switzerland, one also finds the substanceof the Canadian legislation appearing. Why does the Australian Government not attempt to introduce legislation of that sort ? What is the answer of the Government always was slow in making a start ancl when it makes a start it takes such a short step in the direction in which it has started. This bill characterizes the Government's policy towards inflation since 1949. The bill, as can be seen, represents a very short step in the narrowness of the' ordinary commercial channels ber supporting the bill? the bill in principle. However, the Opposition says that the bill does not go far enough. We shall submit several amendments which will specifically indicate to the Government the direction in which we think it should go. The need for this measure has been thoroughly demonstrated. We are concerned, in the export field, with excessive and, in some cases, unfair competition. That is the stagethat the world's trading economy has reached and there is no question that thedifficulties will grow. It will not be easy",69,Mcewen

176,Mr Caiens,"Yes, I am supportingfor Australia or any other country to solve its economic problems by overcoming the difficulties of export trade and a short 3tep in this direction which the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Osborne) has j,ust called the first step is not likely to achieve very much. Also, this measure does demonstrate the situation that has recently developed. We have been told on many occasions that there is a very limited field indeed for the operations of the Government in trade, in commerce and in industry. That is the philosophy of the supporters of the present Government. But a new principle is raised in this measure. It is an interesting principle because it now appears that when risks are involved in the development of a new industry or in what the Minister for Trade unit when referring to the Australian Whaling Commission or when it is a matter of excessive risks in the export trade, it is the Government which will have to enter into the discharge of those risks. For a long time we have heard from the Government supporters advocacy of the wonderful virtues of free enterprise in overcoming risks. Now we have a new principle to which the supporters of the Government have become attached. That is to say, when there is a great risk to be overcome it is the Government, through a corporation, which will have to overcome this risk and not the free enterprise which Government supporters are supposed so proudly to defend. I welcome this development. So this measure, presumably, estabI distinguish between the principle of lishes a new and important principle. It the measure, which I feel should be is a principle to which, I hope, the supported and the extent to which the Government will become sufficiently well principle is carried into effect and in this attached to retain this corporation when respect, I do not think that the measure it becomes a success, and not dispose of can be supported. Unless it is intended it as it has the habit of disposing of that this development shall be taken government enterprises when they begin further, the measure is by no means to make a substantial profit. It seems to satisfactory at this stage. me that we must carefully distinguish the characteristic features of this bill. We must distinguish the principle involvedthe need in these times of excessive competition in the export trade for the Government and its agencies to extend into that field to assist private enterprise, rightly and properly, to enter that field, because there is no more important amendment. problem to overcome than the problem of export trade. Not only can it contribute substantially to the standard of living of the people of all countries involved but it can contribute also to better relations between those countries. I suggest that the corporation envisaged in this legislation may even go further and provide assistance to exporters to travel overseas in search of new markets. It might provide means for exporters to obtain publicity in new overseas markets. It might provide means to allow overseas importers to visit Australia and discover in what way Australia can provide their needs. In this way, perhaps, the corporation could extend under the authority provided in the bill, the powers which the Minister said that it would have when he stated that it could perform any function which arose in risk in any other course outside the control of the exporter and arising outside Australia. That interpretation may cover these points. When this is achieved the bill as at present drawn might be extended to a somewhat wider field than the narrow field of insuring risks of this so-called political nature. Finally, it is clear that the bill could go a great deal further without any risk of cost to the Government nearly in proportion to the cost that it already has to bear in having to purchase wheat on the Australian market which will not easily be disposed of or which will not be disposed of at all. If the Government was sufficiently imaginative and prepared to tackle the problem, as it exists, this measure could provide a great deal in the way of a solution of the difficulty. So adjourned.
