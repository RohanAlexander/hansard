After negotiation, thu Queensland Government agreed to take over all the meat in store on Commonwealth account, and waive a claim for interest, on condition that £19,717 10s. 2d. was paidfor storage This sum was accordingly paid over. On the question of the production of documentary evidence of payment of this amount for storage by Queensland Government, the Crown Solicitor gave opinion as follows:This has hitherto not heen disclosed to Parliament. "" In my opinion, the offer made by the Commonwealth, and accepted by the State, under which the amount of £19,717 16s. 2d. was paid, was for an amount in full settlement of all matters between the parties arising under the agreement for the purchase of amendment, viz. :-Leav e out "" discharged the meat, and, though it was based on the sailor o r "", and insert ""incapacitated Ausamount claimed for storage charges, in my tralian "" in lieu thereof. opinion, it was payable whether or not the State Government had actually mcurred that amount for storage charges.

71,Mr Higgs,"There is nothing derogaI n this House are two such men, representative of both political partiesI refer to' the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) and the honourable and I could furnish honourable members with the names, of a number of returned soldiers who have most pathetically pleaded that this is a war for men of adult age, and not for youths. A good deal of pressure is brought to bear on young men. I believe that the majority of them have sufficient respect for their parents to endeavour to fall in with their wishes, but the pressure that has been brought tb bear, ever since the war began, by ladies who send white feathers to those who have not enlisted, and by the taunts which men under twenty-one years of age have to endure in offices, workshops, and other places, is so great that when the Government give to youths of nineteen the opportunity to enlist without getting their parents' consent, they feel that they cannot any longer endure the reproaches and derision. higher motives than that. thousands of young men under twenty-one years of age who believe-that it is their duty to go to the Front. Many of them have told me so. Another place has made certain amendments which bring the Bill more dnito conformity with righteous public opinion than it was 'originally. The first proposal which the Government made was to break faith with the soldiers who had enlisted for three years or the duration of the war, whichever wa!s the longer period, and they seriously proposed to return the men to Australia and not give them their discharge until the authorities thought fit. That proposal has been withdrawn, and I see no objection to the Bill. Therefore, as soon as the second reading is carried I prq'pose to move the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition has given notice. -On previous occasions I have expressed my views in regard to the enlistment of minors, and I do not propose to repeat to-day the arguments I adduced then. My only objection to the amendment which has been forecasted is that it is too modest.. I do not feel at liberty to move a further amendment, but I , object entirely to the enlistment of any young fellows under twenty-one years of age without .the consent of their' parents. Whilst the proposal to make the new regulations apply to the youths of over nineteen years of age, instead of over eighteen years of age, will have my support, it will be somewhat regretful support, because I think that if the principle of parental control is good in regard to youths under nineteen, it applies to minors of any age. Dnder our laws we refuse persons under twenty-one years of age the i-ight to control their business,. or their cash, or their ordinary affairs. Until they are twenty-one years of age they have no legal standing in the community, and cannot be held legally liable for their actions. Their parents, accept responsibility for them in respect of all the ordinary affairs of life. Yet now, in a matter affecting their life and liberty, and involving, perhaps, the supreme sacrifice-the doing and the risking of what is, after all, the greatest service that a citizen can render to his country-Av e say that parental responsibility can be reduced and parental control entirely, ignored. Obviously, if in respect of comparatively small and unimportant matters the legal responsibility of parents holds good until their children are twenty-one years of age, that would justify the argument that, in regard also to this matter of such immense importance, parental responsibility should continue till the same age But my main objection is based upon that high moral law, which, is stronger and more important than any legal restrictions or statutory powers. The moral law has distinctly placed no limitation upon the duty of children to their parents, or of parents to their children. Four thousand years ago that law was given to the world, and, whether in detail we do or do not recognise the force of that ""law, we ought in a national sense, at any rate, to recognise the binding force of those great moral principles known as the Ten Commandments. There is one commandment dealing specifically with the duty of children to their parents, and, therefore, emphasizing the importance of parental responsibility-""Honou r thy father and thy mother.""

The abrogation of the moral law is to me the most serious aspect of this matter. In a previous speech I pointed out the physical and legaleffects of the enlistment of minors, and also its possible effect on the homes of the people. to because I believe that as moral force is the greatest, and, at the same time, most beneficent, influence in the community, we cannot, without grave peril and loss, be indifferent to the moral law. I was'a member of a deputation that waited about three weeks ago upon the Treasurer to protest against the inclusion of gambling amongst the means adopted for the raising of war loans. argument adduced-by the gentleman of that deputation, and one with which I entirely agree, was that the regulation approved the introduction of an immoral principle in the conduct of national affairs. I believe that gambling is based upon an essentially immoral principle, in asmuch as it seeks to take from a man something for which no equivalent is given, and which is not earned. No other nation in the world seems to surround the home with such a halo of responsibility as does the British nation. HHo doubt, in China the virtue of filial devotion is developed to a quite remarkable degree. It is inspiring to note the reverence for their ancestors, amounting to veneration and even worship, which the Chinese have developed for many centuries with, J, think, considerable advantage to themselves. But even in China, and amongst other nations where filial devotion is highly developed, homes are not established on the same basis, nor is the influence of the home so beneficent or its amongst British communities. There is no word in the language of many ua!ions corresponding to our English word "" home,"" and certainly the in fluence and responsibilities of the home are not recognised in other communities as they are in British communities. There is a special, subtle, and peculiarly beneficent influence which can only be developed in the home. There is no substitute for it , and its effects can only be feebly imitated where the influence of the home is interfered with. It is quite true that some homes, even amongst ourselves, are not all that according to our ideas they ought to be, but I question whether it is not true that,' even in those homes where there seems to be less effort to surround the children with an atmosphere of love, kindness, and goodness, a devotion and service to each other may I am content this morning not be found, which are absent from emphasize the moral aspect, homes where another atmosphere is prevalent. We may find in homes where there is very little comfort, in which poverty is the daily experience, and all sorts of difficulties are. met with, an attachment of the people in the home to each other that in the circumstances is very remarkable. There is by some means a family devotion engendered and a paternal consideration generated that are largely, if not altogether, absent, from The chief the homes' of the well-to-do. where the inmates are less dependent upon each other.

I was hoping to meet his arguments, but he is so absolutely cocksure about his own position that he is not prepared to listen to any one else. I shall therefore take no notice of his interjections. The moral law would have its continuous application were it not for the legal provision which removes parental responsibility when the son reaches twenty-one years of age, and imposes upon him from that time forward the direction of his own affairs. that does not abrogate parental responsibility, nor does it affect the son's recognition of his duty to his parents. moral law covers the whole field of a man's responsibility to his country and to himself. the duty legal at the age of nineteen years. want to record my objection to any abrogation of the rights of parents to determine what their children shall do until they reach the age of twenty-one years.

This is more important than anything else in life. It is a matter of the highest service that a man can render to his country, involving the supreme sacrifice, the risk of everything that life holds dear, a man's liberty and conscience, and I say that in moral law has such a matter parental responsibility should be conserved unti l the age of It has nothing to twenty-one is reached.

91,Mr Fowler (Perth) [12.1],"Icratic principles, should have put aside the one fundamental and essential principle of Democracy in relation to its self defence. A blow has been struck by Australia against the cause of Democracy that will react upon it, perhaps, for many centuries to come. If we do not realize it now, the time is not far distant when we, or those who come after us, will feel the terrible effects of the mistake we are making in our attitude towards the war. It ,is not merely what we think ourselves. It is what the people of the world think of us. Can any one say that a country such as ours, which has enjoyed the protection of the Motherland during the whole of its existence, can continue to hold the respect of the civilized races when, with the welfare and existence of not only the Motherland, but of our own land, in danger, we refuse to take the one step by which we can reinforce our men at the Front, and do our share in the dreadful struggle now proceeding? If we want a hint, if we will only take it, it is before us in our daily press of a few weeks ago. The New York Times, in a leading article, we are told by cable, made these remarks regarding the position in IrelandSome Irish politicians are said to he nursing the mad notion that the people of the United States of"" America sympathize with Irish slackers. There was talk of sending an emissary here to solicit America's opposition to conremark that, the honourable member has scription. It would be impossible for America to receive it. The Chief Burgomaster of Berlin would be as welcome. That may be taken as fairly typical of the attitude of the United States of America towards the refusal of Ireland to accept conscription. What must America think of Australia on that question? If there is condemnation in the United States for the people of Ireland in this regard, is it not a hundred times stronger towards Australia, seeing that the people of Ireland have, perhaps, some justification for their attitude, while the people of Australia can plead none whatever? If we are wise, if we will only look at indications such as these, we will realize, I hope before it is too late, the absolute necessity to Australia's future welfare of doing the one thing needful to rehabilitate ourselves in the eyes of the civilized world. If we want another hint, we have only to read between the lines of the cables describing the passage of our Prime Minister through the "" United States of America recently. agent to advertise everything. Prime Miuister avoided all publicity. Can we imagine him avoiding publicity? No. The truth of the matter was that he was cold-shouldered by the people of the United States of America, who woiild have nothing to do with him coming from a country that had refused its duty in the circumstances that had compelled the United States to adopt conscription. AgainI plead with this Parliament, on the last day of these sittings, to realize the tremendous responsibility upon us, and to take the one step' of duty that is imperative if we have any regard for our honour and our future welfare. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the honourable member for Perth in taking up the mantle that has fallen from the ex-honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine). before the ex-honourable member for Flinders opened his mouth about it. to determine the priority of the honourable member's claim as compared with the exhonorable member for Flinders. I simply taken up the mantle that fell from Sir William Irvine's shoulders when he left the House. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the honourable member, although totally opposed to his views, because he is to some extent occupying an isolated position in the' House, in reiterating his opinions on conscription. The honourable member has not adduced very much evidence -when he asks honourable members to base their views of American public opinion upon a solitary quotation from the New York Times with respect to the proposed visit of the Lord Mayor of Dublin to President Wilson. Anybody who knows anything about the newspaper world can appreciate just how representative of public opinion is the press of any country. The Northcliffe press is a standing illustration of how public opinion is manufactured. The New York Times is in the same position, and in no country in the world is public opinion less accurately portrayed than in the American press.",29,Lamond Th E Honourable Twenty One He Proceeded Further Aud Re

Even admitting that the American press criticism was in opposition to our own sense of self-respect, it must not be forgotten that we have been granted the right to govern ourselves according to our own ideals. chosen, for good or ill , to do without conscription ; and I disagree with the conception of Democracy, as expressed by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) when he tells us that Democracy has achieved the highest pinnacle of greatness when it has imposed on itself the Continental form of militarism. and Imperialism are incompatible with Democracy. means the downfall of Impetrialism.

Wliy did they make the defence law such as to make the law of calling up boys at such an age as the last resource? Because they felt it was wrong in principle to send them. They, therefore, stand self-convicted of adopting a pernicious principle. What does this new regulation mean? A parent cannot chastise his son without the threat, "" I. will enlist."" This is not so in my case. There has been no trouble with me or my son. We were given a sudden surprise. Because only a few days before he enlisted he was talking' about his future as a musician. It was a sudden event. Some months ago he was tempted to got away and tried, but I stopped him, and he then promised that he would go on, finish his apprenticeship, finish his musical education, and then go abroad for Mr Considine. further learning. But excitement of the receptions and cheering of the crowds to returned soldiers and soldiers departing has allured him into the net. My boy went straight into camp, and sent word home that he had enlisted. Self-condemned, he was ashamed to face his father and mother. than his father. member knows nothing about his father, and so he is not competent to judge. The father is a conscientious individual w i th firm religious convictions. . He is an old friend of mine, a man I have known in timately for over sixteen years, and I should like to help him out of the trouble in winch he has found himself because of his religious convictions. He belongs to a particular sect which believes that it is the destiny of the British Empire to work in harmony with Providence for the regeneration of the world. ' They look upon the Central Powers as being the adversaries of the Lord. These people are, if anything, essentially loyal; but their religious convictions prevent them taking up arms or taking part in politics. I say, therefore, that this man and the lad's mother ar.e suffering keen anguish because they believe that as the boy has not been baptised, and as they regard bapoffer no objection to this letter tism as essential to salvation, the son is .risking his immortal life. Their anguish is probably keener than any anxiety that might be felt by parents belonging to other denominations, and who may object for various reasons to the enlistment of their sons. While I do not subscribe to the tenets of this belief, I respect the people who comprise the sect. in the event of this lad falling a victim to one of the ordinary ills of life before he reached the age of twenty-one years and was baptised? lief of the Christadelphians is that without baptism there can be no salvation and no resurrection.

130,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"their enthusiasm caused Ministers to take what they thought a right step in a time of crisis like the present. I fear, however, that they have made a mistake. ' I was much impressed by the statements of the honourable member for Flinders (Captain Bruce), who is fresh back from the Front, where he fought and bled for his country. He solemnly and emphatically, though in few words, warned us against sending youths to the Front, because he said they were not really reinforcing our strength there. My opinion regarding the need for reinforcements is very different from that which has been expressed by some honoraible members to-day. agree with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler), I certainly do not agree with certain views which have been expressed from the Opposition side of the Chamber. My remarks-may seem inconsistent, because both of my sons went to the war before reaching the age of nineteen. I am glad that they have made good, and have done good work. Naturally I am as anxious concerning them as persons mentioned by the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) who hold non-combatant, religious beliefs duffering from mine are about their sons. But, nevertheless, I thank Ood that they are there, and that they are doing their bit, and I hope that they w ill stay there, and see it out to victory. The Minister( Mr Wise) is another whose boy went away as a mere lad, and is doing, his bit. A t the same time, I think that the enthusiasm of Ministers led them into making a mistake which they have tried to cover by altering the age l i m it from twenty-one to eighteen and to nineteen. It is a pity that they do not alter it again to twenty-one. I refused to vote for the amendment the other night, because it would have been taken as a vote of censure on the Ministry. But as on the present occasion we have an opportunity to express our opinion unclouded by other issues, I say that I cannot support the Government's action in this matter. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Johnson) I am unable to accept the motion unless from the honourable member in whose name it appears on the business paper. Under the Standing Orders a motion can be moved by one honourable member on behalf of another only when it is a motion » for leave of absence, or for an unopposed return, and then only by leave of the House. The practice of the House of Commons, too, is that one honourable member may not move a motion for another honourable member except he be a member of the Government, moving on behalf of another member of the Government. ' May says, While I do not at page 250 of the 10th edition of his Parliamentary PracticeA member of the Government may act on""1«half of a colleague in all cases, including the proposal of new clauses on the report stage of a Bill; but, with this exception, or in the case of an unopposed return, or Qn a motion for a leave of absence, no motion can be moved save by the member in whose name the notice stands although I regret that the motion may not be moved.

In Committee: Clause1 (Short title).

Honourable members will recollect that the Royal Commission which inquired into Naval and Defence administration called attention to the difficulties connected with the supervision of the clerical staff of the Departments owing to the existence of varying sets of regulations. In their third report, which deals solely with this subject, they point out the nature of the difficulties that have arisen, and draw attention to the fact that in the twelfth annual report on. the Commonwealth Actiug Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner also referred to the disadvantages of the system of dual control. Dealing with the necessity for the abolition of divided control, the report of the Royal Commission saysWe consider that uniformity in methods of staff control, discipline, and advancement is essential in order tb secure that contentment of service without which there can be no real efficiency. We have conferred with the Acting Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner, Tellers: the Crown Lasv authorities,' and the responsiBrennan, Frank ble officers, both civil and military, of the Defence Department, and the recommendations contained herein are calculated to bring about the desired unification of staff management. Anstey, F.,g The Commission recommended that legisCatts, J. H7 lation should be passed on the lines of a McGrath, D. C. draf t B ill which accompanied their re. port, but when the matter was considered Watkins, D. it was found that many other points had Yates, G. E. to be provided for, necessitating the Riley, E. drafting of a much longer measure than that which the Commission recommended. The Commission also drew attention to West, J. E. the fact that there are three classes of Nicholls, S. R. employees in the Defence Department. As a matter of fact, there are often more. When the Department was formed, some of the employees were public servants under the Public Service Acts of the various States, who had been taken over with all the rights given to them by the different State Acts. In some' States certain employees of the Department were not public servants, but had been appointed under State Defence Acts, although previously they had frequently held clerical positions in the State Defence Departments. Then there was another class, semi-military, which had been appointed under the various State Defence Acts. As the result of the transfer of State officers and other .appointments to the Defence Department, there are on the civil side of' the Department no less than three different classes of employees. ThisB ill is introduced to overcome that difficulty. It is not an amendment of the DefenceA c t ; it is a separate measure dealing with a special subject, and it w i ll come into force by proclamation, and continue in force for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards. Its object is to abolish divided control, and to bring under one set of regulations all persons employed in a civil capacity in the Defence Department. When the Act expires twelve months after the war no officer's rights will be affected. Length Public Service, the of service under this measure will stand to the credit of the officer just as if he had all through been employed under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and each officer whose services are no longer required by the Defence Department will go back to his former position. their military rank with them? to them all the rights they possessed at",37,Lamond Bu T In Their With The I N J U Ry Done To The Families Con

168,Mr Wise,"They will have preservedthe time they came under the provisions of this B ill . No one will suffer by reason of coming under them. It has always seemed to me an anomaly bhat the employees in the Public Service should be under separate control. Public ServiceA c t was passed in order to make it impossible for members of Parliament or Ministers to place their supporters in positions in the Commonwealth Service, the desire being to remove political influence as far as possible from the making of appointments to the Service. Certain examinations are provided for, which, I suppose, are a very good test of ability. We all agree, probably, that it is a good thing that it is not possible for a member of parliament to get his friends or supporters into the Public Service. Some of us are rather pleased to be relieved of the many applications which came to us before the Public ServiceA c t was passed. ment might as well use the influence as head officials. point. Commonwealth employees in the Public Service or in the Defence Department is unsatisfactory, and some Government should evolve a better method of testing the efficiency of applicants. I do not know that we can substitute anything that will absolutely do away' with the educational tests. an applicant for employment shall pass some literary examination, be able to write in a legible hand, and work certain sums in arithmetic, and know the*history of the British Empire from the eighteenth century to the present time, more especially with regard to Australia. do not think it can be held that it is tlie best test that could be devised.

If it were not for the seriousness of the I military situation, it would be a matter for ridicule.

By a peculiar set of circumstances a man may during the course of an examination be called upon to supply answers to the very matters upon which he has concentrated his studies. I think that an examiner should be allowed to pick up a candidate's papers, and, irrespective of the errors in them, judge whether they display ability or not. The honourable member for Capricornia has said that there are people who can memorise anything, but they only memorise for the time being. aminers give consideration nowadays to what they call general knowledge. they are permitted to do so.

Our experience of some of the bounties granted by the Commonwealth has not been a very happy one. The bounty on wool tops, for instance, has not had the effect we believed it would have. employees in that industry seem to have derived no benefit from it. They are expected to work long hours, to work at night .time, and, in some cases, seven days a week. I do not think, however, that our unhappy experience in connection with the bounty on wool tops is a good reason why we should oppose the proposal to pay a bounty in this case provided for in this case. payment of this bounty as such, but I take exception to the method by which it is proposed to be administered. All who have regard for the man on the land must sympathize with the orchardist. I have frequently known of cases where the whole .results of a fruit-grower's labour have* been swept away ih a single night. A terrific storm may destroy all his crop; his prospects may be ruined by too heavy a rainfall, or he may suffer because of an inadequate rainfall. desire to do justice throughout the Commonwealth must sympathize with the fruit-grower, and endeavour to make his lot as pleasant as it is possible for legisafter year. lation to make it. That being so, I do not oppose this bounty as a bounty. When this question was previously under consideration, however, I asked the Minister whether the fruit-growers themselves would receive the bounty. portionate reduction be made in the price paid to growers for the apples? growers, will the price they receive for their apples before it was passed be su reduced as to conform to the amount of secure what is desired. rating factories are owned by orehardists. mind, affords the best way of helping the man on the land. I would go so far as to say that, where necessary, fruit growers should be assisted by the Government to find the requisite capital for the erection of the evaporation plants and machinery. The ment ought to do that. wealtli or the State Governments should subsidize fruit-growers where they are too poor to find the capital to establish evaporating works for themselves Miv FALKINER -The honourable member's Government granted a bonus to middlemen to make wool tops could not have been present when I said that our experience in that regard had been most unhappy. It is true that our Government agreed to the payment of a bounty on wool tops, but we were induced to do so upon the representations of certain people. We were led to believe, that the payment of the bounty would give employment to a large number of skilled operatives; .but, after the bounty had become law, we found that all the employees required in the industry were, as Mr P. W.

Yet we hope to encourage fruit-growing, and to settle returned soldiers cm the land to, make homes for themselves and rear their families on the produce of orchards. bounty is the lack of shipping facilities for the exportation of apples to Great Britain and to Sydney, in consequence of which the fruit is a drug on the Tasmanian market. will get less than $d. per lb. for the apples, these apples are sold in Melbourne for 4d. per lb., or a!bout 13s. 4d. per bushel. You will never have peace while such discrepancies exist. apples can be bought in Melbourne for 5s., delivered at the door. worker cannot afford to buy apples by the ease. Her wage-earner gets only about £3 per week. week is the average wage of a worker. worker cannot afford 5s. to lay out on a case of apples, and, if she did it, she would find that a case went too soon. I have three children, and it is surprising how soon a. case of apples disappears in my household. Consequently the ordinary housewife has to buy in small quantities at 4d. per lb. apples for which the grower gets less than ^d. per lb. evaporated will be nearly all second class apples. For first class apples the orchardist gets from 43. to 4s. 6d. per case. Sir Thomas Bent won his election at Brighton because, in appealing to his constituents, he said, "" Y o u talk about pensions in Victoria-pensions , and 200,000 to 300,000 Jonathan apples goiug at a couple of shillings the case!"" According to the Melbourne Age, the best Jonathans were recently selling here at 2s. 6d. per case, and were being put into cold stores, to be sold later at 14s. per case. We wish to help the man on the land, but the fruit-growing industry will not prosper while growers get such small rates as are provided for in the Bill. because the Imperial Government will not give more than 7d. per lb. for evaporated apples. that the bounty goes direct to the growers. a grower will get any. bounty from me. ter cannot object to the striking out of clause 5.

Bill affords sufficient ground for the apprehension I have expressed. That clause provides that the owner, occupier, or lessee Of any land on which the apples were grown, or the factory iu which they were evaporated or have undergone any process, shall be deemed to be employed in the growing or evaporation of apples, unless the Minister, in writing, otherwise directs. In other words, a factory shall be deemed to be employed in the growing of apples. honourable member for Melbourne Ports is not able to discuss that question at this stage. vision for certain wages conditions, and for power to apply to the Arbitration Court; but we all know that the employers have simply to "" put up a fight"" in order to postpone or avert a decision by the Court. I emphatically say that there must be no bonus paid until tliere is a decision as to wages by the Arbitration Court, or some other competent tribunal. On that I shall insist, and claim a vote, if necessary. in thc Bill for that? The arbitration proceedings may be protracted, and in the meantime the employers may pay what wages they like. We have had experience of this in connection with other bonuses, such as the iron bonus. At that time the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs, and provision was made in the Bill for a certain living wage; but this was declared by the High Court to be ultra vires. The Bill was held up pending some assurance in the matter of wages, and I remember that Mr Hoskins brought five representatives of the union to Melbourne, who urged us to pass the Bill, saying that they were strong enough to extract from the iron masters the wages and conditions desired. In our. innocence we passed the B ill ; and, when trouble arose in the industry, those same unionists asked the -Minister not to pay the bonus, because the iron was' being turned out with "" scab "" labour. As a matter of fact, the employers had outwitted the men, and they succeeded in obtaining the bonus, irrespective of any labour conditions. It will be seen, therefore, how necessary it is to take every precaution in the present case. covered by this Bill has already been provided for. spective Bill, and we are going to pay a bonus irrespective of what wages have been paid. does his own work. are hundreds of men who go fruit-picking.

The Acting Attorney-General has just drawn my attention to section 4 of the Sugar BountyA c t 1905-10, which contains the following provision: The occupier and the lessee of any plantation on which any sugar-cane or beet is produced shall be deemed to have been employed in thc production of all sugar-cane or beet produced thereon.

It will readThe owner, occupier, or lessee of any land' ou which the apples were grown shall, unless .the Minister in writing otherwise directs, be deemed to be employed in the growing of the I apples. There is no reference in the Sugar Bounty Act to the owner of any factory in which sugar cane is turned into sugar receiving a bounty.

If the honourable member's amendment be agreed to, the white-labour conditions of the clause w ill be destroyed. All previous measures of the kind contain a clause the same as that to which the honourable member is now taking exception. The Committee appears to he in such a state of mind that there is little prospectof any amendment being carried. All that I can do is to insist that the Goveniment intend that under this B ill the bounty shall go to the evaporator, and that the evaporator, may not be a grower of apples. no objection to tlie payment of the bounty to him. The Assistant Attorney-General( Mr Groom) declares that the clause is necessary as it stands, and that since it is stated in clause 2 that the bounty shall be payable only to the grower of the apples, clause 5 is not in any way contradictory. I would point out to. him what he, as a lawyer, must know-that , although clause 2 provides that the grower alone shall receive the bounty, if a subsequent clause declares, as this does, that an evaporator shall be considered to be a grower, then such a person may claim the money.

I again take the opportunity of thanking honourable members foT their hearty cooperation during the past week. The Government felt that it was advisable to close the session at this time, because of the problems that are pressing for solution. As honourable members on both sides are well aware, Ministers are severely handicapped in administrative work when the House is sitting continuously. The course we have adopted was not prompted by any desire to escape into recess, as some honourable members have implied, for there is no holiday ahead of Ministers. The Government desire, as far as the administrative work will permit, to co-operate with honourable members of the House in recruiting work throughout the various constituencies during the early part of recess. As far as they are able to do so, Ministers will visit different portions of the Commonwealth, because the news we are getting every day justifies the belief that Australia must do its duty in the war till the very end. Apparently,, the German offensive is still making progress. No encouragement is derived from a study of the military outlook, but we feel that the heart of Australia is just as sound to-day, if it be prothe Chamber had already left for their perly appealed to, as when we first entered the war. Happily, we have 'been able during the last few weeks to banish some of the asperities from the political arena, and I pay my due tribute to honourable members opposite because of that. The Governmenit have tried to encourage a better spirit than, unfortunately, has prevailed during the last eighteen months, and I hope that when we meet again we shall be able to promote harmony to a still further degree. We have tried to show in spirit, as far as was possible, the consideration promised by the Prime Minister and his colleagues at the Governor General's Conference, and in that spirit operation which has been established in the House will continue outside in connection national work that calls for attention. The Acting Prime Minister, in referring [4.37] I to the sale of our wool to the Imperial Government, said that possibly some of the wool would reach other destinations than England. The inference is that some of it may go to Japan or other Eastern countries. Some time ago the Chamber of Commerce at Townsville, acting in behalf of the wool-growers in the hinterland, appealed to the Government to make that port a place of appraisement. Townsville is the fourth port of the Commonwealth in respect to the yalue of its exports, and the people' there think that ships travelling to the Orient from that port might take wool, and save the grower the expense of sending it to some other place of appraisement, such as Brisbane or Sydney, and then shipping it to the East. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to take the matter into consideration, and to suggest to the Wool Committee that wool be shipped direct from Townsville to the Eaist, thus saving' a double journey and freights. congratulate the Government on slipping so easily into recess. I had fully made up my mind to test the feeling of the House in regard to the matter of prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors by moving an amendment on the motion for the special adjournment. As, however, fully half of the honourable members of homes, it was futile for me to do so. But I assure the Government that I shall take the earliest opportunity of asking the House to vote on that subject. It is our duty to do all we can to get reinforcements for the men at the Front, and, even at personal sacrifice, to insure that when they are recruited we shall get the most efficient service from the men, and also safeguard their interests when they return. never found greater difficulty in speaking -",50,Apple Bounty Bill

327,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [4.44],"Ito a motion tlian I do now, because the Leader or Acting Leader of the Opposition is liable to be misunderstood if he responds to the amiable expressions of the Leader of the Government. The duty of an Opposition Leader is to endeavour to destroy the Government, in the belief that the Government cannot possibly do any good; that no good can come out of Nazareth. If I agree with the Acting PrimeM i nister, and accept his compliments for liaving endeavoured to create harmony where discord formerly prevailed, the Opposition may lose votes from two quarters. When we appeal to the electors they may ask, "" W h y should we make a change, when you have such a good opinion of the Government?"" and our more enthusiastic supporters may say, "" You cannot be sincere, because you have not attacked the Government on every possible occasion, giving them no quarter."" amiability must be allowed for by the constituencies. the Acting Prime Minister is in the nature"" of the hand-shake, which is the preliminary to a boxing 'contest, and means, I suppose, that the men intend to -fight fairly, and bear each other no personal malice. in the ring. amused, and possibly edified, if the Acting Prime Minister and myself were to f a l l on each other's necks and kiss. However, I reciprocate the sentiments that he , has uttered. Greater harmony has prevailed. I do not think that there was any occasion for the discord that preceded it . The Government has not done what we think it should have done. I say that without desiring to create angry feeling. It is not the duty of an Opposition to instruct Ministers as to what they should do. Our duty is to tell the"" Government what it should not do. But in the goodness of heart which characterizes those on this side, we are prepared to give the Government a few hints. I agree with the Acting Prime Minister that there is no recess for Ministers: they work nearly as hard when Parliament is not sitting as when it is sitting. That is especially true of' the Treasurer, upon whose shoulders a tremendously heavy burden w ill sit during the continuance of the war. In his dual capacity of Acting PrimeM in ister and Treasurer, the honourable member for Balaclava will have a very great deal to do, and he is entitled to the fairest criticism from opponents. I am of opinion that the Government are making a mistake i u regard to the fixing of the prices of meat. Ministers must endeavour to reI find myself in a difficulty. duce the cost of living to the consumers, beariug in mind their duty to the dependants of the soldiers. It is for the Government also to make the rich bear their due share of taxation. I might enlarge on these matters, but if the Acting Prime Minister wishes for further advice, and will drop me a line, I shall be happy to reply to him freely. On behalf of t i e Opposition, I thank the honourable gentleman for his amiable expressions, and I hope .that honourable members opposite, as well as those on this' side, may live long and die happy. mending the Government for their advance to the farmers, I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister, however, to take into consideration the advisability of making the first instalment larger. The proposal is to pay 3s. now, and to keep back ls. indefinitely; possibly for.on e year, possibly for three. The instalment of 3s. will all be needed to pay expenses; it is the last shilling that will go to the farmer himself. Therefore I urge the Acting Prime Minister during the recess to consider whether, to meet the case of the necessitous farmer and the man who is farming on the share system, a scheme cannot be devised whereby negotiable certificates may be issued for the second payment. A needy man could then go to the Commonwealth Bank and discount his certificates, while a wealthy man would put them in his safe until the payment which they represented became due. This arrangement would not cost the country much, and would relieve many farmers considerably. A t a conference of farmers which I attended, at which there were about 500 representatives, the conclusion was come to that the cost of producing a bushel of wheat, was, at the present time, from 3s. lOd. tq 4s. a' bushel. I know that the Acting Prime Minister will do what I ask, if it can be done, and I'hope that he will'be able to treat the suggestion favourably.

That question was asked on Thursday, 11th April, and an answer was submitted me to the effect-^ An examination of candidates for appointment as Military Staff Clerks was held on the 7th, 8th, and Oth March, 1918, the complete results -of which have not yet been received from the examiners. Can further particulars be made available to enable the matter to be investigated ? I s u b m it t e d another question in s i m i l a r t e r m sHas the Minister any knowledge or corroboration of the following statement referring to the Defence Department, and made by a correspondent in the Melbourne Argus of the 28th March last? ThenI quoted the terms of the speech reported to have been delivered by the honourable member for Echuca( MrI t would appear from this that the Palmer). The Assistant Minister has, I believe, set about, in a perfectly candid spirit, to have inquiry made, but, nevertheless, on Thursday, 3rd May, I was constrained to ask him' When may I expect some information about the important matter of the alleged improper practice in connection with the examination [227 ] A t the next examinafor the Federal Public Service, about which I asked a question, without notice, a week ago? The The reply wasinformation by Wednesday next. A l it t l e later on I received t h e answerThe matter received immediate attention, and is at present the subject of inquiry. In quiries are not yet complete, but a reply will be given to the honourable member as soon as I am in a position to do so. This shows that I was determined to pursue this inquiry until I obtained a satisfactory answer. It shows, also, that the Minister busied himself to obtain all the information he possibly could on the subAbout three weeks ago I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence a question relating to Public Service examinations. Seeing that the this House, as well as the purity of the examination system, will the honourable gentleman, without further delay, supply an answer? I told the honourable member yesterday that I thought I would be in a position to give a reply to-day. I shall obtain the information as quickly as possible. The answer-if not in due time-cam e eventuallyuestions, with the result that the candidates Inquiry has been made by a special officer. deputed by the Minister, but no corroboration of the statements referred to in the press has been obtained. The only thing at all bearing on the matter has reference to a simple departmental educational test of candidates for casual employment, in which, however, no educational college or institution is in any way involved. In regard to this test, it was thought that the continued use. of the same papers would lead to applicants acquiring a knowledge of the questions put, and the questions were suddenly changed, with the result that one applicant showed he must have had prior knowledge of them, probably derived from one who had already undergone the test. The passing of this test did not insure employment in the Department, but merely served to give some indication as to whether the applicant had any educational qualifications to warrant consideration for employment. It is understood that another Department has held an examination at a business college recently, and tbe Minister has referred the papers showing the result of his inquiry to that Department for their information. statements made by the honourable member for Echuca, on the face of them, from the knowledge we have of our examination system, and for other reasons scarcely credible, have now been proved to be wholly unfounded This is a finding upon which I think honourable members on both sides of the House",52,Employment Of Roman With Recruiting And The Other Important

335,Mr Wise,"Inquiries are being made, andmay well congratulate themselves. I can scarcely conceive of any honourable member subscribing to the view that an unf a i r advantage is given to any sectio.i of the community in the examinations for the Public Service, and certainly that any unfair advantage is given to any persons by reason of their religion. I thought it, d e to the persons involved in these damaging statements that the matter should be cleared up as f a r as possible. I am glad, therefore, to place on record a complete answer by the Minister showing that there is not a vestige or tittl e of t r u th in the allegation reflecting on a large section of the community and on a well-known educational institution. honourable member should now withdraw his charges, or attempt to make them good. This morning I asked the Acting Prime Minister a question as to whether undue influence was being used on the students in the Sydney University who refused to sign a statement that they would join a company that is being formed in connection with the Australian Imperial Porce. The question was in the following terms: 1. Isi t a fact that methods of intimidation are being employed at the Sydney University to induce student's of various faculties to sign promises that they will enlist in any capacity in the A.I.F. in connection with a proposal to raise a company of men from that University? 2. If so, will the Federal Government ask the Government of New South Wales to bring pressure to bear on the University Senate to prevent intimidation or consequent victimization in connection with the examination of those students who oppose the movement? The Acting Prime Minister was then unable to answer the question, but he has since courteously communicated with Sydney, and has now handed me the following:The Minister for Defence has no knowledge of the employment of any methods of intimidation to induce students at the"" Sydney University to sign promises that they will enlist in the A.I.F. The Department for Defence has very recently been in touch with the authorities of the Sydney University in connection with the matter of the enlistment of medical students in the A.I.F., and the Minister is convinced that any such action would have been brought to his knowledge during the discussion of these -matters. It appears to me that the Acting Prime ""Minister, perhaps not intentionally, has -failed to answer the-second portion of the -question, namely, whether this was taking place, if not with the knowledge of the M i nister, with the knowledge of the University Senate.. I have been very credibly in formed that certain people are trying to induce some of the students to promise that they w ill j o in this company if it is formed. Those who have not done so have reason to believe that their refusal to sign w ill militate against them in the forthcoming examination; and I should like the Acting Prime Minister to consider that phase of the matter. He will himself know the best way to dissipate these fears of the students. Minister and Treasurer) [5.7] I have The first to explain to the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) that, in the hurry of to-day, the second part of his question was unanswered. I shall take steps to have the attention of the New South Wales Government drawn to the matter, as they are the proper authority. As to the observations of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), I am not specially interested in the production of evidence concerning the allegations of my honourable friend the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer). This is the first I have heard of a raid oh the Labour Call office. I know nothing of the object of such a r a i d; probably it was in the discharge of the duties of the censorship. I can assure my honourable friend that in the recess, if we can call it a recess, there will be no recrudescence such as he referred to ; no action will be taken except what the Government feels is necessary for the maintenance of our war aims and the preservation of the country. As I told the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) in a recent letter, we cannot yield on things that seem vital to us in that respect; that will be the guiding principle actuating us throughout. The honourable member for Calare( Mr. Pigott) has asked the Government to reconsider the question of the wheat advance on the next crop. I have already given the remarks of the honourable member a good deal of consideration, and I do not see that the cure he suggests will remove the difficulties which face the Treasury. It would be very easy to issue 3s. and gave a certificate for the balance, which would be hypothecable at any bank; but that, of course, would mean financial stress on the bank or banks which do the business. It is far better",54,Employment Of Roman With Recruiting And The Other Important
