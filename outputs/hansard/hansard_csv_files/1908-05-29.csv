I notice that he has frequently to raise his voice to make himself heard above the hum of conversation which isi proceeding, even while I am speaking. I am amazed that honourable members should exhibit such an utter disregard of the Standing Orders, to which their attention has been so frequently called. I must also ask the honourable member for Swan not to make a running commentary upon the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay, but to speak himself at a later stage if he desires to do so. for Swan has asked why I did not tackle this question earlier. But I would point out that we had no power to deal with it in this way until five years after the adoption of a uniform Tariff. That period expired about the time that a. general election was at hand. recess, whilst the Prime Minister visited Great Britain; and therefore we have not lost much time in dealing with it. We could not have tackled it very much earlier. Within ten days after the House had affirmed my motion that the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions was an urgent matter, I made a public statement, to the effect that I was in favour 01 this Bill, as under its provisions an amount could be'appropriated and credited to a special trust fund, which would help to provide the Federal Treasurer with the necessary funds to commence paying old-age pensions from the ist July, 1909. the honourable member's policy is to make up for lost time? to the States, from the inauguration of Federation until the 30th June, 1907, ,£5,728,114 more than the States' three-fourths.

I expect that at least £1,000,000 will be accumulated before July, 1909. than that, according to the estimate I have. there will be then at least £1,000,000 accumulated in a trust fund, and available for the payment of old-age pensions. According to my calculation, an accumulation of about £i,25o',ooo would be more satisfactory. The question is, are honourable members prepared, at this stage, to anticipate that accumulation by an appropriation? It is within the power of the Commonwealth to provide for other necessary expenditure as well as old-age pensions, under a trust fund, and it will be the duty of the Government to so provide for it if they think it necessary/ Will the Treasurer say what the increase of revenue has been under the new Tariff?

It would be a scandal if , now that we are taking from our citizens annually £2,000,000 more than they were forced to pay in previous years, we still said, ""We believe in a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, but we cannot yet afford to establish a fund for that purpose."" gotten that the larger States already have old-age pensions svstems. members say that we cannot yet establish a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, I say that we can under the Bill.",23,Surplus Revenue Bill Second Reading

The honourable member for Flinders, in a clear, lucid, and emphatic speech, said that there was not a shadow of doubt as to our right to exercise these powers, and the strongest adverse opinions I have heard from legal members have been the expression of a doubtful hesitation in regard to the matter. Three or four of the lawyers whom I have consulted say that they believe this legislation to be within our powers. member obtained deliberate opinions from lawyers, or is he speaking of mere casual observations ? paid for; but I think that.they were the result of deliberate consideration'. The people, from whom we have extorted' so much money, should be able to look forward to the receipt of pensions should they in their old age desire them. Not only have the toiling masses to provide the great bulk of our revenue, but, as the Minister of Defence pointed out to-day, they have also to find the flesh and blood to defend the country. Therefore, this, is not a party issue; men of all shades of opinion should be delighted at the opportunity to use part of our one-fourth of the net revenue for old-age pensions on the ist of July, 1909. It is not necessary to discuss at length the principles of a Bill which are apparently generally accepted, though I should make a passing reference to the Conference of Premiers held since it was introduced. It was diought that an opportunity should be given to the Premiers to express their opinions on the subject before we finally dealt with the measure; but we have not got as much help from their deliberations as was expected. I am pleased that the Conference resolved that, in its opinion, a' Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme should be established at the earliest moment. But it made the establishment of such a scheme conditional, whereas Aye, in our promises to our constituents, have been unconditional. gain. that; but we, being pledged in this matter, dare not strike a bargain. If we did, we should be unworthy of our positions, and ought to give our constituents an opportunity to say whether they desire that we should continue in their service. seems to be a hazy idea that, if the Commonwealth expends the whole of its net quarter of Customs and Excise revenue, some of the States will lose more than others. 1 deny that the expenditure will be disproportionate to any serious extent. Each State must pay its share of new expenditure according to population. regard to old-age pension payments. payments for other new services. I do not suppose that the Government require a measure of this kind for transferred services. They have a constitutional warrant for expending their share of the revenue upon such services. I do not think, however, that one State could be debited with such expenditure in another, though I do not dogmatize in this matter. New expenditure, however, will be charged per capita, an arrangement which is fair to all the States. The statement that the large States will provide nearly the whole of the necessary money is. erroneous. Each State will, for all purposes of calculation, practically be called upon only to furnish sums for the payment of old-age pensions to its own citizens, and should be proud to be in a position; to do so. land, New South Wales and Victoria wilt be relieved of their present expenditure. later. If all the States had old-age pensions schemes and if they dealt with each other reciprocally they would still be unable to do what can be done under our legislation. . That is an additional reason for urgency. Should the States which now have old-age pension schemes in operation be financially embarrassed by this Bill, they will have the remedy in their own hands. It is open to them by. a State Act to empower the Federal Government to pay their old-age pensions out of the proportion of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to them, and as scon as they do that their embarrassment will cease. The Commonwealth will pay instead of the State. The States need not suffer a dav longer than they please; but in the case of the States which have no old-age pension scheme in operation, it is absolutely necessary that we should act without delay. This measure simply means that if we pass this session an Old-age Pensions Bill, and make an appropriation for the There specific purpose, there will be no legal obstacle in the way of our paying into a trust fund to help, meet' the obligations",24,Surplus Revenue Bill Second Reading

We must not forget that a member of Parliament can do nothing without the people. We have arduous duties to perform, but the people can always find plenty ready to shoulder the reponsibilities of political life. We can do nothing except by the verdict of the very people who constitute the States, and the point that I wish to impress upon honourable members is that those people have given a thrice repeated verdict which we must not set aside. The Prime Minister has in view in connection with this measure the initiation of a system of defence of whicli as regards its naval side I entirely approve, and my views on which I have in no uncertain manner. No one can deny that the members of the party with which I am associated have always been opposed to the Naval Agreement. When it was first put before us in 1903 by Sir Edmund Barton we did not approve of it j we did our best to defeat.it, and were nearly successf u l . At that time the people were opposed to the attitude we took up, but I believe that to-day three-fourths of the people of Australia are entirely in favour of it . do not mean that we should inaugurate a system of coastal defence which should not be associated with the defence scheme of the Imperial authorities. members will agree that it would not be wise, or even reasonably sane, for us to talk about initiating a scheme of defence dissociated from Great Britain. But in a country which is wholly dependent upon another, we search in vain for that essential of manhood which makes a worthy people and a worthy nation. So soon as a nation leans upon another for support,its people as a people begin to decline. The many natural difficulties with which we have to contend have made the virility of our people what it is to-day ; and it would be a sad day for Australia, ancl those who are to govern her hereafter, if , whilst she is practically a nation, with a constitution under the Crown of Great Britain, her manhood were to shirk their responsibility of defending their country to the last man. The whole question at issue is simply one of method. I am one of those who believe that we should take our own responsibilities upon our own shoulders.

168,Mr Fisher,"I have perhaps drifteddefending ourselves in this way, Great Britain will desert us. Isi t not a fact that some of the most shrewd advisers of His Majesty the King have stated, from time to time, that it would be of great assistance to tlie Imperial Government if we had naval depots and a small fleet to defend our own shores ? Isi t not a fact that almost all authorities declare that all we require at present are ships capable of holding off any stray cruisers for two or three days until the Imperial Fleet shall arrive? I take this opportunity of saying that I have never supported the restriction of the present Australian Squadron of the British Fleet to Australian waters; because my belief is that, where trouble is, there the ships should go. First, we should, secure a system of old-age pensions at the earliest possible date; and I hope that a Bill will be introduced immediately and passed this session providing for their payment not later than the ist July next year. The initiation of a system of defence for our coast ancl harbors should also be undertaken at the earliest moment, but I cannot anticipate that the money will be required for a very considerable time. It is onlyfair, however, that Parliament, as an earnest, should give some indication of its intention; and, therefore, I hope that this Bill will pass after reasonable debate, seeing that it raises no party question, and should be dealt with in the true Federal spirit, in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole. I have listened with much attention to the honourable member for Wide Bay; and I think that if I were to describe his speech as solely one in favour of old-age pensions, I should not be inaccurate. The validity and legality bf this measure does not trouble the honourable member. From his arguments one would almost infer that, in his opinion, justifies the means, whether or not those means are constitutional. altogether opposed to the B ill , and was. prepared to vote a direct negative. As, however, I cannot, under present circumstances, take such a course, I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta. opinion this Bill is not correctly named : it ought to be described rather as ""a B ill to prevent the return to the States of about £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which the Government do not know how to spend, or have not arranged to spend."" My contention is that the measure is an invasion of section 87 of the Constitution; that it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith, and that it is a departure from a clear and honourable understanding, made with the States prior to Federation, at the Federal Convention of 1898-a n understanding on which the States of Australia federated. Those words cover the whole of the contention which I shall advance, in opposition to the measure. Immigration, defence, old-age pensions, and other important or beneficent questions, have nothing whatever to do with my opposition to the B ill . The honourable member for Wide Bay placed prominently before us the great necessity and advisableness of adopting a scheme of old age ^pensions at the earliest possible moment. 1 agree with the honourable member on that' point; but I hold that it has nothing to do with the matter we are now discussing, and, therefore, I shall not touch upon it in the slightest way. the only means I know. Sir JOHN FORREST If the means could thus be provided constitutionally and honorably I should have no objection, but my contention is that this measure is unconstitutional, besides being a breach of faith. ber's objections are on constitutional grounds ? the further ground that rhe Bill represents a departure from a clear and honourable understanding made prior to Federation, and in support of this latter contention I intend to show what the framers of the Constitution said and meant when section 87 was passed. As the Attorney-General says, my contention is, in the first place, that the Bill is ultra vires, and, then, that if it is not ultra vires, it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith .with the practically the end States. I wish to say once and for all that there is no doubt that the Commonwealth, I am under section 87, can expend annually the whole of the one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. member admits that. one can read plain English, it must be admitted.

The section does not .provide that three-fourths, and three fourths only, of the net revenue shall be returned to the States, because, as I have already pointed out, it implies that more may be returned. I contend that if the Commonwealth does not spend the whole of the one-fourth, the .unspent or unused portion must, under section 87, be returned to the States. That view has been acted on ever since, the establishment of the Federation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -What is provided for is the unapplied portion. that ""unapplied"" and ""unused"" have the same meaning. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is just point to be argued. as to whether the word "" applied "" means "" used "" or not is all that can be advanced, I do not see much force in the contention. At any rate, the view I have presented has been acted upon up to the present time; and I have never heard anything to the contrary suggested. No suggestion to the contrary was made at the Convention in 1898, nor has any been made since, although nearly eighteen months have elapsed since the bookkeeping period could have teen terminated. No suggestion of the kind has been made by any Prime Minister, Treasurer, Leader of Labour Party, or, indeed, by any one in this Parliament, except a remark of the .honourable member for Flinders, some months ago, who said he thought such an interpretation was possible. I do not know that the honourable member made ' that remark very deliberately. It was, I think, an opinion that the question was open to doubt. Mr W. H .

The honourable, member, however, on 31st March last, rushed in, and took up the cudgels on behalf of the Government, and expressed a view which is adverse to my contentions and to the interests of the States; and he has the credit, as well as the responsibility, of being the first to suggest such an invasion of States rights. doubt' on the point. member for Flinders was the first I ever heard suggest a doubt. been present. have been kept very close, because I had never heard it expressed by any one before.

The Commonwealth may spend the whole of the one-fourth if it chooses, but, if it does not spend or use the whole of its one-fourth, then, I think, it is clear that the balance must be returned to the States. Further, I contend that under section 87 of the Constitution, this House has no power to the credit any unexpended portion of the Commonwealth's one-fourth ""share of the net Customs and Excise revenue to a trust account, except for the purpose of paying a charge or debt actually incurred, or a liability actually existingwealth enters into a contract? with that point directly. I desire to point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that we have not merely to consider what is desirable in this matter. A great many things are desirable, which it is impossible for us to obtain. If we can, constitutionally, secure the necessary funds to initiate a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, without any breach of good faith with the States, I am quite in accord with most of what the honourable member said. merous lawyers upon the matter, and most of them are positive that this Bill is constitutional, while only a few entertain the I expressed shadow of a doubt about it. to expend the full one-fourth share of the Customs and Excise revenue, to which we are constitutionally entitled, we are at liberty to do so.

Recognising that the States were then suffering under a great many difficulties, he naturally desired to return to them 'as much money as possible, so as to enable them to meet their obligations. At that period several of the States required liberal treatment financially by the Commonwealth. Queensland was suffering froma terrible drought, and Tasmania was in difficulties by reason of the falling off of Customs revenue. were of consequence to Tasmania in those days, whilst Western Australia required every penny that she could get to assist in developing her immense territory. I think, therefore, that when Sir George Turner did his utmost to sustain the financial position of the States during the difficult time that they were passing through, his action commanded the approval of the people of Australia. In his speech on 31st March last, the honourable member for Flinders attached very great importance to section 81. of the Constitution-so much importance, . indeed, that he appeared to almost ignore the provision contained in section 87. . He, apparently, forgot that section 81 is a general provision which is to be found in the constitutions of all British countries. the power of Parliament to appropriate money for the services of the country. It would be impossible to carry on a Constitution if Parliament had not power to appropriate revenue for the public service, subject, of course, to its constitutional powers. But I submit that the words in section 81 ""to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner, and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution,"" do not give us full power, for the power is limited by the provision contained in section 87. The honourable member for Flinders seemed to treat the power conferred under section 81, as if it were plenary, ' whereas I contend that it is limited by the words of section 87. . I submit that the language of section 81 is general in character, and must be read subject to the specific words of section 8y, ""not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth' towards its expenditure."" I take the word ""applied"" to mean used. -continuesThe balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, &c. I believe that the words of thrs section mean that the Commonwealth is at liberty to expend not more than one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise' revenue, and that -the balance of three-fourths-o r more-shal l be returned to the States. I come now to the words "" its expenditure"" contained in section .87. I contend that those words mean actual expenditure. They would, I think, include money due on contracts to the extent of the work actually performed. 1 believe that Even a few thousand pounds they would also include repayments of actual debts and such like. . If we appropriated money to pay debts incurred by the Commonwealth or in connection with contracts actually performed for the Commonwealth, it would be proper to charge it against the expenditure for the year, and it might be put aside if it had not actually been paid until the claims against it we're presented. Colonel FOXTON -Would the honourable member say that the money had been "" used "" in those circumstances? work would have been done, and the money would be actually due. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Ho w could it lie said to have been used when it was actually in the Treasury? would have beeri performed and the money would be actually due, and consequently I hold that it would have been "" used."" At one time the practice in Western Australia, and in other States also, was to keep the Treasury accounts open for some time after the end of the financial year, for any accounts which had 'not been paid at the close of the year, to be paid and charged against the year to which they belonged. during the month following the close of the financial year the money had to be revoted. depend upon the Audit Act.

211,Sir John Forrest,"The Convencovered that meaning. Barton, the leader of the Convention, and the chief member of the Drafting Committee, in explaining what the meaning of the words used were, said-pag e 2457What we intend the amendment to mean is that the whole of the unexpended balance of the Commonwealth shall be paid over to the States. With that assurance all the members ot the Convention were satisfied, and agreed to the provision, used the words "" shall be appropriated."" nothing about appropriation being considered as expenditure, or providing that the unexpended balance of the one-fourth may be placed to a trust fund for future use and not returned to the States. There is nothing in that to suggest that an unexpended balance under section 87 would be regarded as an expenditure, on the ground that it had been appropriated, or, in other words, had been authorized to be expended, but had not Been expended. Sir Edmund Barton said that the whole of the unexpended balance would be annually paid over to the StatesT In summing up the work of the Convention of 1897-8, at page 2471 of the official report of the debates at Melbourne, Sir Edmund Barton saidI will pass on to a much more important provision very lately introduced into the B ill . That stitution which I took part in framing, is a provision that a fourth only of the net revenue of the Commonwealth will be allowed to be expended by the Commonwealth. That is to saythree-fourths or more of the revenue must annually come back to States whose citizens are taxed. All this goes to show that, from the beginning to the end, the intention of the Convention was that under the Braddon section the Commonwealth should annually, return to the States any unexpended balance remaining after liabilities actually in existence had been met. There is no ambiguity in these words. The honourable member for Wide Bay has reminded us that this is not a party question, and I appeal to honourable members, again quoting the honourable member, "" as honest men,"" to say what is the plain, clear, unmistakable meaning of these words. It would seem that, with some honourable members, the end justifies the means. Mr T. H . CATTS -The leader of the Labour Partv did'not say so. actually use those words, but I think that that inference might be drawn from his Sir Edmund observations. After reading these words, uttered by prominent members of the framers of the Constitution at the Convention of which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were members, I appeal to honourable members not to support this proposal on the part of the Government. Is it likely that, but for the proposal of the Government to take advantage of this measure to assist in bringing into operation a scheme of old-age pensions, we should have found the Labour 'Party, consisting of twenty-six members, prepared to support this Bill, irrespective of the interests of the States? I am just as strong a supporter of old-age pensions as is any member of the Labour Party, and but'for my vote and the votes of members from Western Australia who supported me, the power to deal with old-age pensions would not have been in the Constitution; but I urge that the fact that it is proposed to finance a Federal system under this Bill cannot override constitutional considerations, or the honourable understanding made with the States before Federation. That a majority in this House appears to be opposed to the views I have urged, and seem to. me to be willing to do what I consider is a grave injustice to the States,_ will not cause me to waver in my determination to perform what I believe to be my duty, a duty that I owe to my own State and to the people of Australia generally. I owe, too, a duty to the ConandI am not going to subscribe, without the strongest protest, to an interpretation of that Constitution which, I am sure, the Convention did not intend to be placed upon it, and which I do not think is legal.

I am surprised at the attitude of the Government and of the Labour Party, which is always boasting of its desire to do justice. Where are the defenders and protectors of the rights of the States on the Government side of the House? One would imagine from the attitude of honourable members on the Government side of the House, and especially in the Labour corner, that they had not been returned by the people of the States of Australia; that they were here, not to represent the States who have sent them here to look after their constitutional rights and interests, but that these matters were of secondary importance to the passing of some warlike or beneficent measure. cislc.

They are intrusted with the maintenance of law. and order, and with promoting and assisting production from the soil all over this great continent. Remembering all these great duties and obligations, we ought surely to have some sympathy with them in the gigantic work they have intrusted to them.. But we find on the Government side of this House very little sympathy for the States, if we may judge, by this and other measures. The Treasurer seems to have no regard for the obligations resting upon the States, and the demands made upon their revenue. H is sole desire seems to be to try to please honourable members of the Labour Party. He will never please them; he will never satisfy them until he signs their pledge,, and joins their ranks.

They could, with advantage to Australia, spend millions more than they have at their command. Eveni f our revenue this year will be £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of that of last vear, If a i l to see why we should take from the States£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 of that total, unless we have expended it .

We have great power in regard to expenditure and taxation, and', if we wish to finance any scheme designed to benefit the people, we can surely find some way of doing so without trying to drive a coach-and-four through the Constitution for the purpose of depleting the revenues of the States. The course that we -are asked to take cannot, I think, be justified. Eveni f it is legal, it is inexpedient, and reflects discredit upon its advocates. It is wrong that we should even try at this stage to take away from the States, who have not sufficient to provide for their present requirements, a large sum to which they are entitled. have to build railways out of loan moneys, the revenue being insufficient to meet such -demands. There are hundreds of miles of railways awaiting construction, and monev has. to be borrowed for that work.

234,Mr Speaker,"If the right honorDebate resumedHouse adjouined for lunch, I had almost arrived at the end of what I desire to say, but, before I sit down, I should like to recapitulate in a few words my contentions. I contend that, under section 87 of the Constitution, this House has no power to place any unspent or unused portion of its one-fourth of the revenue to a trust account, except for the purpose of paying a .charge or debt actually incurred, or a liability actually ex-'sting. I contend also that the words "" its expenditure ' ' ih section 87 mean actual expenditure, and might, I think, include money due on contracts to the extent of work actually performed, and also the repayment of actual debts and such like. But I have contended-and I contend now-that the words "" it s expenditure"" do not include moneys set aside in a trust account to meet, prospective charges, debts, or prospective liabilities for works not vet incurred, or not yet decided upon. In fact, my contention is that the words "" it s expenditure"" mean bond fide and existing, and not prospective dr visionary liabilities which"" may never come forward for payment. I contend also that, apart from the constitutionality of the measure, it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith, and is a departure from a clear and honourable understanding made before Federation with the States. has been said in so many words that if this B ill is illegal, it cannot do any harm, because it may be set aside by the High Court.

I suppose that later on we may be addressed by some legal members, and we shall then see whether there is or is not any doubt in their minds as to its validity. I think few will venture to say that there is no doubt whatever. Mr W. H . IRVINE No one can state more than his own opinion. some things so evident that we may almost stake our existence on them. A t any rate, I do not think the honourable member for Flinders will say there is no element of doubt as to the interpretation which may be placed on this B ill by the High Court. My point is that it must be admitted that there is an element of doubt in this matter-thoug h I have no doubt myselfand if that is so, then especially when we are dealing with friendly States, composed prospective of our own people, we should not try to strain our powers to the uttermost. For a long time. I have had strong complaint to make in regard to this straining of the Federal powers.

AlthoughI concede that much, I must admit to a feeling of deep regret that the right honourable member should even suggest that this Bill is in any way a breach of faith or a violation of the spirit of the Constitution. The feeling of the House all through has been to pay the greatest regard to the rights and duties of the States; in fact, a great deal of our trouble has arisen from a sincere desire on the part of the Treasurer and honourable members to iri.no wise embarrass the States in the early stages of Federation. We' realized that during the early life of the Constitution there were certain limitations which were intended as a direction to this Parliament; and during the first five-year period, when we were realizing what our finances were, and what the effect of Federation might be on the States, it was felt that we should stay our hands and "" go slow."" Possibly we have erred in going too slowly, and' in failing to realize that the people of Australia created the Commonwealth Parliament as a national Parliament, and vested it with national powers, to be exercised for their good. The general attitude of this Parliament has been, and still is, one of sympathy with the States. Another impression that the honourable member left upon the minds of his hearers was that the I appeal to the GoCommonwealth and States are entirely separate entities, apart from the people. I think that the electors' view of the matter will be: ""We have established two sets of agents-Federa l and State. We have given them separate powers, the first puted that. member talked about the Commonwealth and the States as if the Commonwealth were something external to the people, when, as a matter of fact, both are one and the same people.

To do so means that we shall be obliged to levy heavy imposts upon the people if we intend to fulfil our national functions.

In contional; secondly, that it is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution Sir JOHN honourable understanding which was, arrived at. depart from that honourable understanding would be tantamount to a breach of faith. I will deal with his points seriatim. His claim that the Bill .is unconstitutional is based upon -his contention that it violates section 87 of the Constitution. He urges that the meaning of that section is that the monev which the Commonwealth does not actually expend in one year, or which is not set aside to meet an existing debt or liability, or to cover payments in connection with contracts to the extent to which they have , been fulfilled, must be returned to the States. readsDuring a period of ten years after the estabnational functions.' lishment of the -Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.

The section does not read ""shall not expend,"" but in effect "" s h a l l not apply."" What is the meaning of the word "" apply,"" when used in connection with financial sections? I think.

It readsAU revenues or moneys raised or received by fhe Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to means the same thing as "" a p p l y ."" be' appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the, charges and liabilities imposed by this Constidifferent meaning.

But I would point out . that that word, is always used in connection with appropriations, and that it really means "" appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth."" It is now an ordinary practice in the High Court in interpreting the Constitution to contend that we must look at Statutes enacted by the Imperial Parliament, with the view to giving to similar words in our ownConstitution a similar meaning.

Consequently the words .ot section 87 mean that not more than one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise duties shall.be applied and appropriated annually towards the services of the Commonwealth. Otherwise why is the word "" towards "" used in that section?

The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States' taken over by the Commonwealth. The honourable member places implicit reliance upon the wording of that section. But I submit that his contention cannot be maintained in view of what I have already said. His next point is that we must look at the spirit of the agreement made between the several States. In this connection, he has quoted the opinions of members of the Federal Convention. But in every one of those utterances, I would, 1 point out that the word ""apply "" is used, and in moving an amendment to this very -provision, which was finally, adopted, the late Sir Edward Braddon, who seemed to thoroughly understand the meaning of the word, saidI t would be preferable that, for the Commonwealth expenditure, there should be set aside not exceeding one-fourth of the Customs' net revenue, leaving the balance, whatever it might bea balance certainly of three-fourths, and possibly, at first, of more than three-fourthsto be distributed amongst the States. of the 'Federal Convention debates is the would, point out that it is not safe to rely upon isolated passages from speeches in the Convention for an interpretation of the Constitution. Then Sir Edmund Barton, on page 2457, is reported to have saidI f my honourable friend will refer back,, he will see that not more than one-fourth shall be appropriated by_ the Commonwealth. ' He used the word ""appropriated"" there in a'technical sense,'so that what he meant was that any unappropriated balance .should be returnable to the .States. The right honorable member for Swan quoted' Sir Edmund Barton as sayingWhat we intend the amendment to mean is that the whole of the unexpended balance of the Commonwealth shall be paid over to the States. But, later on, Sir Edmund Barton explained what he meant by unexpended balance. Let me read the whole passageJOHN FORREST -Whethe r we exthat the whole of the unexpended balance shall be paid over to the States. For thtt reason I should like the Drafting Committee to adhere to the original wording of the clause. , ment to mean is that the whole of the unexpended balance of the Commonwealth shall be paid over to the States. the balance of the revenue collected, less one-fourth. .refer back he will see that not more than one-fourth shall be appropriated by the Commonwealth. If less than one-fourth is appropriated, the unexpended balance, which may be more than three-fourths, will go back to the States. The whole context must be considered in arriving at an opinion. ports my argument. ber must form his own conclusions; but 1 think that the reasonable construction is that not more than one-fourth shall be appropriated, and that the word ""applied""",38,Forrest Ther E Might Be Priation Is Limited By Section 87 Which He

309,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I do nottake into account the meaning, not merely of these words, but of the word "" take."" It would seem from the Treasurer's statement of his intentions that it is a case, not of using or even of applying money, but of taking money. was to provide for specific purposes uncler the Constitution. Treasurer said that, in the future, the Government would require all surplus revenue, ancl meant to have it . poses of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. an assurance'in that regard, for the power given by the Bill is a very wide one. I do not object to the establishment of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions. On the contrary, I have always approved of old-age pensions being uncler the control of the Commonwealth. I supported the system as a State undertaking in preFederation days, and with the establishment of the Commonwealth I considered that such a scheme should be taken over by the Federal authority. Buti f the Ministry pass an Old-age PensionsB ill, it will annually absorb far more than any surplus Customs revenue we are likely to have. That is another reason why this Bill seems to me to be unnecessary. vide for an accumulation? Minister now takes power to accumulate, or to hold oyer, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, considerable sums in a trust account. Then it has been claimed that this Bill will only absorb the actual surplus, and as regards that surplus it is said that we have been returning to the States every year, on an average, £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the proportion of revenue to which they are actually entitled. We have not teen doing anything of the sort. A considerable portion of that amount, Tanging from £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 , really represents interest on the value of the transferred properties which we have not yet paid to the States. They certainly have not lost anything in that regard, because the surplus moneys which we have returned to them have been far in excess of the interest actually due in respect of those properties. But we have no right to take credit to ourselves for having returned to the States, on the average, £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year in excess of what we were required to do, when, in reality, we have handed back to them only about one-half of that amount. The other day, the Treasurer, when foreshadowing the requirements of the Commonwealth, indicated that, even during this year of boom revenue, he anticipated a surplus of only £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 odd. He did not make it clear whether or not we should have that surplus after appropriating £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for naval defence purposes. In that case, we should have a surplus of only £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, in the other, a surplus of something over £400,000* In reality, we shall have little or no surplus. As the Prime Minister told us to-day, the I desired valuation of the transferred properties is practically complete, and immediately it has been settled, interest upon them will become payable by us. We become the trustees, though not the owners, of the properties; and we have to provide the interest out of our one-fourth of the revenue, thus absorbing the surplus of this boom year. The Minister foreshadowed that, in the immediate future, he did not anticipate so large a revenue, and that he expected still larger demands, apart altogether from old-age pensions. I really do not know whalTTesult is to be attained, at any rate this year, by"" means of this B ill. It would have been much better not to have introduced this measure, but to have brought down an Old-age PensionsB ill , which would, in itself, absorb all the surplus, and mors. The Of course that might necessitate a financial arrangement with two or three of th* States, who would be asked to give ati equivalent contribution in consideration ot their being eased of the obligation to pay pensions. In any case, however, all"" th<; surplus would be more than absorbed by old-age pensions; and I see no necessity whatever for measures of the sort now before us. Such a Bill has not been found necessary hitherto. We are supposed to be intending to take only a portion of the surplus, and when'we ask where the surplus is, we find that it does not exist. The Treasurer will admit that the . payment of interest, which will shortly begin on the transferred properties, will practicallv absorb all that is anticipated as surplus. Another matter of regret is that in this measure the system of bookkeeping is continued. This is most unfortunate, in view of the fact that one of the strongest reasons for Federation was that it would",41,Forrest Tha T Provision It To Enable Us To Carry On The Great Work

The desire was to have free borders and free coasts as between State and State, so that, among other things, the trouble and expense of passing complicated entries for goods might be done away with, and a free exchange substituted, such ss there ought to be in what is one country. must admit that any change would cause dislocation to some extent. only to make an arrangement in accordance with our experience since Federation. What was the bookkeeping period provided for ? One of the objects of Federation was to make the welhto-do States assist the less well-to-do States; but it was found that a burden might be placed on the weaker States unless there was a guide as to the duties paid on goods actually consumed in each State. Thereupon the clumsy, awkward, but, I must admit, for the time necessary, system of Inter-State bookkeeping was established. Now, however, we are at the end of the five years, and, with the experience gained, we know what would be a fair' adjustment between the States. As a matter of fact, there has already been an adjustment between New South 'Wales and Victoria, and, that being so, it ought to be possible for the Commonwealth to devise a scheme fair to all the other States. Yet, here it is proposed to contmue the present troublesome and inaccurate system. for the big States as for the smaller States of Tasmania and Queensland. known what the effect has been in those States under the bookkeeping, system. keeping section, Queensland would have been a very heavy loser"". would appear that the present system must go on for ever. honourable member as to the undesirableness of the system. matter of fact, the present system is more troublesome and difficult than the preFederation system of oollecting duties, inasFederal Convention.

Indeed, the system is only made possible by evasionto use an Irishism, it is only possible.because it is. not observed. It is impossible for me to believe that the firms who handle these goods make the complete analyses which are called for under the bookkeeping section; and the work can be done only in such a rough manner"" as to make it quite inaccurate. I feel sure that a settlement could become to which would pav every consideration to the smaller States, and thus there would be removed a system which is a blot on our Federation. I did hope that when Ministers were dealing with the question, they would abolish the bookkeeping; but, on the contrary, we find it deliberately continued by means of this measure. There are no issues at stake that could not be easily met, and it is most .desirable that we should, in every respect, feel that we are one people. It ought to be possible to send goods from Melbourne to Perth or elsewhere, with just as much ease as from Melbourne to Warrnambool. in the retail trade. the honourable member could give illustrations of the difficulty and the absurdity of the system which, though useful for its immediate purpose, was never intended' to be continued.

Although the right honourable member for Swan said that he did not speak as a lawyer, he argued with considerable skill and ability, evidently understanding his subject thoroughly, because he was able to handle it as well as a great lawyer could have done.

The'Surplus Revenue Bill is not yet law, and yet action has been taken to flout the Constitution as if that Bill had been approved by Parliament, and assented to. The action of the Treasurer is one of the most arbitrary and ill-advised that could possibly be taken, and I hope that the Prime Minister has sent a reply to the Premier of Western Australia, stating that If there should be any whatever instructions have been issued are contrary to the plain words of the Consti tution, and that the ordinary practice, _ ^ adopted for the last seven years, will be continued. [4.5] I think that we ought to have, besome statement from the Treasurer furnishing an explanation dear! .The hororable member is singing out before he is hurt! "" singing out "" at all. I am simply asking, as respectfully as I can, for an explanation from, the Treasurer. wish to ask whether the Treasurer cannot see his way to throw some light on the matter that has been brought before the House by the right honourable member for Swan. Surely when the Premier of a State telegraphs to a member of this House on a matter of such importance, the Minister of State primarily responsible ought to be able lo offer an immediate explanation. .1 do not think we are asking for any more than we are entitled to.",46,Forrest Tha T Provision It To Enable Us To Carry On The Great Work

349,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [4.6],"I alsodown ! sit down if the Treasurer is prepared to get up. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume--Treasurer) [4-7]--Honorabl e members opposite are squealing: yet called the Treasurer. Has the honourable member for Wentworth finished his speech ? speech is attained, as the Treasurer is prepared to speak, I have nothing more to sav. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE -What happened was this: The end of the month of May has not yet arrived. It has been usual, when the end of the month falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, to pay on the Friday. telegraphed to the' States on this occasion giving reasons why the balances were not to be paid to the States to-day. The reason was this-that it was hoped that the Surplus RevenueB ill would be passed! The Bill ought to have been through. I hope that it will be through before the end of next month. There is no intention, nor was there ever any intention, to create a breach of the Constitution. countermand the instruction? Revenue Bill has not yet become law, the money will be paid to the States in the usual' way-the three-fourths, at any rate. . Constitution requires, the money will be paid. But I am not going to say any more about the matter. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [4.9] The explanation which the Treasurer has given iis has created very grave doubts 1 ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE so. I have said that whatever the Constitution requires will be done. Mr W. H . IRVINE the telegram which the right honourable 1 member for Swan read stated that the instructions given were that neither this month's balance nor the succeeding month'? balance were to be paid. The question which I wish to ask. is this-is it the serious intention of the Government, or of the member is under a wrong impression. Surely. Treasurer, before the Surplus Revenue Bill that .is enough. . is passed, to deprive the States not merely of what may be the surplus for the remainhimself must know [417]2 ing month, but to deprive them of an amount equal to all the surpluses that they I am quite prepared to have had during-the preceding months of this financial year? Because, if that be so, I venture to think that that state of affairs will put a totally different complexion upon the whole proceeding, from that which has been, put upon the policy of the Government by this House. It will mean making the Surplus Revenue Bill retrospective in the very worse sense, by taking back from . , the States, in effect, what has been paid over to them, and depriving them absolutely-if that view be right-of the provision which the Constitution has made for . . them for the remaining month bf this year. I cannot believe that that is the real meaning: Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is merely in the honourable member's imagination. Mr W. H . IRVINE It is not merely The Acting Under-Treasurer my imagination, because Mr W. H . IRVINE -Becaus e the Premier of Western Australia, in the telegram sent to the right honourable member for Swan, if I caught its purport aright, says that the instructions of «the Treasurer were "" nor any other-month."" Mr W. H . IRVINE -S o that the instructions apply to "" any othei month."" for excitement. If necessary, the officers will get fresh instructions. Mr W. H . IRVINE It seems pretty clear, that what I have stated is the fact. It means this-that during the past ten months is that we have been paying too much to the States, and that we are now going to take money back from the States. If the telegram of the Western Australian Premier means anything, it means that; and, further, that we are going to take money back It ought not to do from the States by extracting from them all the revenue to-which they would otherwise be entitled during these last two As I understand, months'of the nnancial year. If that be the intention of the Treasurer) It h i nk that it requires further explanation. I suggest that the explanation which the Treasurer has given us needs to be further explained, or else Mr W.

361,Sir William Lyne,"The honourable-say any more about it. Mr W. H . IRVINE I am not going to allow the Treasurer to prevent me from proceeding to express my views orr this subject. The right . honourable member for Swan has read a telegram-, the meaning of which is as clear as possible, if the statement in it be true. That telegram was sent by the Premier of Western Australia, and it says that instructions have been given not to pay any moneys to that particular State. has a copy of the telegram also. Mr W. H . IRVINE I want.to know -and I . think that the House is entitled to know-whethe r such"" instructions were, in fact, issued; and, if they were issued, are they capable of any other meaning whatever than that the intention of the Treasurer is to compel the States to refund the moneys which have been paid to them, monthly during the past months of this financial year ? MT. JOHNSON (Lang) [4.13] I think that we have a light to complain of the tone adopted by the Treasurer towards honourable members of this House when he. is asked for information upon important public questions. Honourable members are entitled to resent the contemptuous manner adopted by the. Treasurer when addressing himself to members on this side of the House, dressed the honourable member for Wentworthwas, undoubtedly, unbecoming to. the ' dignity of the Treasurer's position. him? Tight to treat any honourable member in such an abrupt, curt and overbearing manner. The question under discussion has arisen in consequence of the telegram received by the right honourable member for Swan from the Premier of Western Australia. But the matter affects every other State's finances. The explanation given by the Treasurer was not satisfactory; in fact, the Treasurer's explanations never are very satisfactory. I understand the position to be that instructions will' now be given by the Treasurer that only the three-fourths constitutionally payable to the States will be paid -. That may have been a wrong impression, but the. Treasurer's explanation was so short, snappy, and incoherent, that' the House does not really know even now what is the real financial proposal he has in mind regarding the amount to be paid to the States .for this month. Mr W. H . IRVINE -What the Treasurermeans is that the three-fourths will be paid this month. even make that clear. It remains for another honourable member' to explain what he thinks was in the Treasurer's mind. I do not think that any honourable member is much wiser now than, he was before the Treasurer spoke; and I feel"" guite sure something is to be kept back. External Affairs) [4.14] -It is very unfortunate that, so simple and clear a 'matter should be distorted. Mr W. H . IRVINE -I s that a fair statement ? that the Treasurer's telegram -related only to the'month of May, and to any later month. In the next place, I should have thought that honourable members were aware that this question was dealt with at the recent Premiers' Conference. I informed the States Ministers that the Surplus Revenue Bill was proposed to affect any sum to be paid after that date, and not any moneys already paid to them. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It does affect moneys paid before. Question resolved in fhe affirmative. The. manner in which he adHouse adjourned at 4.15 p.m.",48,Payment To Fore The Prime Minister Himself Replies
