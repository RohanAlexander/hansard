0,"House Of Representatives. Wednesday, S March, 1926. Mr Si'eakjsk Groom) Took The Chair Ar 3 P.m., And Read Prayer3. Of A Message From The Governor","General informing the Houso that the proposed law, which was reserved for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure, had been laid before His Majesty in Council, and that His Majesty had by an Order in Council, dated the 25th day of February, One. thousand nine hundred and twentysix, confirmed, approved, and declared bis assent to it. (Hon. Sir Littleton",14,Setup
1,Mr Speaker Announced The Receipt,"The Governor General had caused the King's assent to be proclaimed in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. 18, dated 1st March, 1926. it has been stated in the press that it is the intention of France, and possibly of other powers, to take steps to enlarge the Council of the League of Nations by the appointment of representatives of Poland, Brazil, and Spain to permanent scuts on it . I ask the Prime Minister, therefore, whether he is in a position to_ say that this information, or any part of it , is true, ancl what representations, if any, he has made to the British Government in relation to this proposal, which would effect a radical change in the Council, and wight be pregnant with serious consequences to the League, to the Empire, and to the Commonweal th ? treaties which were signed at Locarno, Germany is applying for admission to the League of Nations. One of the t-irms of her application is that she shall have a representative sitting as a permanent member of the Council. A meeting of the League is to be held shortly to consider this matter. Certain other countries have for some time past been putting forward claims to permanent seats on the Council of the League, and they aro taking advantage of the present occasion to press those claims. These are the claims of individual countries, and the position is not, as has been suggested, that Prance is proposing that any country should be given u permanent seat upon the Council. The Government has been in communication with the British Government on the whole subject. The Prime Minister of GreatB r it a in w ill probably to-morrow, or possibly to-day, make a statement on the matter,' and until that statement has been made, I think it advisable not to say anything about it . honourable gentleman that the Government has represented to the British Government its views on the proposal, and in this matter it is confident that they are the views hold by the whole of the people of Australia. from the Prime Minister the reason why the Government has departed from the usual practice of asking the Trade and Labour Councils of Australia to make choice of a Labour representative at the Geneva Conference. On this occasion the Government has made representations to the Council of the Federated Unions, in viting them to make the selection. the League of Nations the delegates to be sent to any Conference of International Labour must be selected in consultation with the representatives of employees generally in the community. The Government this year addressed the Council of the Federated Unionsi n the belief that they represented generally the unions throughout Australia, but I havo since had it represented to mc that thar is not exactly the position, and that the Trade and Labour Councils should have a voice in the matter. Consequently, the Government has now invited the Trade and Labour Councils to send in any names they desire for selection. I remind the honourable member that these bodies are not entitled to nominate a definite representative, but to submit names to the Government for its consideration. OIL EXPLORATION ExrEsniTUSE.

8,Mr Bruce,"The Queensland Goso. I received a telegram last week from tlie Premier stating that his Government proposed to sign the Migration Agreement, and asking me to send him new copies of it. Copies were sent to all the States, but apparently those sent to the Queensland Government have been mislaid. The request for new copies is an indication that that Government proposes to sign the agreement, and when it does, Queensland, together with the other signatory States, will be entitled to the benefits of the scheme. MAIN ROADS GRANT. tion about the main roads grant, I wish to read an extract from the South upon noticeAustralian Advertiser, dated the 24th February, 1926, reading as follows:Tlie Premier said the Commonwealth Government proposed to make available certain money on a £ for £ basis, and that, bad been done for years. The Government wanted to ascertain whetlier it would be of advantage to the meeting unanimously expressing grave appreState. Whetheri t was constitutional or not was not in question to-day. torney-General, says it is not constitutional. I now ask the Attorney-General whether he has said that the Main Roads Development Act or the proposed grant is unconstitutional? to give legal opinions in response to questions asked by honourable members; but I direct the attention of the honourable orable member's questions are as follow:member to the section of the Constitution which refers to the giving of nnancial assistance to the States by the Commonaware of the attitude that w ill be taken by wealth. On no occasion have I said that the British Government in respect to. any in the Main Roads Development Act was micrease in thc membership of the Council of the constitutional. yet been made respecting the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway? tween the Commonwealth and the States concerned has not yet been finalized. General's speech is the statement that a sum of money will be advanced to the States for the purchase of wire netting. There have been great ravages by pests, particularly in Western Australia, because of the lack of fences. I have been inundated with letters to this effect, and I should like to know when the Government intends to bring forward a bill to deal with this matter. to introduce at an early date the measure to which the honourable member has referred. 1. Has his attention been drawn to a cablegram that opposition to increasing the membership of the Council of the League of Nations beyond the admission of Germany was voiced by members of all parties at a largely attended meeting of the League of Nations Parliamentary Committee of the House of Commons, the hension of the proposal to make fundamental changes in the constitution of the Council, and urging the Government to offer strenuous opposition ? 2. W ill lie state whetlier this expression by members of the League of Nations Parliamentary Committee, if supported by the British Government, w ill involve Australia into supporting it? 3. If so, what opportunities have the people of Australia to agree or disagree with the sentiment expressed? 1. Yes. 2. The Comnioiiwealth Government is not yet League of Nations. 3. The Government, in coming to any decision on the attitude it may take up on this question w ill naturally give clue consideration to Australian publie opinion, and will make the appropriate representations accordingly.

30,Mr Pratten,"I should like toin committee. The industiy had "" touched bottom "" before the tariff wag imposed. The proportion of unemployment was never greater; in almost all sections of the industry there was grave unemployment, and the story was the same in Sydney, Melbourne, Geelong, Warrnambool, Stawell, Ballarat, and Hobart. We spent huge sums overseas for goods for which a considerable proportion of the raw material was derived from Australia, while this natural, national, and highly important basic industry was wilting. Ineffective protection-ineffectiv e in view of the high standard of wages prescribed -""wa s the only feasible explanation of this. can be sustained against the Australian manufacturers, because charges of that sort are answered by the fact that failure and declining business were the experience of those, whose plant and methods were admittedly as good as any in the world, as well as of that small proportion who entered the business unequipped and untrained. There are over 50 woollen factories in the Commonwealth, three-fifths of which are in the country districts. In addition to important knitting factories, many small knitting establishments have sprung up in our midst as a result of the new tariff, because that tariff has revived and resuscitated the whole textile industry, and given it fresh hope. The action of the Government has been f u l l y justified by the large amount of additional employment found and projected, and the consumer to-day is able to purchase Australian goods of equal value in many cases to the foreign goods upon which he has previously spent his money. quirements of Australia in knitted wear and cotton tweeds, if not met now, will within a few months be almost completely met by the developments that are taking place in the textile industries. Tliere will still be a considerable field for expansion in other textile lines, as seven-eighths of the woollen, cotton tweed, and shoddy goods used in Australia have in the past been brought from overseas, but this position, we hope, will be reversed iu the not distant future. mean by "" shoddy goods?"" orable member all about shoddy goods when we come to deal with them. import into this country about 18,000,000 square yards of woollens and worsteds, and in 1923-24 we made in our own factories only 5,000,000 square yards of woollen tweed and cloth. Flannel, blankets, and rugs are being made almost to the f u l l requirements of . the Commonwealth; but we have not yet got very much further, even to-day, with pure woollen and worsted cloths, for of them we make only about one-fourth of Australia's requirements. The Australian production in 1924-25 was actually lower than in 1919-20. There has been violent agitation about what are termed the "" proN o charge of inefficiency hibitive "" duties that have been placed by the tariff upon cotton tweeds or shoddy cloth; and the London Times Swpplement of the 7th November last actually published a resolution passed by an important body in Australia opposing the duties on cotton tweeds, towels, & c , for the alleged reason that it was impossible to manufacture cotton tweeds in any part of Australia. What are the' facts ? W it h in a month of the imposition of the duties those factories that had supplies of cptton yarn started the manufacture of cotton goods, and to-day the mills can supply the whole of the few million yards of cotton tweeds previously imported each year. And not only can they supply a good article at a reasonable price, but the public has the inestimable advantage accruing from a practical prohibition of the importation into Australia of shoddy goods. Much of the imported shoddy deceived the unwary purchaser. It could hardly be described as better or stronger than brown paper. The reOur 52 mills would require to be trebled to be able to manufacture the whole of our requirements in woollen cloths, worsteds, aud male dress materials. There is a vast field of employment still untouched in this national basic industry, for which we cau readily supply the whole of the raw material. A few days ago a most interesting letter was sent to me, quite voluntarily, by the management of an old-established country woollen mill, which p'lts the tariff position most succinctly from the point of view of the textile manufacturers. It readAs one of the oldest woollen mills in AusI shall tell the hontralia you may appreciate our opinion on the working of the new tariff as it applies to the textile industry in Australia.

In no case in cient protection, where the market has been preserved by high duties for industry has thereby been firmly established, have high duties-always considering our standard of social life-meant any material alteration in prices. I am informed and believe that the [duties have prevented the closing up of several important engineering shops in Australia. I dare say we shall have a few words from representatives of the western State, and I shall have pleasure in putting before them, in due course, the national aspect of the tariff items that are proposed. I want to remind them of the position of their State from the standpoint of the rest of the Commonwealth. First of all, we claim to have in our tariff a larger free list than any other protectionist country in the world. The financial position of Western Australia so far as the tariff is concerned is that the net revenue from Customs and excise in that State, in 1924-25, was £1,994,000. £588,000. This deducted from the Customs and excise taken together, will give £1,406,000 collected in that State in Customs duties alone. I do not suppose that representatives of Western Australia would claim that the people of that State should differ from those of other States of the Commonwealth in their contribution to thc revenue from spirits and narcotics. I shall, consequently, deal with purely Customs duties. capita grant to Western Australia in 1924-25 was £561,000. A special grant of £450,000 is proposed this year in addition. £395,000 net received by the Commonwealth from Customs duties imposed in Western Australia. It is common knowledge that we derive most of the money required for the administration of the Mr Pratten. Commonwealth, and payment of war debts, from Customs duties. Western Australia contributes from this source an amount which, deducting the per capita payment and the proposed payment of £450,000 subsidy order. The Minister is proceeding to discuss some mythical suggestion or arrangement for commuting the per capita payment to Western Australia after consideration of the amount paid connection generally with effiby the people o.f that State in Customs duties. This would launch the committee into a discussion of the finances of the local manufacturers, aud the Commonwealth which would be more proper to a consideration of the budget. I submit that tbe Minister is not entitled to take this course. If it is decided that he may, we shall be unable to discuss the tariff on its merits. I gathered from the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs that he was referring to the financial position in Western Australia in order merely to point a moral. honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) slightly misunderstood the drift of my remarks. Less the deductions I have mentioned, the net sum received from Western -Australia from Customs duties would be £395,000. fchat all the factors requiring consideration are not included in the sums he has The total excise was given. zens of the Commonwealth have to find the money to pay the interest on our war debts, the cost of old-age pensions, and other Commonwealth expenditures, and the grants for main roads and wire netting which are proposed.

The -per In strenuously opposing Customs duties merely because they are Customs duties, they remind me of the person who destroyed the goose that laid the golden eggs. This will leave a balance of A great complaint is being made in some quarters on the ground that by imposing these Customs duties we are deliberately penalizing British trade.

In just about as much as we sold. The greatest balance of trade against us is in our trading with the United States of America. The greatest balance of trade in our favour is in our trading with France and Italy. In the case of the United States of America we take entirely manufactured goods, and in the case of France and Italy we send them almost entirely raw material. again want to stress, in connection with the controversy with regard to our preference to Great Britain, that in 1924-5 the value of goods from the United Kingdom which were admitted free under the preferential tariff was £27,400,000. Had these goods been subject to the general tariff rates the duty collected would have been £3,400,000. And if they had been charged the general tariff rates, the ad valorem duty upon them would have been about 12Jr per cent. The value of goods from the United Kingdom which were dutiable under both the general and the preferential tariffs was £38,000,000. We collected duty on these goods of a little over 26 per cent., or £10,000,000, and had they been subject to the general tariff rates the duty collected upon them would have been £14,600,000, or a little over 38 per cent. So that the clear preference given to the United Kingdom is over 12^ per cent, on the whole of her trade. £8,000,000 a year. from the figures that we give a preference to British trade which amounts to about £8,000,000 a year. The Commonwealth accorded to British goods a preference of £8,000,000 for the year 1924-5. We are, by the proposals before the committee, giving an additional preference to Great Britain which will practically mean a further rebate annually of £500,000 more. Honourable members will agree that first so far as our own manufactures and development are concerned. Our preferences are the most substantial, the most sympathetic, and the most generous in the Empire. We do not limit ourselves to that. Under the Industries Preservation Act, scores of cases have occurred in which, on the application of thc agents or importers of British goods, we have brought section 9 into action for the succeeding year we took Britain's sole benefit, and have placed dumping duties upon foreign goods which came into competition with British goods on this market, although such goods were not made in the Commonwealth, and were allowed into Britain herself entirely free. We have taxed the people of the Commonwealth by imposing some duties upon foreign goods entirely to protect BritishI imports in this market, apart altogether from any other consideration than that of conserving and helping the trade of the Mother Country and penalizing that of foreigners when it came into competition with her interests. This, in my opinion, is a drastic proceeding to protect British trade, and in spite of all opposition, both in the Mother Country and here, to the duties proposed by the Government, it can be said that Britain is still holding the trade. Her proportion of trade with us has not decreased in spite of our proper desire to develop the secondary industries in Australia, and in connection with the great interest exhibited in the Mother Country respecting immigration to Australia, and filling up our empty spaces, may I suggest to my fellow countrymen there that migration of industry should, in their minds, be linked with the migration of people. As an illustration of the benefits of the tariff to Britain, I would point out that the contract for the electrification of the Sydney' and suburban railways was secured by a British firm. It was admitted that, but for' the tariff preference accorded to Britain by the Commonwealth, this great contract would have gone to the foreigner. In other words, our tariff preference to Great Britain enabled that country to get the business. In many cases the tariff serves no other purpose than to protect the British manufacturer. In cotton goods alone, British traders do an enormous volume of business here, we should place Australia which the preference in their favour enables them to hold. Our fiscal position, if studied, will reveal the extent to which consideration is being given to the manufacturers of the United Kingdom, while little has been given to those of foreign countries. In al'l these considerations, it",39,Excise Duties

In this respect the year 1923-4 was disastrous for Australia, partly due bo tlie adverse exchanges that were unfairly ruling against the Commonwealth. The last financial year showed to greater advantage, owing to the improvement of the exchange, and an importation of over £10,000,000 worth of gold instead of goods; but even now our adverse balance of trade with the world, if we include payment of interest abroad, is upwards ot' £20,000,000 short of requirements. The motion which I have formally moved preparatory to a f u l l detailed discussion of the tariff jjroposals of the Government, covers the same items as were previously laid upon the table, and no more. alteration of date owing to the lapse of time has had to be made in several of the deferred duties submitted. The cottontweeds items has had to be re-drafted to cover exactly what was intended by the Government, and no more. This item is now much better defined, and wil l give greater facilities and clearer departmental administration in connection with division V . This complicated division has always been the most difficult in administration and classification, and there is a clear improvement made regarding the wording of the item. define woollen piece goods in a better way, and in committee I hope to give satisfactory reasons for the alteration in the wording. Two or three omissions and additions in particular words have been adjusted. The duty on screw hooks, eyes, and rings has been deferred u n t i l 1st January next, because their manufacture here has not yet been started. An error in item 381 of 5 per cent, has been rectified, and all British films have been included as free. Had the reductions in duty proposed by the Government come into force on the date of the tabling of the last tariff proposals, it is estimated that the Customs duties collected since then would have been about £400,000 less. I may also submit to the committee two or three items respecting reductions for slight alteration consequent on the Tariff Board's inquiry and report. tion of the date of the deferred duty on glass ? specified by the Minister are the figures in this schedule the same as in the schedule presented i u September last? as I know.

That opposition has come, not only from the trading sections, but also from many public bodies whose activities are restricted, and whose duties are rendered more difficult to discharge, by the additional expense caused by these duties.

In effect, he contended that the representatives of the State should not oppose these duties, because, if they did, their State would not be able to get from the Commonwealth assistance in the form of an annual grant. His attitude was extraordinarily inconsistent and illogical. First he told us that certain duties were intentionally prohibite n .

This schedule is important for another reason; it is the first to be based upon reports of the Tariff Board since the law was amended to require that its investigations should be conducted in public. Honourable members will recollect the fight that preceded that amendment of the Tariff BoardA c t . All that has happened since is a complete justification of the attitude of those honourable members who fought so strenuously for the public hearing of all investigations by the board. never have known, that the International Harvester Company refused to give evidence before the board. for Bass will have an opportunitv lo speak later. jection is very pertinent.

If the honourable member for Bass will rise in his place later and advance his views in a regular manner, I shall have much pleasure in answering him. The demand that the board's investigations should be conducted in public has been f u l l y justified. Matters that previously were the subject of private negotiation are now dealt with in public, and those who have studied the newspaper reports of proceedings before the board during the last year or so must have been rather surprised by some of the revelations. As this is the first schedule to be tabled as a result of open investigation by the board, this committee has a duty to look closely into the methods of procedure, analyse the reports of the board, and satisfy itself that the recommendations were in accordance I should not be with the weight of evidence. I have been criticized in the past for reflecting upon the board. That body is the creature of this Parliament and who, if not Honourable members may the parliamentary representatives of the people, should criticize it ? An honourable member is justified in bringing before the House any facts or comments relating to tbe operations of the board which he thinks warrant consideration. Therefore I intend to criticize the board -fairl y and honorably I hope-and I shall resent any suggestion that such criticism is necessarily unjust. We are entitled to ask ourselves whether the board has functioned in a right and proper manner. In regard to the public hearings, the public has been often shocked by the cupidity of applicants; their admissions of inability to meet ordinary competition in their business have amounted almost to confessions of in efficiency. There is need for a change of attitude towards these claims for fiscal help.

H a d the Miuister been possessed of a keener sense of humour he would have taken good care to keep that letter in his cabinet instead of reading it to honourable members. The argument is continually being advanced that we require to establish industries in Australia. opposing these tariff increases are in entire agreement with that sentiment. We resent the suggestion that we are opposed to the establishment of industries in Australia. method is being adopted. Protectionists assume that an industry may be established in only one way. We join issue with them there. We are just as anxious as are any protectionists to see industries established in Australia, but we claim that it is a misapplication of the term to say that an industry is "" established "" when it has to be spoon-fed. There might be something in the argument that au industry should be artificially assisted over its initial difficulties. All we claim is that after protection for a limited period, it should be expected to get into deep water and swim by itself. The Minister should inquire, even suspiciously, into many of the applications for subsidies from the public purse to establish industries. Board is supposed to be the guardian of the public purse. It s duties are to make those inquiries and investigations which the Minister feels that he cannot make himself. Every applicant on behalf of a company asking for tariff assistance should be required to disclose its balance sheet. Thc board should make a searching investigation into its financial position, including the capital value of its property and its business methods generally. If this were done we should not have the spectacle of a company coming before the board with a request for tariff protection on the ground that its business was in a languishing condition, while at the same time men connected with it were erecting They are seeking procostly buildings and exhibiting every sign against competition which of prosperity. member mention one specific instance of inefficiency having been admitted by applicants ? creased Customs protection is, in itself, an admission of inefficiency. How else may we define inefficiency? member contend that if an industry has to pay higher wages than an overseas competitor it is necessarily inefficient if it asks for increased protection? industry should be judged by its capacity to produce an article at a We who are competitive price. Applicants to the T a r i ff Board should be required to produce balance-sheets. This elementary rule has not always been observed. I All we say is that the wrong have in mind one notable instance. I speak from memory, and, therefore, do not wish to be too closely tied to actual figures; but I recall that a company was started ten years ago with a capital of about £18,000. B y thc issue of bonus shares from its profits, it increased its capital to approximately £350,000, and yet it had the audacity to make an application for an increased duty on the article which it produces. Cases of this kind require the most searching investigation. This is recognized by corresponding boards or commissions in other parts of the world. The attitude of the Indian Tariff Board, for example, is in marked contrast with that of the Tariff Board of Australia. Applicants making claims before the Indian Board are submitted The Tariff to the most critical examination. The Indian Board takes nothing for granted. Unlike the Australian Tariff Board, it does not take up a friendly attitude. It is not persuasive, and it does not encourage the applicant. On the contrary, it takes the stand that it is a guardian of the public purse, and that its duty is to resist onslaughts upon the public purse. takes up a free trade attitude. pointed by a Government that is endeavouring to justify the imposition of protective duties in India.

The Canadian Tariff Commission conducts a searching inquiry into all claims for Customs protection.

Contrast this attitude with that of the Minister( Mr Pratten), who, in his speech this afternoon, almost gloated over the fact that the Tariff Board had dealt Avitl? about 400 items during the past fifteen months. He also mentioned .that he had received about 160 reports from that body dealing with claims that had been made.

The effect, on the cost of living appeared to be, in the mind of the board, a sufficient ground for rejecting an application, but if the application was recommended, it avoided any discussion of that aspect of the matter.

An advertisement may appear in the newspapers, but the complaint is that the notice given is inadequate.

Their case may have taken a year to prepare, and they may make assertions difficult to challenge effectively at the moment. General statements in denial carry little weight in the absence of supportA ing evidence. It would be fairer if, after tlie case for protection was stated, some time were allowed to those opposed to thc increase in the duty to prepare their case in rebuttal.

A general and dispassionate study of the Tariff Board's procedure and reports leads to the very unwelcome conclusion that it does not show that unbiased and judicial attitude i u dealing with the matters submitted to it that we are entitled to expect; and it does not justify the retention of the great powers that have been entrusted to it . If honourable members will read carefully the whole of the evidence upon which the reports of the board are based, they will find testimony without I matters which I have considered to he most .important, but which has not been mentioned in the findings of the board. In justification for its attitude the board has intimated, either directly or indirectly, that it conceives it to be its duty to uphold the established and settled protectionist policy of the Commonwealth, and to comply, whenever it is at all possible, with the requests made to it . In the few cases in which it refuses applications made to it . it does so apologetically, and almost invariably it suggests that if another application is made cn some future oocasion it may be favourably are encouraged to be persistent. That is a wrong attitude, in my opinion. know that some honourable members regard the board as a machine for the purpose of granting as many and as high protective duties as possible, but I contend that it should inquire impartially and thoroughly into the matters submitted to it , and not hold out encouragement in cases in which it declines to recommend a duty. Parliament should give its closest and most careful attention to every case in which the board only recommends a duty after the second oi third application. It has been said that either the Minister for Trade and Customs or the board has, on occasions, actually invited manufacturers to apply for protection. Statements like this are made, "" If you apply to the board, it will t r y to help y o u .

The Tariff Board apparently considers itself bound to recommend protective duties wherever possible, on the ground that protection is the settled policy of Australia. I should like to know how many of our people are satisfied with this so called settled policy, but I shall not prosecute that inquiry just now. Assuming that the people generally are satisfied with it , are no limits to be placed upon its nature or extent? to know. Where is it going to end? the Tariff Board was to prevent the in considered. Manufacturers discriminate imposition of duties on imported goods. Men who are what are I called moderate protectionists are in a difficult position in these days. They have no solid ground on which to base their arguments. The only men who can be absolutely logical are the free traders and the prohibitionists. They can get down to rock bottom in their arguments; moderate protectionists can not. I believe that a good deal of feeling was manifested by the members of this chamber when th6 present high duties were under discussion in 1921. It was argued that some independent authority should be set up to watch the incidence of the tariff, and recommend alterations from time to time.

Otherwise we shall always be met with the cry of the "" wholehoggers "" Apparently has not adopted any guiding rule. The ex-chairman d i d on one occasion set up an unofficial standard. That standard was that an industry was no longer to be protected when it was in a position to provide 60 per cent, of local requirements. That was not laid down in any definite material decree, but was referred to and quoted from time to time, f t has now been entirely lost sight of. If that standard had any influence upon the Tariff Board at all, it is obvious thar it had no effect in the case discussed on a motion for the adjournment of thc Hcuse on Friday last affecting an industry that enjoys the local 82.5 per cent, of its output, and still claims to require further protection. 'Bruce) has on several occasions endeavoured with great care to set out certain principles which ought to be followed when applying protection. He has contended that it should be given only to industries which are efficient. Experience clearly shows that it is utterly impossible for any department, or the technical officers of any department, to ""say when an industry is being run efficiently. There is only one test of efficiency, and that is that thc industry should be able to meet competition. guage, that is what efficiency means, and honourable members know it . what the ordinary man in the street regards as efficiency in industry. nations in the world are those that have adopted protection. America is the most efficient nation in the world, and is the most highly protected. to say on that point in a moment. member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is an old Free Trader. to say about the right honourable gentleman directly. The Minister for Trade and Customs has given his ideas on the subject of the limits to protection. He said, "" The more we export and the less we import the better for Australia."" even the board itself export more than it imports. conclusion, the Minister's statement is a reductio ad absurdum. Every business man knows that such a thing is absurd. It is only a euphemism for prohibition, and that is both objectionable and unwise. fact, impossible carried to its logical conclusion. The Minister tried to make out that the money we get for our exports should be spent in paying for our internal productions. Any country that conducts its commerce on such lines must soon get market for into a very peculiar position, as any business man, or, for that matter, any one possessing common sense, will readily The Prime Minister( Mr understand. If we adopt the Minister's l i m it for the application of protection his policy w i ll be found to amount to prohibition pure and simple. In considering the l i m it to the application of protection it is to be remembered that in the majorit y of instances labour costs in proportion to output amount to about 22 per cent. This covers practically every industry, and therefore 25 per cent, protection should be ample for any industry.

After all these years, no standard has been laid down, and Parliament is obliged to deal with this big question with a chaotic mass of expedients. The honorton) would regard the whole question as one of opinion; but all hold different opinions, and an independent board appointed for the purpose cannot fix a standard. We are getting only from one bog into another as the result of the adoption of expedients dictated by interests seeking favours under this so-called protectionist system. often treated in a jocular wav, the position is a very serious one. On this unsound basis we are building an economic structure of unstable eauilibrium. This must end in financial crisis. I sneak in all seriousness, and not as a croaker or a "" dismal Jimmy,"" but from inbern conviction, ancl my opinion is held by thousands of business men and others who are in a position to understand the matter. In common with them, I must end, and that very soon, in financial crisis, and in much hardship to the people of Australia. It will be found that economic conditions are not controllable, and those who are trying to conthat money available in the banks, and trol them will fail to clo so. I believe that it is time to call a halt, for even if required. About that time a very strong some loss were caused to some sections of thc community by refusing to push the protectionist system further, the general body of the people would benefit. There would be far less suffering and disturbance caused by retracing our steps now than will be caused by persisting in this system to the bitter end. In connection with this aspect of the matter, I want to quote a few words from a report by Sir Josiah Stamp. This will serve to some extent as a reply to the reference to America by the right honourable member for North Sydney. into any one. I am bringing forward the opinions of authorities, and certainly The Tariff Board, which was of better authorities than any member of this House, on the economic position in America. The report from which I propose to quote was considered of sufficient of the National City Bank of New York, which most honourable members probably know very well:He showed that the American policy of diverting the whole of this import stream into other countriesjust as the Minister for Trade and Customs says we should doif successful, would lead the United States of America in 80 years (under the power of compound interest) into an extraordinary economic deadlock, for she would have enormous possessions (abroad), and be unable to enjoy the fruit of them without extreme internal discomfort, much greater than would come from her acquiescence in an import surplus at a Though the matter is much earlier date. That is put in academic language, but means only just what I have been saying as regards Australia. One cannot fix a, time definitely, but I believe sincerely that the present policy is leading Australia into an economic crisis. I believe that if we persist with it, when the crisis comes, it will be attended with far greater distress and trouble to the community as a whole than any trouble which mieht arise from an immediate cessation of this foolbelieve that the present system hardy policy. I want now to show how the economic crisis will be brought about. During the war the whole of the primary products of this country were financed by the Imperial Government. That meant generally used for that purpose, was not campaign was started for the establishment of secondary industries in Australia for what was called "" the war after the war."" Honourable members are aware of the great campaign that was conducted to build up industrial enterprises in Australia during the war, so that we might be able to compete with other countries after the war. That campaign was largely featured in the press, and by general publicity methods, industries were",50,Excise Duties

111,Mr Mann,"I do not want to rub i tstarted in all directions, and the capital available was devoted by the banks to this purpose The consequence was that in a few years the banks were tied up by having enormous quantities of capital invested in secondary industries, and also in a building and land settlement policy. Let me say bere that ifc is a very extraordinary fact that the inflation of land values is fche invariable concomitant of a high protectionist policy. A very large amount of capital was invested in the establishment of secondary industries at war prices and on a war basis. The high prices which were being obtained for goods under war conditions were used as the inducement for people to go into industries, and capital was locked up in those industries under those conditions. Honourable members have only to read the commercial columns of the newspapers today to see that the result has been that many industries, which it was claimed were well established in this country, have tremendous blisters upon them in the shape of enormous advances by the banks. It is quite common to read of advances of from £60,000 to £90,000. The industries are striving to meet the advances made for their establishment, .but are unable to do so, because in a great many cases the buildings were erected and machinery paid for at the top of the market for construction prices during the war. The only way for the industries to succeed is to continue to sell their products at the extreme war prices. Naturally there is a reaction against that. is to get back to reasonable conditions, not exactly pre-war conditions, but stable and competitive conditions, we have maintained a high tariff and high prices in this country simply to enable all these interested industries to save the capital invested in them. member to name one country which has reduced its tariff since the war. matter directly. Naturally other countries, having reverted to normal conditions, are able to send goods to Australia to compete favourably with ours. The present high tariff enables these interested industries to carry on under war prices and conditions. AVhat is happening? The cost to the community is enormous. The Minister himself quoted statistics showing that our manufacturing industries had added £140,000,000 to the value of our raw materials. That is true, but it has been shown again and again that the customs policy of Australia to-day is directly and indirectly costing this country about £150,000,000 per annum. In view of this, I ask where is the profit to this country as a whole ? That figure has been confirmed by the Government Statistician. Whafc is the use of talking about an added value of £140,000,000. when it is costing us £150,000,000 to obtain it . There is no economic advantage to be obtaiued from such a transaction. We should consider this matter sanely and not from the view-point of individual manufacturers. We should consider Australia's interests only. The Minister himself has said that our exports do not pay for our imports and the interest on the national debt. This means that we are livin g on borrowed money, and how long can we continue in that position? The end must come, and when it does, it w ill bring down with a disastrous crash the artificial structure that we have built around ourselves. It would be better for us to stop this practice now. Although a few individual firms might suffer a loss, and become insolvent, this would certainly be preferable to the later insolvency of the Commonwealth. Unless we mend our ways, we shall bring upon this country a financial crisis f a r more serious than that which followed the land boom. The Minister Whilst every other country has said that it is necessary for us to pay striving in every possible way for our imports and iuterest on our debts abroad, and that this can only be done by increasing our exports. How are we to increase our exports? Are we to increase primary exports or secondary exports? Any attempt in this direction must f a i l . Statistics show that thousands of men are being diverted from primary industries to I ask the honourable secondary industries. What has made primary industries so remunerative during the last few years has been the high I shall deal with that prices ruling for our products; but if men are diverted from primary industries to secondary industries, how w ill it help the export of primary products? I presume that the Minister would reply that we must increase our exports of secondary products, but how can we do that when the policy of building up our secondary manufactures",51,Excise Duties
112,Mr Scullin,,52,Excise Duties
113,Mr Mann,"is which renders impossible the export of locally manufactured articles. Export markets are closed to us, because of the high cost of production and our protection policy. Our exports will never pay for our imports and the interest on. our national debt, while we pursue our present policy. The object is desirable, but the method of attaining it is useless. I had some hope that the Tariff Board's inquiry and the public resentment against increases in the tariff would have prevented further proposals such as these being introduced. It is time, that we called a halt. Some of these duties are atrocious. The Industries Protection League and those who are anxious to make hay while the sun shines are nervous, because public feeling is arising against additional duties, so they are endeavouring to rush these duties through before the door is closed against them. Let those honourable members who declare themselves awaken to the fact that prohibition is embodied in these tarift proposals. that admission. He said that in some instances these duties were intended to be prohibitive. Is that not prohibition ? The duty on cotton tweeds, for instance, is rank prohibition, and in many other cases, whatever the result will be equally mischievous. In formation was given me to-day of the effect of these proposals on two lines of goods, which are now lying in bond in Melbourne. taining 393 dozen cotton knitted undershirts and underpants. The invoice value is £177 6s. The proposed new duty at 24s. a dozen amounts to £ 4 7 1 18s. and the additional duty of 45 per cent, to £ 8 7 15s. 3d., so that the total duty on £177 worth of goods is £55 9 13s. 3d., equal to a duty of 315 per cent. The other line is cotton bathing costumes. with the subject? made in Japan. wishes to encourage racial antagonism. These cotton bathing costumes were not made in Australia, but this class of goods is used in the summer season by almost every person in the community. based upon a prohibitive cost shipment contained 263 dozen cotton bathing costumes at an invoice value of £110. The total duty on those articles is £ 3 7 1 6s. 2d. when the last tariff was before Parliament. should have been ashamed to assist in passing it . If that is not prohibition, I do not know what to call it . To go to such extremes is a scandalous imposition upon the poorer people of this community. The Tariff Board's inquiries in other directions have been inadequate. It has failed in its reports to consider the meaning and interests of trade. It is common in this House, and elsewhere, to speak of trading interests as being inimical to this country. Such a narrow view is unworthy of honourable members. It ought to be well known that the only way that a nation becomes rich is by trade. foreign countries. member knows nothing about trade. money, I mean goods. the statement. That is the argument used by many people. In actual fact, no money goes out of the country except what intention, the is necessary to effect a balance. Honourable members, instead of using the specious argument that we are sending money out of the country, should say straight out that we are sending goods, the very thing One is a shipment conwe desire to do. They are afrai d to face the true position. On Friday last the gibe was thrown across this chamber that certain honourable members of the Country party were foreign traders. The term is ridiculous. It was, no doubt, meant to be offensive, and to convey some sinister meaning. W h a t is the objection to foreign traders? We cannot have foreign traders without home traders. Unless people from other countries came here, to trade Ave should have no trade at ail. There is W h a t has that to do something unique about trade and commerce.

Wealth consists in that which is of exchangeable value, and only by the process of exchange do we obtain wealth. The board has entirely failed to consider the meaning and interests of trade. Its value and importance have been obscured in fiscal deliberations for many years past,, and it is anomalous that the Minister for Trade and Customs) should introduce proposals which are calculated to discourage trade. The board has failed to recognize or give due weight to the international' considerations involved in trade restriction, and has had no regard for the political aud social effect of the policy it has recommended. It may be that such considerations are not within the province of the board; but this Parliament cannot ignore them, and the committee is -justified in re jecting the findings of the board if they run counter to conclusions based upon them. It is of paramount importance that the national Parliament should consider the political and social effect of its policy, and weigh very carefully its influence on international relations. If the board haa no authority to deal with these matters, ifc is obviously wrong to remit to such a body questions of policy in which they are involved. In regard to the socialistic character ofprotection, I have a bone to pick with the right honourable member for North Sydney. The last election was fought upon the socialistic issue. It is the duty of honourable members on this side of the chamber to oppose extravagant doctrines wherever we find them, whether amongst the manufacturers or the employees. When I was speaking on the TariffV a l idating B ill in September last, I referred to urotection as a socialistic policy, and said that a government returned to power on an anti-socialistic programme should not father a socialistic policy like protection. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that I was speaking nonsense. Incidentally he explained his apostasy from free trade principles by saying that he, like Saiil of Tarsus, had seen the light. I reply to the right honourable gentleman with another biblical allusion-""If the light within the be And the more profit we darkness, how great is? that darkness."" In his work on Protectionism, Professor Somner, of Yale University, a well-known writer on economics, shows that socialism and protection are two branches growing on the same stem. He saysWhen .[ say that protectionism is socialism, I mean to classify it, nnd bring it not only under the proper heading, hut into relation with its true affinities. Socialism is any device or doctrine whose aim is to save individuals from any of the difficulties or hardships of the struggle for existence, and the competition of life, by the intervention of ''the State."" Inasmuch as "" the State"" never is, or can' be. anything but some other people, socialism is a device for making some people fight the struggle for existence for others. The devices always have a doctrine behind them which aims to show why this ought to be done. The protected interests demand that they be saved from the trouble ami annoyance of business competition, and .that they ibe assured profits in their undertakings by "" the State."" Hint is. at the expense of their fellow-citizens. If this is not socialism, then there is no such thing'. If employers may demand that '' the State"" shall guarantee them profits, why may not the employees' demand that "" the State"" shall guarantee them wages? If we arc taxed to provide profits, why should we not be taxed tor public workshops, for insurance to labourers, or for any other devices which will give wages, and save the labourer from the annoyances of life, and the risks and hardships of the struggle for existence? Tho"" we"" who are to pay changes nil thc time, and the turn of the protected employer to pay will surely come before long. The plan of all living on each other is capable of great expansion. It is, as yet, far from being perfected, or carried out completely. 'J he Protectionists are only educating those who, as yet, are on the ""paying"" side ol it, but who will certainly use .political power to put themselves also on the "" receiving "" side of it. The argument that :< the State"" ,iu,ust do something for me because my business does not pay is a very far-reaching argument. If it is good for pig-iron and woollens, it is good for all the things to which the socialists apply it.

I come now to the subject of international relations arising out of our fiscal policy. Like all Australians, I intensely admire the work done by the right honourable member for North Sydneyi n securing the adihission of Australia to the League of Nations, but I regret that he should be today defending a policy which must cause international hostility. Nations was established to promote international peace and amity. This policy of protection tends to have the very opposite effect. Quite recently Mr Swinburne, who represented Australia at the Sixth Assembly of the League of Nations, returned to Victoria. He is a man of high character, wide knowledge, great ability, and extensive experience. the Interstate Commission, he had a very good, opportunity to study the fiscal problem. I believe that he is a protectionist; but he was so impressed w it h what he saw and heard at the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations that he is convinced of the need for reconsidering Australia's fiscal policy in the light of its effect upon international relations. Upon this subject he has delivered some striking addresses, which attracted wide attention. We have testimony from the Labour camp also. speaking at Northampton on the 21st November last, in reference to the protectionist policy of the present tory government in Great Britain, saidThe Government, elected on pledges which the public believed would protect this country against Protection, is steadily week by week, month by month, devising means by which Protection is to be introduced, so that at the end Qf their office they will be able to present an accomplished fact to the country. If that is how politics is going to be worked, don't let us talk about Constitutionalism, because tliere is no such thing as constitutional instinct surviving under such conditions. While on the Continent I found that this policy is doing our trade more harm than anything else. found in country after country that Protection is being discredited. spective of party, irrespective of economical and industrial factors, are beginning to see that unless in Europe tbey can create an enormous federation of free trade nations, there is not a The fact that a socialist single nation in Europe which can flourish in the industrial standard it ought to occupy.

Here is another extracthonorable members w ill observe that I quote both sides-fro m the Westminster Gazette:Sloppy sentiment about the Empire cannot survive the growing puccesa of Canadian ami Australian manufacturers in using a high tariff to nurse their own industries at the expense of their own population and the British manufacturer. We will soon have the world against us in tariffs, diplomacy, and armaments if this illusion of a self-contained Empire based on jpumpering protectionists here and in thc dominions be allowed to became a false commonplace of our political vocabulary.

What will be'the position of our delegates [531 at that convention ? What would be the position of the Prime Minister( Mr. Bruce) at the Imperial Conference if he put forward this schedule as an indication of the national attitude of Australia towards Great Britain?

When the validating bill was being considered last year, I stated specifically that for my part it was to be understood that whatever the result of the election, it could not carry an approval of this policy. The subject was carefully avoided during the election campaign. But while the election was pending, because of the objections that were raised, and the protests that were made in many quarters, the Minister promulgated a ruling under which the operation of portious of this schedule was suspended. vvhich we want to be made acquainted. portant modification of the schedule was made during the election campaign.

Then the Minister used item No. 404 of the tariff to suspend the operation of duties that had been specifically agreed to by this chamber. WhetherI approved or disapproved of the removal of a duty is not in questidn; the method adopted was not the correct one, and the Minister had no right to exercise that power. inember say that that action was taken illegally ? It had a very material effect on the elections. It is, therefore, absurd to say that the result of the election constitutes an approval of this schedule. nothing of the kind. There are one or two other phases of the application of these duties to which I wish to refer. As we know, the new duties became operative immediately they were brought in . Large quantities of goods that had arrived in Australia weeks previously were held up at the wharfs, and could not be discharged until after the schedule had been introduced, because of the shipping strike that was then in progress. Although the importers could not be held to be in any way responsible, those goods became subject to the new duties when they were discharged. business men had lost considerably by the strike, and the sympathies of the M i nister should have gone out to them. Par more common sense should be exercised in applying duties in such cases than is necessary in ordinary cases. should not be made to apply to goods that were ordered before the schedule was brought in . adopted, goods could be ordered three years beforehand. be shown that an order stipulating immediate shipment was placed in England before the duties were brought in , it is grossly unfair to levy them. man buys on the basis not only of rhe cost of the commodities, but also of the duties that exist at the time he orders. I know of cases in which, after goods have been bought, a duty has been altered, and it has been move profitable to send ihe goods back to Aineiii-* than to land them in Australia. Far greater consideration should be shown to the trading public. In my opinion, the Minister has gone even beyond the schedule. It provides that a certain duty shall be chargeable on cotton tweeds. Sitting suspended from 5.30 to S p.m. the adjournment should be misunderstood, I wish to make it quite clear that the honourable I was not suggesting that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) should exercise a discretion contrary to I maintain that it was. the provisions of the Tariff Act in dealing with goods that were either ordered or in transit to Australia, and delayed in delivery owing to the British seamen's It does strike. I have been arguing all along that the Minister should act strictly within the provisions of the act, and that his ruling in regard to cotton tweeds was contrary to them. My point was that, as this schedule is before us, the Government should, in the interest of all bona fide traders, make some provision to meet exceptional circumstances, such as those which arose in consequence of the seamen's strike. I am sorry to say that apart altogether from the imposition of the higher duties on goods under order at the time the new tariff schedule became operative, the department has not been fair to importers of cotton tweed goods. One would have imagined that It was wrong. Many in common fairness the department would have limited the application of the higher duties to materials which the textile trade knew were classed as' cotton tweeds; but, not satisfied with doing that, it broiight quite a number of other Duties materials, which previously had not been treated as cotton tweeds, under fchat heading. It is unfair that simultaneously with the introduction of the new tariff, the interpretation of cotton tweeds was enlarged to include quite a number of other fabrics. The department, in my W h y not? Wherei t can opinion, went quite beyond the intention of Parliament in that regard. I shall bring this matter tip again in detail, and exhibit, samples of the mateA rials in question, when we reach the appropriate item in the schedule. Ever since the election we have had indications that members of the Cabinet itself recognize the necessity for some kind of a change in our fiscal policy.

153,Mr Mann,"Lest my remarks beforesistencies and anomalies i i i the tariff administration. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) referred to the matter at the Lord Mayor's banquet some time ago, and emphasized very stropgly that only efficient industries should be protected. I agree with that. The question was 1 asked this afternoon what were efficient industries, and I attempted a rough definition of them. It is becoming 1 a common practice to use loose general phrases in discussing the tariff: but we must get down to bedrock, and frame proper definitions. The Prime Minister, in the address to which I have referred, indicated also that he felt that some of the claims that were being, made for protection were not justified. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), in speaking some little time ago on the Western Australia -GrantB ill in this chamber, referred to the fiscal position of Western Australia, and I must confess that II was agreeably surprised at the soundness of his views in that connection. I wish hk would realize that the principles he theiji stated are of universal application. Mutatis mutandis, the conditions that apply to Western Australia apply to Australia as a whole. Even the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), in introducing the bill on New Guinea products, enunciated some sound fiscal ideas. I trust that he w i ll follow them up. Althoughi t is true that we cannot go on theory only, I suggest that we cannot have sound practice, unless it is based upon sound theory. Our policy of protection, which we are following to an inordinate degree, reflects adversely on many phases of our national life. For instance, it militates against immigration. It is of little use for us to talk of the need of immigrants to settle our empty spaces, so long as we maintain a fiscal policy that encourages people to settle in the metropolitan area instead of in the rural districts. Our schemes for bringing people here are intolerably expensive because new settlers are enticed to leave the country districts and live in the 'jities. On other occasions I have shown that we are throivirjg the heaviest burden ancl expense of our migration policy upon the State Governments, but are taxing every new settler who arrives here. This to the States. is also inconsistent with otir professed desire to develop imperial trade. We talk in a large way about the necessity for Empire development and reciprocal trade arrangements with the Mother Countiy, and contradict our talk by our actions. Just recently Sir Austen Chamberlain said that as we had a great deal to say about imperial trade preference schemes, and so on, it was to be hoped that we would adopt a policy of give aud take. So far, he added, it had been a case of all give ancl no take so f a r as GreatB r it a in was concerned. I suppose I shall be told that we are already giving Great Britain preference as agaiust foreign countries. The troubleis that, even with the preference, tlie tariff hurdle is too high for her to jump. Although the duties are higher on foreign goods than on British, it is sometimes easier to get the manufactures of poorly-paid foreign workmen over the high barriers that confront them than it is to get British manufactures over the lower ones that they have to face. Our preference to Great Brita in is, as a matter of fact, largely ineffective. Quite recently, a committee, of which Lord Balfour was chairman, submitted an exhaustive and instructive report to the British Board of for the remission of duties Trade upon the effect of foreign tariffs on British trade. Among the remarkable facts that were stated was this significant one, which I give exactly as it appearedThe main increases of tariff rates on British exports have been within the British Empire, where the average ad valorem incidence has risen 'by nearly two-thirds, while in foreign countries, despite the great increase in the United States tariff, the average ad valorem incidence has decreased by one-fifth. It is extraordinary that Dominion fiscal policies are the most serious obstacle to the growth of British trade. That is a remarkable commentary upon our claim that we wish to foster British trade. As a matter of fact, British trade with Australia has diminished proportionately in a remarkable degree in the last decade or so. In 1880 our imports from Great Britain totalled S3.5 per cent., and from the United States of America 2.1 per cent., whereas, in 1924, the respective figures were 45.2 per cent, and 24.6 per cent. is highly, detrimental That shows a remarkable change. ThereOur protectionist policy fore, the effect of our imperial preferential policy has been to drive the larger proportion of our trade away from Great Britain and into the hands of America. The tendency sometimes, when the general protective policy is attacked, is to retreat to a narrower ground. There are those who say that, whether we protect our industries or not, it is important that we should give protection, at any rate, to what we call our key industries. Although this argument is often used, it is most fallacious. If one considers the matter critically, he will realize that a key industry should be about the last to be protected, because, by its very definition, it is one upon which a number of other industries depend for their raw material. The steel industry, for instance, is closely related to a number of other industries. If we protect the steel industry, and raise the price of its product, we immediately raise the price of the products of the other industries dependent upon it . It is most fatal to start at the bottom, and say that raw materials should be protected. Most protectionists agree that raw materials and foodstuffs should not be taxed. It is a truism that the product of one factory is the raw material of another. industry, the price of the products of the other industries dependent upon it is automatically raised. MT . MANN -Yes. That means an increase of prices all around. If we are to check the enormous increase in the cost of living, the products of key industries, in particular, must be free of duty. The steel industry, for instance, should be better able to establish itself than any other industry in the Commonwealth, because it has at its disposal richer iron ore than is to be found in any other part of the world. advantage, it should be in no need of a protective tariff. The schedule, however, will place a tax on key industries. An attempt is being made to develop the disnot because of its cheapness or of unfair comtribction of electrical power. It is necespetition. It is most lamentable to lind in a sary, therefore, that all the appliances, government paper, purporting to deal seriously such switches, alternators, and. transformers, '<what should be made as cheap as possible; but, in a serious economic document. under the schedule, these goods are to be taxed up to the hilt. wire alone would amount to hundreds of that it means competition by countries thousands of pounds. to place duties on yarn. Here, again, is Labour party . itself in England. Some a proposal to tax what is a raw material honourable member stated to-day, I think, for other manufactories. Whatever duties that the Labour party in Great Britain we decide to levy, we should strenuously oppose a tax on a raw material when it would mean an increase in the price of every product made from that material. Taking the items in the schedule in their order, we find that spirit duties are to be imposed. It has been declared and demonstrated before thc Tariff Board that, if they are levied, they will cause a diminution of employment in Western Australia. That, surely, is most undesirable. The duty on textiles, and principally on the cheaper classes of clothing, will fall particularly on the poorer sections of the community. I am astonished to find that the Labour leaders approve of these duties, since they will fal l with the greatest severity on those classes whom they profess especially to represent. Wind mills, pumps, and all the small plants used by farmers to reduce production costs will bear duties which fall heavily on the small producers. The man who wishes to erect an ordinary windmill will now have to pay a duty that has been raised from 45 per cent, to 60 per cent. Under this schedule it is proposed even to tax food and raw materials. This must inevitably lead to an increase in the cost of living. Thc principal argument now used in support of these duties is that it is necessary to introduce them to safeguard the country against unfair competition. That phrase, in itself, begs the question, because it makes an assumption of which there is no proof. I doubt whether, except in the mind of a person being competed with , there is such a thing as unfair competition. It is a loose and objectionable phrase, which I think should not be used. In reading the reports on tariff questions in the Imperial ParliaW it h this great natural ment I found in a speech by Lord Hugh Cecil, these remarks"" Dumping"" differs from normal importation, as electrical gear, distributors, with economic questions, that dreadful phrase unfair competition.""

156,Mr Mann,"Yes. It is also proposed petition has been carefully studied by thewas becoming protectionist. If I thought that the Labour party in Australia were as f a r removed from protection as the Labour party in GreatB r it a in is, I should be very happy. Labour party in the Old Country, some time ago, felt that this subject was a difficult one with which to deal, and it appointed a special committee under the presidency of Mr Snowdenj ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, to inquire into it . The report immediately rejected the use of discriminatory tariffs as a means of securing the objects of Labour, in terms which showed that there was no common ground of agreement with the protectionists. The report statedI t docs not seem a feasible policy to discriminate by means of dill'erential tariffs on sweated goods. It would mean that goods, however evil and immoral the conditions upon which they wore produced, would be permitted to enter a country if they were made dear enough by the payment of a fine. The offending country or countries desirous of maintaining tbeir markets in spite of the tariff would bo driven to produce even more cheaply, and to sweat their work people more disgracefully. In other words, the evil would lie intensified, and labour standards, instead of being levelled up, would be degraded. The tariff policy condones sweated conditions, and is, therefore, to be condemned. Any proposal, whether it be a tariff or a boycott, which assumes that an individual nation can act alone is in our view useless. The matter calls for international treatment, both as regards the minimum standards to be adopted and the method of enforcement. I am entirely in agreement with that committee. The existence of immoral labour conditions in other countries-con ditions that are not in accordance with our conception of humanity and decencyshould be remedied. But as this committee pointed out, the difficulty would not be overcome, but rather intensified, by restrictive tariffs. with by international action such as that contemplated through the International Labour Bureau. the existence of unfair competition. pointed by the Labour party to deal w it h it . That is the conclusion to which the committee came after examination. nizes the existence of unfair competition. due to different conditions. extent, I agree with the honourable member; but the committee said that that can be met not by means of a tariff, but only by international action through the International Labour Bureau. I have always given my support to the efforts of The the International Labour Bureau. Whilst honourable members opposite will approve, of that, I want to ask them whether if through the International Labour Bureau labour conditions in other countries haveimproved-and in some countries i m provements have already been made as the result of certain conventions arrived at by the International Labour Bureauthey are prepared, in view of that i m provement, to relinquish any of the tariff restriction which they say is required. I trow not. If they were logical, and the object of the tariff is to deal with unequal conditions in other countiies, they should; be prepared to relinquish tariff restriction when the unequal conditions are removed. I hear no proposal to do anything of that k in d. I hear no proposal to meet the improvement of conditions in other countries by tariff discrimination. If honourable members were logical and sincere, that should be the result of such improvement. Wouldi t not be one of the best means to encourage the growth of international action for the improvement of labour conditions if we were to say to those countries in which such conditions have been improved, "" Because you have improved your labour conditions, we are prepared' to relinquish our tariff restrictions to encourage you to go on to greater improvement "" ? Would not that be a logical course to adopt? cable, if it were logical. that the logical is practical, and is the safest course to adopt. To depart from the logical is to get into a tangle of i nI t should be dealt consistencies.

Iis proposed to exclude tlie foreign goods because tbey are described as "" skoddy,"" whilst we encourage the manufacture of similar goods here which, when we make them, are not to be called ""shoddy."" Again, in his statement in regard to the woollen trade in Great Britain, the Minister was very unfair. He implied that the whole of the woollen manufactures of Great Britain are made from old garments re-manufactured. "" shoddy "" was so made. are not made from old material. There is no doubt a great deal of old material worked up in Great Britain for the manufacture of cloth that is known as ""mungo,"" but that material is almost exclusively exported to countries with poor, ignorant and unadvanced populations such as the natives of portions of Africa and elsewhere. To contend that much of the material imported into Australia and used by our working people 13 "" shoddy "" is grossly unfair. To promote the manufacture of these goods in this country will not give iis goods of higher quality, but similar goods for which our people will have to pay double the price. When we are told of the number of mills that are able to make these tweeds in Australia to-day, I inform honourable members that orders are going out every day that cannot be filled by the Australian mills. They refuse orders. I know of a mill that sent its representative around to ask for orders, and when asked to deliver the goods it said that it could aot deliver them until it got the orders, because until then it could not secure the money to put in its machinery. have been told that in Australia we have a longer free list than that of any other protectionist country in the world. That may be true if regard is had only to the number of items that are free. But in many cases they are quite insignificant items, and the fact remains that, taking the average incidence of our tariff schedule, including items liable to duty and items duty free, we have the highest percentage of duties imposed in any country in the world. In England we find the same argument used, the same methods applied, the same disingenuous statements made, and the same abuse of poUtical power in the attempt to bring about the imposition of protective duties there. It is not called protection there, because the Government said it would not bring in protection. It brought in something which it has called a ""safeguarding"" instead. I recently read some comments on the procedure which has been going on for some months in Great Britain, and the remarks with which those comments concluded are applicable to the present tariff proposals in this country:No matter ivhat one's vieivs may be of the desirability or undesirability of protection, the safeguarding scheme, judged by its provisions and the procedure under it, is undesirable. No sincere protectionist has a good word for it. To those who object to protection, it presents itself as a dishonest soheme; a dishonest and deliberate intention to give a superficial appearance of British fair play to what is in essence a crooked and illicit operation. So it is, because I believe that, under cover of official forms, political procedure, and the mechanism created to deal with these matters, it is possible to work improper points upon the community. BecauseI feel that this is being done, and the public interest is being sacrificed to private interests in many of the items included in the schedule, as well as because of my general objection to the prohibitive principle, I oppose many of the items of the schedule; and when we come to them. I shall deal with them individually. I shall not be expected to traverse the whole of the ground covered by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), making no pretence to rank with those whose names will be handed down as Marathon orators. I shall confine myself, so far as is possible, to those points of his We speech that I can recollect, and if the omissions are serious, I hope he will attribute them to fche frailty, rather than to 'the perversity, of human nature. Before starting on a journey which promises at best to be far too long, I should like to say that I do not necessarily support every . item of the schedule. Some items I may oppose; but my attitude towards the policy of fche Government as embodied in the tariff is one of enthusiastic and emphatic approval. Before attempting to deal with the arguments of the honourable member for Perth, let me clear the ground a little by dealing with fundamentals, the principles about which he said &o much, and the flights of my honourable",60,Excise Duties

It is a creature of the hot-house, and is dangerously fragile. hard sayings, but they do not complete the indictment. For the first time we learned this evening that it is dishonest, or, at any rate, that it is the result of a recourse to dishonourable practices. Suggestions were made regarding the Tariff Board which., no doubt, will be resented. I for the members of that board; but I say that the proper course for the honourable member to pursue was to put his charges into plain words, so that they might be answered. H is innuendoes were unmistakable. stand' what the honourable member said about improper practices. that men who had approached the Tariff Board with dishonest purpose had succeeded, and that evidence which should not have been received was acted upon. Here, then, is a policy flagrantly defying natural laws, a hothouse plant, illogical, dishonest; unscientific,""immoral; and yet not only is protection the national policy of this country, but, with one notable exception, it is the policy of all the great nations of the civilized world. According to him, it is contrary to the ideals of the League of Nations, a hindrance to the comity of nations: calculated to provoke wars; a dagger aimed at the heart of thc Empire, and particularly at GreatB r it ain herself. This is a formidable in wants wherever he may find it . dictment, and the honourable member might well have paused before making it in such an assembly as this. He refrained, indeed, from, a plain, downright declaration of hostility to the encouragement of native industries. He prefaced his remarks by the pious declaration that he desired to encourage Australian industries, but that was to be done by some esoteric process to which he did not further allude. are therefore in the dark as to how be would encourage the industries of this young and amaaingly rich Commonwealth without falling into those pitfalls which he so graphically described and located. While from his stand-point protection is a policy at once dishonest, artificial, prosame foundation, which is human nature. vocative of war, anti-empire, and illusory, the policy for which he stands rests upon the eternal principle of natural law. It According to him, protection is is at once logical and moral, and ought long ago to have captured a too credulous world, which has been striving these many centuries after truth , which is here lying at its feet only waiting to be raised. These are Protection, so the honourable member says, retards development and handicaps the primary industries; it increases the cost of production, destroys efficiency, retards settlement, and inflates land values. This last, to use his classic phrase, is the inevitable concomitant of the application of the policy. It is very curious am not here to couch a lance that when men wish to confuse and mislead they use terms that none may understand. Let us look at the first of tbe terms upon which the honourable member placed such a pathetic reliance. He spoke of free trade as a natural policy, No one could misunderand of protection as artificial. These terms are meaningless. In one seuse there He told us can be nothing unnatural in a world which is inevitably governed by natural law, where everything is natural. When he contrasts "" n a t u r a l "" with "" a r t i ficial,"" may I remind him that civiliza tion itself is an extremely complex and wonderful product of artificial culture. It depends on artificial aids. What is the law but a means to protect, the weak, the helpless, and the unfortunate . from the strong and unscrupulous? The agents of the law are at every street corner-o r are supposed by the public to be there. They are there to restrain the power of the strong, to arrest free individual development, and to deprive the natural man of the right to take what he Yetthere is nothing more natural than the resort of civilized man to artificial means. It is natural in heat to seek coolness, and in cold to seek warmth. The natural garb of man has long been overlaid. If the honourable gentleman were to go to Williamstown, and there try to approach ever so little to nature's prehistoric methods, he would discover that artiWe ficiality is the order of the day. To say that free trade rests on natural law is to utter once more the shibboleth that served in the time of the French Revolution, and upon which the Physiocrats built their imposing, but futile, doctrines. Protection and free trade both rest upon the It is natural to sell as dearly and to buy as cheaply as one can. As a seller, I want high prices: but. HF a t>uyer I want to operate in that ideal market spoken of by the honourable gentleman where unfair competition is but a name, and where I can get an article as cheaply as is possible. . gentleman was most unfortunate in one of his authorities. He quoted Lord Hugh -Cecil-a n artificial product of an artificial age-as an authority who did not admit there was such a thing as unfair competition. The existence of Lord Hugh Cecil and his class depends upon laws which, the Labour party of England would tell -us are laws which elevate the few at the expense of the many. proof that there can be unfair competition, and in England, too. According to the honourable member, protection increases centralization and the cost of implements used by those engaged in primary industries. He said that the primary industries alone create wealth, and that the secondary industries are parasitic. understood the honourable member. It is the result of missing ever so little of the honourable member's speech. He said that the policy-of protection did not benefit the wage-earners of this country in proportion to the tremendous burden imposed upon them; that they only received 22 per cent, of its cost. He said that, in effect, this tariff was prohibitive, and predicted an economic crash with a confidence that fits him for the role of a modern Cassandra. So far as I can, let me follow the argument in the order that I have noted it . I have spoken of the principles upon which he laid so much stress, and I should like to add that nothing is so deceptive in this matter, so unreliable, as what are called "" principles,"" because there are many principles, and they can be applied in every direction. It is a fundamental prin ciple or trait of human nature to desire f u l l scope for development. That is in the nature of man. M a n believes in competition with reservations. He wants to be loft alone; but when in trouble, he calls for help. appeal for protection when competition becomes distressing. In effect, competition in the eyes of the ordinary man is fair when he is winning, but unfair when he can win no longer. members who worship at the shrine of free trade, secondary industries occupy a subordinate and hardly respectable place, and, as I have said, they openly declare them to be parasitic. I am speaking now of the general opinion of honourable memThe honourable bers who hold the same views as the honourable inember for Perth, but perhaps do not express them in the same way. I shall give the best and most convincing proof of the debt of the Commonwealth, to its secondary industries before I finish. Let me now deal further, w it h the arguments of the honourable gentleman. He said that a tariff destroys efficiency. That is one of his main He is a living objections to protection. He did not support that statement with any convincing evidence. I repeat what I said by way of interjection-that the nations of the world in the vanguard of civilization have, with one exception, adopted for many years this jiolicy of protection, notwithstanding the defects and shortcomings to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I did not say that. Those who have studied the matter must I am sorry that I misadmit that no country has achieved such efficiency in agriculture, in secondary industries, and in organization, as has America. Protection, instead of destroying her efficiency, has stimulated her to greater effort. There is a greater volume of horse-power available for each individual worker in America than in any other country, and there is, therefore, a larger per capita output than in any other country. If there is one which excels it , it is that in which we live. Contrast America with Great Britain. Great Brita in has a policy of free trade whicli, according to the honourable member, rests upon natural law and ensures efficiency, progress and prosperity. These many years she has pursued a fiscal policy devoid of suspicion and provocation. She invites w i th outstretched arms the nations of the earth to join her. Her policy according to the honourable member is sound; her attitude impeccable. Yet. how fares it with England to-day; well or i ll 1 The honourable member had a great deal to say concerning the injustice which Civilized society listens to his our protective tariff does her. He said nothing of the hostile tariffs of the whole world. A few days ago, Lord Rothermere said that Great Britain, amongst all the nations of Europe, was To honourable the one whose f a l l could be most surely predicted. His opinion is one which can-",61,Excise Duties
168,Mr Mann,,63,Excise Duties
169,Mr Hughes,"not be disregarded. He said that surveying society, and looking at the conditions of industry and commerce, he saw no promise of better things to come. He declared the British Parliament inept, and incapable of devising a policy which would help. Of her population, 1,250.000 subsist on a dole; many of her industries are stagnant, her methods stand exposed by competition as ineffective. Britain, faced with competition, is losing ground. Free trade has failed to ensure efficiency. that the policy of protection is not only provocative of war, but, adopted by us, is a blow aimed at the heart of the Empire. May I remind the honourable member that if Great Britain is losing trade in this country, it is despite the fact that tial preference over her competitors. She has been given advantages in the economic and commercial race, and despite that, is falling back. GreatB r i tain is fallin g back in the race for the world's markets, not only here, but everywhere. She is the only nation which is not now able to show a more or less complete recovery from the effects of the great war. I shall not say for a moment that there are not grave causes, apart from the tariff, to account for her present position. depression is undeniable. Lord Bothermere was so impressed with the situation volutionary change of her from the p it into which she was falling. But whatever may be said of Great Britain, America has in every department of industrial activities, achieved efficiency under a policy of protection. The effect of that policy on Australian industry we can discover when we look at the figures, and test it hy experience. For the four years prior to the 1920-1 tariff, the total British trade of Australia was valued at £92,000,000. For the four years since that tariff became operative the was valued at £198,000,000. For the year 1925 the figure was £65,000,000. Sof a r fro m B r it a in losing ground here as a result of the tariff, she seems to be gaining. In Empire trade Austi'alia has dealt f a i r l y with Great Britain. The figures w ill show that we have preferred her to others, and shown due regard to what we owe her for reasons of sentiment and for value received. We have spent our money in her markets, encouraged her industries, and have done what we could to help her to maintain her position in the world. The honourable member for Perth says that protection is provocative of war, and ought to be condemned by modern civili Great zation for that reason alone. But there is no proof that it is so. It is perfectly true that tariffs may be a cause of quarrels The honourable member said between nations, but that is because their interests clash. Free trade did not prevent Great Britainf r o m being drawn into the Great War. Free trade has not protected China, the only great nation that has pursued a pacific policy for thousands of years. China is a pathetic figure. The she enjoys here a substanGreat Powers demand the right to send their goods into her country. She protests, but her weakness makes her protests futile. Whatever may be said of protection, it cannot be said that it is an antipeace policy. Tariffs and disarmament stand in the same position. A nation which disarms while other nations are arming themselves to the teeth pursues a foolish policy. When, during the throes of the French Revolution, talk of natural laws and logic cut the air, and when the Assembly was daily passing But the fact of her resolutions of a most amazing character, circumstances compelled the people to declare a policy for France suited to her that he recommended a reinterests and ambitions. The economic, in the method as well as the national policy of a government in order to save country must be determined by its circumstances. Those who have nothing w i th which to trade cannot expect to do business with those, who have. As the late Mr Joseph Chamberlain pointed out, GreatB r it a in has nothing to bargain with. If she had a tariff she could say to other nations, "" Unless you lower your tariff I shall raise mine."" Great Britain is now as a sheep before the butcher. There is nothing she can do. The assertion that protective tariffs breed wars, coming from countries hedged British trade with Australia around with tariff walls, and armed to the teeth to defend them, is so much hypocrisy. I trust this nation w ill not be turned from a policy, which is suited to its circumstances, and necessary for its progress, by such idle talk. It has been said that protective tariffs retard land settlement, and accentuate centralization. We have heard a great deal to-day concerning economic principles, but I am bound to say that a more monstrous misstatement of the facts could not be made. What has been responsible for modern development? During the last 100 years the world has changed from primitive to modern methods. We arc able to gather fro m the story of that development why our cities have become such great centres of populations, . whereas before they contained few when compared with thc number settled ou tbe land. The distribution of population is determined by the needs of society. individuals can produce only by long and hard labour barely more than sufficient to feed and clothe themselves, it follows that the major portion of the population must be engaged in the primary industries. This was the position u n t i l the beginning offence, America is the worse offender. of the nineteenth century. But w i th the introduction of modern methods the distribution of population necessarily changed. One hundred, 75, and even 50 years ago, perhaps 20 in every 100 people were required to produce food and the essentials of life. who claim particularly to represent the man on the land know with what amazing rapidity the methods of the primary industries have developed. I remember well when wheat was cut in some places -with a sickle, and in others with a scythe. Then came the reaper without the binder; later, the reaper and binder, and finally the stripper. It is literally true that now one man with a stripper can harvest in a day the same quantity of wheat, ready for the mill, as 100 could do in a week at the beginning of the nineteenth century. And as one man can do to-day as much as 100 men could do before in a week, what need is there for the other 99 men to remain on the land? Man does not attach himself to industries according to some philosophical principle or for m u l a; he does what he must do, and no more. as much for secondary production? secondary industries have been, and are, engaged in ministering to the constantly expanding wants of the people. hundred years ago people had to be content with one-fiftieth of the wealth that is available to-day. Tlie masses of the world now live better than did the barons in the days of K in g John. Wealth in an ever-increasing shower is descending upon the people, and that more than anything else explains the unrest in the modern world. Who is to share, and to what extent, in this marvellous stream of wealth that is flowing into the laps of mankind ? Secondary industries have developed in accordance with the redistribution of population, and in many industries efficiency demands that large numbers of people shall work .together under certain conditions. The honourable member for Perth has When said that the policy of tariff protection cannot last. He predicted an economic crisis, but did not explain why this crisis must come upon Australia,, which is certainly not the worse offender, and leave others unscathed. If protection be an member cannot determine the matter by a mere gesture pf negation. Whatever he has said, or may say, of this Those honourable members tariff has been said hundreds of times before of other tariffs. There is nothing new in his prediction of disaster. He has said that this new schedule is the laststraw-bu t the beast still staggers on, and, amazing to relate, it positively flourishes upon a diet that should destroy it . The honourable member said that the tariff is illogical. It would be amusing, if the matter were not so serious, to consider the application of this word "" logical"" to other activities of mankind. L if e itselfis most illogical. If we apply democracy logically, whither would it lead us? The Constitution is illogical. What is called the Constitution of the Empire is the most illogical system of government ever evolved. Every part of the Empire insists upon governing itself in its own way. Yet we claim that the Empire is one and indivisible, that its people are many, and yet one. Logic has nothing to do with human nature or the. institutions of man. The more one examines them the more is one compelled to admit how. utterly illogical they are. The most logical people in the world are A the French, and they do not get very far. Britons are illogical in their Constitution and their methods, and yet they have conquered the earth. The doctrine of protection is at least as logical as free",63,Excise Duties

173,Mr Hughes,"It is. The honorabletrade, but neither is carried to -what is termed its logical conclusion. Free trade has never been, and is not now, practised in its entirety, even by Great Britain. The Imperial Preservation of Industries Act is an outstanding example of this. Always the guiding principle of nations is that each does that which it believes will further its own interests. Australia has found from experience that the policy of protection advances her interests. A few' years ago primitive conditions obtained in this land. We were mainly a pastoral people. gold, people were attracted from all parts of the world. Then agriculture came upon the scene, and, lastly, in its natural order, manufactures formed the cupola of the indtistrial temple. Protection has been proved to be suited to the circumstances of Australia. We need not inquire what will happen when the whole world has reached that ideal stage when every nation is ready to discuss principles without regard to selfish interests. When civilization has dary industries, who are moved by preadvanced that far, universal free trade may be discussed on its merits, but until then the Commonwealth must pursue the same policy as each individual adopts in the conduct of his own affairs; it must protect its own interests. The honourable member for Perth spoke as if the law of competition prevailed in every walk of life, and every sphere of human activity. That is not so. We see on every hand men making supreme efforts to avoid the effects of competition. members opposite are living examples of the point to which organization can be decredibly informed by a manufacturer veloped by one section of the community in order to protect itself against the atand has done great things: but i i tacks of other sections. The organizations of Labour are protective combinations brought into being to defeat the effects of so-called "" natural "" laws of competition, by preventing individuals from offering their labour at prices extorted by pressure of circumstances, with a consequent reduction of the standard of living and the denial of the claim of the workers to enjoy a fair share of the benei f there were no tariffs they wculd fits of civilization. And we see similar organizations on the other side. A few days ago the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) moved the adjournment of the Housei n order to disrepresentatives would have us believe cuss the action taken by two great foreign oil companies, who had had the brazen effrontery to increase the price 'of petrol by 2d. per gallon so that they might recoup themselves the cost of supplying fo distributors several hundreds of foreign-made pumps. It is well known that the great corporations of the world frequently enter into arrangements with each other to avoid competition. It is an outstanding fact of life that when freedom can be exercised without let or hindrance men are all for freedom, but as soon as some one stronger, more skilled, and more efficiently equipped, outstrips By the discovery of them in the economic race, they demand some sort of protection or aid. Tbat. A new era began. characteristic has marked man ir. twery country and in every age. In regard to the application of the Customs tariff, I do not deny the right of the primary producers to take whatever action is necessary to promote theiT interests,, but I take exception to the claim that in so doing they are more honest, more moral, more honourable, or more logical, than men engaged in the seconcisely the same motives and seek to f u r ther their own interests. Each section endeavours to promote its own welfare. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) will tell the committee to what extent and in what way the primary producer is oppressed by the tariff. If the honourable member can make out a good case I shall be delighted to support him. I do not say that there are no Honourable spots on the sun. The Minister for Trade and Customs told us that he had been that he is a man of light and learning is possible that the honourable gentleman has made mistakes, and if snob mistakes can be clearly shown, I shall be very glad to support honourable members in rectifying them. Sometimes men engaged in primary industries do not look at the problems of production from the stand-point of the whole community. They have been told that be in much better case-that they would get their implements much cheaper and be able to produce wheat or whatever they grow at less cost. They or their that the effect of the farmer producing cheaper wheat would be that the pf>]-i« would get cheaper bread. But that is not what is at the back of the farmer's mind. He wants to be able to produce wheat at less cost in order that he may get more profit. Nothing could be more natural. For my part, I have done a ll that any man could clo to help the farmer to get a fair return for his labour. He is entitled to that, but there is no evidence that the Australian farmer is handicapped in his competition w it h farmers in other countries. For example, there is no proof that thc Australian primary producer is handicapped in competition w i th the farmer in New Zealand, who is able free of duty. farmers of Australia, in 1903, imported £450,127 worth of agricultural implements, and, in 1924-25, implements to the value of £784,024. hand, f a r m implements of local production, in 1903, amounted in value to £860,348, and, in 1923-24, to £3,132,305. Thus, while in the period under review imports were nearly doubled, the value of implements of local production purchased by Australian farmers was nearly quadrupled. This shows clearly that thc greater proportion of the implements purchased by the farmers of Australia are made in this country. The other night, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) farmers in the world had been so well catered as had those honourable to agree with that statement. cultural machinery and improved foi the use of the man on the land in Australia -will bear favorable comparison with that manufactured any other country. of the Country party will be able to tell us how much it costs to rjroduce a bushel of wheat in Australia, the United States of America. after all, is the test; but I venture the opinion that the competition lian wheat with that produced in Canada and the United States of America is regarded farmers of those couutries. of the Australian favourably with those adopted in any other country. ment in every industry. is sometimes not so efficient as could Mr Hughes. be wished. I heard the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr. Paterson) last week refer to the ideal dairy cow which would yield 80 per cent, of butter-fat. No doubt, that would be a very desirable cow; and there is no reason why the Australian cow should not produce, at least, as much milk as, say, the Danish cow. The climatic conditions are entirely favorable to the Australian dairyman. I am aware that here I am treading on dangerous ground, and since I do not wish to face a posse of indignant and outraged dairymen, who are always power to buy imported implements f u l and,' sometimes, desperate men, I find that the I shall content myself with the statement that, on the whole, the primary producers of Australia have' benefited greatly from the development of our secondary indusOn the other tries. Thoy havo been admirably served with machinery most suited to the climatic conditions of this country and the special circumstances of their avocation. The honourable member for Perth made an extraordinary statement about the intimate relationship between socialism and protection. I noticed that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), to whom certain aspects of socialism are very much like rats to a terrier, at once manifested deep interest in this . statesaid that no ment, which is, without doubt, the most cold-blooded and unprovoked that I for by local manufacturer!! have ever heard. There is no more relaof Australia. Most tionship between protection and socialism members will be inclined than there is between a bishop of the The agriEstablished Church and a field of battle. devised, developed, Because a bishop, prior to his preferment, was probably a canon, there may be some obscure relationship between a bishop and in a battle-field, but the suggestion is very Honourable members far-fetched. The relationship between socialism and protection is no better established. I understand that the honorCanada, and able member quoted as his authority That, Professor Sumner, of Yale University. I have not read Professor Sumner's book, of Austrabut I hope it contains other things besides that. A f t e r all, the best answer to the honourable member's statement is that as extremely serious by the which I gave him by way of interjection, The methods namely, that the British Labour party is farmer will compjare in the main, if not wholly, a free trade party, yet is avowedly socialistic in its But there is room for improveaims. There is no more relationship The agriculturist between socialism and protection than there is between civilization and socialism. Civilization, like protection, depends upon th© interposition of the law to protect the individual from the effects of competition in one or other of his many activities. The maternity allowance may be regarded as a definite feature of socialistic policy. protection, although it protects many women at a critical period of their lives, and in any discussion of the fiscal issue, reference to the maternity allowance would not be in order. I could pursue this question further, but I want to round off my arguments with convincing proofs of the efficacy of our protective policy. This policy has been in force in Australia for over twenty years. I remember when it was first mooted in this House. many things which I think were more effective than anything I have heard since. I propose to remind honourable members of the condition of the country at that time, and to compare it with the position to-day after twenty years of this policy, which, we have been told, is illogical, is opposed to natural law, is advocated by a r t f u l and dishonest business men, is provocative of war, is anti-imperial, is destructive of the primary industries, and opposed to the. best interests of the community. The proof of auy policy is the experience of its effects. The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it . In 1903-4, when protection as a policy was formulated, the population of Australia was 3,916,592. In 1923-24 it had risen to 5,873,507. In other words, it had increased by nearly 2,000,000. The figures dealing with production in our primary and secondary industries are illuminating. They are as follow:1903. £ Agriculture ... 26,792,000 ... 81,125,000 Pastoral Dairy, and bee farming 9,674,000... 42,112,000 Forestry and Fisheries Mining Manufacturing ... 28,528,000 ... 132,392,000 Total production 117,672,000 ... 392,570,000 Thus, whilst our population between 1903 and 1924 increased by nearly 2,000,000, the wealth produced increased by nearly £275,000,000. crop in Australia in 1903-4, after a long era of uninterrupted free trade in most of the States, was 9,301,785 acres, and in 1923-24 it was 16,531,186 acres. This, I submit, is a complete answer to those who say that protection has placed a crushing burden on the shoulders of our primary producers. But it is not fiscal The honourable member for Perth delivered an address, lengthy, but not, to my mind, convincing, on the effect of protection upon trade. He said that the inevitable result must be that trade would wither and collapse under the blighting influence of a protective tariff. This is what happened under protection during the twenty years under reviewImports. Exports. £ £ 1903 37,811,471 48,170,164 1923-24 140,618,293 119,487,104 I said then 1924-25 157,143,296 162,030,159 The total trade rose from £85,981,635 in .1903 to £319,173,455 in 1924-25. These figures furnish a complete and convincing answer to the charge that protection strangles trade. Treasurer after Treasurer, with that excess of caution that the tremendous responsibility of the task creates, has in his budget estimated a falling off in trade; and every year, so far as I can recollect, his prediction has been falsified. Despite the devastating blighting effect of this tariff, the value of the goods purchased by Australia from countries overseas rose from £37,811,471 in 1903, to-£157,143,296 in 1924-25. Turning from trade to banking, we find that deposits in the cheque-paying banks rose from £91,757,234 in 1903, to £321,594,080 in 1925; whilst the advances and investments increased from £88,223,686 to £261,340,527. Thus, tested by the increase of population, growth of production, primary and secondary, area under crop, overseas trade, and 1923-24. banking, the progress of the Oommon£ wealth under a protective policy w ill com... 25,620,000 ... 102,843,000 pare with that of any country in the poultry, world. There are one or two othei statements ... 3,219,000 ... 11,866,000 to which I must refer. In dealing with ... 23,839,000 ... 22,232,000 the effect of protection upon the worker, the honourable member stated that the worker's share of all these millions amounted to only 22 per cent, of the total. In refutation of that statement, I quote Mr Hume Cook, who in a letter to the Argus on 12th January last The total area under quoted from Professor Bowley's booklet The Division of the Product of In dustry, that, taking all the industries of Great Britain covered by the census of 1907, the wages and salaries cost amounted to 68 per cent, of the total. Sir Frederick Mills, chairman of the British Iron and Steel Federation, places these wages as high as 90 psr cent, of the cost of production: and Mr Ayre, OBE., chairman and managing director of the Egtheburnt Island Shipbuilding Company, Scotland, makes the proportion of wages to the selling price of the ship about 80 per cent. The best-the truest-tes t of a policy is to be found by a scrutiny of the condition of the masses of the people. To show the effect of this national policy of protection upon the great mass of the people of this country,. those who earn their livin g as wage earners, and the margin that is lef t to them after they have enjoyed the highest standard of living that exists in the world, I shall read figures relating to the deposits in our Savings Banks. as follows:Particulars. No. of Accounts Amount on deposit Average per account . . „ population Those figures completely answer the declaration that protection is a bad policy for Australia. I have shown that its benefits have been spread over the whole community; that it encourages trade, industry, primary and secondary; and is the most effective cause of the growth of population. Immigrants have come to Australia because work at good wages awaited them. During the whole of my l if e I have been a believer in land settlement. I believe it to be the basis of a nation's greatness. In what way can land settlement be induced ? There is only one way. It must be made profitable. That cannot be done by the writin g of books or the making of speeches, but only by making available profitable facilities for placing primary products upon them. ditions must be such that there will be a profitable return in pounds, shillings, and pence, and the adjuncts of civilization for the farmer. The British scheme of Empire settlement is the best yet devised. I had the honour to inaugurate Mr Hughes. it, and it has gone on haltingly ever since. What have we to show for the expenditure of so much money and energy ? If we could show on a screen in parallel columns the amount that has been spent, and the amount that has been gained by that scheme, we should see that we had spent millions and obtained very little. But immigrants have been induced to come to this country by the high standard of living fhat we enjoy, and the promise of employment. Our secondary industries employ 440,000 persons directly, and many more indirectly. They are the country's standby. They have attracted people to our shores, and provide employment for tens of thousands of persons, not only in the large cities, but also, as my friend the Minister for Trade and Customs said this afternoon, in the smaller towns of Australia. They are I sympathize with my friends in the Ministerial corner who preach the 1903. 1925. policy of decentralization. I believe in decentralization. It would be a 1,053,372 3,992,201 splendid thing if we could establish, in £33,910,378 £182,103,686 every town some industry that would £32/3/10 £45/12/4 prevent, its young men from trickling to ,, head of the large cities. But you cannot £8/14/5 £30/14/3 induce men to go on the land merely by placing before them glowing pictures that have been painted by men in the snug recesses of city oflices. The most effective means of encouraging decentralization is a national policy that will provide employment, and, by diversif y i ng industry, create openings for every temperament and every kind of talent. In America, where this policy has been in operation for many years, it has done what no amount of effort on the part of the agricultural bureaux, or any "" back to the land "" movement, could achieve. It has scattered the industrial organization of America over every State, and distributed it in small centres. I was in formed, whilst in America, by the American Federation of Manufacturers that the great bulk of the 50,000 firms which it represented did not employ more markets, and providing than 100 hands. In almost every small town in the United States of America, a In short, the consecondary industry has been established; the men employed have their homes about the factory, and round about it land settlement flourishes, providing food and other necessaries for the population attracted by the factory. Settlement begets settlement. Land settlement in Australia has been, is being, and -will be encouraged by the wholesale endorsement of a national policy of manufactures, so that there w ill be sure and certain employment for who come to this country. distribution throughout the continent, markets w ill he established at the doors of the men on the land, who w ill be given opportunities that were formerly denied to them. One more table and I have done. It relates to the breadwinners in the Australian population. only those figures that are relevant to this discussionNo. of Persons Engaged. 1901. Industrial Primary Producers . . This table completes what the others began; it shows the magnitude of the operations of the secondary industries. The greatest thing to the credit of this country is the standard of living that is enjoyed by the mass of the people. It is not the few wealthy persons who make a nation great; bnt the diffusion of wealth and the happiness of the many. It is the glory of Australia that her sons and daughters enjoy a high standard of living. That high standard is reflected in the physique of her people. When our men went to the war, they went well equipped. They had sprang from a great stock, and they had lived in a favoured environment. They had been well fed, and they were fit not only to pursue the arts of peace, hut also to defend themselves on the bloody plains of war. In this high standard of living and the great margin over and above it , which is shewn by the deposits in our savings banks-in the tremendous growth of our oversea trade, and the amazing increase of deposits in our cheque-paying banks, in the extraordinary progress of production, and the growth of population -in all these things is shown the value of our great national policy of protection. Asf o r me, when I believe in a thing, I believe whole-heartedly. I believe whole-heartedly in this policy. I am not one who takes two bites at a cherry. I do not deny that there may be in the schedule before us some items those already here, and others that need amendment. I have said that By thc if any honourable member has arguments of secondary industries to prove that there are, I will listen to him, and will do my best to prevent in justice. It may be true that merchants are suffering unfairly because of the delay in the delivery of their goods on account of the seamen's strike. If hardship has been inflicted, I , and I am sure every other honourable member of this commitI sliall quote tee, will do everything possible to remove it . If this great policy falls short at all, it is in so fax as it has not been applied Percentage of as widely as it might have been; but it Total is upon this policy that we must depend Breadwinners. to develop the great potentialities of this country, and to make it what it is destined 1921. 1901. 1921. to he-on e of the great nations of the earth. 426,166 723,559 26% 31-2 .1 'rogress reported. 533,107 593.695 32-5 25 -8 That the House do now adjourn. This afternoon, I asked the PrimeM in ister, on notice, a series of questions in connection with the admission of Germany to the League of Nations. I am sorry that he did not appear to realize the importance of the matter and to rise to the occasion. He seemed to think that I asked the questions out of mere curiosity, or with some frivolous object; but I wish to in for m h i m that many of my constituents are deeply in terested in the League of Nations, and are thoroughly acquainted w i th its. proceedings. A t East Sydney .we have a strong branch of the League of Nations Union, which includes in its membership some university professors, a number of clergymen, ami other persons of high standing in the community. I wished to obtain some information for them. My questions *n the Prime Minister were as follow: 1. Has his attention been drawn to a cablegram that opposition to increasing the membership of the Council of the League of Nations beyond the admission of Germany was voiced",65,Excise Duties

175,Mr West (East Sydney) [10.3],"-by members of all parties at a largely attended meeting of the League of Nations Parliamentary Committee of tbe House of Conimons, the meeting unanimously expressing grave apprehension of the proposal to make fundamental changes in the constitution of thc Council, and urging the Government to oiler strenuous opposition? 2. Will he state whetlier this expression by members of thc League of Nations Parliamentary Conunittee, if supported by the British Government, will involve Australia into supporting it? 3. If so, what opportunities have the people of Australia to agree or disagree with the sentiment expressed? In reply, the Prime Minister said1. Yea. 2. The Commonwealth Government is not yetaware of the attitude that will be taken by the British Government in respect to any increase in the membership of tlie Council of the League of Nations. 3. The Government, in coining to any decision on the attitude that it may take up on this question, will naturally give due consideration to Australian public opinion, and will make the appropriate representations accordingly. I arn not satisfied with those answers. The Prime Minister should give the people, or at kaist the representatives people in this House, an opportunity to express their views on the subject. Many of our people are opposed to Germany being given a seat on the Council of the Leaguem preference to Poland or Spain. no doubt that those two countries will feel seriously aggrieved should Germany chosen in preference to them. no European country in the past has suffered so much, in one way or another, as Poland. Briand, has stated that if Poland is not admitted to the Council of the League there will be perpetual war at Warsaw. The Government should be very careful before it makes any determination this matter. mentous very careful lest we involve too much my own part, I do not think that the Locarno Pact will be of any great benefit to Australia, particularly that is going on at present continues. Pact only takes into account the affairs of three big European Powers, and I am afraid that the tendency on their part is to revert to secret diplomacy. Mr Ramsay MacDonald is revered in Great and on the continent to-day because while Afr. West. Prime Minister he initiated the system of open diplomacy which made available to the people f u l l information on all foreign affairs. Personally, I have not much confidence in Sir Austen Chamberlain. Ho was friendly with Germany before the war, and it seems as though he is getting back to the old relationship. I hope that the questions I place on the notice-paper will not be treated with contempt, but that proper respect will be paid to the people on whose behalf they are asked. Anything that I can do to promote the welfare of the League of NationsI shall do, despite the way in which the Prime Minister has treated me in this matter. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [10.12] -If the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) has gained an impression, from the answers I gave to his questions this afternoon, that I was treating either h i m or his constituents with any disrespect, I very much regret it. I am afraid that, perhaps, to use the words employed by the honourable member at the beginning of his remarks, of the I did not rise to the heights to which his questions gave me an opportunity to soar; but no slight or disrespect was intended. The position with regard to the permanent members on the CouncilI have of the League of Nations is now under consideration. The matter involves great be difficulties, and is one that may do much I suppose to destroy the very much better spirit that came over Europe after the signing of the Locarno Pact. The right honourable memThe Premier of Erance, M. ber for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) also submitted some questions on this matter, and I imagined that the answers I gave him, together with my replies to the questions by the honourable member for East Sydney, would furnish all the on information desired.
