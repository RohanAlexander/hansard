Prim© Minister1. Has the Shipping Combine or any of its representatives approached the Commonwealth Government or the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers with a view to increasing freights between Australia and Great Britain? 2. If so, with what result? 3. Can it be definitely stated whether the existence of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers has at any time been responsible for preventing an increase in the freight rates? iber was good enough to apprise me of his intention to ask this question, and I now desire to supply him with the following reply1. Yes. 2. The Government has declined to increase the freights of the Commonwealth Government Line as suggested. 3. As the vessels of the shipping Combine have not (so far as is known at present) increased their freights between Great Britain and Australia, it can only'be assumed that the action of the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the freights not being raised. presenting the Minister for Repatriation, upon noticeAre theTe any employees upon the permanent or temporary staffs in the serviee of the Repatriation Department in Australia who do not come within the rigid definition of a returned sailor or soldier as defined by the Repatriation Act? vises as follows: There are five such on the staff of the Repatriation Department proper. Since the coming into operation of the amended Repatriation Act certain pension staffs have been transferred to the Repatriation Department, and these include a considerable number of non-A.I.F. men. Instructions have been issued that returned soldiers are to be afforded opportunities to learn the duties of the positions held by nonreturned soldiers with a view to the filling of those positions by returned men at the earliest The House, of possible moment. This is being done, and some States have already submitted the names of returned men suitable for appointment thereto. presenting the Minister for Repatriation, upon noticeHaving regard to the hardships entailed by the abolition of living allowances from the operation of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, will the Government take the necessary steps to have these allowances restored in I desire to ask the the Act? of the continuance of fche payment of living allowances is at present receiving the consideration of the Government.

MAXHERZ . upon notice1. Whether Max Herz, a native of Munich. Germany, was interned during the same period as Father Jerger and Dr. Hirschfield, and for similar reasons? 2. Whether Herz himself, during liis internment, provided evidence of his disloyalty? 3. If so. what considerations have influenced the Government in not deporting Herz, seeing the other two men were deported, especially in view of the fact that the medical profession of Australia has brought forward evidence to show that there' is no professional reason why he should be retained in Australia? honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Dr. Max Herz was interned on Iflth July, 1915, and was in the internment camp when Father Jerger and Dr. Hirschfield were interned. 2. No doubt the honourable member refers to a request made by Dr. Herz during his internment that he should be allowed to return to Germany 3. Very strong reports from numerous patients and the parents of patients desirous of treatment having been made, which indicated that he was possessed of great manipulative and surgical skill in orthopaedic cases, and that many afflicted persons had unbounded faith in him, and the Solicitor-General having recommended that he be not deported, it was decided to release him in order that he might attend his patients. SinGe this decision a deputation of medical men waited upon me in Sydney and urged that Dr. Herz be deported. The deputation, which was a most representative one, assured me that a number of Australian surgeons possessing equal or superior skill were available to treat all the cases treated by Dr. Herz! The matter is now being considered by the Government. senting the Ministerf or Defence, upon notice1. Whether the. Government have reviewed the circumstances and secured a report concerning the new schedule of rates applying to the Koyal Australian Engineers, as mentioned in Tlanstinl report, pages 2270-2271, 19th May, 1920? 2. Have the commissioned ollicers of the I would invite the Koyal Australian Engineers received increments in their rates of pay or allowances? 3. Will the Minister provide a schedule of and N.C. officers during the same period? 4. Does the Government intend to provide actual increases to the men and N.C.O.'s of the Royal Australian Engineers? Sir GRANVILLERYRIE The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:I . Reports have been submitted and have received consideration. ' Tlie new rates of pay, which came into operation on 1st April. 1920, were framed by a representative committpe of senior officers, and are considered to provide reasonable minimum and maximum rates for the respective ranks. Following the principle which was established in the Australian Imperial Force, the basic condition has been adopted that all branches of the Permanent Forces be brought under one scale of pay instead of, as hitherto, having varying rates for theseveral branches. Having regard to the military value of the services rendered by the members of the several branches, it is considered that sufficient reason does not exist for continuing the old practice. Non-commissioned officers and men of the Royal Australian Engineers were, under the old regulations, already receiving rates which, in many cases, approximated to the general rate provided for their ranks under the new",20,Allowances Various Pools

37,Mr Lairdsmith,"On the 3rdI am now able to furnish the honourable member with th© following information : 1. The question of importing a number of engine forgings for two large vessels building at Cockatoo Island Dockyard is under consideration. 2. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company is able to supply steel ingots of the size required. 3. A new hammer has been erected at Cockatoo Island of about the capacity indicated, 4. There is in existence at Mort's Dock, Sydney, a hammer of about the capacity indicated. 5. There are competent forgemen available in Australia capable of carrying out the work of manufacturing forgings of the size required. The reasons for importing a portion of tliese forgings are as follows:(a) Up to now about 50 per cent, of the large forgingB for ships under construction have been imported, and even under this arrangement the completion of the larger forgings has always delayed to a greater or lesser extent the vessels which have been completed. (6) The plant available as above is not suitable for efficiently working these large ingots, and some of the ingots supplied have not been very satisfactory. There is no doubt that tlic forgings turned out arc not equal in quality as yet to the imported material, although by exercising great care in supervision and manufacturethe forgings accepted by tlie Dr? partment have complied with Lloyd's test. It is considered that in these large vessels for the overseas trade, carrying exceptionally valuable cargoes, the best material should be employed for such important purposes as shafting, &c.

I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation : No members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery who volunteered for active service are being discharged except those who reach the age limit, or are undesirable. Members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery who, being eligible, did not volunteer, will not be re-engaged on the expiration of their present period of enlistment. Preference in enlistment is always given to applicants who have had war service, provided that such applicants conform to the physical standard necessary for enlistment in the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery. papers in connection with fche purchase by the Commonwealth of mills, timber areas, & c , in Queensland.

Parramatta) [3.19] -(B y leave.)--The success of th© second Commonwealth Peace Loan is now beyond doubt, and, though final figures cannot be given at fchis stage, th© information to hand enables me to make fche unqualified statement that more than £25,000,000 will be secured, and the loan over-subscribed.

NEW GUINEA BILL. ister and Attorney-General) [3.23] 1 move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a measure to make provision for the acceptance of the mandate for and to establish civil administration in those islands which were once comprised, under the generic term of New Guinea. The banks, the The Territories and islands comprised in this B ill are:-Kaise r Wilhelm'sLand, on the mainland of fche island of New Guinea; the Bismarck Archipelago, containing the large islands of NewB r it a in and New Ireland, the A d miralty Islands, and the German Solomons. These, w it h Nauru, were the whole of the German Pacific Possessions south of the Equator. They were all included in the colony of German New Guinea. The Governor of German New Guinea surrendered them all to the Australian Naval and Military Forces on 17th September, 1914; and they were all occupied by, and are still occupied by, the Commonwealth of Australia. Prior to the German Treaty coming into operation, our occupation was by military force against a belligerent country. But by the Treaty, Germany renounced her right, title, and interest in these islands, in favor of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers had already agreed and announced, in Paris, on 7th May, 1919, fchafc a mandate in the case of these islands should be held by Australia.. Since ifc is a matter of interest to honourable members, and most important that fche form in which this decision was made should be stated, I w ill quote from the official record which was addressed to fche British Empire Delegation: The attached agreement was reached thia afternoon at a meeting between Mr Lloyd George, M. Clemenceau, President Wilson, and M. Orlando, and will be published at once. (Sgd.) M. P. A. HANKEY, British Secretary. Villa Majestic, Paris, 7th May, 1919. (1) It is agreed that, in the case ofTogoland and Cameroons -Franc e and? Great Britain shall make a joint recommendation to the League of Nations as to their future. German East Africa -The mandate shall be held by Great Britain.",26,Second Peaceloan
42,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nGerman South-West Africa -The mandate shall be held by the Union of iSouth Africa. The German Samoan Islands -The mandate' shall be held by New Zealand. The other German Pacific Possessions south in the B ill for the appointment of an of the Equator -Excluding the German Samoan Islands and Nauru, the mandate shall be held by Australia. Nauru -The mandate shall be given to the British Empire. German Islands north of the Equator -The mandate shall be held by Japan. Thus, on 7th May, 1919, the Council of Four decided that the mandate for these islands should be given to Australia. ThisB ill does three things(1) It makes provision fox the acceptance of the mandate when issued. (2) It provides a skeleton or"" provisional government for the Territory. (3) It accepts the obligations laid down in the Covenant of the League of Nations as regards a mandate of the Pacific Island class. The delay in issuing the mandate has been a matter of some embarrassment; and it is thought desirable to establish a civil government at once, on a provisional basis, in lieu of the military government which now exercises authority, and which is no longer appropriate, because we are no longer holding these islands by force of arms against an enemy. New Zealand has passed an Act for the government of her Samoan Possessions. SouthA f r i ca has acted in like manner. New Zealand has obtained from the Imperial Government an order, under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, upon which to base her legislative power. South Africa legislated under her own Constitution. ThisB i ll is an exercise of the powers of the Commonwealth under our Constitution. Apart from the Treaty and the agreement to confer a mandate, we have also section 122 of the Constitution, whicli empowers the Parliament of the Commonwealth to make law3 for the goverument of any territory placed by the K in g under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth. This Territory is de facto and de jure under the authority of the Commonwealth; and under the Constitution we have power tc make laws for its government. This government must be regarded as provisional, and the proposals for the civil government are of the simplest character. Provision is made Administrator, who, until Parliament otherwise provides, will hold ofiice during the pleasure ' of the Governor General. Provision is also made for the appointment of such deputies of the Administrator as may be found necessary in different parts of the Territory, and for Ordinances to be made by the Governor General. In that respect the B ill follows on the lines of the Papua Act. It will be noted that the chief Executive Officeri n this B ill is referred to as the Administrator, -while under the Papua Acb he is referred to as Lieutenant Governor. When we come, in the light of experience, to bring in supplementary legislation we shall be able to consider precisely what is best to be done in regard to this matter-whethe r the designation of the Administrator de facto shall be that of Lieutenant-Governor or not. In my opinion it is quite an immaterial matter. Provision is made in the B ill for the exercise of executive and legislative power in the Territory, and this B ill will enable all the necessary measures to be taken, and all the necessary governmental machinery to be set up. The Ordinances will be subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament, as in the case of Papua. Honourable members must nob forget that, while we are legislating in regard to these islands, we have not sovereign power over them, as we have over Papua. Ours is a position of trust, and we are responsible to the League of Nations, or the Allied and Associated Powers who are the signatories of the treaties, and who, either in their capacity as the Council of the League of Nations, or asMhe principal chief Allied arid Associated Powers, will look to us to carry out our trust f a it h f u l l y , and to whom we must make report from time to time as to the manner in which we are carrying out our obligations. A word or two on the mandates may be permitted. The Covenant of the League of Nations provides for three classes of mandates, A , B , and C, and it will be noted that the mandate, as far as Australia is concerned., is in Class C. The ClassA mandate applies to countries such as 2 arts of the Turkish Empire, J which have reached the stage of development when their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised, and the mandate is to be applied during the process of reconstruction. In ClassA mandate the question of trade and the rights of allied nationals does not arise; the policy in regard to tliese is to be determined by the mandated nations, and not by the Mandatary, excepting as a temporary measure. We now turn to mandates of ClassB , which apply to countries in an earlier stage of development, such as the Cameroons, Togo Land, and German EastA f r i c a . These are tropical countries, of vast extent, where the population is very numerous and which have attained a much higher standard of civilization than tlie islands in the Pacific. There the mandatory Power is compelled, not only to enter into guarantees in the interests of the native population, but must also undertake-7-and this is most importantto secure equal opportunities of trade and commerce for the other imembers of the League. The third class of mandates, Class C, is entirely distinct. If we are to take as an analogy the tenures of land, we may say that this is a leasehold tenure, which, if it does not give the right of conversion into freehold, for all practical purposes, gives such rights as are given only to freeholders. The terms of reference .to the C class of mandates in the Covenant, paragraph 6 of Article 22, are worthy of being quoted. arc as follows:There are territories, such as South-West Africa, and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilization, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatary, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatary as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of thc indigenous population. These safeguards are set out in clause 15 of the B ill , as follows: (1) The slave trade, is prohibited in the TerriThe conditions under which we were tory. (21 No forced labour shall be permitted in' the Territory, except for essential public works and services, and then only for adequate remuneration. (3) The traffic in arms and ammunition shall be controlled in the Territory in accordance with the principles contained in the Convention signed at Brussels on the 2nd day of July, 1890, and known as the General Act of the Brussels Conference, or any Convention amending thc same. Mr Hughes. (4) The supply of intoxicating spirits and beverages to the natives of the Territory i * prohibited. (5) The military training of the natives of the Territory, otherwise than for purposes of internal police and the local defence of the Territory, is prohibited. (0) No military or naval base shall be established or fortifications erected in the Territory. (7) Freedom of conscience, and, subject to the provisions of any Ordinance for the maintenance of public order and morals, the free exercise of all forms of worship, shall be allowed in the Territory. Subject to those conditions we have a mandate over these islands which enables us to make the same laws in relation to them as we can make for the Commonwealth itself. Under ClassB mandates the mandatory"" Power is compelled to maintain the principle of the open door, vvhich, applies to both men and goods; that is to say, it cannot exclude the nationals of any of the signatories to the Covenant, nor can it impose any bar against the importation of goods. On the other hand, under ClassC mandates, such as ours is, we may impose whatever restrictions we please upon both men and goods. I need hardly point out how vitally the difference between ClassB and ClassC mandates affects us; and, seeing that the islands are contiguous tp the mainland of Australia, and that German New Guinea marches with the dividing line of Papua for 600 or 700 miles, it must be apparent that it is vitally They important that whatever conditions apply, for example, to German New Guinea, must necessarily affect Papua to the extent of colouring its whole circumstances. If men cr goods could flow freely into German New Guinea they could flow ; freely into Papua, and if that should happen they would then be within 80 miles of Australia. Perhaps one of the most valuable fruits of victory in the late war, from our point of view, was this recognition of our geographical and political circumstances. given this mandate were the manifestation by the Allied and Associated Powers of their recognition of the splendid services Australia had rendered to the cause of the Allies during the war. A t the Versailles Conference it was pointed out with some foroe, not only what Australia had done, but also how vitally her future, and even her present, would be affected by whatever policy was adopted in regard to tliese islands. As a result we have the mandate in its therefore, w i ll be in a position to administer these islands, to the extent she thinks fit, as integral portions of her territory. Her obligations to the League of Nations are in the nature of a Trust, facts in relation to the islands in or Mandate, to safeguard the interests of order ."" that honourable members may the native inhabitants with regard to realize the possibilities of the future. specified matters, and to report to the The area and population of Australia's -Council of the League. These obligations "" island empire"" is estimated as f o i are accepted in the last two clauses of the lows :B ill ; and the League can rely on their being faithfull y carried out, in accordance with the traditions of British government of native races. The Commonwealth will not be hampered in its administration by any other limitations on her f u l l control. As to immigration, Papua trade and commerce, and shipping, the Kaiser Wilhelm's Parliament of the Commonwealth will have the same unfettered discretion Bismarck Arch. as it Australia. alone, and the trade it carries, this means that Australia w ill be able to secure for herself, not only the trade in regard to commodities taken to and people, and a huge territory, with vast brought from these islands, but also the potentialities, which can best be gauged control of the shipping that conveys them. by a comparison with certain tropical and Honourable members who have given the other countries detailed in the following matter any consideration will realize what table:Papua German New Guinea Java Sumatra Philippines Cuba Japan (main islands) Hawaii* These are the total exports from all the Netherlands East Indies, but by far the greatest part is from Java and Sumatra. It is, of course, easy to exaggerate the actual and potential riches of New Guinea. The Royal Commission, which consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor of a tremendous handicap it would have been for Australia had we lost control of the trade and shipping of these islands. However, I shall uot dwell on that point now, present form, and Australia, because during the debate I shall have opportunities to emphasize it more particularly.

Papua, and Mr AtleeH u n t , and Mr. Lucas, at page 13 of their report, sayi t is important to remember that the area of cultivable lands in these, as in other tropical countries, cannot be gauged from the total area? mentioned, as, owing to tbe fact that so much of the country is mountainous, and so much swampy or inaccessible or of poor quality, the extent of land available for settlement is comparatively limited. I have never been to New Guinea, and I regret very much that honourable members did not take advantage of an opportunity which recently presented itself, in order that they might see, at any rate; something of this great Possession that has come to us. It is an added responsibility, but it is also a wonderful opportunity, of which I feel confident Australia w ill avail herself. I do not accept the statement of the Royal Commission that ' ' the extent of land available for settlement is comparatively limited "" as the last word fco be said on the matter. I venture to say with all respect to two of the Commissioners that they d i d not go very far, and consequently could not have seen very much. It does not take very much swamp to p u t in a very good day's work for a man, and mountainous climbing is the sort of thing that one does best at one's fireside. many parts of Australia to-day because things as coffee and rice, and it will of the recent rainfall. an optimist in regard to the possibilities has a number of navigable rivers, one of of this great empire that has fallen to us. which, I believe, can be navigated for I remind honourable members that if they 400 miles by vessels of 16 feet draught. turn to the early history of Australia.

I regret that they acted in that way My own idea is that it is wise for the workers to have representation on Commissions of this character if only for the pur]30se of enabling a minority report to be submitted. However, they probably had a sickener in such matters on account of the way in which they were treated in connection with the Bureau of Science and Industry Commission.

Indeed, it has been pointed out by some honourable members that Parliament votes £500,000 annually for contingencies, and that nobody knows exactlv where this money goes. But every Minister knows that it is impossible to get from any Department money in excess of 5s. in the absence of a voucher. who was foolish enough to say the contrary. literally interpreted the words used by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) in the beautiful book which he wrote entitled, A. Financial Carnival. I would like the right honourable gentleman to write a revised version of that book. The carnival is in progress now, just as much as it was then. safe Government in power now. Mr T1JDOR They have spent money in just the same fashion as did their predecessors. One has only to read the press articles concerning the expenditure of the 'Commonwealth and the States to find that the position is practically the same now as it was then, or, if anything, that it is worse. cause there bas since been a world war. However, it is not merely war services upon which our expenditure has increased, but other services. WhilstI congratulate the Treasurer upon the statement which he has made, we ought to recognise that the only way in which we can reduce our expenditure is by economizing as much as possible. Efficiency is true economy. Expenditure on lighthouses, for instance, may not be immediately productive, but in the end it is necessary, as it often results in saving valuable lives. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) stated that there had been a failure on the London loan market; but The we all know that it is not the London market that is responsible, but a few people who take control of finance, and who say whether it is wise or not to invest. It is possible for a few persons to make or mar any loan proposals placed upon the London or any other stock exchange. Personally, I am very glad to know that we are, as far as possible, raising our loan money in Australia, because we are doing infinitely better than could be done elsewhere. I do not intend, at this juncture, to go into the question of whether or not the whole of our loans should be taxable, although I believe it to be right. We have a progressive income tax, and if contributions to loans are free of income tax, persous paying on the higher rate receive a concession, in some cases, of equal to 2 per cent. I have asked the Treasurer to look into the judgment given by the H i g h Court to see how Far State loans are taxable, as I think that necessary in view of the. recent decisions by that Court. When we legislated here on the question, many thought State loans were taxable, and the Treasurer admitted that he was surprised to learn that they were not. The Treasurer referred to two items which are not included in the Bill now before the Committee. One relates to",33,Precautions Reguladepartments Including Income Tax Land

It must be admitted, however, that exchanges are placed in the metropolitan area largely for the convenience of subscribers, and I am sure the Postmaster General( Mr Wise) could inform honourable members that in many districts the present arrangement is most unsatisfactory. Quite recently, when walking down a street in my electorate, my attention was directed to three houses in the one street, within 40 yards of one another, which were connected with Central, Windsor, and Hawthorn exchanges respectively. bers are perhaps aware that the first exchange to the east is Hawthorn, to the south Windsor, to the north Northcote, and to the west Brunswick. The money proposed to be expended in connection with the Collingwood exchange was, I believe, recommended as far back as 1916, and that should be sufficient to prove that the work is urgent. When the Budget is before us it is my intention to discuss the financial proposals in detail, and to see how the Government intend to meet deficiencies if they should exist. We do not know at present .whether it is the intention to impose additional taxation, but if that is decided upon, we trust that provision will be made for those who possess the wealth of this country to contribute a fair share. It has been my desire Tor a considerable time to bring before honourable members the case of ex-Warrant OfficerF . H . L it t l e, a member of the Australian I m perial Force, who rendered abroad, and returned to Australia under a cloud. Ex-Warrant Officer Little has not yet had an opportunity of proving his innocence, and the Defence Department has not taken steps to further prove his guilt. In bringing his case before the Committee this afternoon, I ask honourable members to bear with me while I quote a fairly complete report of this man's record, because he has from time to time unsuccessfully endeavoured to secure satisfaction. He has made application to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), to the Defence Department, and Mr Speaker has also made representations on his behalf. It appears that, after all the representations that have been made, he has not been able to secure sufficient consideration to enable him to prove his innocence, or for it to be proven that the attitude of the Defence Department toward this man is justified. Ex-Warrant Officer Littl e enlisted for service overseas on the 4th August, 1914, at the outbreak of war, and departed from Australia with the first contingent. He arrived in Egypt on the 3rd December, 1914, and performed his duties with his unit u n t i l he was placed in charge of an Australian Base post-office, which was established in May, 1914. He had a staff of fifteen men under his control, and was promised a Honourable memcommission by the officer in charge of his section, Lieutenant Butler, as soon as an establishment was made. Ex-Warrant OfficerL it t le took up his duties at the Base post-office, but was surprised a few days later to learn that Staff-Sergeant C. S. Cunningham had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant and placed in charge of the office. ningham been in Egypt? of his record, and I am merely giving the details supplied to me. Prior to the arrival of Lieutenant Cunningham to take charge of the post-office, ex-Warrant OfficerL it t l e had arranged for the billetting and the messing of the staff at Alexandria under two separate contracts. About the middle of August, L it t l e received a communication from a native named Naggair, stating that he was the catering contractor for the Australian Imperial Force post-office at Cairo, and that he would also be pleased to cater for the Alexandria staff post-office. Exservice Warrant OfficerL it t l e replied that he was perfectly satisfied with the arrangement,and did not anticipate making a change. Warrant Officer Little's staff so increased between the 29th May and the beginning of September, 1915, that the contractor for tlie supply of meals in formed him that he could not cater for the larger number. Thereupon L it t l e decided to negotiate with Naggair, who had come from Alexandria to interview him. A f t e r the interview L it t l e placed the matter before the officer commanding. Lieutenant C. S. Cunningham, who told him to go ahead and make all the neses&ary arrangements. That instruction was carried out, and from that time matters proceeded satisfactorily. Naggair kept up to the terms of his contract, and",34,Precautions Reguladepartments Including Income Tax Land

77,Mr Makin,"I have no particularsthe reports furnished by Corporal Grice were so satisfactory that some three weeks later Warrant OfficerL it t l e placed the whole of his staff' under Naggair's contract. For some weeks everything was satisfactory, but it was then found necessary, owing to repeated complaints on the part of the men, and because of Warrant Officer Little's own observations, to draw the attention of the contractor to the unsatisfactory manner in which the contract was being carried out. As a result of these representations the causes of complaint were removed, and for a time the supply of meals was satisfactory. Once again, however, there was a lapse on the part of this contractor, and the management was so bad that L it t l e served on him a notice that in the event of his not carrying out the contract in a more satisfactory manner it would be necessary to terminate it . Warrant OfficerL it t l e was nob satisfied to act only on the reports submitted to hi m by Corporal Grice. He placed another man, Corporal Healey, in charge of tlie billet, and received from h i m reports bearing out those presented to him by Corporal Grice. When accounts in respect of meals supplied for certain months were submitted to him for payment he discovered that the contractor had wrongly included a number of menthat he had charged for the supply of meals to men who were away on sick leave, whilst in other cases he charged for the supply of three meals where only one had been served. account were rectified by Little, but they were repeated in an account for December, 1915, which was submitted in January, 1916. The discrepancies represented a total of £ 2 0 . L it t l e brought them under fche notice of the Officer Commanding, and also called his attention fco fche unsatisfactory way in which the contract was being carried out. He returned the account with an intimation that he declined to pass it for payment until it was correctly and properly made out. next account was prepared by the private clerk of the Officer Commanding, and was presented to Little, in the contractor's office, for signature. L it t l e again refused to sign the document, as there was still an overcharge of about £ 3 . Complaints were still coming in from the staff, and on 1st February, 1916, L it t l e was compelled to furnish a written report to Lieutenant Cunningham concerning the matter. come now to a point in this story where it is shown that there was evidently [186] some conspiracy. On 9th February, 1916, while Littl e was at lunch at the staff's billet, No. 9, MahommedA l i Place, Alexandria, Egypt, a sergeant-major of the Military Police, after asking for Corporal Healey, requested L it t l e to accompany him to Kom-el-Dik Fort. Little asked why he was to go, but was told that no reason could be givenithat tbJe .officer was simply acting on orders from the A r m y Provost-Marshal. On arrival at the fort he was paraded before the Officer Commanding, Captain Twvbell, an Imperial officer. He asked why he had been brought there under arrest, and was informed fchat the captain had received instructions from t h e . A r m y Provost-Marshal to keep him in detention for safe custody, but that he did not know what was the charge against him. Some three days later L it t l e was taken to the Australian Base post-office, where he and Corporal Healey were brought before the Officer Commanding, Lieutenant Cunningham, and charged with conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline. The crime sheet, Form B252, did not specify any definite charge. Littl e asked that a definite charge should be preferred against him, but Lieutenant Cunningham replied that he would take the responsibility of making a definite charge after summary evidence had been taken. Corporal Healey inquired whether that would not These mistakes in the be irregular. Lieutenant Cunningham replied, "" Oh, shut up ! or I will have you put where you will keep quiet."" would say. evidently has a personal knowledge of this officer. If that is so, I should like him to tell the Committee of it , and so assist me in obtaining justice for this man. W it h the assistance of the honourable member, I may be able to induce The the Defence authorities to deal with this case, and others coming within the same category. When Warrant OflicerL it t l e repeated the inquiry made by Corporal Healey, Lieutenant Cunningham said, "" Now, Warrant OfficerL it t l e, these sort of questions are not going to do your case any good, and you should know better."" Cunningham' then called in the contractor Naggair. L it t l e asked that the I evidence be taken on oath, but the Officer Commanding said, "" No, I will not allow it .

Corporal Healey at this stage said to the Commanding Officer, "" As you have power to deal with the case, have you decided to send us for a «our t martial before takmg the evidence?"" Lieutenant Cunningham replied, "" It is out of my hands."" Cunningham had a statement in shorthand from his witnessesa statement which had not been taken in the presence of L it t l e and Healey-and after referring to it, he proceeded to put to Naggair such leading questions as, "" Now, did you give MrL it t l e any money?"" "" H o w often?"" "" And what amounts?"" -anything to you about money?"" "" And what ""else did he say?"" questioning took place during the examination and the taking of evidence from three natives.

He was definitely promised that, on his return to Australia, he have .an -opportunity to appear before a court martial. That opportunity has not been afforded h i m, and in a letter fro m the Defence Department, it is stated thatA summary of evidence was taken, but it was considered by the military authorities in Egypt that, as .the only evidence was verbal, it would be difficult to prove the case, and for that reason trial by court martial was not ordered.

The militar y authorities, I xmderstand, tol d him they would give h i m a clean discharge if he would re-enlist. Thc Officer Commanding endeaI f they were prepared to do that, surely he should have received a .clean discharge even if he refused to re-enlist. L it t l e served in the New 'South Wales Irish Rifles for three years, between the ages of seventeen and twenty years. He was recommended by his commanding officer to go on active service in the South African campaign. Ho enlisted with the 2nd New South Wales Mounted Rifles, and, after serving for twelve months, on his unit returning to Australia he volunteered in South Africa for a further term of twelve months and was attached to the New South Wales Imperial Bushmen.

Therefore, he set to work to take up another occupation. Now he wants assistance to the extent of some £10 or £ 1 5 with which to purchase tools.

Although tlie woollen manufacturers have, made very considerable profits during the war .period, I believe they are not the greatest profiteers. The manufac-' turers during two years covered by theperiod of the war made so much profit that it more than equalled the total capital employed in the conduct of their businesses. If the Commonwealth mills can sell cloth to soldiers for 5s. 6d., 6s. 6d., and 7s. 6d. per yard, I contend that, from the constitutional aspect, those mills are not debarred from selling similarly to . the general public; for, after all, returned soldiers are only part and parcel of the great body of the general public to-day.

He has a more responsible position til an that occupied by the railway stationmaster, and he receives less pay. We ought to p u t these officials of the Commonwealth in a reasonable position in the matter of pay. In regard to the imposition of war-time profits societies, member for Macquarie ( Mr Nicholls) referred, I think a mistake has been made in this matter. I remember accompanying a deputation v he was Acting Prime Minister, and asking . him to make such an amendment of the War-time ProfitsA c t as would exclude co-qperative societies fro m its operation. This was asked for because a co-operative society is in a different position from a company or syndicate. It is an association of individuals, who deal at a particular store of their own, and any profit derived from its operations, after paying the expense of working the store, is distributed amongst the (members of the society. This can scarcely be referred to as profit, because it is money given back to them in the form of a rebate. That money has been paid to (members of the Lithgow Co-operative Society for some years past, and the Taxation Department is now asking the society to pay something over £1,800 war-time profits taxation for the year 1915-16. Every co-operative store would have been affected but for an amendment of the measure introduced by Mr Watt, when Acting Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he did not make the operation of the amendment retrospective; but I am inclined to think that if he were present he would agree with me that it was never intended that any wartime profits tax should be collected from co-operative societies. The £1,800 for which the Taxation Department is now asking was distributed years ago to the members of the Lithgow Co-operative Society, and if it is to be paid now they must take the money out of their earnings during the-next six or twelve months, or be called upon to refund what was returned to them by way of rebate in 1915-16. upon it as a part of their income. whose incomes were over £156 have already paid income tax upon the share of this money paid to them. It was never intended that the war-time profits tax should apply to organizations of this kind. I am not finding faul t with the Commissioner of Taxes, who must administer the Act as he finds it . If Parliament has made a mistake in the matter, he is not ,to blame for that. I think it would be taxation upon co-operative advisable on the part of the Government to which the honourable to pass an amending measure exempting this particular co-operative society from want to say that I the operation of the War Time Profits Tax Act. If this is not done, the society will be placed in a very awkward to MrW a t t , when position. No one can say that it has been profiteering. Its capital was in creased beyond what it was prior to the war by reason of an influx of members. Quite a number of workers joined the society, and they were called on to take so many shares. If , for instance, they were called on to take up ten shares of £ 1 each, each new member would contribute £10, and in that way the capital of the society was inflated beyond what it was previously. On the face of it , it is not fair that this co-operative society should be called 'on to pay a war-time profits tax, especially in view of the fact that the members have already paid income tax on this money. I hope that the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) will give consideration to the matter. No one knows better the working of co-operative societies, and the right honourable gentleman knows all about the Lithgow society. He represented Lithgow when the societywas in its infancy, and I believe has kept himself in touch with it . since. I appeal to him to do something for the relief of the society in this matter. A reference has been made to the fact that young fellows who enlisted when under age are not being paid the war gratuity. I have had brought under my notice the case of a man who enlisted and went abroad He was of age, and, after serving for some time in Gallipoli, he fell sick. The doctor decided that he should be discharged, and he was discharged. A number of other men were discharged at the same time. This man considered that he would be all right for fighting in the course of a little time, but the orders from his chief were that he must return to Australia.

Now, however, the Treasurer is willin g to supply the money which is required, so that there is no excuse for the Postmaster General declining to take the initiative in these matters.

But we should remove to the Federal Capital as soon as possible with a view to getting away from a provincial, into a Federal atmosphere. At the present time altogether too much provincialism is exhibited by members of this Parliament. Only to-day the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) stressed the fact that this State and that State had contributed will not the Departtheir quotas to the second Peace Loan, of these which, after all, 'was an Australian loan.

I trust, however, that the Assistant Minister for Defence will consider the facts I have placed before the Committee, and see whether the Government cannot vacate the building and hand it back to the State authorities. particularly those who have to pa6s the building daily, look upon it as the most unsightly thing on earth, and as it is not it only remains to connect Tamworth with urgently required, I trust the Government will not remain in possession much longer. * If the Government are prepared to do this, it is my intention to bring the matbers of Commercei n Melbourne to the ter before another placeI am not referring to another Chamber, where they merely pass the time away, but to the Parliament of the State of New South Wales. The building is most unsightly, the interior is in need of repairs, and as the ground could be put to much better use, I earnestly trust that action in the direction I have indicated will be taken at an early date. I am not bringing this matter forward merely because the land on which the building is situated is valuable, but because it would be a gracious act on the part of the Government to release the men who are at present detained. them have been imprisoned for minor offences. The record of one man is rather "" rough,"" but having inquired into his early life, I have ascertained that he lost his parents at an early age, fell into bad company, and eventually joined the Military Forces, where, unfortunately, his record was not satisfactory. I trust the Government will consider the desirableness of releasing these men, and handing over the building to the State authorities, as by doing so, they will not only be treating the men graciously, but will be relieving the Government of unnecessary expenditure. I desire to bring before the Committee a matter of importance, not only to my constituents, but to the people of Queensland generally. I refer to the establishment of a telephonic trunk line between Sydney and Brisbane. Some weeks ago, when I learned with surprise that the Government intended to duplicate the trunk line between"" Sydney and Melbourne, a deputation of Queensland members waited upon the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise), and urged the establishment of a trunk line between Sydney and Brisbane. I regret that the Postmaster General is not present, as he was most sympathetic, and he not only admitted the justice of our request, but said that it was a matter of great surprise to him to know that this line had not already The Sydney people, been established. There are already trunk lines between Brisbane and Wal-> langarra and Tamworth and Sydney, and Wallangarra. On the 10th February, 1916, the secretary to the Postmaster General wrote to the Associated ChamT effect that the completion of the line was' delayed owing to the then nnancial stress. We are now told that this line cannot be completed owing to the lack of material; but I cannot conceive of any reason which would move the Government to duplicate the Sydney to Melbourne line before establishing trunk line communication between Sydney and Brisbane. The construction of the line as f a r as Wallangarra has already been passed and carried out. t would not intentionally advocate any unreasonable expenditure, but I am convinced of the justification of my protest, and feel sure that other honourable memMost of bers will support me in advocating that the Sydney to Brisbane line be completed before fhe Sydney to Melbourne line is duplicated. desire to ascertain if the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) can furnish me with information as to the conditions under which a certain action which was taken in England against the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes) was settled.

Thos action has been in abeyance for a long time, and I desire to know if the Government intend to proceed with, it a n d , , if not, for what reason ?

The new regulation enables theGoveniment. to; charge to the Consolidated Revenue any losswhich was incurred inconnexion with the requisitioning of ships. I have been informed, and, I believe, upon reliable authority, that the lossincurred while the ships were held up in t he Australian ports, owing to the dispute between the companies and the seamen, was borne, not by the shipping companies, but by the Commonwealth Government.

They were under our own Shipping Controller, and the freights were also controlled by him.

That is to say, any increase in fares and freights would have been added to the price of everything carried by those ships, and the public, therefore, would have had to pay for it .

One of the great difficulties associated with the bulk handling of wheat is that important structural alterations must first be carried out in those vessels which have hitherto carried our grain in bags. Ships' captains do not care to go to sea with cargoes of bulk wheat unless their vessels are specially constructed for the purpose. The trouble is that the cargo is apt to shift. Provided that our farmers can get their wheat away without difficulty by bulk ' transport, I am of opinion that the principle is the right one. I certainly hope that our coming harvest will be sufficiently good to warrant the inauguration of bulk handling, and I also hope that the price-whethe r it be altered in any way by the introduction of bulk handling:-will , at any rate, remain reasonable, so far as Australian consumers are I preconcerned.

Western Australia. Mm TUDOR -And I am anxious to see more, of it done. Mr W. D. Johnson,, of iWestern Australia, says in a letter to meTliere are eighty-five different co-operative societies distributed throughout our farming areas, and ten industrial co-operative concerns established in our larger industrial centres. Practically the whole of these societies are members of a co-operative federationwhich was organized last year so as to arrange for closer unity in buying and distributing: This federation recognises the Westralian Farmers Limited as their central wholesale concern. I should liketo know from the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) whether this wholesale concern will get the same 1 terms as other wholesalers from manufacturers in the cities. I know that when there was a wholesale co-operative society in Victoria, the manufacturers would, not , sell to it on the same terms as to> other warehouses. I am anxious that this West Australian society should be placed in exactly the same position as are the Manchester and Scottish wholesale societies, who do an immense business. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), when speaking the other day, said that those gentlemen who enter into Rings and Combines arethieves and robbers. said that! truth whentbey are angry. Another point regarding, which I am anxious-is whether-a standard rate of wage will besecured to those men who will becalled upon to work on these silos. I know that the building industry is sufficiently organized to make sure that those engaged in the construction work shall haveat least the minimum rate fixed! by the Arbitration Court,, but I believe there has been trouble in Western Australia amongst' the men engaged in lumping wheat. I understand that this co-operative society paid such men 16s. per day when the recognised rate was 18s. and £1.",57,Hughes

If Government money is to be expended in the way proposed, we should insert a clause in the Bill providing that the standard rate of wage shall be paid by the co-operative society for the handling of wheat. I should say that, by the new method of handling, at least 90 per cent, of the employment at present given will be done away with, and we ought to see that the workers who remain are fairly treated. such a provision in any Bill? to get such a provision put into Bills. protects the men. fond of the 'Arbitration Court. bitration. bitration when they are forced. people are like that. the worse example. However, I regard fche Bill as a step in the right direction, always providing that the security of the Government is sufficiently covered. understand that even farmers who are not members of this co-operative association are to have their wheat handled at exactly the same price as is charged to members. ThatI do not agree with. If this association is putting up £1,500,000, finding first of all £100,000 before anything is done, those non-unionists or outsiders should not be placed on an equality with them. operative societies sell to outsiders. but give their members advantages that are not shared by the general public. Under the Rochdale system of co-operation the shareholders, on their purchases, get a rebate of about 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 ; and, under the scheme we are now discussing, the members of the wholesale association should receive better treatment than that given to outsiders. graph 7 of paragraph 4, the co-operators get something extra. articles of association'. to support the Bill and to explain, as briefly as possible, how this agreement came about. It -was largely due to the fact that wheat sacks rose to a tremendous price, costing about 6d. per bushel, or an impost of Is 6d. per bag. The farmers determined to make some change. In Western Australia alone over £260,000 per annum was being spent in the purchase of sacks, and went to a country outside, and the sacks themselves, after being used for only a month or two, were also sent away. The farmers realized that the metliod was antiquated and costly, and they turned their thoughts to bulk-handling, obtaining all fche information they could in Australia, and then investigating the systems in vogue in Canada. The Victorian Government were very kind in sending to Western Australia lantern slides showing the bulk handling as carried on in the Dominion of Canada. Finally the farmers decided to form a company with a capital of £1,5,00,000; and I may inform honourable members opposite that that association or company is entirely non-party. Mr iW. D. Johnson, an ex-Labour Minister ,and still a Labour man, is one of the directors, and Mr T. H . Bath, at one time Acting Premier of WesternI Australia in a Labonr Government, is a shareholder. With such men as these connected with the organization, honourable members opposite ought to feel assured that the interests of those employed in handling the wheat will be well looked after. If all the money owed by Australia were invested as this money is proposed to bo invested, the position of the Commonwealth would be much sounder than it is to-day. The Western Australian farmers have undertaken to take up 150,000 £1 shares in this concern be.fo2e the agreement operates, and when it is extended, as it must be, they undertake to put up in cash one-third of the total amount, of capital required, which really means a payment of Is. per bushel upon the wheat grown last and the ensuing year in the State and put into the Pool. As I put 23,000 bushels into the Pool, I pay £1,150 into this company, and am, therefore, justified in recommending the scheme as one which offers reasonable security.

Why should the Oommonwealth borrow money at 6 per cent, and advance it to the Western Australian farmers at the same rate of interest up to two-thirds of the value of the security offered by those farmers, and that a personal security? the Commonwealth wheat at half-price, and the Commonwealth, therefore, owesthem something. that the honourable member fbr Swan should congratulate the farmers of his electorate, and the farmers of Western Australia generally, upon this very good deal.

What is the special reason for its introduction? I do not wish to put the question, but it is suggested to me by the smiling countenance of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), who looks at me and then at the Country party corner, to ask why we should not give this money at 6 per cent, to a chosen, few, when in order to do so we must borrow it at 6 per cent, from some one else. toria might have made a similar request, -but they are too slow in this State. hope that I should get some information as to why this very unusual procedure has been adopted for the purpose of benefiting a particular class in one State of the Commonwealth. In view of the fact that the Bill is to be passed, I shall look with confidence to the honorahle member for Swan, the party to which he belongs, and also the Government to support me in a proposal which I may introduce, on the strength of this very encouraging precedent, for the establishment of boot manufactories on a very large scale in the electorate of Batman, which I intend to propose shall 'be financed by this benevolent Government to the extent of at least £2 for every £1 contributed by my friends in Batman, in order that my friends in that electorate may be able to draw dividends to the extent of at least 8 per cent, from the venture, and ultimately to divide the profits from it amongst themselves, a proposal which, in the words of the honourable member for Swan, "" cannot fail to commend itself to the people of the Commonwealth as a whole."" On the 27th July, 1918, this Parliament passed an Act relating to wheat storage. I think that it was passed unanimously. In that measure it was provided that the Commonwealth should advance to various States a sum amounting to £2,800,000, for the erection of silos.

Wales Government borrowed money on the security of the people, and the Commonwealth Government found the whole of the amount they required. In this instance the farmers of Western Australia have clubbed together, and have said: "" We are prepared to put our money into this venture to the extent of £250,000 in order to enable the bulk handling of wheat to be accomplished."" they take one risk and the Government take two risks.",62,Hughes

Nobody could get debenture money to-day 'under 6 per cent.; whioh is what these people are to -pay. interest is raised. be the case with ©very other concern that was trying to raise debenture money. It would have to pay more in the future. In any' ordinary trade and business deal the debenture money is small as compared with the shareholding -money that is 'to participate in the profits. In this case the programme seems to be reversed. The debenture money, which is to be obtained at a fixed rate of interest, and which is not to participate in the profits, is very much greater than the amount wbich is to be 'found by the shareholders, who are to participate in the whole of the profits. It haa been 'suggested that they are not ' to participate in the profits ""to a greater extent .'than 8 per cent., but a very short study of 'the agreement will convince anybody that they are -to take their 8 per cent., plus any profits that can be earned by their own one-third and the Government's two-thirds combined. I should be delighted to see this mean a very fair return to the individuals who put their wheat into the Fool, if there is any subsequent distribution. The honourable member, for Swan( Mr Prowse) suggests that the money for the sinking fund has to be found before the profits can accrue to the co-operators in the scheme, but I remind him that it is almost the universal practice, if you raise debenture money, to repay it over a series of is the ordinary procedure in a commercial deal such as this. Mr .PROWSE -Then where is the .risk f a great risk, but the security is nothing like so good as the honourable member suggests. The Government are advancing up to two-thirds of the security, and the farmers are finding one-third. The 'Government security is whatever is acquired with the money found by the two sides, but tliat is absolutely the only security the Government has. we save is still to be worked on as security. There is that buoyancy in the Pool, because it is calculated that tbe -cost will only be 3id. per bushel. We-oan even exceed that, and still have a margin. honourable member has no sort of liability to repay the money. because it has nothing to do with it.

Of course, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) Bays that the Bill is a very good one. Only a few days ago, after a division had been taken in which the Government narrowly escaped defeat, I heard a member of the Country, party remark, "" If the Government do not do what we wish them to do. they will be faced with something even worse than this."" I do not know whether this Bill is the outcome of threats of that description. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) dealt with the measure in a very nice way, but one could not fail to perceive that he recognised that it does hot give a fair deal to the people of the Oommonwealth. stands the King's English, that was the impression conveyed by the honourable member's remarks. I cannot understand why the Government of Western Australia have not dealt with the question of the erection of silos in the same way as other State Governments have dealt with it. with a big country, and they have a lot of big works to carry out. son for it . If these silos are going to prove such a boon to the State, those who represent the people should have contsol of then. I would prefer to sanction an arrangement being made with the Government of Western Australia, in regard to the erection of silos, rather than with a few men who' propose to form themselves into a company. As a matter of fact, before anything can be done under this Biit, a company must be formed, whose shareholders will have to contribute £100,000. done.. The whole thing has been fixed up: MrW i EST I do not think that the honourable member understands the position. He stated that he did not know much about it . He said, "" I have seen a certain pamphlet, and I have been endeavouring to understand it . "" remarks upon the question. The honourable member for Flinders has directed, attention to the fact that what the Commonwealth Government propose to provide is debenture capital. I venture to say that debenture capital could not be' obtained at 8 per cent. 'These silos are not to be erected upon private land-the y are to be located upon Government land. Under such conditions I am certain that no debenture capital could be obtainedanywhere. If this scheme related to any State other than Western Australia, the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) would be found violently opposing it . ber's statement does not happen to be correct. agreement the farmers cannot get a reI did not Bay that. turn of more than 8 per cent, upon their capital. I hold that no interest should be paid to them until the capital account provided by Commonwealth loan has been entirely liquidated. We are merely the trustees of the money which it is proposed to advance to the farmers of Western Australia, and as they will derive a substantial benefit from the erection of these Bilos, that ought to be sufficient to warrant them in disregarding the payment of interest until the capital advanced has been repaid. I would like to hear the honourable member for Swan dealing with this question."" His remarks would be like the Binging of a psalm. I hold very strongly that the wheat grown in Australia ought not to be disposed of until a twelve months' supply has been assured to our own people, as a safeguard against drought. That is one reason why I believe in the .erection of silos for the conservation of grain. I am in favour of the. erection of silos because I oonsider it necessary to storeat least twelve months' wheat, so",66,Hughes

I hope that when our party comes into power it will take care that there shall be always retained in Australia at least twelve months' supply of wheat for gristing and seed purposes to meet the possibility of drought. I believe that if the Labour party were in power it.woul d make that provision, and I am sure that the New South Wales Government will insist upon it in connection with their silo scheme I regret that the Government of Western Australia has not followed the example of New South Walesi n building State silos. The Commonwealth, in advancing money to a State Government, would be' practically advancing it to a section of its own taxpayers. There might be some reason for lending money for such a purpose to a State Government or a Government-controlled Commission, b u t in proposing to lend money to private enterprise in this way, we are creating an unwise precedent.
