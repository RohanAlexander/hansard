These terms and conditions allow the departments to address excess staff situations. In addition, the certified agreement of the Department of the House of Representatives has an early retirement scheme, inserted into the agreement at the suggestion of industrial organisations. This provision allows for staff with particular skills to be replaced by staff with different skills. Staff leaving the Department under these provisions are not made redundant. The following table details the number of staff made redundant in each department over the period requested. The figures do not include the Department of the House of Representatives’ early retirees (insignificant except for the period ending in February 2003, when the total on a one-off basis was 16), as these terminations of service were not caused by an excess staff or redundancy situation.

(2) If so, for each program for each of the years that funding was granted to local government authorities, (a) what was the level of funding provided to each local government authority, (b) what was the purpose for which the grant was made and (c) in which federal electoral division or divisions does this local government authority fall. (3) Have any concerns been raised with the Minister’s office or the Minister’s Department from (a) local government authorities or (b) other organisations regarding cost shifting onto local government in regard to any programs administered by the Minister’s Department; if so, (a) to what program or programs did the concern relate and (b) were any investigations undertaken by the Minister’s Department in relation to these concerns; if not, why not; if so, what were the findings of these investigations. (1) Yes. (2) My Department has examined the question. A response detailing the allocation of funding for all Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) programmes to each of over 700 councils over 6 years would not be practicable and would not warrant the resources required to undertake this task. In addition, Local Government areas (LGAs), as a responsibility of the States and the Northern Territory, do not necessarily align with Commonwealth electoral division boundaries. Both Commonwealth electorate division boundaries and Local Government boundaries would have changed over this period. However, information that may assist in building up a picture is as follows: Financial Assistance Grants Each year the Federal Government provides untied funding to Local Government through the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 (the Act). These funds are paid to the States who distribute to Local Government within their jurisdiction in accordance with such States Grants Commission methodologies and policies that support the current National Principles. Distribution of these grants is detailed annually in the Report on the Operation of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 (commonly known as the National Report) tabled in Parliament as soon as practicable after 30 June each year.

I understand that the Committee is still taking submissions and that, in addition to the submissions received to date, further material will be provided to the Committee through a series of hearings involving councils, especially in regional Australia. I am informed that the Committee is expected to report to the Parliament later this year. I look forward to considering the Inquiry’s outcomes. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 979) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) In his responses to question No. 610 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6800), question No. 611 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6801) and question No. 629 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6802) and his statements that he has dealt with the matters exhaustively, is it a fact that he has never given a direct answer to these or similar questions on the current stage of development of the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) nor a direct answer to the question of when the projected full implementation date of that Plan is to occur. (2) Is it in the public interest that the public have a right to know when the LTOP targets of aircraft movements to the north will be fully implemented, if not, why not. (3) When will the other LTOP targets be fully implemented. (4) In respect to the answer to part (9) of question No. 610, can he say who has portfolio responsibility for the question of whether the new owners of Sydney Airport, Southern Cross Consortium, have a conflict of interest in that other related interests such as Infrastructure Trust Australia and its subsidiary owners of feeder motorways, such as the Airport Motorway and the M5 Motorway, may demand financial compensation should the airport train take business away from the motorways in future; if not, why not. (5) Further to the answer to part (10) of question No. 610, (a) what undertakings has the Southern Cross Consortium given the Commonwealth Government with respect to NSW State environmental laws, (b) what environmental undertakings did he require of the new owners of Sydney Airport with respect to compliance issues of NSW environmental, planning and development and pollution laws; if he did not require such undertakings, why were no contractual or other requirements made prior to the sale of Sydney Airport and (c) are NSW State environmental, planning and development and pollution laws an intrinsic part of the total environmental laws of any land in NSW, whether that interest be Commonwealth, State or other land interests; if not, why not. (6) Further to the answers to parts (5) and (7) of question No. 611 concerning the Sydney Airport railway system, (a) does he have an interest in the railway passenger usage to and from Sydney Airport; if not, why not, (b) is he being advised of Sydney Airport railway utilisation to and from Sydney Airport; if so, what data is being made available to him from NSW State Rail; if he is not receiving data on railway utilisation, why is he as Minister for Transport and Regional Services not interested in the statistical utilisation of this critical mode of transport, (c) what is his real interest in passenger movements as part of the overall environmental operation of Sydney Airport, including whether it includes (i) cars and vehicles,(ii) trains, (iii) aircraft or (iv) a combination of these. (7) What is the new airport owners political responsibility towards the minimisation of pollution of all kinds from Sydney Airport utilisation, including (a) greenhouse gas emissions either directly from the Airport or from transport related movements using Sydney Airport, (b) maximisation of public transport to and from Sydney Airport, (c) minimisation of pollution and traffic generation to and from Sydney Airport, (d) noise pollution from traffic of all kinds to and from Sydney Airport, e) air pollution from traffic of all kinds to and from Sydney Airport, (f) water pollution from all sources emanating from Sydney Airport usage, (g) soil pollution from all sources emanating on or around Sydney Airport. (1) to (7) These matters have been dealt with in responses to previous questions. Aviation: Airport Security (Question No. 1322) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Does the lease for (a) Essendon Airport, (b) Sydney Airport and (c) Melbourne Airport require a certain level of security; if so, what are the security requirements; if not why not. (2) Are there security arrangements in place for every airfield in Australia. (1) (a) (b) (c) The leases for Essendon, Sydney and Melbourne Airports do not specify a level of security for those airports. The leases do, however, provide that the airport operators must comply with all legislation relating to the airport site and structures and the use of the airport site and with all notices issued by a Government authority. The security arrangements for categorised airports are specified under Part3 of the Air Navigation Act 1920 and its Regulations. (2) There are appropriate security arrangements in place for those airports for which the Commonwealth has legislative responsibility. Foreign Affairs: Iraq (Question No. 1373) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 February 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 971 (Hansard, 11 December 2002, page 10248), why does the Government not provide any recognition to Kurdish authorities within the boundaries of Iraq. (2) To what other minority, indigenous or other groups seeking self-determination does the Government provide recognition or special status. (3) Are there set criteria for determining what groups are accorded status; if so, what are they. (1) For reasons relating to the territorial integrity of UN member states, Australia does not support the creation of an independent Kurdish state unless it is agreed to by Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey or any other state whose territorial integrity would be affected by the creation of such a state. Australia considers the Kurds to be minorities in the countries in which they live and believes that their cultural and political aspirations should be met by working within existing territorial boundaries.

177,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,99,Questions On Notice
178,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australian Government stresses the importance of fully respecting international human rights norms in the treatment of Kurdish minorities. (2) Australia accepts the international consensus that the Palestinians represent a special case. The Government does not accord recognition or special status to any other group seeking self determination. (3) No. Health: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Question No. 1381) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 6 February 2003: (1) In the Government’s response to the House of Representatives “Health is Life” inquiry into Indigenous Health, did the Government indicate that the Minister would report to Parliament on the cost of providing adequate water, within three years, to all the communities where water supplies do not meet national standards. (2) Is he in a position now to provide that information to the House. The Government Response to “Health is Life” was tabled in Parliament in March 2001. In response to recommendation 17, the Government accepted the importance of providing potable water to all Indigenous communities and confirmed that the Commonwealth would ask ATSIC to provide advice on the cost of providing adequate water, within three years, to all the communities where water supplies do not meet national standards. I am now in a position to present that information to the House. ATSIC estimates the capital cost involved in the provision of adequate potable water to all Indigenous communities within 3 years to be in the order of $146 million. I am able to provide full details of the methodology and the key determinants used in reaching this costing. This estimate is based on information available from the 2001 Community Housing Infrastructure Needs Survey (CHINS) undertaken on behalf of ATSIC by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The information from this survey was only released in mid 2002. This figure suggests there is still substantial need to be met. That is not to say that a substantial effort from government has not already been made. Since 1996, the Commonwealth has significantly improved the overall quality and extent of water infrastructure in Indigenous Communities. Between 1995 and 2004 some $241.8 million has been provided under the National Aboriginal Health Strategy for health related infrastructure including water systems, sewage disposal and electricity. Providing water infrastructure such as water treatment systems and pumps is only part of the solution. This technology must be suited to the cultural and geographical situation in which it is being placed if we are to provide adequate water. This point was well made in the 1994 Water Report undertaken by There is no point putting in expensive treatment systems which the community cannot maintain or which requires technical support that is located thousands of kilometres away. A large part of the cost I have cited is for replacement or upgrade of infrastructure which is no longer functioning because it was ad hoc or inappropriate in the first place. There are important relationships between water supply and other infrastructure which will also determine the functioning and adequacy of water supplies. For example, power is nearly always required to produce water, and a wastewater system is required to dispose of water. If waste water does not drain adequately it can damage water supply infrastructure and can lead to risk of water contamination by micro-organisms. Appropriate monitoring and management of water systems to ensure safe drinking water is also essential. The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) provides guidance on the management of water quality in Australia. These guidelines provide information on acceptable ranges of physical, chemical radiological and microbiological characteristics of drinking water, for safe consumption over a lifetime.",99,Questions On Notice
179,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:It is important to note that these are not standards, and are adopted and regulated in a variety of forms by State and Territory governments. The ADWG has recently been revised to include the Framework for Management of Drinking Water Quality. This risk management framework places the emphasis on managing supplies at critical points to ensure water safety. These guidelines are well suited to urban environments and to situations where water is managed by an appropriate authority. But there are barriers to applying this framework to the Indigenous communities under discussion here. Although management of water supplies is usually a State responsibility, approximately 1000 discrete Indigenous communities manage their own supplies. Most of these communities are in very remote locations in Australia and 75% have populations under 50. The new ADWG contains guidelines to assist in managing small supplies, but small supplies are defined as communities with populations less than 1000 – not 50. It will be necessary to trial more flexible approaches to water management which are both cost effective and simple for communities to maintain. In any water management system there is a role for external surveillance bodies. These roles are usually outlined in State legislation, regulations or guidelines and include the surveillance of the built environment, waste disposal systems, water quality and public health standards. These roles are normally provided by local council and state government. However they are not always provided to Indigenous communities, sometimes because there is uncertainty about whether legislation applies to those communities or because they are not in locations or on land covered by local council. The absence of these support systems is a significant problem which must be addressed. This interrelatedness of systems means that it is impossible to plan around water supplies without adopting a cross sectorial approach to the problem. Any expenditure on new infrastructure must be accompanied by a coordinated plan to address these broader management issues. I will be seeking assistance from my federal and state colleagues with responsibilities for provision of water, public health regulation and monitoring, local government and planning, to help develop this plan. This work will be developed in the context of a broader action plan to address environmental health issues for Indigenous communities currently being developed by the Commonwealth Working Group on Indigenous Environmental Health (CWGIEH). Aviation: Security (Question No. 1505) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: With respect to the Department’s regulation of aviation security, can he say which regulations have been modified, waived or relaxed to facilitate or permit the effective conduct of the air security officer program administered by the Minister for Justice and Customs. With respect to my Department’s regulation of aviation security, no regulations have been modified, waived or relaxed, however a number of exemptions and permits under the Air Navigation Act 1920 have been granted to facilitate the Air Security Officer Program. These exemptions and permits relate to the screening and clearance of Air Security Officers, the carriage and possession of weapons in the sterile area and onboard an aircraft. Foreign Affairs: Terrorists (Question No. 1515) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1267 and his answer that most of the 77 people arrested by Malaysian authorities for alleged links to KMM or JI were Malaysian and two were Indonesian, (a) what other nationalities were amongst the remainder of the suspects and (b) are these suspects from the countries in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). (2) Is he able to say what are the exemptions for OIC visitors arriving in Malaysia.",100,Hreoc
180,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Why is the Australian Government not in a position to explain Malaysian immigration policy. (4) Is he able to say whether (a) the Malaysian Government has made any public announcements or (b) there have been press reports, on the no visa requirement to enter Malaysia or OIC countries. (5) Have Australian authorities sought a briefing from the Malaysian Government or its representatives about any change in policy since the arrests of KMM/JI suspects; if not, why not. (6) Since the JI bombing of Bali and given JIs relations with Al Qaeda, does the Government see any danger in the ease of entry to Malaysia of OIC citizens; if not, why not. (1) We have no further information. (2) This is the responsibility of the Malaysian Government. (3) See answer to Question 2. (4) No. (5) We speak regularly to the Malaysian government about policy issues. (6) See answer to Question 2. Trade: 2005 World Exposition in Aichi, Japan (Question No. 1616) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: (1) What consideration has the Government given to participation in the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi, Japan. (2) When does he anticipate a decision concerning Australia’s participation to be made. (3) What is the likely nature of any Australian participation. (1) The Government has given extensive consideration to participation in the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi Japan, looking at both the costs and benefits for Australia of participation. (2) The Government will make a decision on participation as part of the 2003-04 Budget process. (3) Should the Government decide to attend the Aichi Expo, an Australian pavilion would be developed to showcase Australia over the six month life of the Expo (March to September 2005).",101,Hreoc
