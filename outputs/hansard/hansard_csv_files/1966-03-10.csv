They expenditure at 28th February 1966, which are placed in the corners of the notes. The discloses that for the past eight months the honourable gentleman will be aware that total of advances to the States for housing corners of currency notes are often torn off is lower by SI.73 million than for the same while the notes are in circulation.

In fact, the Commonwealth is sure that it will be taken up. The amount of actual drawings on the fund is not the criterion. The criterion is the number of commencements, and finance available can fall back a little. There can be what is called delay in the actual appropriation of funds. However, much more importantly, we have been looking with great caution and care at the figures of commencements and approvals in the public sector. I am glad that the honourable member has raised this. It gives me the opportunity to mention that they have fallen substantially over the course of the last four months. The Prime Minister said in his statement to the House and to the nation last Tuesday evening that we were cautiously watching the housing position. I have asked the Treasury to give me a certain stimulus to the housing field during the next four months. The report is being I ask the honourable gentleman: What is note?

I shall see what can be done to ensure that currency notes, of whatever denomination they happen to be, will be accepted at their value by banks if it is obvious that they are legitimately and properly issued.

The reason why cotton is being grown more than anything else at the Ord is because it is a much more profitable crop. There are many other crops which can be grown there. Research and experimental work are being undertaken in connection with them. As an example, I mention long grain rice. The growing of sorghum is also a profitable venture at the Ord. Investigations are being carried out in many otherfieldssuch as the use of pastures for the fattening of beef cattle, the growing of oil crops and so on. Sugar can be grown particularly well on the Ord River, but the cost of establishing a new mill is such that it is unlikely that sugar will become a main crop in the foreseeable future.

I have already asked for suggestions from my own people about various measures that might well be contemplated. However, I think it might be pertinent to point out that the re-engagement rate of those eligible for re-engagement in the Australian Regular Army is very highover 70 per cent. This is, I think, one of the highest re-engagement Tates of any Army in the Western world and indicates that those people who are in the Army believe that conditions of service are good, that conditions of living are good and that there is a fine and worthwhile career in the Army. It may well be that some additional measures will have to be devised to get this message across to a broader spectrum of the general public in an effort to increase the number of volunteers for the Regular Army.

I inform the House that it was necessary, as at 12th February, to cancel the issue of old stamps, but it was decided, nevertheless, that the public should be able to use the old £.s.d. stamps for a period of two years subsequent to Uth February last. For the following three years, that is, from the beginning of the third year to the end of the fifth year, it will be possible for members of the public who still hold stocks of these older stamps either to have them converted at equal value to decimal stamps or to have cash paid for them in multiples of 6d. on surrendering them to the Post Office.

I now ask: In view of the number of rumours that are circulating widely in the country that large quantities of agricultural seeds, which could also carry viruses that would have disastrous consequences for Australian primary industry, are being illegally introduced into this country, will the Minister take action to ensure that the maximum penalty for this offence is substantially increased? rumours mentioned by the honourable gentleman. I endorse his point that plant quarantine in relation to seeds and so on is just as important as animal quarantine is. I did not mean to minimise the importance of plant quarantine by my emphasis on animal quarantine yesterday. I will be only too glad to give careful consideration to the suggestion of the honourable gentleman. to the Minister for the Army.

There is, of course, an Australian component in the pharmaceutical industry. The industry as a whole is highly competitive, and an element which I think does have some influence, in particular directions at any rate, is the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The extent to which the activities of this organisation should be expanded is a matter of Government policy. I am not prepared to give any answer on the policy question now, but I shall study the details of the honourable gentleman's question and see in what respect my present answer should be amplified. directed to the Treasurer. I refer to that part of the statement by the Prime Minister on Tuesday night in which the right honourable gentleman saidIn addition, the trading banks will, we hope, be lending from the new funds on a long term basis and private persons continue to kill wild on reasonable terms and conditions. Can the Treasurer give an assurance that an understanding will be established with the trading banks to ensure that these conditions are implemented? the House yesterday in answer to a question, I have already had preliminary discussions with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and I hope soon-perhap s next week-to have discussions with some of the general managers of the trading banks. I cannot anticipate the outcome of the discussions, but I can state that it is the Government's objective to have a sum of $50 million allocated as soon as possible so that increased long term lending to rural industry can take place. the Prime Minister. Will his Government lodge a strong protest with the Algerian Government concerning the manner in which Ben Bella, the former Premier of that country, has been imprisoned for several months without trial, in circumstances where he is denied visitors-eve n members of his family and relatives-is prevented from obtaining medical attention, is refused legal representation and, in fact, is detained in a manner which is quite inhumane and a total derogation of human rights? Will his Government also protest on this matter through any international agencies which may be appropriate for this purpose? which led to the deposition of Mr Ben Bella was, of course, an internal matter. Whatever opinions we might hold on it, it is not appropriate for us to make representations to the Government which, de facto, is in control of Algeria. I am afraid I cannot give the honourable member the satisfaction of assuring him that we will make any representations to the Algerian Government on this subject. addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry. He may recall that on 30lh September 1965 I addressed a question lo him in which I asked whether he was aware that aerial poison spraying and the casual use of deadly chemicals by official bodies life and to wreck the balance of nature, to the detriment of primary industry. I asked the Minister whether he would make investigations with a view to using the full power of his Department to overcome the problem. His answer was one word"" Yes "". 1 now ask him: Has he made the investigations and, if so, with what result? member did ask me that question and I have made investigations. He suggests that agricultural chemicals are detrimental to primary industry, but I remind him that, lo a great degree, they also assist in increasing the productivity of primary industry. What is needed is a balanced approach. This matter is of world concern, because such spraying takes place in countries other than Australia. The Australian Agricultural Council has sponsored the preparation of a manual on the application of toxic agricultural chemicals from the air. That manual has been supported by my Department and can be bought by anyone who wants it. I commend it to the honourable member and to anyone else who is interested in this subject.

I am sure that if the honourable member comes to me I can give him additional detailed information. Minister for External Affairs is supplementary to that asked of him by the honourable member of Oxley. Is the House to understand from the Minister's reference to a de facto government that the Australian Government does not recognise the present Government of Algeria?

Bill presented by Mr Wentworth, and read a first time. Second Reading. That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a bill designed to put a third question to the people at the foreshadowed referendum. A short time ago there was some degree of urgency about this Bill because the referendum was to take place on 28th May 1966. Now that the referendum has been postponed there is not the same degree of urgency, particularly since our Constitution provides that a Bill for its alteration evaporates, in effect, unless it is put to a referendum within six months of being passed through this House. In those circumstances it would be inadvisable for this House to finalise the Bill before the date of the referendum is known. The consideration of this Bill is urgent but its finalisation is urgent no longer. In common with other members of this HouseI welcomed the Government's decision to put to a referendum a proposal to repeal section 127 of the Constitution which provides that Aborigines shall not be counted for certain purposes. This is good, but does it go far enough? I believe that it does not go far enough, and I have two motives in bringing before the Parliament this expanding Bill which provides that there shall be more responsibility on the Commonwealth to help the States to deal with Aborigines and to prevent racial discrimination in Australia. Let me refer first to the Aborigines themselves. I think that everyone who has had contact with Aborigines, as I have, has a personal liking for them and a feeling that we have a responsibility to them. They are nice, good people. Most of us would also have some sense of failure in relation to the way in which we have dealt with our Aborigines in the past. This is a failure",19,Poison Sprays

70,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [11.18].,"which perhaps is not peculiar to the Australian people. Other people, not only white people, have sensed it elsewhere outside Australia. However, there is an inherent difficulty in dealing with this problem. It is circumstances and because this is a pressnot just a matter of saying: "" We will regard the Aborigines as merely poor white people"". They are not. They are special people and they do need and deserve some special help. We have a special responsibility of assisting the Aborigines is not shared in this sphere. Hence, in a sense, some discrimination is still necessary but it must be discrimination in their favour, not discrimination against them. The Commonwealth so far, except in the Northern Territory, has had no direct responsibility in this sphere but there is a feeling that it should assume some greater degree or direct responsibility. That feeling stems from several sources. First, the Aborigines themselves want this to happen. If we were dealing with the rights of trade unionists or companies or pastoralists or any other group in the community we would consult with that group. The Aborigines are such a group and should be the first people to whom we would turn before deciding anything relating to their future. What do they want? What are their feelings in this regard? As a result of inquiry and a very considerable degree of contact with Aborigines, I knowI think the House would agree with me on this-that they want the Commonwealth to assume a greater degree of responsibility towards them, their rights, their opportunities and their advancement. That is the first reason for desiring some Commonwealth responsibility. I think it is a compelling reason and one to which we have not as yet given sufficient weight. We must not regard the Aborigines as having no rights. We must not regard them as merely a group in the community with no feelings, or as being not even proper people. This is the wrong way in which to regard them. We must look first and foremost to what the Aborigines want, and they want the Commonwealth to accept a greater degree of responsibility towards them. The second reason why I believe the Commonwealth must assume responsibility is that considerable funds will h j ncsded and these are most readily available from Commonwealth sources. From time to time in the past the States have said: ""We would like to do more for our Aborigines but we do not have the funds. There are competing claims for State funds. The Commonwealth has all the cash "". In those ing human problem, the Commonwealth should go to the aid of the States. Indeed, apart from those reasons, it should go to the aid of the States also because the burden equally among the States in proportion to their total population. Western Australia and Queensland, for example, have a more than proportionate need for assistance. It is unfair that the taxpayers of Western Australia and Queensland should be asked to bear a disproportionate share of what is really a national responsibility. It is a national task; it is a national problem with international implications. For that reason also the Commonwealth should be playing a direct part. The Aborigines, very rightly, require equal protection throughout the Commonwealth from adverse discriminatory laws. All of such laws should go. The present position is that an Aboriginal in Queensland has quite different rights before the law from those of an Aboriginal in New South Wales. At the moment I am not suggesting which is correct and which is incorrect. I am saying that it is bad that there should be a lack of uniformity and that the Aborigines throughout Australia need equal protection against adverse discrimination. For all of these and similar reasons, the Aboriginal problem will be handled better with some Commonwealth help. This does not mean the end of the State welfare administrations. Rather does it mean their extension as more funds become available to them properly from Commonwealth sources. In the administration of Aboriginal welfare there is a great deal to be said for the principle of decentralisation. The problems at Wyndham are not the same as those in Redfern. There are differences. Whilst all Aborigines are entitled to equal protection against adverse discrimination, the special welfare measures that are needed for them may well be different in different parts of Australia. SoI hope that the administration of Aboriginal welfare will continue to be decentralised among the States. Indeed, I believe that at this moment we should be paying some tribute to the new spirit that has come over many of the State administrations in the last few years. They are doing much better with the indadequate resources at their command. They may not be doing as much as we or they would like; but let us acknowledgeI think the Aboriginal people themselves recognise this -that a new and better spirit, which we all should gratefully acknowledge, is abroad in the State administrations. So much for the first motive for bringing in this expanded bill, namely, to help our Aboriginal people. The second motive is the elimination of racial discrimination inside our Australian Commonwealth. This also affects the Aboriginal people because the Aboriginal problem is best treated within the proper framework of avoidance of racial discrimination in Australia. It is by far the most important part of the Australian picture; but I believe that it is a part which is best treated in relation to the proper framework of the elimination of racial discrimination. That is one part of the motive. The other part is that in the Australian Constitution there are anachronisms dating back to the old Chinese and Kanaka problems of 70 years ago, which no longer exist. It should be a matter of pride for us to remove these anachronisms from the Constitution. It is certainly a matter of avoiding danger because they are subject to misinterpretation overseas and in certain circumstances could imperil Australia's total security considerably. That is the other leg of the problem. First and foremost, the motive is to help our Aboriginal people. Secondly, it is to put this matter in its proper framework by avoiding the expression of the principle of racial discrimination in our Australian Constitution. Let me pass now from the motive to the drafting of the Bill before the House. As honourable members will see, there are two operative clauses. The first provides for the repeal of the present sub-section (xxvi) of section 51 of the Constitution, which in its present form gives the Commonwealth power to make laws with respect to "" the people of any race other than the Aboriginal race in any State for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws"", and its replacement by a simple provision that the Commonwealth shall have power to make laws for "" the advancement of the Aboriginal natives of the Commonwealth of Australia"". The second operative clause provides for the addition of a new section 117A after the existing section 117. The proposed new section readsNeither the Commonwealth nor any State shall make or maintain any law which subjects any person who has been born or naturalised within the Commonwealth of Australia to any discrimination or disability within the Commonwealth by reason of his racial origin. There are the two proposals. Let me refer, first, to sub-section (xxvi) of section 51. There are two possible ways of dealing with it: First, the way that I have described and, secondly, the way of simply omitting the words "" other than the Aboriginal race in any State"" so that the Commonwealth would have power to pass discriminatory laws in regard to people of any racial origin, including Aborigines. The mere omission of the words seems to me to be unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, the sub-section does not say whether the discrimination should be adverse or favourable. If one looks at it one sees some implication, at any rate, that the discrimination would be unfavorable. We do need the power for favorable discrimination; we should not have the power for unfavorable discrimination. For that reason, I believe that it would be unsatisfactory just to omit the words. Another reason is that the omission of the words would not confer full protection against State discrimination. It would give the Commonwealth power to legislate and, as honourable members will know, under section 109 of the Constitution Commonwealth legislation overrides State legislation. But, if honourable members will turn their attention to the judgment delivered by the High Court of Australia in the case of the City of Melbourne v. the Commonwealth of Australia in 1947, they will see that the operation of section 109 may not be quite as untrammelled as some people are inclined to suppose. It may be that the High Court, applying the principles that it laid down in that case, would find, for example, that a Commonwealth law providing that Aborigines shall be eligible for a State franchise was a law relating not to Aborigines but to the organisation of State government and, as such, beyond Commonwealth power. So, in spite of section 109, these protections would not be absolute simply because of the removal of those few words. Thirdly, honourable members will know that there are practical and proper impediments to getting through this House legislation aimed at any specific provision of a law of a State government. Fourthly, we do not want to retain in our Constitution the power to make laws providing for adverse racial discrimination. That power would remain if we just removed those few words. Hence, I think, this sub-section, which has never yet been used, should come out and be replaced by the positive sub-section I have suggested, giving the Commonwealth responsibility for the advancement of our Aborigines. When I speak of this, I must speak of some things which have been said previously in this House about our need to retain what are described as the plenary powers in this sub-section (xxvi). The Nauruan question, for example, was raised in relation to it. I think there was an error of law here, because the Nauruans are not a race; hence the powers of sub-section (xxvi) could not be used in regard to them. But there are plenty of alternative powers that we could use in regard to such a problem. Sub-section (xxvi) is not operative but there are other sub-sections which would be operative: sub-section (xix)-naturalisatio n and aliens; sub-sections (xxvii)-immigratio n and emigration; sub-section (xxix)-externa l affairs, with the treaty making powers; subsection (xxx)-relation s with the islands of the Pacific. These powers exist and their operation has been determined by a series of High Court decisions. They are sufficient to cover any conceivable situation. The plenary racial powers in sub-section (xxvi) are not needed and, indeed, they are an impediment to the good name of Australia overseas. I have permission from the former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, to quote from a letter which he wrote to me last week in regard to this when I raised this question with him. He traversed some of the ground that I traversed and I now quote an exact sentence from the letterI would shed no tears over the complete repeal of sub-section (xxvi). It is, I think, quite unlikely to be operated by the Commonwealth, having regard to modern circumstances. I think this might be sufficient to dispose of that particular item. I come to the second question, the new section 117A. I think it is advisable to write a prohibition against racial discrimination into our Constitution in something like these words, because unless we did so there would be inadequate protection for Aborigines in both the Commonwealth and the State spheres. Our international relations would be improved by the inclusion of this section, which is in accordance with resolutions of the United Nations. It would also give expression to the ideal of homogeneity in our population which was expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) only a couple of nights ago in this House. The suggestion that I have made does not go too far and this does not raise controversial issues which might imperil the success of the referendum. It applies only to Australian electors including, of course, Aborigines, and their children and it applies only inside Australia. It leaves unimpaired other Commonwealth powers, for example, those over aliens, immigration and external affairs. It is not a prohibition which could be used to impede proper Commonwealth action. Objections have been raised that a section on rights of this character, a prohibitory section, is foreign to the spirit of our Constitution. This does not impress me overmuch, particularly when reading sections 116 and 117 which are in the Constitution already and which themselves have the same prohibitory form. It is said by some people that the section as I have drafted it is not sufficiently watertight. If this be so, I shall be glad of any improvements in the drafting. This is always open in the Committee stage. I do not want to be dogmatic about the actual wording of the draft and I hope that if any improvements can be suggested they will be brought forth. Indeed, Profesor Cowen, the Professor of Law in Melbourne, has suggested to me one significant improvement-jus t one or two words to provide for the case of immigrants from ithe United Kingdom who are neither born in Australia nor naturalised in Australia but are "" registered "" as citizens in Australia. I think this provision might well be put in. But these are not serious matters and I am aot proposing to take up the time of the House by traversing them overmuch now. There has been great support for this Bill. First and most important, there has been support from the Aboriginal organisations themselves. ThisI regard as vital and, indeed, decisive. There has been support from church bodies. Three or four weeks ago the Council of Churches, meeting in Melbourne, decided to support these proposals and to ask ministers throughout Australia to work for them. I gratefully acknowledge also editorials in the "" Catholic Weekly"" of Sydney and the ""Catholic Advocate"" of Melbourne, giving full support to these proposals. I thank the 250 university people who have signed in support of the proposals. I include among those two vicechancellors, a dean of law and various other people, whose very weighty support will help. Spokesmen for the Australian Labour prospect that all will turn out well there. Party in this House have given some support But we must see that this referendum to these principles and the Democratic succeeds. Labour Party has also indicated support. As regards the Liberal PartyI gratefully acknowledge the support of the Women's us do this primarily because we want Group in New South Wales. The Liberal to help our own Australian Aborigines, to Youth Council in New South Wales help them in this period of transition, to has seen fit to give support, as well as bring them through to full citizenshipa ' numerous branches and conferences. Apex and Rotary clubs, while not formally committed as bodies to support, have helped very materially. I thank those very, very numerous helpers who have distributed pamphlets and otherwise worked. I reserve the right to speak later. express gratitude to these people and appeal for the continuance of their support. I think that there is now a deep tide The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr of popular sentiment running in favour Wentworth) has reminded us that there are of the kind of proposal that I have differences in State policies in relation to brought forward in this Bill. It may Aborigines. I remember that when the be that the Bill will be taken over Select Committee on Voting Rights of by the Government.

I ask those who support these proposals both inside and outside the House to continue to work for them. It will be necessary to dispel any suspicion that we are out to transfer immense powers from the States to the Commonwealth. This, of course, is not so. We should like the Commonwealth to share a burden with the States in a matter which, in terms of their total responsibility, is a small and embarrassing matter but which, from our point of view in this Commonwealth, should be a matter of quite prime responsibility. I have had some contacts, I am glad to say, with some of the States already. These have been on a confidential basis and I do not wish to discuss them in this House but I would say that I am not without hope and Let us continue our campaign.

But one had no feeling of definite purpose as to what positively was going to happen to the people for their advancement, how they were going to fend for themselves in society. They appeared to be in a kind of protective custody. At Woodenbong, on the other hand, the housing was disgraceful, employment was intermittent, conditions were not good, the morale in the community was not high. I asked one man why he had come down from Cherbourg to Woodenbong and his answer was: "" I would rather have freedom than good conditions"". Such a statement does, I think, qualify a man for the franchise, but in addition to that it seemed to to me a tragedy that there should have been among so many a sense that they had to choose between freedom and good conditions. There was no doubt that in the formal sense of constitutional rights, the right to vote and freedom of movement about the State, Queensland had a policy very different from and much more highly restrictive that the policies of other States. In terms of the ultimate survival of the Aboriginal people I do not say that Queensland policy would have been behind that of the other States; I merely remark that I could not see what the Queensland authorities were doing to enable the Aboriginal people to get off the footing onto which they had been manoeuvred. The Aborigines in that State at that time had no sense of freedom of movement within the State; in that sense they were at that time without some aspects of independence and dignity. This is a constitutional debate. A constitution is a living document to determine the actions of government in a community. I think the honourable member for Mackellar has a great heart, first for attempting to amend the Constitution at all and, secondly, for trying to amend it in .respect of the Aboriginal people. The section which he proposes to eliminate from the Constitution-it contains the restriction on the power of the Commonwealth to legislate for the Aboriginal people-reads The Parliament of the Commonwealth shall have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to the people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. In the 1891 draft of the Constitution this passage read quite differently, and I want to refer to the implied censure of Australia by New Zealand resulting from the original form of words. Last night in the film that was shown in this Parliament House there were references to Sir George Grey, and I am glad to see the beginnings of a revaluation of his position in history, because I think that when we study fully the history of our country, which in this respect is tied in with that of New Zealand, we are going to see in Sir George Grey the greatest figure of imperial statesmanship in our 19th century history in the senses in which imperial policies have survived the test of the modern conscience. I think it is due very largely to him that provision was made for a democratic franchise for the Senate a remarkable achievement in 1891 when legislative councillors as a matter of course were elected according to property qualifications. He was representing New Zealand at the Constitutional Convention as the Prime Minister of New Zealand. The original draft gave the Commonwealth power to make laws with respect toThe affairs of people of any race with respect to whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws not applicable to the general community; but so this power shall not extend to authorise legislation with respect to the Aboriginal native race in Australia and the Maori race in New Zealand. I have no doubt that what Sir George Grey was trying to do was to throw a defensive screen around the Maori people, to defend them from the kind of Aboriginal policies that we pursued in Australia, and when New Zealand withdrew from the negotiations designed to include it in our Federation the provision was left in the draft except that the reference to Maoris was eliminated and the Aboriginal people were the only ones then referred to in the limitation of power. One of the men who stood for this limitation was Sir John Forrest who, as an explorer, had been very dependent on Aborigines to help him locate water and so on. When he referred to this section he saidI cannot for the life of me see why we should desire to give the Federal parliament control of any person, whetever may be his nationality or colour, who is living in a State. I think he conceived a defensive role in relation to Aborigines, and he was not even Jn favour of the Commonwealth having the Authority to repatriate the Pacific Islands labourers, which was the field of power where the real interest centred in this debate at the Constitutional Convention. Whatever the origins of this, however, the fact remains that the provision continues as a prohibition on the Commonwealth from legislating for the people of the Aboriginal race other than those in Commonwealth territories. The honourable member for Mackellar has, I think, a quite unique and vital distinction in the politics of Australia in this respect, because in his persistent work which led to the establishment of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies he extracted from the Government of the Commonwealth the first gesture of a basic respect for the Aboriginal people in 50 or 60 years. I will make a reference later to earlier gestures, which unfortunately did not live on in history, by the Government of Queensland at the turn of the century and by the Government of South Australia early in the century. Basically all Aboriginal policy is drifting. The mind of no government in Australia and no political party in Australia are really focused on the Aboriginal people. The way in which a minority people is treated is the touchstone of national character. The true test of our respect for a minority race is whether we want them to be a distinctive people making a distinctive contribution. New Zealanders are proud of Maoris; Maoris are proud to be Maoris. Whatever failures there may be in New Zealand policy, or injustices in New Zealand policy, these fundamental and essential achievements in the vital realm of the mind are there. Our policy, which we proudly claim to be one of assimilation, is an unconscious revelation to the world that we are not yet capable of New Zealand's maturity. We are not proud of the Aborigines, although there are many reasons why we should be, and almost no policy exists in either the Commonwealth sphere or the State sphere of encouraging Aborigines to be proud of themselves. I remember a friend of mine who taught at the Forrest River School. He was teaching Australian history to Aboriginal children and he suddenly realised that his teaching of history was totally rejected by the children. He sat down and asked them why, and they said: "" You teach us about Australian explorers but you never refer to the Aborigines who we know guided them, showed them how to find water in desert places and helped them. "" As a result this young man, whose name is Harry Venville, conducted researches into this auestion and was astounded to find the extent to which the statements of the Aboriginal children about the dependence of Australian explorers on Aborigines were true. But he was cheered to find that these Aboriginal children had a pride in themselves as a people and demanded their place in Australian history. I would say that this was the greatest compliment to the effectiveness of his own teaching, if he could foster self respect, that could possibly be made. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies is the first sign of a real respect on the part of the Commonwealth Government. It is the achievement of the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), but there is credit due to the acceptance of it on the part of the Government. Every State is utterly indifferent, except perhaps in museums, to Aboriginal music, Aboriginal customs, Aboriginal religion, Aboriginal languages, Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal art. Queensland and South Australia in the 1890s and early in this century respectively took some interest, and Queensland appointed a brilliant ethnologist, Walter Edmund Roth, whose work on Aborigines in the 1890s and early in the 20th century was a vital part of the history of this country and of the Aborigines. The Queensland Government did attempt to pursue a policy based on an enlightenment proceeding from a real study of the Aboriginal people. South Australia backed the Baldwin Spencer expeditions before the First World War. Apart from that-le t us face it-the States have treated Aboriginal life as unworthy of notice. This is not to say that there were no policies; but all policies envisaged the Aborigines as potential black Europeans. There was no attempt, after Roth and Baldwin Spencer, to get in to find out who the Aboriginal people were, or who they themselves thought they were. Australians policy has been directed towards the destruction of the self consciousness of the Aboriginal people and the policy of assimilation is now a continuation of the destruction of that self consciousness. In most cases in the States the new policy is not, in my view, a policy at all. It is an attempt to avoid the charges of apartheid and discrimination and does not go beyond that in any real creative sense. We will give them diinking rights. We will give them fornicating rights, whereas it used to beas it is in South African law-a n offence for interracial fornication to take place, although we never denied inter-marriage. We will give them voting rights and they may vote every three years for Tweedledum or Tweedledee who normally are equally indifferent to their needs. All these reforms cost the Treasury virtually nothing. We have now an Arbitration Commission decision on wages. If we ask for statistics on tuberculosis or leprosy we are told that racially segregated statistics are not kept and we are proud of the fact that we do not racially segregate our statistics. We cannot see races, but we can now identify Aborigines as a distinctive group to whom for three years we can pay lower wages. We can see Aborigines when it comes to a question of wages, but we cannot see them when it comes to a question of health statistics. But we need separate statistics about the Aboriginal people if we are ever to measure the effectiveness of policies and make moral assessments of policies. I have no doubt that in this group of Aborigines in the Northern Territory over whom one blanket definition is now thrown, some individuals are worth full wages now, but we assume that they disqualify as a group. It is based on no evidence whatsoever presented by the Aboriginal people themselves. White government officials appeared before the judge and white union officials appeared before the judge; but did he go to see the skills of the Aboriginal stockmen? skills. There were very many inspections. out the Aborigine who has skills equal to those of the white stockman and give him equal wages? tions. that, but did Aborigines testify before the judge? among the Aborigines, such as wife lending, which become desperately degrading out of the context of tribal law and safeguards, and yet when we make a refprm like the fornicating rights we do not notice this. In Western Australia venereal disease has quadrupled in the last two or three years and it is very often among Aborigines. We do not want any charges of apartheid. We are not thinking in terms of the real welfare of the Aborigines. We are not thinking of this background of custom. And a double hit is made. They have not wages equal to those of the Europeans. They have this background of wife lending and the giving out of their daughters, and they have developed the expenditure needs of the Europeans. Inadequate income among Aborigines in contact with Europeans leads too often to prostitution and venereal disease. We have really to look intelligently at this Aboriginal community. The honourable member for Mackellar has attempted to make us look at these people-as they look at themselves-throug h the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. We have to look at what is really happening to them in health. The Commonwealth Government, in the 1930s, avoided collecting unemployment statistics because it did not wish to be judged by them; therefore they were not published. Now the Commonwealth and the States avoid any statistics in relation to Aborigines and treat this deliberately cultivated ignorance as a matter for pride. It is evident that most tuberculosis is among Aboriginal people. If you ask what are the statistics for leprosy and tuberculosis you are told, smugly, that no separation of statistics on racial grounds takes place. Why not? You want statistics if you want to measure the true effectiveness of your health policy. We get glimpses from reputable private investigations of an Aboriginal infant mortality seven or eight times the European rate. If the Commonwealth and the States wish to know the success or failure of their policies they should have clear statistics of leprosy, tuberculosis,",24,Constitution Alteration

We now propose not to go ahead with the referendum on which we had agreed. There is to be further delay. The Aborigines in the Northern Territory who are engaged in the pastoral industry are not to be given equality of wages until further delay has occurred. This sort of thing always seems to happen in relation to the Aboriginal people. We know that if this were to happen in relation to trade unions, business or any other section of the Australian community the kind of uproar that would immediately arise would prevent any delay in meeting what those people conceived to be their needs. Somehow or other, Aboriginal affairs always seem to be thrust aside as secondary. This is because perhaps I in my heart and many others in their own hearts, as they would agree if they were quite honest, in our basic motives feel that Aborigines are a secondary people. Dr. Ida Mann, Professor of Medicine at the University of Western Australia, reported some years ago that 78 per cent, of Aboriginal children suffered from trachoma. I think that was the percentage. Magnificently, the State Government has got rid of that disease some years since. If it had been reported that 78 per cent, of the children at the Claremont School, which my children attended, suffered from trachoma, the uproar would have resounded from one end of the State to the other and the State Government either would have had to clear up the situation in a couple of weeks or it would have been out of office, because we are passionately concerned about our own children. But, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that we are not passionately concerned about the Aboriginal people. I believe that this Parliament is capable of being passionately concerned about them. I consider that the referendum campaign that the honourable member for Mackellar proposes, whether it were to succeed or fail, would be of vital importance as an educational campaign in focusing in the minds of all Australians the whole position of the people of the Aboriginal race. They will not die out. This is the point that makes the issue so vital. Across the north of Australia, there has been a reversal of the population trend. We shall have many more Aborigines in the future. We must get down to some real thinking about their place in the Australian community. I believe that the constitutional changes proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar will provide a documentary basis for new action by the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States, in the field of Aboriginal welfare. Let us be quite clear about the situation. The States now live with the battle to get money from the Commonwealth. As far as I can see, the sums allocated for the Aboriginal people are not sufficient to meet their needs. But once there is written into the Commonwealth Constitution a clear statement of the Commonwealth's own responsibilities, this will, I believe, lead to a transformation in the finance available to meet the needs of the Aborigines. I believe that it will lead also to a vital transformation of attitude to the building up of staffs to deal with the needs of the Aboriginal people and to a transformation in their conditions. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, which was established at the suggestion of the honourable member for Mackellar, has now given us many clues about the way in which we should deal with the Aborigines. For the first time their thought is being opened to us and we have been shown how to treat them with real respect as a distinctive people with the right to be distinctive. For that reason, the Opposition wholeheartedly supports this Bill which was presented this morning by the honourable member for Mackellar and which is designed to amend the Constitution as it relates to Aborigines. Deputy Speaker, it gave me very much pleasure indeed to second the motion of my coUeague, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). I congratulate him on the great deal of work that he has put into this. I must say at the outset that we are all very pleased to see Mrs. Kathleen Walker, the Australian Aboriginal poetess, in the chamber. When we tackle the problem of the integration of these two races, we must first realise that the responsibility is on not only our shoulders but also the shoulders of the Australian Aborigines. Through the years, we have passed the buck by saying that this is not",27,Constitution Alteration
80,Mr Erwin (Ballaarat) [12.11],"Mrour fault, that it is the fault of our forefathers. We must realise that if we are to brine about any successful integration of Aborigines with Europeans those in the majority-the Europeans-mus t take the lead. We must give because we have taken. We have taken a good deal, so now it must be nearly all giving on our part. Both races have to work at the task. Today we cannot say that we have Queensland Aborigines, New South Wales Aborigines or Western Australian Aborigines. All are Australian Aborigines. Section 51 of the Constitution, if we allow it to stay as it is at the moment, will not permit us to introduce legislation providing for definite assistance at the national level towards the welfare of our Aborigines, apart from those in ths Northern Territory, as we know. I want to emphasise a point that was stressed by previous speakers. We shall not take anything away from the States. On the contrary, we shall give something. I believe that State officials to whom I have spoken realise their responsibilities and will look at the situation in this light. We realise, Conditions were different then. The simple as has been realised in many of the other countries where similar problems have existed, that these problems must be tackled first through the channels of education. But when we think of the education of Australian Aborigines we must think not only of reading, writing and arithmetic in our primary schools. We must think of something that is even more important than our Aboriginal children attending with European children in the same schools. We must think of a special kind of education-a n education that will bring these people to appreciate our way of life so that they can have a good life beside us, living as we do and respecting the kind of things that we respect. This will mean a special kind of education. I think this is what the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) were referring to when they spoke of a kind of discrimination. In the field of primary and secondary education, the States have done and are doing a wonderful job in the education of Aboriginal children. Recently in the United States of America on a federal basis there has been started what is called the Head Start Programme. This has appealed to me as the sort of thing we could well emulate in Australia. The idea of the Head Start Programme is to bring children back to school during vacation periods. What is more, each child is paid $1.50 a day as an incentive to return to school at that time. During this period they are given a special type of education they need so much. This is the sort of thing we have to look at from a federal angle. SoI say: Let us all look seriously at the amendment of sub-section (xxxvi) of section. 51 of the Constitution and let us do it now. Unless we correct it now, the eyes of the world will soon be turned on us and we will be held to criticism for our treatment of the Aborigines. To use the common vernacular term, it is better to beat the gun and act now. Despite the collective wisdom of those who framed the Constitution, one can hardly imagine that the section under discussion would be accepted today as readily as it was almost 70 years ago. This was not the fault of those who framed the Constitution. truth is that our knowledge and understanding of the problem have grown. Our ideas have altered and developed. There is now a growing awareness of the human value of these neglected people. Our national task is patiently consistently and with understanding to help these shy, diffident and deprived people whose age old culture and organisation have been destroyed or are being threatened and disturbed by the march of our own civilisation. The Aborigines face what is for them the immensely difficult transition from the despised shanty settlements that fringe some of our towns to secure integration and equality within the hearts of our communities. The transition can be achieved only if our national Government has the required constitutional power. This Government has a strong desire to legislate on all matters that will bring about an improvement in the assistance available to our Aborigines so that in time-n o one knows how long-ou r two peoples ultimately will be successfully integrated. represents an effort to bring the Australian Aboriginal community into the body of the Australian Commonwealth in a fully constitutional way. That is the project before us.",29,Constitution Alteration
81,Mr Bryant (Wills) [12.20],"This BillI suppose the immediate project is for those of us who are convinced that this is necessary to convince our colleagues in this House and then to carry with us the rest of Australia-in the terms of the Constitution, a majority of the people in the majority of the States. From my own experience, which is now lengthy and broad, I am convinced that the people of Australia will support wholeheartedly any referendum that flows from this Bill. I say that because in the 10 years I have been in the Parliament, I have associated myself closely with the movement of the Aboriginal people themselves and those other people who are concerned with this problem. Because of that association, I know that there is a campaign ready to be initiated immediately the Government decides that it is politically possible to proceed with this project. SoI say to honourable members that the first thing we should do is to shed any doubts about the feelings of the citizens of Australia in this matter. The last doubts lie with ourselves perhaps as to whether we can carry our own electorates with us. I think I can give a personal guarantee that a majority of the citizens of Wills will vote for this proposition. I am sure the pursuasive advocacy of the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) in Bruce will have the same result. The simple question is this: Are the people with us? 1 say: Yes, they are. This is not a campaign that started only yesterday. Like most of us, I came to this Parliament not very well informed on the Aborigines. The position of these people was brought to my notice only a year or two after I entered the Parliament in late 1955. With the permission of the Australian Labour Party, we of the Opposition moved a motion on the general subject of Aboriginal welfare as long ago as 1937. Only a week later my close friend and former colleague, Mr the House to this Bill will certainly be Haylen who was then the honourable member for Parkes, tabled a petition in this House asking that the Commonwealth take action to remove sub-section (xxvi) of section 51 from the Constitution and to repeal section 127. In the intervening time, a tremendous campaign has been associated with this project. In fact, 94 separate petitions have been presented to the House in the nine years since the campaign got under way in -58. Actually, it is eight years since we launched the project in a national way. Churches, most political parties, people in all the Parliaments and the trade union movement of Australia are all convinced that this change is necessary. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has given the Parliament an opportunity to agree to it and I believe it is our bounden national duty to get on with the job. The position is this: The Aboriginal people are still denied some of the advantages and benents of being Australians and they will be denied those advantages while this section of the Constitution remains. While anything inhibits Commonwealth action in the field of Aboriginal advancement, the Aborigines cannot receive the full benefits of Commonwealtb resources. The last arrived migrant who steps ashore in Australia can receive the benefits of Commonwealth support in education. He can go to a migrant school to learn the English language. But the Commonwealth Government has no constitutional authority to establish such a system for the Aborigines of Northern Queensland or Western Australia although I do not suppose its authority to do so would be challenged. This is simply a question of bringing the Australian community together in a partnership. I put it to honourable members that each of them should examine his own conscience, which I presume is as clear ,as anybody else's in this matter; each should take a look at his own electorate and consider where he will stand when this project comes before the people. Is his electoral committee on side in this matter? Can it carry his electorate with it? lf the answer is: "" Yes"", the answer of "" Aye "". This has been a long campaign for the Aboriginal people of Australia. The instructions given to Governor Phillip when he set out to establish a settlement in Australia wereYou are to endeavour by every possible means to open an intercourse witb the natives, and to conciliate their affections, enjoining all our subjects to live in amity and kindness with them. And if any of our subjects shall wantonly destroy them, or give them any unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their several occupations, it is our will and pleasure that you do cause such offenders to be brought to punishment according to the degree of offence. Then this portion of the instructions is ironical because we have not yet got round to itYou will endeavour to procure an account of the numbers inhabiting the neighbourhood of the intended settlement. . . . The repeal of section 127 will enable us to get on with that for the whole of Australia. The first mention of this proposal that I can find before the Parliament, although I have not delved into every document, is a recommendation by Dr. Donald Thomson in a report to the present Miniswho was then Minister for the Interior, on made the Government, through the approthe position in the Northern Territory. priate Minister, will call in the representThis is what he saidAlthoughI think that the objective should be finally to bring the whole of the administration complete report on this matter.

In this instance the only people who exercise total responsibility effectively for have to be convinced are the members of the Aboriginal people of Australia and for this Parliament. I am convinced that the all people of Australia. SoI invite honourable citizens of Australia are on side, f am members to remember that the proposition convinced that the electoral machinery is that we change the Constitution in this way in existence to carry the proposition once it has, so far as I can tell, the wholehearted is put before the citizens, and I am consupport of every organisation associated vinced that there can be no proper approach with the Aboriginal people in Australia and to the Aboriginal question in Australia until the support of the Aboriginal people the Commonwealth Government takes it up themselves. If the House will bear with me for a the Aboriginal people of Australia should moment I will tell honourable members reside solely in Queensland and Western something of the organisation with which I Australia while the Victorians and New am involved as the senior vice-president.

So we speak here this afternoon with the full support of the Aboriginal people.

I am pleased that on this occasion 1 speak in full support of and in full rapport with my colleague, the honourable member for Mackellar. This is a notable advance in Australian politics. I know that several other honourable members opposite wish to add their support to this motion. Therefore, in certain ways, this is an historic matter. --Order! As it is now two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate is interrupted. Motion (by Mr Snedden) agreed toThat the time for discussion of notices be extended until 12.45 p.m. support this proposal. I believe that there is a very great need for us to overhaul completely our national approach to the Aboriginal problem. This is a matter that deserves even more consideration than the scope of this debate permits. The Aboriginal problem in Australia was described by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) as something that was of both national and international concern. I am one who feels very strongly on the issue of the international clearly the need for more work to be done. implications of the problem. During a visit overseas last year I suppose the question most often raised with me was about Australia's policy in respect of the Aboriginal people of the Commonwealth. I was proud to be able to say that we did not, in a practical way, discriminate, that we were doing things to advance these people and that we regarded them as citizens of the Commonwealth. But one must go further if one is to be quite serious in a matter of this kind, and to take it further one must have regard to the constitutional factors and to the ways and means of looking to the interests of the advancement of our Aboriginal people. It has been argued that the Constitution, cared for. We are not approaching this proas it stands, does not permit Parliament to blem as we might do. I believe that a great discriminate and that the proposed alteration deal more could be done to raise their status could introduce a situation in which Parliament could discriminate. I have no doubt that the Government will take this view fully into consideration when, as must happen, this matter comes again before the Executive for consideration. The view of the honourable member for Mackellar that we cannot proceed with this motion hastily because there cannot be a determination that would run longer than six months ahead of a referendum date is a vital consideration. But let us make sure that in the long run we are able to remove any doubt in this matter. The Commonwealth would be the poorer if the eventual outcome of this matter leaves any doubt about discrimination. We cannot permit a stituation that would infer discriminataion. Having said that, I want very briefly to express some views in respect of what we should be doing in Australia from the standpoint of the practical approach that is necessary. First, we are spending insufficient money in the interests of the advancement of the Aboriginal people. In my own electorate I have many instances of the need for greater expenditure. There is scope not only for housing and education but there is also vast scope for the provision of an adequate approach to the problem of social work and welfare work. There are insufficient officers and an insufficient provision for welfare officers to do a worthwhile job in lifting the standard of the lives of the Aboriginal people. I find that there is an increased Aboriginal population in my electorate. This indicates very In New South Wales a parliamentary select committee is currently investigating the Aboriginal problem. This will be a useful move, so far as the State is concerned. However, there is no national policy so that whatever is the determination of the parliamentary committee and whatever is its recommendation, there is still a situation of doubt and difficulty not conducive to an atmosphere in which we can successfully resolve the needs of the day of the Aborigines. One of the principal requirements is to ensure that in respect of employment and well being the Aboriginal people are properly",32,Constitution Alteration

I support the motion because I believe it is the only way in which we can bring the overall problem effectively under notice. The Government must ensure that no doubt exists as to where the Commonwealth stands and that there is no room for doubt on the score of discrimination. Let us support this proposal so that the Government will again have the responsibility of examining the problem effectively with a view to ensuring that in the long run we do something worthwhile in the interests of the Commonwealth and, in particular, of the Aboriginal people. privilege and pleasure to speak on this they do not enjoy at the present time. matter for a few minutes.

A great deal has been done on the reserves, where there are quite substantial settlements. At Cape York the settlement contains 1,015 Aborigines; at Cherbourg 1,088; and at Palm Island 1,550.

89,Mr Hallett (Canning) [2.15],"l n mycongratulations, because I feel that they bave done a service to this country. It is true that not every Australian will agree with all the findings and conclusions contained in the report. It is also true that the ahead. members of this House and indeed the Government itself do not agree with all the findings and conclusions contained in the document. But it would be a strange world if we all did agree with everything contained in the Vernon Committee's report. The fact of the matter is that we now have available to us much information that we did not have previously in the comprehensive form of a report. Whether we agree or otherwise with all the matters contained in the report, we are now in a better position to examine the situation in which we now find ourselves. AlthoughI agree that we should always look to the future in order to know as nearly as possible exactly where we are going, I submit that we must at the same time examine our past performances. The Vernon Committee has done this to some extent by examining the position as it has existed in the post war period. The Committee has also stressed tbe importance of increasing both our production and our exports. Of course, we are continually striving to do these things, and the Committee makes certain recommendations relating to them. In the main, the Committee refers to economic growth and full employment. These are matters which the Government has been striving to promote. No doubt it will continue to do so in the best interests of not only Australians but also other people throughout the world. ln order to achieve this, we must at all times strive to make the best use of the power and all other resources within Australia. This is one field to which I wish to address my remarks in speaking to this report. We are living in an age in which great skill and know how are required in industry. Conditions have changed rapidly in the last few years. In all our industries, both primary and secondary, research and capital are playing a greater part in promoting our well being. Indeed, if we do not make the best use of the results of research throughout the world and within Australia and if we do not make available the amount of capital necessary to enable us to take advantage of the results of research and to make the best use of the skills available to us, we shall not make the progress which is required for a number of years The development of practically every project in Australia today, regardless of where it is, requires the appUcation of capital and know how if it is to be successful. As an example, I point to the rapid development that has been taking place in the establishment of new factories in Australia in an endeavour to fulfil orders obtained within Australia and to export products to various parts of the world on a comparable basis with other countries. AU the evidence available to us today emphasises that if we are to achieve this level of production adequate capital must be poured into the new factories. For example, the only way that I can see to develop the iron ore and steel projects in Australia, especially those in Western Australia, is to pour adequate capital into them. If this is done-and it is being done throughout Australia today-the n I am sure that we shall be able to compete with other countries and to capture overseas markets. In fact, we have already captured some overseas markets and thereby established that these industries can succeed. WhatI have said applies not only to secondary industries and to mining; it applies equally to agriculture. We are living in a new age. The statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) on rural credit last Tuesday evening was a very important one. As I see the position, it represented the first step towards making long term credit available to our agricultural industries. In my view this long term credit is extremely important. The Prime Minister indicated to the House that, together with having talks with the banks in the near future on how rural credit is to be distributed. The method of distribution is of the utmost importance. A difficult set of circumstances exists in eastern Australia today due to the present severe drought. Let us not underestimate the importance of some of the remarks contained in the Vernon Committee's report on this position. Governments can make certain amounts of money available, but that money can only alleviate the position, not solve it. The solution of the problem is one for",35,Australian Economy
90,"Natural Resources, All Available Skilled Man","the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon), we will benature itself. In the meantime, this country cannot afford to continue losing the number of livestock it has been losing over the last year or two. I have mentioned previously in the House that at this point of time we should be in a position at least to hold our breeding stock in the country. Apparently we have not been able to do so under the conditions obtaining recently. I know that to achieve this position is extremely difficult, but its achievement is not impossible if we embark upon a programme of long term planning. We must do this. When dealing with credit, the Vernon Committee has this to say at paragraph 8.93 of its report. . . we doubt whether credit institutions are fully adjusted to the needs of the new farm technothe return that is possible from this prology. We see less merit in or need for interest-rate ject, in the next 15 or 20 years, the amount concessions than for development credit, long and intermediate in term, with repayment conditions adjusted to current land-development programmes. The final conclusion at which the Committee arrives is that a further study of this particular problem is required. I take it that in speaking of credit the Committee is referring not only to credit to agricultural industries, but also to the need to provide credit generally throughout Australia. I can see from reading the report that in delving into the matter the Committee experienced great difficulty in trying to analyse the exact position in which we find ourselves today. I would not be surprised to learn that the greatest need will be found to exist, not in the secondary industries, but in the rural industries because the whole question of rural production is most complicated today. The Prime Minister's statement is really a welcome one, but the important consideration today is the manner in which the credit is to be made available. We are living in a completely different age. We are past the horse and cart age. We are at the stage where the only way by which agriculture can be made successful is by making sufficient capital available for its development. If adequate capital is not made available, then the limited amount of money that has been invested in agriculture will simply be wasted. We are simply wasting the skills and ability of the men engaged in agriculture if we simply tackle the problem in a half hearted fashion and do not produce the goods we need so badly. We have seen this happen. It has happened to some extent in Western Australia. It was stated quite recentlyI take it that the statement was correct-that something like 20 million acres bas been developed in Western Australia and that another 20 million acres of land is still to be developed. When we realise that $50 million is now to be expended and in the next 15 years in one State of Australia a programme to develop 20 million acres of land is to be undertaken, we appreciate how enormous the project is. At the moment, an area of one million acres is being developed each year in Western Australia, but not sufficient money is being poured into the area each year to obtain from the project the income and exportable surplus that such an undertaking should return. To achieve of capital that will be required will be tremendous. Nevertheless the fact that $50 million is now to be made available is some indication of the development planned at this point of time. Of course, other moneys are being invested in these fields throughout the whole of Australia, but we have still to survive the present drought. The important point is that greater quantities of money must be made available if we are to achieve the returns we require. I agree with the recommendation contained in the Vernon report concerning further economic studies. In recent years the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada and New Zealand have found it necessary to gain further information on economic matters by additional study. This is such an important matter that we cannot ignore it. Our balance of payments situation and the development of this nation have relied and will rely on our primary industries. If the drought position in eastern Australia continues, our situation will deteriorate. We have to improve the situation. How we do it depends on how we utilise our skills and the credit available to us. Agriculture nowadays depends on engineering and research. Figures contained in the Vernon report indicate that the percentage of money spent on our agricultural research in relation to the overall economic situation is as good as, if not better than, that spent in America and most other countries. The same cannot be said of our secondary industries. Having acquired the skills and the factories to produce the necessary machinery within Australia we must move into the credit field. Money must be made available to develop the country and to enable farmers to use the facilities available to them. If we do not do this we are not doing the work we should be doing. During the Budget debate last year I suggested that the banking world was not in line with modern agricultural techniques. I find that this situation applies in all the agricultural areas I have visited throughout this Commonwealth. Why should we be timid about advancing money for agriculture? Where money has been devoted to developmental projects in Western Australia success has been achieved. In some areas of Western Australia developed in recent years with war service land settlement funds about four sheep will be carried to the acre. This is the sort of thing that can be achieved, but when we look at the areas where sufficient capital has not been provided we find an entirely different picture. We cannot afford this situation. When capital is poured into a project the return benefits not only the individual, who exists for only a limited time, as do we all, but the nation as a whole. We develop a national asset through making credit available. If $50 million is made available on the terms that we understand it will be made available-financ e of the kind which the Australian Country Party has been seeking ever since I have been in this House-it will relieve the situation in the eastern States and will assist farmers in the early stages of developing property. Australia is a young country and we that when the Prime Minister( Mr Harold have no other choice, and we have the confer with the banks and credit is made resources to do the work. It has been available it will be the first and not frequently said-and I do not agree with the final step in this field. I believe the this-that the world is over supplied with availability of credit will enable us to wheat. Never yet to my knowledge has progress and to get on with the job in hand. Australia produced a bushel of wheat that it has not been able to sell. The present world situation indicates a decline in wheat [2.34] -In speaking on this report of the production. We must carefully examine the Vernon Committee I should like initially world's requirements and the world's proto pay credit to and highly commend the duction. Wheat is an important grain for Committee for the tremendous amount of human consumption. When we look at work it has done in preparing this report. South East Asia, Africa and other parts of The report contains information that will the world and then study wheat production be of great value to all sections of the generally we realise we cannot ignore the Australian community for many years to facts. In England and in America, for come. It represents a compilation of instance, huge tracts of good agricultural statistics and facts which will be invaluable land are being taken over for home buildin determining a whole range of growth ing, roads and factories. I do not suggest that this should not happen, but we must realise the effect it is having on primary production. Figures relating to the use of agricultural land in Britain for purposes other than primary production are rather startling. It is obvious that this trend must continue and that production must decline. In 1965 world wheat stocks were estimated at 44.4 million metric tons, but the forecast for 1966 is 38.7 million metric tons. Australia is in a position to do something about the situation. We have vast areas not yet in production. We are in a position to make huge quantities of foodstuffs available to other parts of the world. We are in a position to supply South East Asia and other countries with wheat and other foodstuffs. This is one of the most humane things Australia can do. We can maintain our production by applying our skills and by making credit available. The Vernon report will be worthwhile if nothing more comes from it than a study of the credit situation as it relates to Australian industries. We cry out about too much foreign capital coming to this country. Let us use some of our own capital in our primary producing areas to enable us to achieve greater exports, then the earnings coming back to Australia will be our own money and not foreign capital. We have the ability, skills, raw materials, good land and research facilities to accomplish this. Much of our land is starved of credit. It is in the Government's hands to remedy the situation and I hope",36,Australian Economy

92,Mr Bridges,"MAXWELL (Robertson)in this country. I do not intend to deal with the larger questions of economic growth and the economy in general, as these were last night and by other speakers. I intend to speak about chapter 16 of the report, which deals with research. It is only a small chapter when compared with the others, but it is of tremendous importance as related to the development of this country. 1 believe that research and the development of new ideas, techniques and methods of production will have a tremendous effect on our future as a nation. I do not say that they are the complete answer. As my friend the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hallett) has said, we must take into account other matters such as the use of credit. If we want to compete as a trading nation, if we intend to develop this continent and populate it, and if we want to maintain our standards of living, to improve our national welfare and also to be able to defend ourselves as a nation, then in the long term the attainment of those objectives will depend upon our ability to innovate, to Use our resources and to develop new techniques by research and the application of science. In chapter 16 of the report the Committee analysed Australia's research effort and compared it with that of other countries. The Committee made various suggestions. For example, it suggested that our industrial research and development are weak. I would agree with that suggestion. I am on record as having said that in the past. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt), in his state of the nation address two days ago, said that the Government is considering methods of giving an incentive to industry to enlarge its research and development effort. Later in this speech I intend to deal in greater detail with that subject. The Committee also suggested that in terms of agricultural expenditure the extension of new ideas to farmers is weak. I am delighted that in the recent recess the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) announced to the Australian Agricultural Council that the Government intends to increase fourfold over the next few years grants by the Commonwealth in the extension field. This will have a great effect upon the extension adtivities of the various States, unless we restrict our play to a league for small particularly as the States have given an undertaking that they will not lower their present allocations in this field. The Vernon Committee suggested also that there needs to be an increase in the basic research that is done by our universities and it suggested the setting up of a national science foundation for this purpose. If we adopt the definition that the Committee gave in its report, last year the Government had already set up the Australian Research Grants Committee, otherwise known as the Robertson Committee, to do this very thing. So some of the steps suggested had already been taken. I do not say that the Vernon Committee was original in advancing these ideas. A lot of people in industry, the universities, the Academy of Science and elsewhere have been submitting to the Government suggestions on these lines. Nevertheless, the Committee has made a good analysis of the research effort in this country and has made some good suggestions. My criticism of this section of the report is that I do not think it goes deeply enough into the subject, particularly in the light of my thoughts about the importance of research to the future development of Australia. I regret that the tables used by the Committee are out of date and that statistics, particularly for Australia, were not available. Over the years several of us have referred to this as being a field in which we need greater information. The comparisons made in table 16.1 of the report have been given too much emphasis, particularly in subsequent paragraphs. The Committee realised the ineffectiveness of comparing research efforts in various countries as related to the gross national product. It pointed that out itself. Indeed, the Committee devoted a fair amount of space to this point. In this context I refer to the John Joseph Fisher Lecture in Commerce in 1962, delivered by Bruce Williams at the University of Adelaide. Mr Williams saidIt is usually taken for granted that not keeping up with Britain and America is a sign of "" backwardness "", and that backwardness is bad. Tf we have a low position in the research league surely we should do something to get to the top! When a problem is posed in competitive terms it is not surprising that Australians should react in this way. It is however a mistake to treat research as a competitive game. It is misleading to judge performance from our position in the "" research leagu-"" economies such as Sweden and Switzerland. Some",38,Australian Economy

Research and tennis are different. The relation of research to growth is in fact a very comblems that we face in development, the cost plex one, particularly where, as in Australia, foreign companies dominate certain industries. I should like to enlarge on this matter, because honourable members opposite have spent many hours denigrating the Government's research effort. Indeed, the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), in an earlier debate, referred to this particular aspect of the Vernon Committee's report. 1 have dealt, on another occasion, with his transposition of the columns of table 16.1, and the errors that he made then. He said then, and he has continued to say, that the 0.6 per cent, that is referred to in the table in question is indicative of the low research effort in this country. I cannol agree with that statement, because I cannot accept this comparison of research and development expenditures as proportions of gross national product. I remind honourable members of what Mr Williams said in his lecture-that we cannot compete on the basis of a research league. The United Kingdom and the United States of America have high industrial development. We, on the other hand, are a developing country. We are dependent basically upon agricultural products, we are opening up new areas, and we are developing new resources such as minerals. As a percentage, the defence vote in the 50 per cent. To compare our effort., in other countries is far larger than ours. If education in this way with those of some we remove from the figures that are shown other countries is, 1 submit, invalid, and, in table 16.1 the defence research effort of if I may say so, dishonest. the United States and thc United Kingdom, we find that the United Kingdom, instead of expending 2.4 per cent, of its gross is happening in science and research in national product on research, is expending Australia. Of course, agriculture is the field only 1.4 per cent. Similarly, the United in which the greatest effort has been made. States figure would come back to 1.3 per I am grateful to the honourable member for cent, and ours would come back to .45 per Canning for quoting that section of the cent. That narrows the gap. We must also Vernon Committee's report in which the take into account the fact that our industries Committee says that insofar as comparisons and our companies are smaller and are less are valid, our effort in primary industry able to afford laboratories. They must puras it relates to the national economy comchase their knowledge. I have agreed in the pares favourably with that of the United past with their doing this, but I do think States. The Commonwealth has a proud the time is coming when we must try to record in thefieldsof research and science. alter this policy. If we added the sum of I do not need to speak about the work of £50 million which Sir Frederick White has the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial estimated as being spent on royalties-ad Research Organisation; it is well known. mittedly, the United States and the United The Department of Supply has working for tional i per cent of our gross national product would have to be included. If we then added, because of the very real proof oil surveys, which are a form of research, the cost of mineral surveys and, the cost of land resources surveys, we would find that our research effort is comparable with that of many larger and better developed countries. Similarly honourable members opposite delight in comparing our effort in the field of education with education in Turkey, Spain and Greece, but on checking the information on which they base their arguments you find that it is derived from figures in the Martin Committee's report which were prepared in 1959. Such comparisons pay no regard to the standard of living in those other countries or to the literacy of their populations. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) used 1959 figures when he referred to education at a meeting at Broadmeadows in Victoria a few weeks ago, if he was reported correctly. Let us see what has happened in Australia in education. I will cite some figures for the largest State. In 1959 New South Wales spent £57,609,000 on education. This year the New South Wales Government has budgeted to spend £130 million on education -mor e than twice as much as it spent in 1959. But in the period since 1959 our gross national product has risen by only These matters raise the question of what it a large body of eminent scientists who ere doing first class work. To be aware of the quality of their work one has to think only of the two new weapons systems developed by Australian scientists and accepted by the other western countries. The large and effective contributions to science of the Department of Health are well known. Great work is being done by the Department of National Development through the Bureau of Mineral Resources, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the Joint Coal Board, the Fuel Branch, the Forestry and Timber Bureau, the National Materials Handling Bureau and the Australian Water Resources Council. All of these bodies use funds for the development of new ideas and techniques. Within the Department of Primary Industry the application of funds to research is playing an important part in the development of the wool, wheat, tobacco, dairying, meat and barley industries. Finance for research into these industries comes not only from government sources but also from the industries themselves. The Postmaster-General's Department also is involved in research work and the development of new communications systems. The State Governments are very active in the field of applied research, particularly in agriculture. I do not intend to deal in great detail with the work of universities, but with to curtail their activities but are able to conthe great growth of universities in recent years there has been a growth in basic research work carried out in this oountry. The weak link in research, so far as industries are concerned, is the fact that only the large industries can afford research laboimpediment is placed in the way of scientists ratories. However, in recent years Foundations have been developed which, together with private endowments, have enabled work to be done not only in the field of medical research but also for teaching and cultural purposes. As this work proceeds it will play a more important part in the cultural and scientific development of the community. Our record is one of which we as a country may be proud. It is not honest for honourable members opposite to say, as they have on many occasions, that the Government has no science policy and that we are lagging behind in our effort compared with other countries. We have some eminent scientists in this country. Valuable work is being done here. We number two or three Nobel Prize winners among our scientists. Unique work is going on. I have in mind the work on the heliograph and the interferometer at Narrabri. This is novel work unique not only in this country but in the world. These projects are being developed by Australian research workers and are beingfinancedby Australian and overseas interests. The development by the CSIRO. Division of Plant Industry, and by universities, of new grasses and clovers for tropical areas will have a tremendous effect on development in those areas. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) tells me that the introduction of these new grasses may result in a fivefold increase in beef production in northern Queensland. I know from first hand knowledge that the technique of controlling the breeding cycle of sheep, which was developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry at Sydney University, will have a profound effect on the wool industry. AH of these developments have taken place in Australia and we may be proud of them. As for the future, I believe that the continued growth of our universities will ensure that sufficient scientists, technicians and technologists come forward to service industry. We must take the long view and budget for research. We must see that organisations dependent on outside finance for their research programmes are not forced tinue them without interruption. I believe that even though the question of superannuation is receiving attention by the Government now, we must do something about developing a scheme so that no who may wish to transfer from; say, the CSIRO. to a university or to industry. We must enable them to make these moves with ease and without losing any superannuation benefits. The present situation is having a deleterious effect not only on the universities but on other research organisations as well. There is a great need to look at research in the minor industries, which are being neglected to a great extent in favour of the more wealthy and large industries. I have in mind industries such as the oyster industry, the citrus growing industry, the vegetable growing industry and the poultry industry. These industries are not able to raise large sums of money needed for research. They sbould be given support without having to form an industry scheme. I am pleased that the Government is considering schemes to increase the research effort of our secondary industries. This should lead to lower costs because of reduced royalty payments and, as a consequence, place us in a stronger exporting position and strengthen our overall economic situation. I believe that research is one of the key factors in our development. The Government has a record of which we all may be proud. Australia has been well served by the support which this Government has given to research and to science. We have been well served by our scientists. mittee say about those things? honourable member for Scullin had been in current level of 100,000 a year.

I want to give particular attention to the subject of immigration. But before I do, I would like to pay a tribute, as others have done, to the members of the Vernon Committee. I feel that not only the members of this House but the whole of the Australian nation is indebted to the Committee for the prodigious amount of time and effort that it has put into producing this remarkable piece of work. The"" Current Affairs Bulletin"" issued by the University of Sydney on 6th December, under the heading "" A Critical Look"" had this to say-and I quote it because it makes special reference to immigration, which is the particular topic in which I am interestedThere is not space here to subject all the assumptions and arguments of the model to critical examination. But it may be worth looking at a few that have been singled out by the report's critics. The committee lays much stress on the significance for economic policy of the change in the age structure of Australia's population from the 1950's to the 1960's. During the 1950's the number of young people entering the work force was abnormally low because of the dip in Australia's birthrate during the depressed thirties; we were fortunate in being able to fill the gap through a high rate of immigration. During the work force is being swollen by the products of the post-war "" baby boom"".

96,Mr Drury (Ryan) [2.54],"The 15thThe comment I want to make on this particular recommendation is that the phrase "" for the time being"" appears to refer to a preceeding section in which it is suggested that substantial increases in immigration targets should not be made now. It is suggested that it would be better to wait until the late 1960's or early 1970's, when the economy accustomed to large annual increases in the work force before raising the contribution of immigration to population growth still further. The concluding recommendation of the Committee appears to have been reached in an attempt to reconcile two separate sets of assumptions, one of which appears to be predominantly expansionist, and the other one might describe as predominantly conservative. I would like to say something, first of all, about what we might call the expansionist view, which is set out in the report. The expansionist view of the Committee recognises the role of immigration in these terms. . . between 1947 and 1961, about SO per cent, of the population increase was provided by immigrants and their children. . . . migration can be greatly influenced by government policy . . . the rate of natural increase is not so amenable to . . . government policy.

In 1961, there were more post1947 migrants employed in manufacturing than the total increase in manufacturing employment between those two years. It could be added that other benefits of migration mentioned in the various parts of the report-and this is not an exclusive listinclude the supply of fully trained workers, the mobility of migrant workers, the enlargement of the domestic market, incentive to investment, national security and a variety of intangible benefits. Dealing with the dependence oi' the economy on continuity of migration, the report said. . . the economy becomes geared to a steady immigration flow and sudden large variations could cause either shortages and inflationary pressures, or unemployment and excess capacity . . . The report places special emphasis on the fact that immigration targets should be changed only gradually. My comment on that section of the Committee's report is that this is the policy that will have become more is being pursued by the Government. We have had a run of very successful years in relation to our immigration programme. Our targets have to be flexible, but at the same time they must be realistic. Honourable members who have made a study of our immigration programme and progress, as announced by the Minister for Immigration from time to time, will have realised that in the last two or three years we have set our targets, not spectacularly higher, but steadily higher, and the benefit that we have reaped from those higher targets has been very satisfactory. In the last year, for example, over 100,000 migrants were the net result of the year's migration programme. The Government has very good reason to be very well satisfied. In a section of the report dealing with the filling of the population and occupational gaps, the report, very properly, places a lot of emphasis on the proportion of skilled workers in the migrant intake. The report, for example, saysMigrants have been drawn from age groups which have particularly strengthened the work force . . . the disproportion has been reduced in recent years, and the inflow has been probably included a higher proportion of skilled workers than the Australian born population. They plementary to those of the Australian born. Dealing with the supply of migrants, the Committee was apparently satisfied, from its inquiries and investigations, that Australia need not expect any serious failure in the supply of immigrants, at least in the next 10 years or so. With that I believe most of us would agree. As one who believes that the future grows out of the past and the present, I think that the impetus of our immigration programme over the last few years is such that there cannot conceivably be anything but a regular improvement in our net settler intake over the next few years. . . The view that I regard as the conservative view sets out the features of the immigration programme that the Committee regards as some of the less desirable features. I shall quote one paragraph of the report to illustrate the point. The Committee saidMigrants are not only consumers and producers; they are all users of capital. They require houses, standard working age-that is, 15 to 64 and they give rise to additional expenditure by governments on . . . public services and facilities. In addition, the workers among them need to be provided with factory space, tools, machines, etc. My comment is that the capital expenditure incurred to meet these needs is itself a stimulus to employment and helps to absorb migrant labour. Moreover, it has been readily argued that migrants generally do not compete with Australian born workers for existing jobs but gravitate towards or are attracted by new industries, development works and new mining ventures. I would like to make a fleeting reference to many passages, but, as time is moving against me, 1 must curtail my remarks. When dealing with the argument that migration intensifies economic fluctuations, the Committee saidDuring recessions, immigration may further increase unemployment; in a boom migrants' consumer spending and their indirect demand for capital equipment may worsen short-ages, drive up prices or aggravate balance of payments problems. The answer to this assertion is provided by the Committee in its report in another place. It saidHowever, these are short-term problems, and Australia's experience . . . leads to the conclusion that long-term immigration plans need not be changed drastically because of short-term difficulties. There follow some very interesting paragraphs relating to the immigration target recommended by thc Committee. After lengthy consideration of economic pros and cons, the Committee gave credit to the demographic merits of immigration in these wordsWe judge that at past rates of population increase the benefits of immigration have in total far outweighed the cost, especially in view of the complementary role played by immigration in shaping the age-structure of Australia's work force. Dealing then with rises in living standards and population increase, the Committee made some very interesting projections under three main headings. Having decided that future migration programmes should not be determined by economic considerations alone, the Committee went into the question of whether the appropriate yardstick is to be provided by the future size of, first, the total population or, secondly, the population of years-or , thirdly, the work force. I will not attempt to analyse this because time will not permit me to do so, but the Committee made a very interesting projection of figures up to the year 1975 for each of these three headings. The Committee said that within the limits set by the working age population, size and composition of the future work force will largely be determined by four main factors. They are, first, an extended period of education; secondly, additional supplies of female labour; thirdly, the trend towards tertiary industries; and, fourthly, the trend towards skills in secondary industries. IfI may be permitted just a few comments on these four factors, I would say that immigration plays a complementary role or has a compensating tendency in relation to each of these four factors, first, by providing young workers to replace those at school; secondly, by having a smaller proportion of females; thirdly, because in general, migrants do not enter tertiary industries until they have been in Australia for at least some years; and, fourthly, because skilled persons represent a higher percentage of the immigration increment to the work force than in the increment contributed by native born Australians. The essence of the conclusion of chapter 4 of the report was thisHowever, we do not suggest that the rate be reduced, though this might appear to be an easy solution. The risk seems worth taking. Conditions for emigration in many supplying countries are relatively favourable now and, if Australia does not take advantage of this opportunity, it may not be possible later to get the immigrants missed. The Vernon Committee deals with the capital requirements of immigration as if immigration had begun only on 1st July 1962, which is the starting point of its projections. However, migration being a continuous process, earlier generations of migrants by now have turned from users of capital into savers and are now providers of capital. Moreover, much of our industrial plant is not fully utilised; in many instances scarcity of labour has reduced operations to one shift although two or three shifts would probably be more economical. Since the war, generally, new industries and development have depended on migrant labour rather than has the intake of migrants had to wait for the establishment of new employment opportunities. Economic growth and rising standards of living, which were factors included in the Vernon Committee's terms of reference, by definition imply and in practice entail shortages of workers in certain industries which have to be manned by migrants. These industries include public transport, brickworks, abattoirs and postal deliveries. The prospect of heavy defence requirements in terms of service personnel and civilian workers in defence construction and engineering largely arose after the report was drafted and could not, therefore, have been taken into consideration by the Committee. Since 1962, which is the starting point of the projections, we have aheady experienced three years of a growing local work force and rising migration; yet there is still some pressure on our labour resources, particularly in the skilled sector. Population increase through migration has made possible production on a larger scale and therefore at a lower cost. This has helped to replace such imports as steel, motor vehicles and earth moving equipment and has also enabled us to be more competitive in overseas markets. Not only the birth rate but births in absolute numbers have been falling in Australia since 1962 and migration will need to provide an even greater share if population growth in this country is to be maintained over the years that lie ahead. I join in the tribute that has been paid to the members of the Vernon Committee who compiled the report that we are now debating. The report is the result of the endeavours over a long period of men who are leaders in their own fields. Much of the report, of course, was out of date by the time it wasfinished,but this is always one of the disadvantages of a report of this complexity which requires a large volume of data for its compilation. I intend to devote most of my time to chapter 10, which deals with the availability of credit. To some extent, the report deals with planning. It is often a little difficult to determine where planning ends and control begins. I , for one, do not think control other than to a very limited and wise extent is desirable. I. would like to draw the attention of the House to the matter of rural finance, 1 am reluctant to say this but it is quite remarkable as one moves around Australia to find that a large number of people have no conception whatever of what happens in rural areas. That statement is rather drastic but it is completely true. The spotlight has been put on rural finance now because the rural community is in the midst of one of the most disastrous dry periods which have ever been known in the history of Australia. In fact, if this dry spell should continue, it will follow what is the driest first year of a drought on record. People in quite high offices have told me that they cannot understand why people in rural industries should be in need now of liberal credit because these people have had 16 good years in which to put aside substantial reserves. This view, of course, is based on uninformed thinking. First, we have not had 16 good years. In Queensland and New South Wales there have been what I term several intermittent dry periods. These dry periods have had serious consequences. Secondly, as far as rural finance is concerned, after the wool boom in 1950 the cost structure rose to a very high plane and has remained there. This cost structure is a serious impediment to the establishment by people in rural industry of sufficient reserves to tide them over a dry period. Several other factors are involved. There is the turn around in land. The person who owned a holding a few years ago may not have possession of the land today. People have bought into other land. Another big factor in the continuance of the solidity of the financial position of family properties in particular is the matter of probate. I have mentioned before that probate is something that has destroyed the interests of quite a number of our prominent rural families in Australia. It is interesting to note in this respect that what have been two of the greatest names in the merino sheep industry are almost out of that industry today.

99,Mr Armstrong,"Yes, it is an infor all members of this House, and partiinterests of people in the rural industry on an even keel. Mention was made by the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hallett) and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr the reward for the risk it takes and for Bridges-MaxweU) of the advances in science in this field. It is true that half the expenditure by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation on science is in connection with primary industry. But we come to another problem in this regard, although I am happy to say that it is being overcome. I believe that we are to give some assistance to the States shortly in connection with extension services. Science has made great advances and so has technology in enabling people on the land to increase production. But none of these advances is of any value unless the producer who is the recipient of this knowledge has the finance with which to put this knowledge into enect. This has been a tremendously limiting factor. There is another reason why people engaged in rural industry have not big reserves. In recent years, we have seen the period of the greatest expansion in our history of our sheep and cattle numbers. Since the dry times of the 1950's, our sheep numbers have risen from 105 miUion to 165 million in the course of a decade. This increase has been achieved predominantly by good seasonal conditions. But it has been achieved through the benefits of science also. It is quite impossible for people -withi n reasonable limits at any rate-to put aside large reserves to take advantage of these great advances in science when they have also to spend large sums on their properties. I should like to speak on overseas investment, which was referred to in the Vernon not need capital, know how or equipment. report.

We have established ourselves, form more partnerships whereby them. We have acquired the know how Australian capital can be given a greater necessary to continue them and it is very opportunity for investment. It is fair to say doubtful, to my mind, whether it is an that in a great many fields Australians are advantage for overseas capital to take not interested in investing their money. certain fields, where the risk is great, it is proper that overseas capital should get the knowledge it brings into the country; but it is also fair to say that Australians are a little self conscious about the amount of capital they have to invest and the knowledge they have. In this connection I mention the steel, glass, paper and sugar industries. Those industries have been established without any assistance from overseas capital. We have obtained a lot of knowledge and benefit from organisations that have brought in money and know how from overseas, but we would obtain more lasting benefit in the technical and scientific world from industries which we ourselves established. There is a point of balance in this matter which is not easy to' determine. The Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) in his statement to the House said that 90 per cent, of investment in Australia is from our own savings and 10 per cent, is from overseas capital. That, of course, is quite correct; but there are two sides to the question. If we require only 10 per cent, of overseas capital for some of our investment that would seem to imply that there are a lot of savings on which we could draw. One of the sources, which has been instanced of recent years, is the life assurance field. Life assurance societies are anxious to diversify their investments and have invested in mining and pastoral industries, and would. I am assured by one of the biggest societies, be prepared to expand their investments into other fields. It would be absurd to suggest that we do them over.

101,Mr Armstrong,"If it is true inaspect that concerns me as the aspect of control. The ideas 1 am putting forward are not revolutionary because almost every country has a limitation on foreign investment. This has been done in Japan and India. The United Kingdom itself would not allow the Rootes Group to be bought out. The British Treasury insisted that there be a predominance of British money invested in it. New Zealand, Canada, Holland, France and Brazil are other examples. Brazil is a notable instance, because that country has some of the richest iron ore fields in the world. A consortium of American companies took up leases to mine iron ore in Brazil only a year or so ago and the Brazilian Government-it would not be derogatory to say that by world standards the Brazilian Government would not be considered more stable than the Australian Government-insiste d that Brazilian interests should hold a 51 per cent, interest in iron ore production. That was readily acceded to. The same policy has been adopted in the Philippines, Pakistan and other countries.

102,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [3.33],"Afte rno doubt will be read and studied by economists, university students and other interested people outside this Parliament for many years to come. We on this side of the House believe that it deserves a much better fate than has befallen it at the hands of the Government. A sum of £149,000 is a lot of money, and it was unfair and unjust to the Committee to treat so summarily the work of two solid years. It is interesting to note that in criticising the report so high-handedly the then Prime Minister was at the same time criticising some of his top departmental officers. For instance, on the secretariat which prepared the basic research data and calculations for the Vernon Committee there were more -than 20 Commonwealth officers. The largest contingent-fiv e officers-cam e from the Prime Minister's Department. One of them had the second most senior position in the secretariat, being second only to the secretary himself, who was another very highly placed Commonwealth civil servant, with a distinguished academic background. In addition, the secretariat comprised three officers of the Commonwealth Treasury and two officers co-opted from the Reserve Bank. This is a formidable list of top line men. When the Prime Minister rubbished this report as he did that night he, in effect, rubbished those 20 men who worked so assiduously in the preparation of this most important document. The then Prime Minister decided to set Government on the basis of qualifications up the Committee in October 1962. Its rather than as the representatives of conception was due to the aftermath of the interested groups. 1961 economic recessions. The Government was jolted into doing something to offset the criticism which had been levelled at it. The Committee, therefore, was conceived as a gesture to the Government's numerous independent critics. It is interesting to note that the editorial in the "" Canberra Times"" of 22nd on its own initiative. It would also operate September last year said much the same as an important forum of consultation thing as I have just said. Under the heading between the Government and the private "" Sir Robert v.

The Government was immediately embarwith investment. It suggested that overseas rassed by it; hence the Government's summary dismissal of its findings and advice. I suggest that this will be the last report on the economy to be sought by this Government because it started something which turned on it, and the Government does not like anything to turn on it. That is what this Government did with the stubborn truth contained in the report about the state of the economy and the ways in which to improve the economy. It is so long since the report was before the Parliament that we need to remind ourselves of some of its contents. The report contains 1,500 pages, but it is only fair to have a quick look at some of the subjects it dealt with and some of the suggestions it contained. An interesting point is that the Committee's conclusions were based on a growth rate in the economy of 5 per cent, a year. To maintain a growth rate of 5 per cent, a year without excessive balance of payments problems or foreign domination, the Vernon Committee made certain recommendations. In the matter of planningwhich, as we all know, the Government hates-the Committee suggested that the Government should set up an advisory committee on economic growth. The then Prime Minister shied clear of that suggestion very quickly. The Committee went on to say that the proposed advisory committee should be a small body composed of a chairman, two executive members and not more than ten part time members, all selected by the The report stated also that although the proposed committee would be required to report on specific topics, it should be and able to undertake work That would be a very good move and we on this side of the House would support it. The report rejected the idea of should evolve policies directed at long term rates of growth for the economy as a whole The Committee then went on to deal investment in Australia should not go beyond £150 million a year unless there was some form of direction and control. I point out that during the last twelve months more than £250 million has come into Australia in foreign investment. This is £100 million above the limit suggested by the Vernon Committee at which some controls should be applied. The Committee went on to say that the formal approval which the Reserve Bank gives to non-sterling foreign investment should be extended to the sterling bloc to aid potential control of overseas investment. Takeovers of Australian enterprises by foreign companies should be approved by the Government-that is quite a revolutionary suggestion-and the Reserve Bank should maintain a register of all overseas investment. That is not done at present. tralia and suggested that these should be I believe that the Committee advanced two very good suggestions in relation to investment. It suggested that if potential overseas investment appears to be significantly beyond £150 million a year selective controls should be used. That is something else that the Government is not doing in relation to overseas investment in Australia. The Committee then went on to deal with money. It said that the Reserve Bank should acquire more control over non banking financial institutions, even if this requires and means of keeping the growth rate at further legislation. The Committee no doubt had in mind the fringe banking organisations in Australia which today are playing -uncontrolled . I point outa major role in the economy. Hire purchase companies would be one sector to which the Committee was referring. It believed that the Commonwealth should take steps to make fiscal policy more flexible to overcome deficiencies in monetary policies. It should also set up credit facilities for long term finance of capital goods exports. Migration is another matter to which the Committee turned its attention. It recomMinister? mended a target for net immigration of 100,000 a year. The search for oil was considered and the Committee decided that Minister, Sir Robert Menzies.

When dealing with minerals the Committee suggested that Goeconomics at the Australian National University, vernment mapping and geological surveys said the Vernon report compared favourably with should be stepped up and that rewards many should be given where exploration leads to discoveries which cannot be exploited It stated that Professor Arndt had spoken immediately. It suggested also the setting of the Prime Minister's violent attack on up of a special projects commission by the Federal Government, for development, to advise on new concessions and to help overcome a lack of co-ordination between State and Federal Governments. These are worthwhile, sensible and practical suggestions but everyone of them has been torpedoed by the Government. The Committee then dealt witb productivity and with primary and secondary industry. It stated that grants or loans should be given to high cost farmers to move out of the industry. Dairying is specifically mentioned in this context. Honourable members will remember that a committee which was set up a few years ago to inquire into the dairy industry found that there were 3,000 uneconomic dairy farms in Ausgradually eliminated by the present owners being bought out either by the Government pr by neighbours. The Vernon Committee, as I have indicated, also referred to uneconomic dairy farms. We on this side of the House do not agree with such a drastic solution to the problem. The Committee then went on to mention costs and savings. The matters to which I have referred were considered by the Vernon Committee when it was trying to find ways 5 per cent, a year without excessive balance of payments problems arising. The report is a most intricate one and has been prepared very carefully. I wish now to refer to comments on it by one or two men who ought to know something about it-'mor e than any of us know about it.

Members of the Country Party in this Parliament would agree with more of this report than would members of the Liberal Party. Here again we see the conflict of opinion between the two groups that make up this coalition Government. of opinion? will be resolved in time. We are very patient people. In the "" Canberra Times"" of 24th September, Peter Samuel made this interesting commentlf this report demonstrates anything, it is the need to get experts on to committees which are intended to provide expert advice. I am quite prepared to believe, though, that in this case the Government never really wanted advice in the first place, and that it simply wanted something launched so it could counter charges of complacency about the quality of its economic policymaking . . . The terms of reference of this Committee included almost every economic policy topic under the sun except those most closely related to this short-term problem. He also made this interesting pointWhat of the Advisory Council on Economic Growth which the Prime Mimster ""unhesitatingly rejected""? Here Sir Robert's argument is really feeble. He claimed that the establishment of the Council would involve handing over power to outside bodies and lavishly talked of a technocracy taking over from democracy. Now the report deliberately made the point that the Council should be advisory and provide purely economic advice. Yet the then Prime Minister claimed that thfc Advisory Council would take over the government of the country. That was i stupid and ridiculous criticism of what the Committee had in mind. Sir John Crawford cleared this matter up when he answered the Prime Minister. He had the courage to do that. He saidFar from favouring the idea of a technocratic society, the committee dismissed as undesirable the setting up of a formal planning body of the type operating in several countries. Nor did it favour the assignment of target growth rates to sectors of industry, although it considered industry needs some lead as to the general Tate of growth thought feasible by the Government. The committee fully realised thc final responsibility of Government in a democracy and had no wish to change the established relationship between government and the authorities set up by executive action or Parliament. The Government's disposal of the advisory council suggestion, however, did not dispose of the need for more independent, non-government economic analysis. 1 want to comment on that. 1 believe that a government can be too close to the economic problems of the day; in other words, it can be too introspective and too cluttered up with details, so that it cannot see the wood for the trees. That is inevitable in modern democratic government, when so many factors, trends, stresses and strains are, as it were, battering on the doors of the government's offices day after day. In my opinion there is a need for an objective approach to economic trends, strains and stresses by an independent, non-governmental economic committee which feeds its findings to the Government regularlymonthly, if you like. In this modern age of fast moving affairs and events, we need a committee looking at the economy free from frustrating attention to the day to day tasks of administration. That is the sort of committee that the Vernon Committee had in mind-no t a large one, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, but one equipped with men with qualifications in this field. I believe that such a committee would have a real job to do and could give the government a lot of advice-bu t not instructions-in relation to the strains and stresses of the economy by looking at it from a distance rather than in a close, day by day way, as a government is inclined to do.",50,Australian Economy

107,Mr Duthie,"We have a few, but theyMr Gates of the University of Sydney made some good comments on this report, too. He saidThe Vernon Committee was born of uneasiness at the hand-to-mouth nature of Australian economic policy. The minor disaster of 1960-61 and the subsequent slowness of recovery showed the need for intelligent anticipation and long-term guide lines . . . The Vernon Report. . . is notable for four things: Giving content to an otherwise platitudinous recitation of goals such as growth, rising living standards and economic stability; repetition. Looking ahead and trying to assess the kind of performance that we can reason-ably expect of the Australian economy; Studying in great detail what this expectaments for investment from overseas in tion implies for the economic variables which are subject to Government influence; Recommending that thc work of the committee should become a continuous exercise. He also saidPolicy decisions are the responsibility of the Government, but policy formation is ultimately a matter for the widest possible public discussion. He backed up the other men from whose statements I have quoted on the matter of the Advisory Council on Economic Growth. We members of the Opposition say that this report has been treated shamefully. It can be a guide to a government that really wants to give permanent answers to some of the great economic problems of our time. One of the great weaknesses of this country is the limitation of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament and Commonwealth Government under Ihe Constitution. When we get right down to bedrock, we find that many of the fine suggestions made by the Vernon Committee cannot be fully implemented because the Commonwealth has not the power to implement them. That is a tragedy in this modern age. owe a lot to the members of the Vernon Committee. They have gathered together a great mass of statistics and factual material and placed it in order. That is what appears in the second volume of their report. They have devoted a great deal of time and thought to the major economic issues that face Australia and have recorded their views in a very convenient form. That is in the first volume of their report. Whether or not we agree with all of their They make no very firm recommendations conclusions, 1 think every one of us would in this chapter. In fact, in the last section, agree that the report is of very great value. For a long time, I think, it will be a solid starting point for discussion on these major issues. This afternoon I want to speak about their chapter on overseas investment in Australia. This is chapter 11. In it they start by setting out the arguments for and against overseas investment from our point of view. These arguments are fairly well known, but I think they will stand brief As they see the position in sections 3 and 4 of this chapter, they place the arguAustralia as being three in number: First, that it brings new technologies and know how; secondly, that it supplements our domestic savings and so enables us to achieve a higher rate of capital investment and, in consequence, a higher rate of increase in productivity; and thirdly, that it relieves pressures on our balance of payments. As against that, they put two main arguments. First, they say it builds up an increasing liability for remittance of interest and dividends overseas, and this might become an embarrassment. Secondly, it increases the proportion of overseas ownership and, consequently, overseas control over important sectors of our economy. Having stated those arguments for and against, they pose the question: Are we relying loo heavily on overseas investment? They argue various issues and there are throughout this chapter a number of suggestions. They suggest the establishment of a register of foreign investment. 1 think most people would agree with this. It would be very useful to have it. It probably could be organised by using the foreign exchange control procedures. They are inclined to favour government regulation of takeovers. They suggest that Commonwealth and State promotion of overseas investment should be stopped. Finally, they say that possible risks in the future with our balance of payments should lead us to keep thc level of new capital inflow at a level not exceeding about £150 million a year. These may be regarded as suggestions.",51,Australian Economy

It is true, of course, that, against this, dividends are paid abroad from this industry and this has affected our balance of payments. Surely however, this is relatively insignificant beside the benefits which we have had. It is true that this industry is foreign owned to a large degree. The could stop the outflow of dividends immediately if we wanted to. There are risks Dealing with some of the arguments reason that they come to the conclusion we should keep our inflow of capital at the rate of about £150 million a year, so as not to produce that result. There are various criticisms of this. I would not want to develop them in detail this afternoon. They are dealt with very effectively in the supplement to the "" Treasury Information Bulletin"" entitled "" Australian Balance of Payments "", which was issued last month. The Committee's table involves a number held by companies in the United States of of assumptions. In the first place, the figures America. But there are also proportions of are produced by assuming that whenever foreign ownership of Australian industry in capital comes in and produces its profits, Canada, New Zealand and other countries. 50 per cent, of those profits will be ploughed It is almost ridiculous to suggest that all back. It is also assumed that they will these companies in various countries, or always be producing 8 per cent, profit.

Already the Committee's assumption about the probable increase in the rate of exports has proved to be an underestimate. The members of the Committee underestimated, cise foreign ownership we tend to speak as for instance, the amount that we would though there is a certain Australian industry receive during this period from exports of and foreign interests are coming to take iron ore. Contracts already in existence it over. This may be so in the case of takewhen considered in conjunction with proovers, but in the great majority of industries jected contracts, show, I suggest, that they the fact is that we would not have those have seriously underestimated this source industries here at all, if they were not foreign of export income. It would seem that we owned. Foreign capital has virtually created can use in this direction a far greater capital them in the first place. Often when we talk inflow than the Committee was prepared about the difficulties of foreign ownership, to recommend when it used this arithmetical we should talk about choosing between approach.

The second worry that the Committee we can exercise very considerable powers of bad about overseas capital concerned the control over foreign ownership.

Some reference was made to Canada and to the fact that United States interests have a very big share in Canadian industry, but one or two matters are worth noting in this regard. In the case of Australia, in contrast with Canada, the foreign ownership of our industries is by corporations in different countries. They are not all in one country. The largest proportion of foreign ownership of Australian industry is to be found in the United Kingdom, and the second largest proportion is There is a second matter that is worthy of attention. When we talk about and critiFinally, let me remind the House that like getting out of hand we can stop repatriation of dividends or capital. Indeed, Let me now deal with the suggestion that there should be at least 40 per cent, of Australian equity in enterprises carried out in this country. Some people say that we should insist on 40 per cent. Australian equity. The Vernon Committee considered this suggestion and recommended against it. It said that we should not insist on 40 per cent. Australian equity as a means of reducing the financial control exercised over Australian industries by overseas interests because, if we did so, we would be merely placing more Australian capital under foreign control. That capital could be under Australian control, could be employed elsewhere in the Australian economy, and should not be put under foreign control as a minority interest. In addition, of course, this overseas capion the other side. tal comes in very largely in connection with risk ventures, such as oil exploration and mineral ventures.

Australian industry is an absolute requirement and so producing undesirable results. We have the power to control and we are at present exercising it to provide for a free flow. We can keep an eye on the situation and we can alter our policy, if necessary, to deal with any risks arising from foreign ownership.

109,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [4.15],"I do notthis report was rubbished by the then Prime Minister and because reflections and aspersions were cast on the members of the Committee and certain of their findings. I think we should recall how the report was born, and also a few of the factors associated wilh ""the political approach of this Government to the great problems which were covered by the document. I believe the best summary of how the report originated is contained in the ""Current Affairs Bulletin"" of 6th December 1965, which saidThe Vernon Report had its origin in a decision by the Menzies Government announced by the Prime Minister on October 17, 1962, to appoint a Committee of Economic Inquiry. The decision to hold such an inquiry arose from the events of 1960-61; . . . Particularly in December 1961 when the Government was within 100 votes of defeat. . . that had followed the restrictive measures of November 1960; much public discontent with the so-called "" stop-go"" policies; the Government's near-defeat in the December, 1961, elections; uncertainty engendered by Britain's moves towards entry into the European Common Market, and thc somewhat slow progress of economic recovery during 1962. Two more specific factors precipitated and shaped the decision. One was a vocal and surprisingly widespread public demand for some form of national economic planning on the French model, or at least on the lines of the National Economic Development Council set up by the Conservative Macmillan Government in Britain. The other was an acute controversy over tariff policy that had just culminated in the resignation of the chairman of the Tariff Board. The Menzies Government was firmly opposed to long-term planning in any form; a once-for-all factfinding economic inquiry was as far as Jt was, reluctantly, prepared to go. In other words, the foundation of this report tion which controls abattoirs and cool stores was laid in a period of serious economic and has interests in sheep and cattle. There difficulty.

On this Committee were many notable citizens. I repeat their names in crder that the public may know them. The Chairman was Dr. Vernon, Managing Director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd., which has extensive interests in aspects of primary and secondary industrya first class Government choice, no doubt, of a man pledged to support a government like this economically and, maybe, politically. He is well known as a man of exceptional ability and judgment-so the Prime Minister said-wit h a fine record of public service. I agree with all these things. He is a notable man in the community, and Cabinet decided that the chairmanship should go to one who would probably be regarded as detached from any present or past formulation or execution of Governthe unusually severe economic recession ment economic policy. Then there was Sir John Crawford, known to everyone in this Parliament no doubt, and to most people in the country. The then Prime Minister said of himSir John Crawford's capacity to take a prominent part in this investigation is universally acknowledged by every section of productive industry and business generally, as well as in high academic circles. In addition, the then Prime Minister announced the appointment to the Committee of Professor Karmel of Adelaide who, as he said, is a distinguished academic economist of high repute in his own field. Another member of the Committee was Mr D. G. Molesworth, Chairman of F. J. Walker Ltd., a large meat packing organisaThe Government is grateful to these busy and men who have agreed to accept this additional capacity. Everyone would have been personally chosen by the Government not only for his ability but because of his support of the Government and the fact this his approach to problems was in line with the Government's thinking on economic matters. I give that background in order that honourable members will know that members of the Committee, personally selected by the then Prime Minister and the Government, were hand picked and were given special terms of reference. There could be no dispute as to their ability to carry out the inquiry. They no doubt believed in the policies and approach of the government of the day. There was also the fact that their report would be of great benefit to the country and one of which notice should be taken. After the Committee had laboured for some time, the report was presented to the Parliament by the then Prime Minister on 21st September, 1965. As I have said, the Committee was appointed because the Government was tottering on the brink of defeat in this Parliament, with a margin of only one vote. The appointment of the Committee was just a face saving proposal. The Government hoped it would be able to discard the report without comment when it was received and the Government had weathered the economic storms of that time. Let us see what this document cost to the Committee,fixesthe terms of reference produce. I do not know how many pages it and spends about £250,000 of the Auscontains, but it comprises two huge volumes tralian taxpayers' money on the inquiry, which I think weigh 11 lb.

I suppose one could say, conservatively, that this document cost-wit h all the inclusion of the expenses borne by the departments involved-muc h more than £250,000 to produce. I point out these facts to the House and the people in order to show that we are dealing with a document that is valuable not only in respect of the findings it contains, but also because it was produced at huge cost to the Australian taxpayer. Therefore, the reception which this document was given by the Government of the day should be criticised at this time. The document was produced in Parliament in September 1965 and, according to the reports of that time, the Government rejected the report. If honourable members care to study "" Hansard"" they will see that the then Prime Minister was very critical of the Committee'sfindingsand that he differed from them on a number of fundamental issues. A newspaper report at the time statedThe Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) last night tabled the report of the Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry in Parliament and announced that the Government had rejected the committee's principal recommendations.

He then proceeded to offer a number of specific criticisms or as he described them, ""observations which might be helpful"".

Before doing so, however, I point out Economic Council of Canada. None of those fhat the central attitude of the Government circumstances has applied to Australia. Only has been that it rejects the proposition for now has Canada, rather belatedly, got her a committee or an advisory council on unemployment below the level of 5 per cent, economic growth. This attitude has fallen of the work force. We in Australia have under rather strong and trenchant criticism not approached that situation since the from front bench members of the Opposi1930's. So if one looks at Canada and tion and even from the Deputy Leader of relates the proposition in the Vernon report the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), who, on this for an advisory council on economic growth occasion, happens to have agreed with to the Economic Council of Canada, one them. They suggest that we should set up finds that very little real comparison can in Australia a body similar to the Economic be made between the situations in the two Council of Canada. This proposition has countries. been advanced dme and time again, but nowhere do they analyse the circumstances under which the Economic Council of that have been made by the honourable Canada was set up. When one analyses these member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and circumstances, it is clear that they do not the honourable member for Melbourne Ports apply in Australia and to that extent one ( Mr Crean). The honourable member for has to reject the idea of an advisory council Yarra gave an interesting dissertation on or committee on economic growth. In the latest edition of a very valuable 1951 the problem was to get economic journal called ""Australian Economic growth at almost any cost. We had to get Papers, June-December 1965 "", Mr A. M. growth. From 1951 onwards, he said, the C.

I agree with post-war years. This is the sort of situation this. I would not disagree with it for one that gave rise to the need for the developmoment. But there are shortcomings in this ment of the Economic Council of Canada sort of suggestion. He then quoted Mr and the sort of thing we in Australia have Garner Ackerley, Chairman of the Council said we do not want to have. Mr Waterman of Economic Advisors to the President of the stated that in 1963 it was said in a criticism United States. Mr Ackerley has said that of the Canadian economy by Professor H. the problem is to get allocation of resources G. Johnson in ""The Canadian Quandary: within an economy which is going through Economic Problems and Policies ""First, I do not believe that "" growth "" has been We know that Mr Ackerley has promoted Canada's major problem: instead I believe that the this kind of solution to the problem of outstanding problem of the past five years has been economic growth in the United States. mass unemployment. Secondly, I believe that the Whether for reasons of justice or for reaproblem of mass unemployment has been seriously aggravated by perverse economic policies ineptly sons of pursuing economic growth at any pursued by the Canadian economic policy makers. Professor Johnson was able to write that very critical indeed. In the United States early in 1963. In concluding his analysis of they have mass unemployment. They have Canadian economic growth, in which he a situation of poverty in which nearly 10 F.l 198/66 -R -[6 ] quoted Professor Johnson, Mr Waterman statedIt is hardly surprising that by 1962 the Cabinet's nerve was entirely shattered: the extraordinarily perverse handling of the exchange crisis and subsequent events serve only to illustrate the general proposition that a country gets the government it deserves. I have given those quotations because they make clear the background to the circumstances that led to the setting up of the We come now to the general criticisms some of the strategies of economic growth. He made the point that between 1931 and economic growth. With all this we agree. cost, the problems of allocations of resources in the United States are per cent, of the population have unemployment or under employmentI am referring to the Negro problem. Any attempt to relieve poverty so as to develop a great society, even if the re-employed men are nothing else than work force additions to the economy, has to produce economic growth. So the problem of allocation of resources in the USA. is related very clearly to a level of poverty in that country. This is the central problem of American economic growth. Eliminate some of the poverty and you will have economic growth, even if you have no growth in productivity at all and even if you have no increase in the capital backing for each worker. But that is not the situation in Australia. Here we have something like 6 to 7 per cent, of our households at a poverty level. Quite apart from the injustice of that situation, which is very considerable, the major problem is that the reallocation of resources would not produce economic growth here in the same way as Chairman Ackerley says it would in the United States. So the honourable member for Yarra, in equating our position with that of the United States, has not, I suggest, properly understood the situation. My very good friend, the honourable membasically divides economic growth into two ber for Melbourne Ports, in his contribution sectors. There is the growth in the work made the veiled accusation, as he did in force and there is the growth in productivity his speech on the Budget last year, that the per worker. The Committee makes its proGovernment is devoted to a wage fund jections up to the year 1975 upon a growth theory of wages. His being able to talk of the work force of about 2.7 per cent, of a wage fund theory indicates that he per annum. It assumes that the rate of knows something about economic history, growth of productivity will be 2.3 per cent, but we are concerned with the present situaper annum. I may be slightly out in my tion. The argument that he hinted at in his recollection of those figures. The Committee speech last night and to which he referred does not assume that productivity will rise explicitly in former speeches is that wages and so it argues that with this situation we in Australia are low and that productivity can achieve a rate of growth of about 5 per worker has been rising very slowly in per cent, per annum between now and the Australia because there is insufficient capital middle 1970's. But of the 2.7 per cent, per backing per worker. The burden of his annum growth in the work force, which is submissions to the Victorian Industrial Relaobviously critical to the Committee's calcutions Forum late last year and on other lations, about 1.4 per cent, will be due to occasions was that the way out of this the natural population increase. dilemma is to increase wages. In his submission, if you increase wages productivity critical for these calculations because from increases and so on. I do not think it is logical at all to comdue to natural population increase will depare wages as a proportion of national incline quite sharply. I am referring to the come or national product and to say theresustained, the real and the chronic decrease fore one country is paying more wages than another or one country at different times geSt that this is the most chronic, persistent of its history has paid higher wages than another. If one wants to accept the theory which lies behind the contributions of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in this respect, and I respect him very highly, one then has to say that this Government has done more with respect to wages than previous Governments because wages have been a higher proportion of national income and net national income under the Menzies Government, and the Holt Government of some weeks, than it ever was under Labour governments. Therefore, one could argue that the increase in wages and productivity on account of this factor was as high as it could possibly be. I think the whole balance of reasoning here is fallacious. I should think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in his more sober momentsI do not say that with any disrespect-o r on reflection, might agree with that kind of proposition. The report of the Vernon Committee is a very large document and one has the suspicion that some honourable members have not completely read it. I know that the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Bowen) is very proud of the fact that he has read every chapter of the report. The report I mentioned that the year 1975 was 1976 the rate of growth of our work force ill L..C On. Lli lULw UL L f . w . . . .. . a u g and dangerous economic and social problem that Australia will have to face. By the late 1970's we will not have a 1.4 per cent, addiwith this problem. One would hope partion to our work force from natural factors; it will be down to 1.1 or 1.0 per cent, and from all accounts the rate will continue to fall. SoI suggest that the central problems that we will have to face are the need to keep a sustained and increased demand in the economy from a sustained increase, over the long term, of the work force and of a consuming force. Unless this problem is faced now, Australia will fall into serious trouble from the middle 1970's, and I know many honourable members on this side of the chamber intend to be still here on the Government benches in the middle 1970's. It is to be hoped that the Statistician, in assessing future increases in the work force, will not neglect these factors. The chronic problem which the United Kingdom has to face in trying to increase her rate of economic growth, which is nothing like ours, is the rate of growth of her work force, which is only about .4 per cent, per annum. The chronic problem which France faced for decades was a decrease in her work force and it was not until the work force started to increase in real terms that she began to have significantly higher rates of economic growth. I think we can benefit very clearly and in a very pertinent manner from the experiences of the older European nations in this respect. There are one or two other matters upon which the report has not commented. The Committee has not dealt with the problems of determining short run fluctuations in the Australian economy. Australia has a number of regional economies. In my own State of Queensland there are five distinct regional economies which have violent seasonal fluctuations. A levelling out of these seasonalfluctuationswould produce a real and sustained growth in the gross national product and in the Australian rate of growth. But the report does not deal at all with the problems of regional growth. It does not deal with the problems of cutting the bottom off short run declines in national product. I think honourable members realise that many more indicators will have to be constructed in order to deal with this situation. In the last pages of the report-as deficit for the year ending 30th June 1966 an addendum in a sense-the authors suggest a number of statistics that need to be gathered by the Statistician. Some will have to be gathered before we can deal ticularly that statistics relating to earnings drift in Australia will be compiled and evaluated without much delay. I regard them as extremely important. One aspect of the economy with which the report has not dealt is, of course, the welfare aspect. It is anything but a bread and circuses report on the Australian economy. It does not deal even with welfare economics. But any attempt to deal with welfare economics which would cause in the long run a real and sustained increase in the Australian work force from the critical middle 1970's onwards would make a greater contribution to our long term growth than any changed engineering of the resources which this report attempts to achieve. -There are one or two questions in the Vernon report which relate to major matters in the economy and which I think the House might note. I refer to the remarks that have been made in regard to savings and the inflow of foreign investment. I listened with great regard to the speech made a moment ago by my friend from Queensland, the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), and I felt that what he said about, for example, the changes in the work force has not yet sufficiently engaged the attention of the Government or of this House. I do not intend to traverse those matters. I commend the honourable member for what he said. I think he gave a most thoughtful and original analysis of some of the main factors. If we look at our balance of payments on current account we are struck by the immense deficits which now seem to be occuring. I shall citefiguresfrom the "" Treasury Information Bulletin"" of February 1966 on the balance of payments. For 1958 the deficit was $309 million; 1959 $385 miUion; 1960 $459 miUion; 1961 $737 million; 1962 $2 miUion; 1963 $476 million; 1964 $59 million; 1965 $784 million. It appears from preliminary figures that the will not be less than $1,000 million; it may even exceed that figure.",59,Australian Economy
111,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [4.54].,"These deficits have been made good by capital inflow, because of which our balances in London have been kept up. But can this continue and, in particular, can it continue in its present undesirable form? The figures produced by the Treasury in respect of capital inflow show that today practically none of it is accounted for by Government securities and fixed debentures. On page 53 of the Treasury White Paper thefiguresset out show that the governmental inflow for the period from 1949 to 1965 was $312 million, balanced by an outflow on other official transactions of $128 million and by an outflow on account of marketing authorities of $62 million. The net capital inflow on the debenture account for the 17 years period is only some $122 million, or roughly $7 million a year. It is virtually a negligible figure. Practically the whole burden has been carried by capital inflow for the purchase of equities;-the purchase of Australian real things. I think honourable members will agree with me that this is an undesirable state of affairs and that if we must have this capital, a great deal more of it should be coming in the form of fixed debentures, and a great deal less should be coming from sales of equities. The Treasury White Paper shows that in respect of annual property income, the invisible debits have risen from $90 million in 1949 to about $400 miUion in 1965. The increase continues, so that it wUl not be long from abroad in the form of capital inflow before the need to service foreign capital is in fact exceeding the capital inflow. This is the kind of debenture situation which all companies find dangerous and is one to which, perhaps, more attention might be given in our economy. I agree that while we continue to have what I think is an unforgivable deficit on current account because of excessive imports and the need, which we have now imposed on ourselves, to service a large amount of foreign capital, we are forced on any terms to obtain foreign capital in order to carry on. We are mendicants and suppliants for foreign capital until we can get rid of the deficit on current account. Because we are mendicants and suppliants, we have to sell our equities on the market at the best price available as forced sellers until we can bring our balance of payments on current account into better shape. I have read to the House some of the figures from 1958 onwards. They do not give us any cause for satisfaction or optimism for the future. If we study the figures, they may seem even worse than at first sight, because honourable members wUl recall that we are not as yet carrying our fair share of international defence commitments. We have to find more if we are to be safe and to continue to exist as a nation. Although it is true that we have been absorbing a considerable number of migrants, our rate of natural increase, as the honourable member for Lilley has told the House, has not been as great as it might have been. In a sense, an incoming migrant is a cheaper person to service in terms of capital equipment than is a child, because an incoming migrant does not require the same education and total maintenance as does a child while he is not yet ready to enter the work force. It seems that we must make a great effort to cut down our imports and substitute for them locally produced goods. I appreciate that there are difficulties. Some people say that it cannot be done, but that is what is said by every man when he is told by his bank manager that his overdraft should not increase any further. There are aU sorts of things which he cannot do without until finally he must do without them. There is need for a great substitution of local saving for the saving that we have been importing which has been purchasing our equities. As it has purchased our equities, it has made it much more difficult for us to maintain balance in the future. We are in the position of a firm whose commitments for what it has borrowed in the past seem now to be preventing any possibUity of its paying its way from current income. We have had certain windfaUs. There may be greater windfaUs, particularly in view of the discoveries of mineral treasures which we did not put in the ground but which we are very lucky to have in the ground that we own. These mineral resources may come to our rescue. If there is no disaster and if we can maintain our existence as an independent country, the growth of population in Asia will caU for considerably greater exports of foodstuffs and may give to our primary industries a bonanza greater than they are at present expecting. But with all this we have got to be taking a semi-compulsory basis, or perhaps on a measures, as the Vernon Committee very voluntary basis, financed by some kind of rightly says, to increase our local rate of special savings bond tailored to the special savings. It has been a failure of the Goneeds of the teenagers. vernment's financial policies to date that it has not faced up to this problem. It is not an easy problem to face up to; it is not a pleasant problem. In facing it, I think there investment in debentures by companies must be a certain loss of electoral which use their overseas credits, which are popularity. What are the measures which we can One example I think would be General take? In the first place, I think we must be Motors-Holden's Pty.

The man is an incorrigible optimist and the victim of his own propaganda. The whole of his speech, with due respect to the honourable gentleman, was an exercise in self deception. I will not weary the House by quoting excerpts from it but in to to it was merely a string of economic platitudes. It contained a marked degree of flippancy, of ineptness and of inefficiency. In substance and in form it typified the sloth and complacency of this Government. After all, we are in a new era. We are in the post Menzies era when new men of less stature have assumed the reins of government in this Commonwealth, and the crown is perhaps a little bit big for some of them and the shoes into which they have stepped are perhaps flopping around on their feet as well. It is quite certain that the former Prime Minister knew and deliberately timed with great precision the date of his retirement. He has left to this Government a very considerable legacy of economic trouble. The problems are very real. It is only a matter of a week ago, or a little longer, since there was a mass deputation from the various manufacturing interests, the various importing interests, the Chambers of Commerce, wool growers, master builders, retailers, the automotive industry, and the whole gamut of industrial and economic activity within Australia to the Prime Minister and his individual Ministers to state their case for, as it has now been aptly phrased, a little more gravy in the Australian economy. The warnings that we of the Opposition uttered at the time of the 1965 Budget are coming home to roost. That Budget was a soak the sinners budget. It was deliberately designed to reduce consumer expenditure and consumer demand, and it has had precisely that effect. Because of that effect we had the encouraging spectacle, from our point of view in political terms but one which we greatly regret in terms of the welfare of Australia and the living standards of its people, of a mass onslaught to this Government asking that it face up to its responsibilities and drop its sloth and its living in a world of make believe and get down to the stark economic realities of 1966. If ever there was a modern Micawber confidence he exudes and the confidence he expressed when he said that the interests of the nation are likely to be best served if the pattern of economic activity is able to adapt itself freely to the changing pattern of nadonal and economic demand. Micawber never did better than that. I should say that he has out Micawbered Micawber, and from this modern day Micawber all we can expect is a repetition of the near disaster that occurred in this country in 1960 and 1961. After all, we now have, shall we say, dual ministerial control. We have the former Treasurer who is now the Prime Minister and we have a Treasurer who is an economic hierophant and who, like the sorcerer's apprentice, has learned part of the trick of producing rabbits out of the hat but does not know how to stop producing them. Most of those rabbits seem to be like those bred in the economic crises of 1960 and 1961. After all, the Government is suffering from a reaction. It no longer has the national image of the former Prime Minister. It no longer has his prestige, his charisma or his mystique to shelter it from the wrath of the Australian people. We have taken with the retirement of the former Prime Minister a leap from the economics of 1960 to the realities of 1966, and this Government does not know how to handle them. Worse that that, it is saddled with the Vernon Committee's report which is round its neck like an albatross and which will be there until the Government's destruction at the forthcoming election. Two things will then destroy this Government. One is the economic effects of the drought and the other is the certainty ef the resentment of the Australian people of the Government's economic incompetence and its inability-it s utter stark incapacity-to plan in terms of Australia's best national interest. The Vernon plan is an economic hair shirt, if I may change the metaphor, that this Government, Treasurer and Prime Minister will wear until the next election. It will be there as a constant irritant. I should say that 80 per cent, of the Vernon Committee's report is acceptable fo the Opposition. Its suggestions seem reasonable, practical and make common sense, but the technique of the big smear was adopted when the report was tabled in the Parliament. Goebbels used precisely the same technique. It was aptly said this morning by a radio commentator that the former Prime Minister did not like the Vernon Committee's report and neither did the report like the Prime Minister. His reaction was a typical and obvious one. He was perhaps at the peak of his arrogance and petulance when he stigmatised the Committee. I remind honourable members of what he said when the report was tabled. He saidIt will, of course, at once appear to honourable members that, if the only problems in dealing with economic policy in a nation were purely technical, Parliament, which is not technical, and a Cabinet which is not technical might as well hand over to a group of technicians. In such a case democracy would have ceased and a technocracy would have begun. That smear, that sneer, is still there and the Government is stuck with it. Last night the Treasurer attempted to wriggle out from under it a little, but the hard fact is that this is an age of technocracy, an age of planning, an age of stark economic realism. But the Government is living in the past. It has had a big brother to protect it, but now it has nothing other than the pygmies who have come in his place. Let me deal in particular with one of the problems that has arisen and which this Government is utterly incapable of solving. I refer to the situation that has arisen within the Australian steel industry, which of course is of national importance and which has still a marked export potential. I should like to quote from a comment made by Sir Colin Syme, the Chairman of Directors of Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. as reported in the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" of 2nd March. The report statesThe Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. foresees difficulties in keeping all sections of its plants for the application of dumping duties under operating at capacity levels during the remainder of the year ending May 31. . . . It further statesRecalling the annual meeting last September, Sir Colin says that he told shareholders of indito make a reference to the Tariff Board. cations of an easing in demand for some types of steel. ""Since then and particularly during the last two months these indications have become quite marked."" Sir Colin went on to state the various factors that were responsible-the drought, a reduction in housing and a decline in automobile sales. He referred alsoI particularly stress this factor-to steel imports. The report statesSir Colin says that a further factor is that substantial steel imports in the form of rolled products and manufactured goods-suc h as motor cars-ar e coming into Australia. These goods are coming mainly from Japan, and the prices for rolled products must show a very low return to the overseas producer, he says. These imports, coupled with the effects of the severe drought, have affected the demand for products of our largest customer, John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd., and that company has consequently reduced its demand on us. In 1962, when BHP. had some surplus capacity, export markets were available, but the current situation is entirely different as many countries have surplus steel capacity and are putting heavy selling pressure on world markets. My comment relates particularly to the Japanese steel industry. The latest figures show that last year Japan had a total steel production of 44 million tons. Her internal consumption needs were 32 million tons, leaving an export surplus of approximately 12 million tons. Flat rolled steel products are coming into this country at dumping prices, but the Government cannot do anything about it. Certain types of steel produced in Australia are still able to compete on the export market. I refer to the bigger sections of steel-ingots , billets, blooms, rail and larger structural sections. But when the labour content is high, as in the end products like flat rolled steel-particularl y the flat sheet steel that is used in the automotive industry-the Japanese have a competitive advantage. That competitive advantage is enabling them to undercut the Australian product. For the first time in 30 years John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd. has had to make an application to the Tariff Board the relevant legislation. That application was made in December last, but up to date the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Anderson) has not decided whether I have sent telegrams to the Minister on the matter, but the replies I have received state that he has not yet been able to ascertain the selling price or the domestic production price in Japan and therefore has not been able to decide whether a dumping -duty could be applied. Because the Japanese depreciated their currency in 1949 they are able to sell at a competitive advantage which cannot be detected under the terms of the existing legislation. I shall have much more to say on that matter when, at a subsequent sitting of the House, I deal with the Prime Minister's statement. Air) [5.30] -The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) likened the Government to Micawber. At least members of the Government show a level of optimism in this place in contrast to the prophecy of doom that we always get from the Opposition. Nothing would please the Opposition more than a gradual decline in the state of the Australian economy. plainly so that we may understand him. always hopes that things will get worse. There are many advantages in being an optimist. This debate has ranged over a day and a half and is just about to end. Therefore, I though it might be useful at this stage to tie up a few of the loose ends. Thefirstthing that emerges from the debate is that in the report of the Vernon Committee there is a tremendous amount of useful information that will be used, not only by the Parliament, but by other groups in the nation in the years to come. I do not regard this report as by any means being an albatross around our neck. Collated in it is information that will be of 'tremendous importance to all who have the guiding of the economy in the years ahead. During the debate honourable members on both sides of the House have taken from the report passages which have seemed to them to bear upon their own particular theories. As the document consists of some thousands of pages it is not difficulttofind in it some comments that are useful in supporting one's point of view. Honourable members opposite selected passages that they liked to talk about, and the same thing has happened on this side of the House. That will go on for a long time. What bas been demonstrated is that the report is a collation of points of view and statistics that will be of importance to us F.1198/66 -R -fi ] all. None of us should be dogmatic about the report one way or the other. I propose to refer to some important parts of the report that I found to be interesting. I thought that the chapter which deals with minerals and the mining industry was important. Mining will be one of the important parts of the national effort in the years to come. Some very interesting facts about education were dealt with. I wondered just how much of that part of the report was the work of the whole Committee and how much was the effort of Professor Karmel, who has devoted a good deal of attention to this subject. I thought that quite a lot of this section of the report was reminiscent of other reports that he has published from time to time within the last few years. At least the information is summarised in this document. The importance of apprenticeship training was emphasised in three or four different sections of the report This is a subject of tremendous importance. We have not done nearly enough in Australia to improve the level of apprenticeship training and the general retraining for industry that is necessary in a changing and flexible economy. I thought that the chapter on research and development was too short and that more information could have been given about this very important sector of the economy. I thought that the chapter on the conciliation and arbitration machinery was important. It certainly illustrated the many problems that face the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and that are involved in the determination of the basic wage from year to year. Neither side of the House would agree with all of the conclusions in the report but I think the report is important because for thefirsttime the issues have been spelled out. From now on we can give more thought to the problems involved and to the ways in which they may be solved in the future. At least we know now that we can improve the present system. I do not say that I agree with the recommendations of the Committee but at least it has given us some guide lines that are worthy of investigation. All these things are important. The one thing on which we disagreeI am sure we will always disagree on thisis the Committee's final summing up,",64,Australian Economy

At a time in our history when we are able to attract migrants in large numbers;-abou t 150,000 a year-shoul d we refuse to accept them because we want to improve our standard of living at the expense of taking migrants? All of these things are important but we must take the long view. If we are able to get migrants now we should encourage them, even if it means limiting in some way our growth rate and the improvement of our living standards. It may happen that at some time in the future the flow of migrants will dry up. At such a stage other factors affecting our growth rate can be considered. I do not think that because the Committee fixed on the magical figure of 5 per cent, we should abide by it and put the rest of our economy into a strait jacket. This is what would be involved if the full recommendations of the Committee were adopted. Finally, a great deal of attention has been given to the subject of planning. I would like to comment on some useful remarks which were made by Mr John Brunner in a lecture which he delivered to the Marshall Society a few weeks ago dealing with British planning at the present time. I think that some of his comments are interesting. Amongst other things, he saidThc self-defeating character of published economic forecasts can also afflict more formalised predictions such as tbose of the Board of Trade's regular investment intentions survey. Iffirmslearn that capital expenditure is due to be cut back x per cent, next year, they may easily decide to reduce their own capital commitments more or increase them less than they had originally intended. The result may be that the actual fall turns out nearer 2x per cent. Therefore, there are dangers in too tight forecasting in a mixed economy, which exists both in the United Kingdom and Australia at the present time. Later on he saidEven if one accepts that for some reason yet to be vouchsafed every firm in the country does in fact accept the overall targets decreed both for the economy and for its particular industrial group, how is the individual company to interpret this intelligence for its own policy? The point here, of course, is that these targets have little meaning without some mechanism for allocating market shares, a problem which is very well illusquite right in pointing out to the nation the trated in the plan itself. F.l 198/66 -R -{8 ] It is, of course, precisely this tendency towards the promotion of comfortable restrictive practices for market sharing purposes that lends a certain attractiveness to target setting of this kind in the minds of some producers. It is also, of course, a good start along the road towards ossification of the industrial structure through the effective reduction of competition. I believe that in the mixed economy that we have in Australia there are many dangers in the sort of detailed planning thai has been advocated by the Opposition. This expert from the United Kingdom points out some of the things that happen in practice as against what should happen in theory, according to economists. I think it is useful to take the opportunity to look at what has happened to other people who have adopted some of these plans. In this way we can see the pitfalls before we embark on the course that has been suggested by some of the speakers in this debate. FinaUy, there was a recommendation in the Vernon Committee report for the establishment of an outside economic advisory body that should loftily pontificate from year to year on what is happening inside the economy and what should happen in the years to come. Surely the Government must accept this responsibility itself. As the should be for the Government to get together with all the important sectors of the community and receive advice from them. But having received the advice, surely it is the Government's job to decide on the policy to be adopted. We should not have a body outside the Government, with no responsibility for the consequences of its actions, being able to sit aside loftily and say to the Government: "" You are making mistakes "". This body would not have to accept any responsibility for the results of any action that might be taken as a result of the advice that it tenders. I believe that while we have a government, it is the government's job to carry out its responsibility, after listening to the advice that is given to it. That is why I think the Government has quite rightly rejected the main conclusions of the Vernon Committee's report.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Sitting suspended from 5.50 to 8 p.m. Ministerial Statement. External Affairs) -by leaveMr Speaker, before we start debating what we are doing or what we ought to do in Australian foreign policy let us face plainly the fact that there are two things we cannot do. We cannot change Australia's geographical situation and we cannot cancel out the great forces that are bringing massive changes in the world today and particularly in the southern half of Asia. We in Australia are living on the edge of a great upheaval both in human relations and in the ideas which innuence the conduct of mankind. We cannot withdraw from this region and we cannot do anything to prevent the upheaval. The Australian foreign policy, developed in this setting, must protect and advance Australian interests. This does not mean isolation, which would be equally foolish for us whether we chose it as a policy or whether we drifted into it through lack of care. We have to ally ourselves with others if an Australian policy is to have any effect. We need allies for the sake of our own security. We need allies so that the principles which we regard as vital shall prevail. We choose the principles on which our conduct is to rest and, having chosen them, we stand with those powers who will help maintain them. We examine the dangers to our own security and stand with those who will help us face those dangers. Then we must learn to be a good ally ourselves-to be ready to help as well as be helped. We do not want simply to stand in the shade of any nation. As a small, independent and resolute people we have chosen whom and what we will support and whom and what we will resist. We rely on others and trust they can rely on us. Our foreign policy is based on a proper whole of our foreign policy. I want now concern for the security of our own nation, to trace the application of this policy in on a belief that certain principles of international conduct must be observed in order to have fair and honourable dealings between nations and peoples and in order that peace may be achieved in the world, and on a belief that certain conditions will be more conducive to peaceful relations between nations and to co-operation for mutual benefit fhan other conditions. The danger to Australia's security is twofold. There is the danger of global war. If it occurs this will probably turn into a nuclear war in which the whole of mankind will suffer. That danger of global war is being averted by the diplomacy of power and, although not a great power ourselves, we have a part to play in the diplomacy of power. A more direct danger is presented to us by the active and belligerent fact of Asian Communist imperialism. This is being held in check by the resistance of the free countries of Asia, helped by nonAsian countries, including ourselves. For the sake of our own security we will continue to support the United States and its allies in maintaining the restraints of power against the two other great aggregations of power, while hoping that throughout the world success in containment of power will be followed in all cases by attempts to develop the conditions for co-existence. We will continue to support, both in the forum of the Uniled Nations and in all situations in which the organs of the United Nations have any capacity to act, the standards of international conduct set out in the Purposes and Principles of the Charter. We will continue to apply the same principles in all our other international dealings. We will continue to support the resistance of free countries to external aggression aimed at the overthrow of their independence and we will join in cooperative measures for the common security of the region in which we live. Recognising that security is only the beginning and not the end, we will continue to work with others for the economic and social advancement of the peoples of tbe less-developed countries. WhatI have said hitherto applies to the",70,Australian Economy
119,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,"Minister forAsia. We do not imagine for a moment that we or any other power can turn back history or cancel the changes taking place in Asia. We have carried out for many years past, both under my distinguished predecessors and in my own term of office, a policy that respects the neutrality of those who choose to be neutral and respects the sovereignty and independence of all Asian powers. I believe that this side of our policy has shown some considerable success. We value today the regard and respect of our Asian neighbours and their co-operation in various common enterprises. We want to see an Asia free from fear and insecurity in which tbe independent nations will be able to develop for themselves the kind of society and the forms of government that they believe are best suited to themselves, where human welfare can be advanced more rapidly, and where economic progress will strengthen the me :ns by which each country will be able to support its own independence. We want to see the conditions in which such free and prosperous nations will be able by their own decision to co-operate more fully in measures for common welfare and security. This means that it must be an Asia free from the domination of any single great power and safe from the persistent subversion of a communism which is being used de'iberately as an instrument of imperialist power. It is plain that a foreign policy of this kind requires Australia to know as much as it is humanly possible to know about the facts of Asia, to enter as closely as it is humanly possible to enter into friendly contact with the peoples of Asia and to study with a clear vision all the facts we gather and to maintain in friendliness all the associations we form. Our whole interest as Australians is in the advance of all the peoples of this region to a new and brighter future of freedom, independence and opportunity. What threatens this freedom and independence and what dims their hope for the future is the dread of domination by the new imperialism of China and the throttling grip of Communist aggressors. It is the Communists who have themselves announced their plans. Are these so-called liberation centre of conflict in Asia today-South fronts-the National Liberation Front of Vietnam. I submit first to the House and Vietnam, the Malaysian Liberation Front or the Thailand Liberation Front, all of whom have lodging and blessing in Pekingcreated to ensure that the peoples of Asia will be free to choose for themselves? Of course not. They have been formed and dedicated to the purpose of bringing these countries, without free choice, under Communist rule. Marshal Ky, Prime Minister of South Vietnam, spoke the plain truth when he spoke of the National Enslavement Front. The story favoured by the Communists gives a false picture of Asia today. We are not engaged in the rearguard struggle of a doomed colonialism. We are taking part in the establishment of conditions which allow independent nations to exist and prosper in Asia. Free Asia needs the reinforcement of the free world. It was essentially Western power, allied with the growth of South Korean strength, that successfully repelled Communist aggression in Korea-so successfully in fact that the Government of the Republic of Korea is today able to contribute substantial forces for the defence of South Vietnam. It was the British military presence in the Malaysia-Singapore area, with help from Australia and New Zealand, that helped Malaya to overcome the challenge of the Communist terrorists. It is this same military strength which is helping Malaysia to resist Indonesian confrontation, despite all the psychological and political devices used in the confrontation campaign to undermine the will of the Malaysian people. Britain's presence in the MalaysiaSingapore area continues to exercise its historic role in stabilising the area, and it is sanctioned by the consent and goodwill of the people of Malaysia and Singapore. Japan and the Philippines have freely negotiated defence treaties with the United States which recognize that their national security is linked to'the power of the United States. The central issue, common to all these situations, is that the freedom and independence that the nations of Asia have won with the end of the colonial era can be preserved and that they can choose their own future. I turn now to look at the most critical to the people of Australia that we cannot see that conflict clearly if we look only at Vietnam. This is not only a local struggle. It continues to harass the thoughts of compassionate people in all lands, and attempts to find a settlement fail because it is so much more than a local struggle. Behind Vietnam lies a wider conflict that extends from the northern frontiers of India to the dividing line in Korea; that engages the worldwide diplomacy of the Soviet Union no less than the worldwide diplomacy of the United States; and that casts the shadow of fear over millions of people in all lands of southern Asia no less than the shadow of terror over the villagers of the Mekong delta. This is a war that affects the fate of all countries of South East Asia a war that throws into sharp relief the aim of Communist China to dominate them by force. These are things seen most vividly and felt most painfully by the countries of the region. We do not imagine that a lasting arrangement can emerge in Asia which does not take account of what exists on the Chinese mainland. That is not the same thing as immediate recognition of Communist China or its admission to the United Nations. Those are simply parts of the whole question of China. What we are trying to do is to establish and make clear the conditions whereby China and the countries of the region can live peaceably side by side. One essential condition is that there should be no Chinese domination attempted by force or threat of force. We and other nations are standing up for that principle now in about the risk of global war arising in Asia Vietnam. It will take time-indeed , it may take or a fear of provoking those from whom a very long time-to reach an accommothe threat comes. The real risk lies not in dation with China. China itself must make the fear of provoking Communist aggressome response and make some movement sion: It lies in any failure to block it. The towards accommodation. Some persons, damage to the principles on which alone Australians and others, talk of recognition peace can be founded is done by neglecting and of United Nations membership solely them, not by applying them. in terms of action by us and countries that think like us. But China itself would have appearing more starkly as the months go to contribute something. Any acceptable by. As operations proceed and the attack accommodation will have to provide for the on the Vietcong uncovers more of the independence and security of China's neighenemy strength, the old fiction that this bours and must not involve abandonment was just a band of rural patriots fighting of Taiwan. Communist China is a big country in sors becomes more ridiculous than ever. As area and population. It has substantial underground headquarters, large dumps of forces, and a revolutionary policy both intersupplies and weapons, and the organisational nally and internationally. But we should not allow ourselves to be bemused into thinking that Peking has been uniformly infallible or successful. What is its record? It has brought together in certain respects the Soviet Union and the United States, by its clumsy and doctrinaire threatening of both. China has alienated a large part of the nonaligned world by its treacherous armed aggression against India and by its bullying tactics at Afro-Asian gatherings. It is not a record of success. It is a record of miscalculation and failure. If we hold on with courage to resist aggression while pursuing positive policies of political and economic development we shall win through. What we, who are on the fringe of the region, are also concerned about and what we hope that all nations in all continents will be concerned about is that events in Asia are also a threat to the peace of the world. They present today to the world the greatest risk of global war. Indeed, over thirty nations have seen this and are giving some support to South Vietnam in its struggle. Are they giving enough? If they see that their fate and their future are also involved in the present struggle, if they see that the aggression that has to be resisted and the principles of the United Nations Charter which have to be upheld in Asia today are the same as those that lie at the core of peace in every continent of the world, should they not do more? This struggle to save freedom in Asia is the struggle of the whole of the free world. Sometimes unfortunately any statement is translated only into a fear of escalation The character of the war in Vietnam is with weapons captured from their oppresstructure of the Vietcong are revealed, it becomes plainer than ever that this attack has been prepared in breadth and in depth and organised with professional skill over a period of years and that year by year more and more sophisticated weapons of foreign Communist manufacture have been fed into South Vietnam from the North. I saw myself in Saigon a few days before Christmas photographs of one of the wellprepared underground headquarters of the Vietcong and I have talked with Australian soldiers who cleared these redoubts. I saw in Saigon literally thousands of weapons captured from the Vietcong and alongside them other military and semi-military supplies from Communist China and Communist Europe. South Vietnam is not opposing a local band of dissident citizens but the deliberately created and well organised instrument of North Vietnamese aggression. In all, the Communists have at least 80,000 regular troops, some 120,000 guerillas and some 18,000 men in administrative and support troops. As more and more of the enemy are captured or defect, unit identifications and interrogations help to give increasing precision to our knowledge of enemy strength. The Vietcong have perhaps as many as fifteen regiments of their own which have been established and trained with the help of North Vietnamese cadres and increasingly armed on Chinese equipment. Among the Vietcong there is an ever growing proportion of men infiltrated from the North. In all, over 60,000 men have been infiltrated from the North since 1959. Included in this figure are 18,000 men in regular units of the North Vietnamese Army. There are now nine and probably more regiments of the North Vietnamese Army in South Vietnam. These regular units are being reinforced from other forces of the North Vietnamese Army illegally stationed in the eastern parts of Laos. We now have a much more realistic knowledge of the enemy as a result of the more intensive fighting, the greater difficulty war. They said so in plain and angry words. of concealment by North Vietnam and the knowledge progressively uncovered of the long preparations and planning of the other side. The challenge is being faced today with a better assessment of what it is and a clearer determination on how and where to meet it. There are now about 300,000 bombing of the North. The original decimen in the regular forces of South Vietnam, sion by the United States to begin bombing which is a significant increase in the past six months. There are now more than 215,000 American troops in Vietnam, supported by forces from Korea, Australia and New Zealand totalling some 20,000 men. As announced last Tuesday by the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt), the Australian Government has decided that the battalion now in South Vietnam will be replaced by a self-contained Australian task force under Australian command of some 4,500 men. The Philippines Congress is at present considering a proposal by the Philippines Government to despatch an engineering construction battalion supported by security forces. To make possible this buildup of strength, ports of entry and bases have been established and secured at points along the coastline of South Vietnam. The ocean approaches are securely controlled and the United States is also able to make a vast use of aircraft and helicopters, both from carriers and land bases. One other part of the character of the conflict is also being revealed more starkly than before. Up to date, as honourable members know from statements previously made in this House and by documents published, the enemy has not shown any interest in peaceful settlement by negotiation. Early this year further overtures were made. The bombing of North Vietnam was suspended for 37 days. Although an earlier pause in bombing last May had evoked no response from the enemy the United States was willing to try once again to demonstrate its readiness to end hostilities if it could see hope for a just solution by peaceful means. Governments of Communist countries and of non-aligned countries which might possess some influence in Peking and Hanoi were approached. Direct contact with the Hanoi regime was made in some capitals where the United States and North Vietnam were both represented. All these approaches were summarily rejected. Peking, Hanoi and the Vietcong prefer war. Let us face that plain fact. They prefer war. They have chosen They denounced American efforts for peace. It was under these circumstances that restrained bombing of the North was resumed. I should like to say something about the of North Vietnam early last year was not taken lightly. Indeed, so strong was the desire to avoid spreading hostilities and destruction that the decision to undertake bombing was delayed far beyond the time when, on military grounds, it became justified. The simple fact is that for some years the Vietcong-armed , supplied, and directed from North Vietnam-hav e been waging a campaign of terrorism and guerilla warfare in the South while the North was left untouched. The point was reached where we could no longer ask the people of South Vietnam to sit and take it and fight the Vietnamese Communists only at the places of the Iatter's choosing. The three objectives of bombing, as defined at the outset by Mr negotiate and not fight address all their McNamara, the United States Secretary of Defence, were first, to demonstrate to the South Vietnamese that they could depend upon American support; second, to reduce the flow of men and equipment from the North to the South and/or to increase the cost of that flow to the North Vietnamese; and third, to put political pressure on North Vietnam to halt their campaign of subversion in the South by demonstrating to them that they had no chance of success. Notwithstanding the limited purposes of the bombing, its suspension meant real sacrifices from a military standpoint. The evidence is clear that the North used the month-long lull to repair damaged infiltration routes and bridges, to send men and material to the South more freely and to recover from some of the losses that had -been inflicted on them in the South. The lull in the bombing was a liberal declaration of the sincerity of the search by the United States for negotiations for a peaceful settlement. They paid, and paid heavily, for their forbearance by the advantage the enemy took from the lull and the sad fact is that the pause failed to bring negotiations morale of those who live in the regionin sight. The Australian Government supported the eventual decision of the United States to resume the bombing. While on our side the search for peace will go on, the prospects are-le t us face it soberly-of a long and difficult struggle in Vietnam. The possibility of military victory has been denied to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese armies supporting them. They do not have the logistics or the fire power to defeat the South Vietnamese and their allies in open battle. They can no longer hope to bring about the disintegration of the forces opposing them by rapid attack and dispersal with light losses to themselves. They will try to wear us out. They will try to undermine our resolution. This has become a test of will. It is also a test of faith. In countries such as our own and the United States the questioning, the search for some way for peace, will go on. It is our pride as a free people that this questioning and the public debate can take place. But, while we debate, let none of us forget the central issues which are at stake. Some people who think that we should persuasions to the United States. In that quarter no persuasion is needed. The United States has demonstrated again and again its readiness to talk. The need is for some persuasion to be urged on Hanoi, which has hitherto shown a total unwillingness to talk, a total disregard of any overtures, and a clear preference to try to obtain its own ends by force and to unify Vietnam under Communist rule regardless of the wishes of the people of the South. On our side we have done what we can to bring Hanoi to the conference table. We would prefer to talk than to fight. But if we are to make real progress towards a peaceful solution, our policies for peace must be conducted with great care and realism and an unfalteringfirmnessof purpose. This has been the lesson in all the efforts to negotiate with the Communists in the successive post-war crises. We must avoid the risk that eagerness to find a peaceful solution may lead to adjustments in our own position which come perilously close to yielding ground that must not be yielded. We must also avoid the risk of raising doubts and adversely affecting the not simply in Vietnam-and the morale of those who have committed their lives and the future of their families to the successful outcome of the struggle. Many are in free countries which are even closer to the conflict than Australia and are now under direct pressure. My final word on this is to say that talking is not an objective in itself, but a means to an end. We have to be vigilant lest the idea of talk for its own sake leads us into traps and quicksands. What is the purpose of talking? Surely it is the same as the purpose of our present fighting; to stop the Vietcong from terrorizing the people, to enable the people of Vietnam to make a free choice of their future, and to prevent the Communist aggressor from taking over by force yet another country. Any reference to negotiations raises the question of whether the United Nations can play a useful role. Honourable members will be aware of the attempts made by the need to be stated repeatedly and firmly. Secretary-General, U Thant, to bring about It is all very well for the critics and the discussions, and they will also be aware doubters-wholl y sincere as I know many of the lack of response to his attempts. of them are-to plead for negotiations.

The Asian DevelopmentFOOD RELIEF FOR INDIA At this point I should mention one other important decision in the field of aid-the decision to make a special contribution to the value of SA8 million to India for the relief of what is expected to be a critical shortage of food in that country in 1966. This gift is additional to the contribution which Australia makes to the long term economic development of India from our regular annual aid appropriations. The Government has gladly made this emergency contribution, which follows a similar emergency contribution last year, and I am pleased that it is being supplemented so substantially by the voluntary efforts of Australian churches and private organisations. At the same time. I am bound to observe with both countries. that the responsibility for assisting the people of India in their hour of need must necessarily rest with the international comresolve all the practical and administrative munity as a whole.

Apart from special non-recurring contributions of this kind, Australia's regular aid programmes are continuing on a scale which is comparable to that of most other aid donors. As to their effectiveness, I would nor helpful for me to engage in comment say that it is my constant aim to improve our performance; in other words, to get full value in aid for the money that is so generously provided. During my recent visit to South East AsiaI saw in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam unmistakable evidence of the importance with which our aid is regarded and of the successful completion of several big projects, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances. I have been speaking about our relations with Asia through the medium of economic and technical aid and co-operation. But this is of course only one facet of our present day association with and interest in the activities of our neighbour countries. Let me turn now to two countries with which Australia has particularly close associations. The separation of Malaysia and Singapore has not led to any reduction in Australia's continuing assistance in their joint resistance to Indonesian confrontation or in collective defence planning generally. Despite our disappointment over the separation, Australia has continued to enjoy a close relationship The act of separation did not, in itself, pore on a number of matters, and other month's White Paper on defence, that In Indonesia the situation is in truth still so fluid that it would be neither prudent or speculation about it. It has been noteworthy that most countries, like Australia, have recognised that this is a domestic crisis. We have been circumspect in our comments on it, as have most other countries. The notable exception has been the Communist regime in Peking which, under considerable suspicion of involvement in the abortive coup of last September, has been aggressively outspoken and partisan about the whole situation ever since. Peking has used all its considerable resources of propaganda in seeking to influence openly the course of internal political developments within Indonesia. We in this country, and other countries of Asia and Africa which are observing these events, should take careful note of the light thrown on the conduct and motivation of Peking's external policies, including its readiness to interfere in the domestic policies of other governments. Unfortunately, in Indonesia the past few responsible Soviet role to other parts of months have also seen a continuing Asia and elsewhere in the world. Unfordeterioration of the economic situation, with tunately, differences between the Soviet and the erosion of capital assets, the running Western objectives are still acute. But in down of foreign exchange and accumulathe long term we hope that some kind of tion of debts, problems of credit and broad common purpose in keeping the stagnating production. There is, as I said peace of the world will emerge. in October last, a formidable task to be done in concentrating resources, both human and material, on domestic construction and development. The longer this is postponed, the harder the task will be. Let me turn for a few moments to India the newly independent countries.

I should like to make one observation on the side with regard to the Tashkent Agreement. The Ausualian Government acknowledges the responsible and constructive role played by the Soviet Union in bringing the two countries together in Russian territory. The Soviet Government has recently shown some awareness of the dangers of unrest in the sub-continent, and of the opportunities that this offers to Communist China to meddle and to pursue its expansionist aims. It is perhaps too much to hope for any early extension of a helpful and Of all the regions of the world it is the African con'.inent that has suffered most from feverish restlessness over the past few months.

The effect of these measures, we believe, is beginning to be felt and the Government has seen no need to deviate from its view that what is needed in this situation is not the use of force but firm and patient support of the British Government as it seeks to carry out its responsibilities.

At the outset I express the hope that strange reasons for refusing to grant this with the authority, support and indulgence reform. I refer to an answer given to me of the people of the Australian Capital by the former Prime Minister in February Territory I shall be the first member for 1959 when I suggested that the Government this Territory to exercise full voting rights. should take action to amend the Australian That, of course, remains to be seen; it is a Capital Territory Representation Act. The matter to be decided at the polling booth. Prime Minister showed solicitous concern The Opposition welcomes this measure because it achieves what the Opposition has sought to achieve on several occasions in this House. The first occasion was in 1959. The Government then was introducing some really wants to have a full vote for the Australian minor amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Representation Act. 1 think at that time-to the initial embarrassment of "" Hansard"" but quite correctly1 referred to them as piddling little amendments, and moving that all restrictions on the voting rights of the member should be removed from the Act. That amendment was quite thoroughly debated and was then voted Government numbers.

122,"Page 72), On Motion By Mr Anthony","Capital Territory. It seems it may expose his holding of the seat to some danger, but that is for him to determine. Well, if he held that view the Prime Minister protected my interests by refusing to agree to the amendment I sought. I gather that the present Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) has made a similar suggestion, perhaps not with solicitude but rather with glee, that if the seat is made a full voting seat the present incumbent may not be able to hold it. That, of course, is something for. the future and something for the people of the Australian Capital Territory to decide. Back in April 1959, when the former Minister for the Interior, now the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth), was moving some minor amendment to this Australian Capital Territory Representation Act, he gave some reasons why the Government could not agree to grant full voting rights. He saidIf it is merely a question of numbers, then the should look to an approximate equality in the member for the Australian Capital Territory is numerical size of electorates. I will deal with clearly not entitled to full voting rights at present. This was in 1959, when the enrolment was of according a vote to the representative of a much less than it is at present. The Minister civil service community my argument fell to the went on to sayThere are, of course, other difficulties in the way. in the Australian Capital Territory came up to The Australian Capital Territory has been created tbe average number in any electorate this Governby the Sates as part of the machinery of federation. ment would automatically grant full voting rights As a centre of administration it is largely financed to the member of the Australian Capital Territory. by the contributions of taxpayers all over Australia.

A glance at He went on the party numbers in this House should be a convincing reassurance to him on that score. Indeed service charged with the duty of being non-and I do not know whether the honourable mempartisan in the advice it gives to governments, ber can take this as a compliment or otherwiseat has been represented to me quite strongly that political problems, and yet having possibly a while the member for the Australian Capital Terridecided leaning towards one political party or tory has no vote in the House and therefore does another, where that civil service vote is identifiable. not directly influence the fate of a government, residents in the Australian Capital Territory make That is the only distinction in principle the best of both worlds by electing a representative between the civil servants in Melbourne, of the opposite political persuasion to that of the Sydney or somewhere else in Australia and government in office. At least, having used that quite specious argument, the Minister had the grace to former Minister for the Interior, now sayI concede that at times that kind of view demands some pretty accurate political forecasting. I mention that argument only to emphasis that this governshould be identified with a political party when, ment is not actuated by party politics or personaliin point of fact, the duty of the civil service is to ties in its present views. Another argument sometimes used to justify the withholding of full voting rights is the extent of which the Commonwealth Government is obliged, as part of its function of developing a national capital, to spend on the provision of amenities here large sums of money that are quite out of proportion to the taxation contributed by the electors resident in the Australian Capital Territory. I do not rely on that as a very powerful argument except to say that there is no ground for supposing, on the present expenditures on Canberra, that the citizens are not receiving a very fair share of government consideration. I mention this to show that the Government has not always relied entirely on the question of numbers-that it has not always based its opposition to this electoral reform on the numbers enrolled in this electorate. In that same debate, in reply to my amendment seeking the removal of all restrictions on the voting rights of the member, the then Minister for the Interior saidTo my mind it is entirely reasonable that we that point. It was also suggested that because I had introduced into the discussion the question ground on the numerical question. At no time in the debate have I said that when the numbers of a vote. Where civil servants are spread as a It becomes rather interesting to find the civil charged with being impartial in its approach to the conglomeration of civil servants in Canberra. I am quoting the words of the Minister for Shipping and Transport. He went on to sayIs it desirable that the civil service vote, as such, give impartial advice to the government of the day? perhaps worthwhile just to glance back on It is quite true that there is a distinction which the history of this matter, because it is quite can be drawn. A civil servant may hold definite political views and yet, in the line of duty, still clear that members of the present Governgive impartial advice to those carrying out the government. I believe many do, but in the public mind I think confusion would be created and the doubt would be there. I have said on previous occasions-and I say again that I think that was a very poor argument for the Minister to use at that time. I hope and believe that the present Minister will not use that form of argument, and indeed the fact that he has introduced this Bill and has, I believe, persuaded his Prime Minister and Cabinet to agree to its introduction, reveals that he will not adopt that line of thinking. But it needs to be recorded that that was the argument used by a previous Minister for the Interior in refusing to grant full voting rights to the member for the Australian Capital Territory, thus denying lull representation in the Parliament to the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory. As I have said, the Government requires members of the civil service to hold political views. In fact, it compels them to express political views in compelling them to vote. The compulsion to vote quite clearly pre-supposes that the civil servant who goes to the polls must hold and must express political views when he casts his vote for the candidate of one party or another. SoI believe that the argument put forward by the former Minister was completely without substance, in that it denied to a whole community the right of full representation in the Parliament. We have had recent experience in this Parliament of the attitude of this Government to a civil servant who chose the express certain political opinions and to hold to a certain political belief. I refer to the recently elected member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson), who was a very senior public servant when he announced his intention to contest that seat as the candidate ol the Australian Labour Party. What the former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, had to say on that occasion is fresh within the memory of many members of this House. I would say that the people of this Territory particularly and the people of Australia as a whole should remember these things, because those are the views expressed by leading members of the Government parties on their attitude towards members of the Public Service. It is ment parties have not always based their argument against full voting rights for the member for the Australian Capital Territory on the question of numbers. The Australian Capital Territory Representation Act was passed through this Parliament by the Chifley Labour Government in 1948. That was the Act designed to give the first representation in the Parliament to the people of the Australian Capital Territory and it included the provision that the member for the Australian Capital Territory might vote only on a motion to disallow an ordinance. In this the Government was following the pattern of legislation already in force in the Northern Territory to grant representation there. It was held-and I think quite rightly-that at that time, when the electorate numbered between 11,000 and 12,000 voters, you could not have given a member representing that number representation equal to that of members representing electorates then averaging 50,000 or 60,000 electors. But the non-Labour parties of that day assailed the Government on its provision. Of course it is the duty of an Opposition to oppose, but they assailed the Government for not granting full voting rights to the member for the Australian Capital Territory. They protested that the Government should have given him full voting rights even though the enrolment was then only 11,000 or 12,000. opposition. Mr J. R. FRASER -They were kept honest in opposition. The trouble was that they were not kept in opposition long enough. They might have been more honest today if they had been. On 11 th November 1948 a former member for Henty, Mr Jo Gullett, who later resigned from politicsI think he got heartily fed up with the conditions in the party to which he belonged, he gave politics away and became a farmer in the Australian Capital Territory and is now our Ambassador in Greece-speakin g to the debate on the original Australian Capital Territory Representation Act, saidIt is just as well to remind ourselves that the people of Canberra will still be classed with lunatics, criminals, children, aborigines and, of course, aliens; as people without an effective voice in the",81,Australian Capital Territory Would Have Had Exactly The Effect Of The Representation Bill 1966
123,Mr Daly,"They were very honest innational affairs of this country, and people withwhen there was an enrolment here of only out a say in their own process of self government. about 10,000, at the first election in 1949 That was the view expressed by Jo Gullett, who was a member of the Opposition in 1948 and who, of course, became Government Whip in the Menzies Government. But the description he gave, apart from the minor amendment now made to grant voting rights to Aborigines, could still be held to reflect the opinion of the present Government so far as residents of the Northern Territory are concerned. The amendment now proposed will, as from the commencement of the next Parliament, remove the people of the Australian Capital Territory from that classification. But from now until, say, February of next year, they could be classed with lunatics, criminals, children and, of course, aliens. After February of next year that stigma will be removed from them, but it will remain with those who live in the Northern Territory and who elect a member to this Parliament. tives here they are highly intelligent voters. Mr J. R. FRASER I thank the honourable member for Grayndler very kindly on my behalf and on behalf of the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr sented in this House by members with full Nelson). It is perhaps worth recalling criticism expressed by a quite distinguished member of the Menzies Government, which then, of course, was in opposition. I am now speaking of the debate in 1948. The honourable member for Wentworth, Sir Eric Harrison, who became Vice-President of the Executive Council and later High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom, also criticised the provision of the Chifley Act of 1948 which denied full voting rights and said that the then Opposition parties, when they came into power, might find it necessary to amend that provision. The debates to which I have referred show how opinion has changed and how Government members who in those days felt that the member for the Australian Capital Territory should have full voting rights, have voted and spoken against a bill on the same subject. I do not propose to use anything like my full time in this debate, though I wish to place certain things on record. I think It is worth reminding the House that although this seat was created in 1948 when the late Dr. Nott was elected to this House as the first member for the Australian Capital Territory the enrolment was only about 11,800, as the Minister said yesterday. At the 1951 election when I was elected it was 12,774. By 1954 it had increased to just short of 15,000 and in 1955 it was 16,181. In 1958 the enrolment had crept up only to 20,563. It was not until the election in 1961 that the first substantial increase took place. In the three years between 1958 and 1961, the enrolment jumped from 20,563 to 28,698. In the following year it increased to 29,941. At the election in 1963, the enrolment was over 36,000. The presant figure is 43,726. This is still considerably short of the average of electoral enrolments in the 122 seats that return members with full voting rights in this House. In February, the average stood at 49,236. Although enrolment in the Australian Capital Territory is still some thousands short of the Australian average, it is worth putting on record again the fact that the present enrolment of 43,726 in this electorate is greater than the figure in 50 of the electorates reprevoting rights. Of those seats, 21 are in New South Wales, 14 in Victoria, 4 in Tasmania, 6 in Queensland, 4 in Western Australia and 1 in South Australia. So there are substantial reasons for the introduction of the Bill that the Government has now brought in. Just for the record, Mr Deputy Speaker, I point out that of the 50 electorates with an enrolment exceeded by that in the Australian Capital Territory, no fewer than 9 are represented by Ministers. It may have been of great help to our argument that the enrolment in the Territory is now some 3.000 greater than that in the seat of Higgins, which is held by the Prime Minister, and about 3,000 greater than that in Lowe, the seat held by the present Treasurer enrolment in my electorate.

FRASER -The enrolment here exceeds not only the enrolment in the seat held by the Leader of the Opposition but also that in the electorate represented by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean). I suppose there is a fairly even balance between seats represented by Government supporters and those held by Opposition members among the electorates whose enrolment is exceeded by the figure for this Territory. The full tally of electorates with an enrolment currently lower than that in the Australian Capital Territory is already 50, and officers of the Commonwealth Electoral Office have indicated to me that the enrolment here is rapidly overtaking that in a number of other seats. So. by the time this measure becomes effective, the enrolment in the Territory may exceed that in 60 or more electorates. By that time the enrolment in this seat may well be greater than the enrolment in at least half the electorates represented in' this House. "" It is obvious that an electorate of this size should no longer be denied full voting representation in the Parliament and I commend the Government on having introduced this measure. It is a great pity that the Administration bas not seen fit to introduce it with immediate effect, but I accept as a reasonable proposition the proclaiming of this amending measure on the day on which the Twenty-sixth Parliament assembles. spare time? This means that when the people of the Territory go to the polls later this year they will know that they will be voting to elect as their representative in this Parliament a member who will have full voting rights at least equal to those of all other members of this House. I should like to stress one point Mr Deputy Speaker, because some idle thoughts have been projected about this matter. The mere granting of full voting role of the member for the Australian Capital Territory, because this, after all, is monwealth electorate on the mainland comprises an area represented in the State Parliament, on the average, by two members. I think that in Tasmania there are probably five State members to every Commonwealth division. Mr J. R. FRASER -That is better still. In the average division on the mainland there are two State electorates. There are also a number of city, municipal or shire councils, as the case may be. But in the Australian Capital Territory, there is no government at the State level. There is no local council or Legislative Council. So the member for the Australian Capital Territory in any future Parliament, whoever he or she may be, under the existing system will have to represent the electorate not only at the Commonwealth level but also at the State and local council level. Further than that, because the Commonwealth is here landlord to everybody-becaus e it owns either the land or both the land and the house built on ita matter that normally is one between landlord and tenant here becomes a matter between the citizen and the Commonwealth. So the member for the Australian Capital Territory must act in that field as well. In addition, because the Commonwealth is, either directly through the Public Service or through other channels, employer to so many, what would normally be matters between employee and employer here become matters between the citizen and the Commonwealth. So the problems that arise in these fields also land on the table of the member who represents the Territory in this House.",84,Australian Capital Territory Would Have Had Exactly The Effect Of The Representation Bill 1966

129,Mr Stewart,"What does he do in hisMr J. R. FRASER I can assure you, Sir, that he does not play squash. I mention these matters, not necessarily to scare off any aspirants, but just to point out to them that if they come here with any hifalutin ideas that they will be able to study and speak on matters of national and international import, under present conditions they will have to think again, because their time will be so fully occupied with representation of the kind that 1 have mentioned as to make this impossible, just as it is impossible for me to become familiar with much of the legislation that comes before this House or, indeed, to become an expert in any particular field of legislation. This is one of the facts of life in this electorate. The job of representing this seat is a full time one and it has to be done at many levels. Mr J. R. FRASER -It is perhaps rewarding, but not sufficiently so. Under present conditions, as the member for the Australian Capital Territory is the only full time paid representative that the people of this Territory have, his time is fully occupied with the thousand and one matters which his constituents bring to him and which in other electorates would be dealt with by members of State Parliaments and of city, municipal or shire councils. As I have said, this is one of the facts of life in this electorate and I put it on record for the benefit of those who believe that the member for the Australian Capital Territory, now that he is to have full voting rights in this House, will be able to speak on all the great topics that come before this Parliament and that he will be able to make himself an expert on external affairs, repatriation benefits, social services and the like. He has, of course, to represent his electors on these matters. He has to represent them in all the fields of federal legislation, but in addition he has to represent them in fields in which normally they would be represented by members of a State Parliament and by a local council. That position will oe maintained until the Government sees the wisdom of creating within this Territory some form of local self government. This is one of the great needs of this and I hope that the Parliament shortly will Territory, and I believe that within the have the opportunity to amend the Northern electorate the opinion is growing in strength Territory Representation Act. Perhaps the that this reform should be undertaken and present incumbent will thus be persuaded that the people of the Territory should be given the right to govern themselves in their day to day affairs. Not only should they be given this right; they should also no longer be allowed to escape the responsibility of governing themselves. The Minister for the Interior who introduced the Bill has also committed himself on this matter of self government for the Australian Capital Territory. He has inquiries in hand to overcome the problems created by the division that must be made between what is properly national expenditure in the Territory and what can properly be said to be local expenditure to be borne by the residents of the Australian Capital Territory. But until this Territory is given some form of local self government, either through a Legislative Council or a Territory Council of some kind, the member for the A.C.T. in this Parliament must act for his constituents-and the population of this place now approaches 100,000. He must act for them in all the three categories I have described. In fact, because the member for the A.C.T. must bring their representations to this Parliament, this National Parliament itself is required to spend portion of its time dealing with matters which should more properly be dealt with by a Legislative Council or a local council. I. said once of a previous Minister for the Interior that I wished the previous Minister for Territories would bite him, because that Minister for Territories had established a Legislative Council for the Northern Territory and a Town Council for Darwin while the Minister for the Interior of that time was still refusing to introduce those reforms into the A.C.T. I hope the present Minister for the Interior will persuade the Government of the wisdom of taking this step as early as possible. In introducing the measure, the Minister made some reference to the Northern Territory and 1 have done so also in passing. I hope that the Minister will help to persuade the Government to remove all restrictions on the voting rights of the member for the Northern Territory.

Evidently the Government's ideas on these matters change, depending upon who holds a seat and what the numbers are in the Parliament Full voting rights are now to be given to the member for the A.C.T. I hope that it will not be another 10 years before the member for the Northern Territory is given the same right in this place. I suggest to the Minister that he tell us why he does not follow the policy of his Party and give a full vote to the member for the Northern Territory. Honourable members will recall that when we were debating a bill relating to the wool industry last year we were told that a grower with only 10 bales of wool would have a vote at a referendum, and that the principle of one vote one value was to be followed. That principle was not in line with Country Party policy. But now the Minister has a chance to come right into line with Country Party policy by giving the member for the Northern Territory a full voting right in this House. That would give justice to the people of the Territory. If the Minister will not accept that suggestion, I would recommend that the people of the Northern Territory continue to vote Labour, because only in that way will rhey get a member who will do for them what the member for the A.C.T. has been able to do for the people of that Territory, that is, force the Government to give a real voice in the Parliament to the man who represents them. I support the request made by tbe honourable member for the Northern Territory. I extend my personal congratulations to my colleague from the A.C.T., as I know do all of those who believe in democracy, on what is a magnificent occasion for him and also for the people of the A.C.T. This is an achievement that deserves the commendation of us all. for the Interior) [9.47] -in replyI listened tonight with great interest to the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser). I was not quite sure whether his remarks were a preview of his policy speech for the forthcoming election. No doubt the member for the Territory, whoever he may be in the future, will have to go to the people of Canberra with a very much broader policy than has been the case in the past. The honourable member tonight spoke for some considerable time. He seemed almost to be trying to say that we should not give a vote to the member for the Australian Capital Territory. He mentioned arguments that the Government had used over the years but did not mention the criterion which the Government has stuck to rigidly -that is, that this matter would not be considered until the electoral population of the Territory approximated the electoral quotas of the States. That has been the Government's view. The stage was reached when the Government again had to look at this question. It considered it and decided that the time had arrived when the people of the Australian Capital Territory should be given electoral rights which would enable the member for the Territory to have full voting rights in the Parliament. After listening to the honourable member for the A.C.T. speak of his difficulties in representing this area, I will pay him due credit. He does have heavy electoral commitments in that he has to do work normally performed in a municipal or State sphere. But he almost gave me the impression that the member for the Australian Capital Territory, whoever he may be, would be so busy on these matters that he would not be able to cast an informed and intelligent vote on national and international affairs. I hope the honourable member did not really intend that I should interpret his remarks in that way. However, he would almost allow me to think that perhaps we did the wrong thing in giving the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory full voting rights, because he is so preoccupied with his own local affairs. I turn now to answer a question asked by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson). The honourable member asked what form of representation the Government is considering should be given to the Northern Territory. I reiterate what I said in my second reading speech",88,Australian Capital Territory Would Have Had Exactly The Effect Of The Representation Bill 1966
133,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister-that the Government will re-examine the question of full voting rights for the honourable member for the Northern Territory only after the referendum has taken place next year. It is absolutely impossible for me to inform the House of what form of representation will be chosen. The honourable member for the Northern Territory asked whether it would be representation both in this chamber and in the Senate. Such questions will have to be studied. It is a complex problem, and the decision will be taken only after the Government has given a great deal of consideration both to the principle of electoral quotas and to the possibility of representation both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.

134,Mr Adermann (Fisher,"Minister forfor in the provisional agenda for the Conference. In a debate in which many forthright speeches were made, strong demands were made, particularly by African delegates, for the use of force, but these were with equal emphasis resisted by United Kingdom and other delegates. The Conference, on this occasion, was extended to cover twelve sessions which were held on seven days and its discussions ranged over an agenda of subjects of vital interest to all Commonwealth countries. The report which I have just presented deals broadly with the Conference discussions. The full text of the speeches delivered ing the large number of interesting and should be available shortly from the General Council Office of the Association and I would commend its persual to honourable members. The report of the delegation also deals with the meetings of the General Council and the General Meeting of the Association at which two important matters were submitted on behalf of our own Branch. Honourable members will recall that, at the 1964 meetings in Kingston, Jamaica, preliminary consideration was given to proposals submitted by our delegation for an increased scale of parliamentary visits. These proposals were again submitted at the Wellington meetings and were, on resolution, agreed to in principle and referred to the Secretary-General for development in consultation with all branches. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has a very special role to play in the preservation and development of relations between Commonwealth countries and there is, I think, a growing realisation of the importance of inter-parliamentary visits in the furtherance of this role. The acceptance of the branch proposals was, therefore, gratifying and we confidently look forward to their successful development in the future. The second major proposal put forward by the Branch related to the administrative functioning of the General Council. With the rapid increase in the number of main branches, the Council has become a most unwieldly body for management purposes. We have therefore proposed, in a preliminary way, the formation of a sub-committee of top level councillors to manage Association affairs between conferences. This suggestion from Australia was well received and its submission in positive form at the meetings this year could well be acceptable. All honourable members appreciate, I am sure, the important role which the Association can play in maintaining the links which bind together the various nations of the Commonwealth. The Australian Branch has, I think, taken an active and constructive part in the activities of the Association, a continuance of which will do much to preserve the ties which bind us within the Commonwealth. I personally valued very greatly the opportunity of participating in the Conference in Wellington and of meetdiverse personalities who attended. New Zealand, the host Branch, spared no effort to make our stay in that wonderful country an enjoyable one, and to that Branch we express our sincere gratitude. In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to my colleagues in the delegation and also to Mr Norman Parkes, who was its secretary. At all times my fellow delegates cooperated fully in the function of ably representing the Branch and participating in Conference discussions. [10.0] I should like to join with my leader, on this occasion the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), and other delegates at the conference from Australia in expressing a few thoughts about the actual conduct of the conference and some of the subject matter discussed. But I should like to preface my remarks by expressing my personal thanks-and I believe also those of the other delegates-to our leader on this occasion, the Minister for Primary Industry. I felt that we were an extremely happy party. I believe we did Australia credit, and while he could not say it himself, I feel we were extremely well led by the Minister for Primary Industry. I think it would be quite out of place to omit some expression of deep gratitude to the host branch, the New Zealand Branch, of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which was so ably assisted by the New Zealand Government in making arrangements for the care and welfare of the delegates, not only at the conference itself but also in the period prior to the conference when most extensive and interesting",90,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
135,Mr Mackinnon (Corangamite),"tours were arranged for the various del gations. I think the Minister for Primary Industry was a little conservative in his estimate of the numbers present. ActuallyI think there were about 150 altogether, with the various observers but, as the Minister said, this number had to be divided into seven different touring parties and tours were arranged which included quite extensive visits throughout both North and South Islands. We had an opportunity not only of partaking of the extraordinarily generous hospitality of the people of New Zealand but also of seeing many of their primary and secondary industries. Above all, we had the opportunity of enjoying the extraordinary attraction of the scenery of New Zealand. As I wrote in a recent letter to the Right Honourable Keith Holyoake, Prime Minister of New Zealand, if scenery was dollars and sterling credit, New Zealand would have no balance of payments problems. This is indeed a fact. New Zealand is one of the most lovely countries in the world. The delegates, especially those of us who were interested in primary industries, had the opportunity of seeing some of the most efficient farming taking place, particularly from the grazing angle, in the world. I think it is worth recording that there has been some criticism of the idea that was adopted on this occasion of having preliminary tours before the actual conference was held. It was felt that perhaps a little too much time was devoted to the tours, thus taking time out of the lives of a number of busy men from all over the world. I would like to express my view. These tours not only had immense value in bringing to our own knowledge the problems of the host country but they also gave us a unique opportunity of meeting on a social level many delegates whom we would never have had the same opportunity of meeting but for the tours. We had the opportunity of meeting them in circumstances in which we could discuss informally the points of policy, the points of national differences and the points that might arise in the subsequent discussions that took place at the conference. I think it is well to remember, too, that this conference proved a great success these discussions were on a completely under extremely difficult conditions. I am informal basis and, because of this, one sure the delegates who attended the concould rely on getting a reasonable expresference would agree with this. sion of view from a number of delegates who, perhaps, in the open forum of conference, might have been talking to their Press, wherever it came from or wherever they came from. I feel that this opportunity of getting around and meeting these people prior to the conference itself had very great value in some ways-in enabling us to get to know each other better than in the actual period during which what was being said was being taken down and being published throughout the world. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, will realise the importance of this matter because it has been raised recently in connection with the Prime Ministers"" Conference which normally takes place in London. Instead of preserving an atmosphere of privacy of discussion in camera, a number of the speeches made at the Prime Ministers' Conference were blazoned throughout countries of the Commonwealth of Nations before the speeches had been made. If we are to have a logical approach to the solution of differences it is essential that we should have confidence that our conversations and our expressions of thought are not being publicised outside the actual meeting place. I firmly believe that the touring which took place before the formal conference had tremendous value. It gave us a chance to interchange ideas and afforded a unique opportunity of getting to know each other and each other's problems on an unofficial level. This was extremely valuable. The Minister mentioned the difficulties facing us when the conference started. It is reasonable to say that no previous conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association assembled in a more difficult atmosphere or in more difficult circumstances. The situation was pregnant with possibilities of divergent racial and economic factors creating conditions that could lead to a clash between the various delegates, ft is true that due to the common sense of those conducting the conference, particularly the chairman, the Hon. Blair Tennant who has been a great leader in New Zealand for the Association, The question of Rhodesia was considered. A number of the African countries in particular, supported by the delegates from other countries including India and Pakistan, recommended that fhe United Kingdom should use force against the Smith administration. We came down firmly in the belief that one does not create a war where no war exists, and we opposed the recommendation. We also had before us the burning question of India and Pakistan with Kashmir as the subject for discussion. One hour was allowed for debate between the delegates of those two countries with no other country joining in. On the face of it this was one difficult situation that could have affected the general atmosphere of the conference. Over and above all else was the question of Vietnam. On the final day present with the observers at the conference was Senator Fullbright who, as some honourable members may know, has expressed strong views on the policy adopted by the United States in relation to Vietnam. I mention these matters to give other members of the Parliament some idea of the atmosphere in which the conference was held. I should like to conclude by referring as well as trying to attack the problems of to the tremendous assistance given to us by our parliamentary staff. This is not the the age, are attacking one another. first occasion on which I have had the opportunity of being blessed by the extraconference and to see the beautiful counordinary efficiency of the people who serve try of New Zealand from one end to the this Parliament, particularly when we are other.

I do not believe that you make for the peace of the world or make the world a better place to live in by creating more and smaller political entities. For that reason, not merely should the Commonwealth of Nations be preserved but its members should endeavour to get closer together and to understand better the problems that face each of them. There are people who, using the magic terms "" nationalism "" and "" independence "", seek to separate themselves at the least provocation. To do that, of course, does not improve the world. Even though in this age and generation more and smaller political entities are being created under the impetus of what is called nationalism and independence, the time will come when we will have to reverse the trend and those people who bave become separate will have to become united again so that they may attack the economic, social and other problems of the world in unison. They will have to attack those problems as a common force rather than as separate entities which, I was very pleased to be present at this of the nation of Australia that we were representing.",91,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association

It is equally true, however, that by this process we open the door to understandings-n o more, perhaps, but certainly no less. That is an extremely valuable contribution. The work that the Australian representatives have done and are doing, and the contributions they make to the formal and informal sides of the conferences, have, I think, built up throughout the world a very substantial measure of goodwill towards us. In the past all roads in the Commonwealth led to the United Kingdom, because the United Kingdom was the centre of what was the British Empire, then the British Commonwealth and then the Commonwealth of Nations. I think that Australia has done something in that respect, but 1 think it should do more. I do not mean that it should interfere with the old roads that lead to the centre of the Commonwealth, but that it sbould build new roads that lead to and from this country. I believe that if we can do that we will build up goodwill that will benefit both Australia and the Commonwealth. Question resolved in the affirmative. Aluminium-Newspape r Article. Motion (by Mr Fairbairn) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. I want to raise a few points in relation to the that on these flat prices there is a loss of production of primary aluminium at the £15 per ton on the primary aluminium smelters in this country. BeforeI do so, I that we have to sell overseas. Of course, must apologise to the Minister for National we must add freights to this. I have Development ( Mr Fairbairn). There is a estimated that we export somewhere form of courtesy in this House which between 15,000 and 20,000 tons of primary requires that before one rises to speak on aluminium a year. In addition, the Austhe adjournment debate one announces to tralian Aluminium Co. Ltd., known as the appropriate Minister the subject that Australuco, which is a totally owned subone intends to raise so that he may be able sidiary of Aluminium Ltd. of Canadato throw some light on the points raised or Alcan-in a tariff submission said that, give his point of view. ThisI neglected to in comparison with the price on the Ausdo, through an oversight. I turn to the question of the investment a ton. A little quick estimating reveals that that is taking place in this country today in losses in exports vary between £600.000 the production of primary aluminium. I and £800,000 or £750,000 and £1 million, think that what is taking place, having depending on whether the loss is taken at regard to the present capacity of this indus£40 a ton or £50 a ton. This is significant, try and its potential capacity, clearly shows and a little later I will elaborate on my the necessity for planning of the economy suspicion that the domestic consumer will of this country. It is, in itself, a clear exhibition of the way in which lopsided investment can take place in a sector of the economy. Of course, this is very much to the detriment oi the economy. I shall give some details to support my contention, but it seems to me that what could easily happen in the production of primary aluminium in this country is that one of the big three smelters which will be operating by about 1970 could fold up. These smelters have a capital investment which varies between £25 million and £30 million. Those are the figures lhat I have been able to obtain. At present we have two smelters producing primary aluminium in Australia. They are Alcoa of Australia Pty. Ltd., at Geelong, which has 51 per cent, foreign ownership, and Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd., at Bell Bay, which has more than 90 per cent, foreign ownership. The capacity of these two smelters is approximately 90,000 tons, which is one and a half times Australia's present consumption. In 1964 the production of primary aluminium in Australia was approximately 79,000 tons, and last year it rose to 86,000 tons. In 1964 the domestic consumption of primary aluminium was 64,000 tons. I have not got the figures for 1965. It is significant to note that the surplus has to be sold overseas. The home price for primary aluminium is £260 per ton and tralian market, selling on the world market involves a loss of between £40 and £50",94,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
139,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [10.22],"Tonight the world price is £245 per ton. That meansbe expected to prop up the surplus capacity of this industry, if it is to be sustained. The production at Bell Bay is 52.000 tons of primary aluminium a year. Alcoa produces 40,000 tons a year. Australuco, the totally owned subsidiary of Alcan, intends to establish at Newcastle a smelter that will be in operation by 1969 and will produce between 30,000 and 40,000 tons of primary aluminium a year. But by then we will be using only the full capacity that is now available in the existing two Comalco and Alcoa. I stress that even if we lift the home consumption of primary aluminium from 12 lb. a head to 18 lb. a head, the output of the Alcan smelter at Newcastle, or its equivalent, will be surplus to the community's needs. In recent times, some rapid manoeuvring has occurred in this industry. Alcoa made an application for tariff protection. It was supported by Comalco with some qualifications. Then Alcan made the sudden announcement that it would establish a smelter at Newcastle. In addition, Comalco announced in late December that it would spend another £4,500,000 to lift the production of its Bell Bay smelter by 17,500 tons a year by 1967. This is a one-third increase in the output of this smelter. Further, the consortium that will be exploiting the Gove reserves has undertaken to produce alumina, as distinct from primary aluminium, by 1971. A production capacity of 500,000 tons is planned. I expect the answer to a question I have placed on notice to confirm that this consortium has given an undertaking that it too will establish a smelter for the production of primary aluminium. We then have the position that the productive capacity of which Alcan is capable will be surplus to requirements, the extra 17,500 tons that Comalco will produce will be surplus to requirements and the Gove production will be surplus to requirements. Where will we sell all this material? Will we sell it overseas at a much lower price than we are getting on the home market and at a time when there is a world surplus of aluminium? To give a clear indication of the existence of this surplus I have only to direct attention to the treatment that President Johnson handed out to the United States aluminium cartel when it endeavoured to raise the price of aluminium. member's time has expired. Knowing that there is a world surplus of aluminium, he threatened to release the Government's stockpile, which was significantly large, and, realising the effect that this would have on the world's surplus of aluminium, the monopoly group withdrew its proposal to increase the price. I point out that Australuco, which is owned by Alcan, has been responsible for 50 per cent, of the sales in Australia of semi-fabricated aluminium. Since 1964, first as a result of import licensing policies and then as a result of tariff policies, it has been using about smelters-thos e operated by 20,000 tons of Australian primary aluminium. When it produces its own aluminium at this smelter, capable of an output between 30,000 and 40,000 tons, we will find that Comalco or Alcoa, or both, are going to suffer a fairly severe setback. Their best market because of cost disadvantages is going to be in this country. The largest single demand for their output has come from Australuco, but it is going to produce its own primary aluminium and will have a surplus capacity. So we can see that excessive investment is taking place in the production of primary aluminium in Australia. In 1964 Alcoa had a loss of £1.6 million. It has paid up capital of £25 million. ComalcoI have seen it variously quotedhad a profit of £684,000 or £437,000 in 1964. It has a paid up capital of £30 million. That is a pretty poor return. What concerns me, first, is that we are going to have a situation where the consumer is going to have to pay a high price to subsidise a low price gain in export. Secondly, I want to know why this sort of investment is taking place willy nilly. I cannot see where there is any advantage to this country or its economy in this situation. The Parliament is entitled to a report from the Treasury or the Department of National Development indicating whether the losses presently sustained by the established smelters, the increased capacity of production and so on, can be integrated into the economy without any cost disadvantage to the community or whether we are going to have to prop up, again, an uneconomic position in which there is disproportionate investment in this sector of the economy while starving other sectors.",95,Adjournment
140,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorableSpeaker, it is quite a long time since I intruded on the patience of honourable members at this time of the evening. First, I apologise to honourable members for asking them to listen to me at this stage of the evening. But there is a matter on which I wish to speak for just a few moments. It is a matter of importance, I think, to members of this Parliament who may find themselves somewhat confused because of the attitude of the Press. The Press is a great instrument of public opinion in Australia. I regard the Australian Press very highly. It helps in the shaping of the opinions of our people. I believe that its powers should never be limited. But it has the responsibility to respect the integrity of individuals. It should endeavour to regard itself at all times as an instrument that is here to serve in the shaping of the opinions of the people along honest and genuine lines. SoI consider that, while the Press should not be attacked in an irresponsible way by members who feel themselves hurt, it has a responsibility to see that individuals millions in the five years since independence. in public life are respected. On Tuesday of this week the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) moved a motion in which the House recorded its regret at the death of the former Prime Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Balewa. Mr Speaker, you will permit me, I am sure, to quote thc words of the Prime Minister regarding Sir Abubakar Balewa who met a tragic death in a massacre in Nigeria. The Prime Minister described this deceased statesman, one of the leading figures of the Commonwealth, as a man who was calm and dignified in his demeanour. He said that he was widely acknowledged as a man of integrity, fairness, courage and sound judgment. Further, the Prime Minister said his reputation had grown steadily since 1952 when he first entered politics in the Nigerian Federation. The Prime Minister went on to say that Sir Abubakar Balewa believed deeply in democratic standards, in fairness to all and in free speech. Our former revered Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, described him as a respected leader, clearminded, sagacious, tolerant and just. He said: ""The world can ill afford to lose men of this quality."" I was one who deeply regretted the butchering of this great Commonwealth statesman. of Australia's leading journals, the Melbourne "" Herald"", which controls the "" Courier-Mail"", a leading journal in Brisbane. The article, which I read last night in the Melbourne "" Herald "", tells of bribery that existed in tKe Nigerian Government according to the Press of that country. I think that the article was ill timed, particularly as this Parliament had so recently paid its respects to the late Prime Minister of Nigeria and had expressed such deep regard in the words spoken by the Prime Minister. I am sure that had other honourable members in this place read the article in last night's Melbourne "" Herald"" they would have been as upset as I am. Consequently I believe that honourable members will allow me the indulgence to make some reference to this article which, in my opinion is really shocking and does no justice to the Press. The article in the "" Herald"" statedThe military regime has opened a campaign to rid Nigeria of corruption which wasted many The campaign ranges from a crackdown on those who try to bribe traffic policemen to a review of the tariff structure, which was rigged by crooked Cabinet Ministers to protect their own business interests. Stories of official graft circulated before Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed and his government overthrown last month. This was a reference to the gentleman we spoke about in such high terms on Tuesday last. The article continuedForeign businessmen planning investments here found they had to accommodate Cabinet Ministers and their friends with "" dash "" (bribes), jobs and special favors. "" You can't buy a Nigerian Cabinet Minister,"" said one US. executive, "" but you can rent them for the afternoon"". The article made reference to special cases of bribery. It referred to the Finance Minister who would be the equivalent of the Treasurer who sits in this place. The article stated that the Finance Minister who was killed in the revolt was known as the King of Bribes and that the evidence indicates that he deserved the title. It went on to say that import duties on plastic shoes increased steeply after he built a factory to make them in his home town. The article suggested that he sold the shoes back to the Government and it also suggested that he died while trying to bribe his executioners not to kill him.",96,Adjournment

Will the Commonwealth extend to the Girl Guides Association in the Australian Capital Territory, pro rata on a membership and district basis, the same financial assistance as has been given to the Boy Scouts in the Australian Capital Territory? 12. If not, why not? honourable follows1, 2 and 3. During the past three years the Boy Scouts have constructed four Scout Halls at Downer, Narrabundah, Red Hill and Deakin, valued in all at about $32,000. Based on the value of work done by the Scouts' own efforts, the Commonweallh assisted by grants totalling $6,960. In addition an old building was removed from Acton, re-erected at Yarralumla and converted for the joint use of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides at a cost to the Commonwealth of approximately $8,000. 4. None. 5. Provision has been made in the current year for a further $8,000 towards the cost of three more Scout Halls but the actual subsidy will depend on the value of work financed by the Scouts themselves. 6 to 10. In addition to the Yarralumla Hall already referred to, the Commonwealth at a cost of approximately $2,400 moved an old building from Duntroon and re-erected it at Gungahlin for use by Girl Guides as a camp. Recently the Girl Guides sought Commonwealth assistance in providing two balls on the north side of Canberra for their sole use. The National Capital Development Commission is taking action to construct one hall at O'Connor at an estimated cost of $14,000. The whole cost will be met by the Commonweallh and the Guides will have full use of it at a nominal rental. A Community Centre is being provided at Commonwealth cost at Downer and it has been suggested to the Girl Guides that they use the centre as a meeting place, at least for tbe time being. 11 an 12. While the Government is very appreciative of, and has always encouraged the work done by youth welfare organisations in the Australian Capital Territory, and has given them assistance in various ways, there is a limit to what it can do in this direction. Because of this it has been suggested to the Boy Scouts' Association and the Girl Guides that they should consider ways and means of making joint use of meeting halls. My Department is still awaiting the outcome of this suggestion and when it is settled consideration will be given to what additional assistance, if any, is warranted. A r m y Recruiting.
