BILL 1946. read a first time. for the Interior) [3.15] -by leave I ' move That the bill be now read a second time. This measure is designed to extend the functions of the Commonwealth Forestry Bureau to enable it to advise on matters affecting the. supply of timber. The war and its aftermath have decisively demonstrated Australia's present inability to meet all our essential timber requirements from our own resources, and have given prominence to well-founded doubts as to bow long even our present standards of timber production can be maintained. A planning and co-ordinating authority is required to investigate the position, and -advise the Commonwealth Government with regard to forest resources, timber production, imports and exports for Australia as a whole. Under the National Security (Timber Control) Regulations, the Commonwealth Timber Controller had wide and necessary powers in relation to timber which was always in short supply. As the war position eased, it was possible to relax many restrictions on the use of timber, but the planning and co-ordinating side of the work of timber control has had to be continued to provide for the requirements of the many activities sponsored by the Commonwealth Government in connection with housing, public works programmes, &c, ""and to arrange, as far as practicable, the equitable distribution of available supplies between the States. The Director-General of the Commonwealth Forestry Bureau has for some time held the' appointment of Controller of Timber under the National Security (Timber Control) Regulations, and timber control was transferred from the Department of Works and Housing to the Department of the Interior as from the 1st July, 1946. The planning and co-ordinating' servicedeveloped during the war has the confidence and co-operation of State forest authorities and local sawmilling and timber importing interests throughout the Commonwealth. The logical development to meet peacetime requirements is the inclusion of advisory functions with regard to these matters in a Commonwealth Forestry and Timber Bureau. A definition of timber is included by clause 3. Other amendments to the principal act are the change of the name of the Forestry Bureau to the "" Forestry ancl Timber Bureau "", and the designation of the Inspector-General of Forests to "" Director-General, Forestry and Timber Bureau "". Clause5 of the bill details the additional functions relating to timber which it is proposed to place with the Forestry Bureau. Timber is proving a limiting factor in the rate of development of certain postwar projects of national importance, such as housing, public works programme and the standardization of railway gauges. Facts regarding production, stocks, imports, exports and interstate movement of timber from month to month are needed to serve as a basis for planning. During the war, it has been demonstrated that this information can be collated and analysed by a very small staff without reuiring industrialists to make burdensome returns. Although the forests of Australia, for the most part, are under the control of the States, certain factors on which the successful.exploitation by the sawmilling, industry of any forest region are dependent, are controlled by the Commonwealth. Accessible forests were heavily",18,Petrol Rationing

67,Mr Johnson (Kalgoorlie,"Ministe rover-cut both before and during the war. It is now necessary to go further afield for logs if the rate of production is to be maintained. This may involve either higher prices or subsidies. Problems of this nature should be dealt with regionally, and should be investigated and reported on before the supply position becomes acute and dislocation of industry develops. Constructive planning by State forest authorities and a Commonwealth organization working in collaboration is required. In order that such problems may be considered in correct perspective, a knowledge of current production and consumption throughout the Commonwealth, with due allowance for imports and exports, is required, and this can be supplied only by a properly constituted and sufficiently staffed timber and forestry that new industries requiring timber as a bureau. A second important factor having a large influence on the economy of working the forests of any region is access, and present indications are that the Commonwealth may have to assist in the provision of funds for any major programme of road or tramline development. State forest authorities are already asking what the Commonwealth intends to do to extend the zone of supply in certain States to meet post-war demands, and at present there is no authority which can reply to them. In the future there will be intense comCommonwealth was directly concerned petition for softwood supplies from all countries having exportable surpluses, and it is evident that timber will occupy a prominent place in international trade agreements and that, in addition to control exercised through tariffs, considerable proposed additional powers and functions planning and co-ordination will he needed to regulate the quantities of timber to be imported into the main consuming centres and to ensure an equitable distribution of available imports in the national interest, with due regard to the stability of the local saw-milling industry. Despite the fact that Australia will need to import nearly one-third of its total timber requirements after the war, there is scope for the development of a valuahle export trade in high-quality hardwoods and figuredcabinet, woods. The extent to which hardwood exports will be possible will depend largely on our success in organizing {he import of satisaet to authorize the execution by or on . Ifr. Johnson. factory supplies of general utility softwoods. Australian hardwoods properly marketed will command a high price in overseas countries, in many cases more than double the value of equal quantities of timbers we may import to replace them for building purposes in Australia. Moreover, a number of Empire countries such as New Zealand, Ceylon, South Africa and even the United Kingdom will be seriously embarrassed unless they can obtain hardwood supplies from Australia for public works, railway requirements and special industries. Reserves of good quality timber remaining in the forests of Australia are not sufficient to maintain the saw -milling industry at its present level of production indefinitely, and it is important therefore raw material should be considered in relation to the general problem of timber supply. Eor example, it is open to question whether Australia can afford to extend the use of mature logs of good quality to the manufacture of such products as paper and wallboards, when these _ commodities can be made from thinnings, poor quality logs and sawmill waste. At the present time the Commonwealth is directly concerned in any new projects of this nature, as approval is required to the raising of capital, the importing of machinery and the erection of new works; but even under pre-war conditions the in as far as such projects required either bounties or tariff protection before being started. It is desired to make it clear that the of the Forestry and Timber Bureau will not interfere with the powers of the Minister for Trade and Customs, to impose import and export duties. The bureau, however, will be in a position to advise the Minister in that regard. I commend the bill to honourable members and urge its speedy passage. adjourned.

OF CHILDREN ) BILL 1946. read a first' time. for Immigration and. Minister for In formation) [3.26] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is intended to serve a dual purpose, namely, to enable tbe Ministerf o r Immigration to continue to act as tbe legal guardian of overseas children who remain in Australia after the National Security (Overseas Children) Regulations cease to have effect and to enable tbe Minister to act as legal guardian of all children who will be brought to Australia in future as immigrants under the auspices of any governmental or nongovernmental migration organization. Under these regulations legal guardianship of British children, who were evacuated to. Australia in 1940 for the duration of the war, was vested in the Minister for Immigration and through him in the various' State child welfare departments. The children were placed by those departments with custodians, who accepted responsibility for their w e l fare and care. came to Australia under the overseas children scheme and the majorit y have now returned to the United. Kingdom. There are, however, over 100 children still in Australia. Some are remaining temporarily to complete educational courses or apprenticeships and others permanently. (Overseas Children) Regulations will cease' to have effect after the 31st December, 1946, and the .bill now introduced will enable the same arrangements as were made under those regulations to be continued in respect of the overseas children remaining here. The bill also covers children who w ill be brought to Australia under the auspices of any governmental or non-governmental migration organizations when migration is resumed. The overriding responsibility of the Commonwealth in respect of all migrants, including the application of its social service legisla(GUARDIANSHIP tion, applies in greater force perhaps to children. It is believed that the Commonwealth Government, in encouraging and financially assisting child migration by way of contributions towards passage money and payment of child endowment to organizations caring for the children, accepts a responsibility which does riot end with the children's arrival in Australia. It is, therefore, incumbent on the Commonwealth to see that child migrants are properly accommodated and cared for until they reach 21 years of age. The only way in which this can be achieved is by vesting in the Minister for Immigration an overriding legal guardianship in respect of all such children. Whilst under the provisions of the bill, the Minister w ill be the legal guardian of immigrant children, it is proposed to utilize the services of the State authorities in the same manner as has been done with overseas children under the National Security (Overseas Children) Regulations. State authorities may, under delegation from the Minister, exercise control and supervision of the children, who w ill be cared for under the auspices of voluntary migration organizations introducing them, such as the Fairbridge Farm Schools, Dr. Barnardo Homes, Northcote Children's Farm School, and church bodies. These Originally 577 children organizations can be appointed custodians of the children brought out by them. It w ill be observed that the proposed legislation does not apply to immigrant children who come to Australia with, or for the purpose of living under tbe care The National Security of, their parents or relatives. A t a conference held in A p r i l , 1946, attended by representatives of the Commonwealth and States, it was agreed that there was need for uniformit y of procedure with regard to the legal guardianship of child immigrants and that the Commonwealth should assume responsibility for theit guardianship until they attain the api",20,Railwa Y Standardization Agreement Bill 1946

No changes in the specific rates of duty under any of the items are involved. nature, I shall, however, comment briefly on some of the proposed alterations. Customs Tariff items 371, 372 and 373 and Excise .Tariff items 10B, C, D and B are an extension of concessional duty privileges to the Governor General, State governors and official representatives of overseas countries. It has been pointed out that representatives of the Australian Government were receiving more favorable treatment in some other countries as regards customs and excise privileges than the representatives of overseas countries in Australia, and the Government has been pleased' to introduce the proposed amendment to equalize tbe treatment. Provision, however, has been made for the Minister to be able to determine that the' ' application of the concessions in customs item 373 A and excise item 10 D shall be conditional on reciprocity. The other Customs Tariff items 174M, amended for administrative purposes. As regards Excise Tariff item 1, it has been deemed advisable to include a definition of beer in the Excise Tariff. The amendment to excise item 2Q will allow hospitals to obtain full benefit of the con-, sessional duty on spirit used by them. 'Previously duty-free delivery was only permitted for spirit used by hospitals in the manufacture of medicinal preparations, but inquiries showed that many hospitals could not avail themselves of the concession, as they did not possess the requisite manufacturing facilities. Hospitals will now be able to obtain the full benefit of the concession by purchasing from drug manufacturers, who will obtain duty-free delivery of the spirit, provided that manufacture is carried out in a licensed warehouse under excise control. The amendments to the remaining excise items are fully explained in the notes, circulated to honourable members. Progress reported. ' Tn Committee of Ways and Means,: Consideration resumed from the 30th July (vide page -3263), on motion by 1. T.ha-t a tax be imposed upon incomes at the following rates:. . . {vide page 2461).. way of amendmentThat paragraph 1 be postponed. Prime Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) in the Financial .Statement claimed that reductions of income tax this 'financial year ranging from 20 to 47 per« .cent, were a substantial concession to taxpayers, but that is far from the truth. Only the most miserable concessions are proposed. Far from getting anywhere near the pre-war level of income tax the Government intends'to go on its wasteful way. The strikes that trouble industry are largely dueto the fact that workers are over taxed. They do not want to 'work just for the Treasury. Trade is restricted because business houses cannot launch on new programmes because of the punitive taxes. High taxes and in-' flated prices are handicapping ex-servicemen wishing to set up in business. Heavy 150 and 393B have been taxes are new to them after having been out of civilian life for so long. By maintaining taxes .at such a height the Government is keeping up prices ,a.nd.. contributing to the scarcity of commodities That leads to continuance of the black market. Proof that the proposed concession is miserable instead of substantial, as claimed by the Prime Minister, is proved by translating into pounds, shillings and pence, mostly pence, the percentages by which rates of tax are to be reduced. In -most cases the weekly saving that taxpayers will make as the result of the proposed benefaction will be a matter of pence. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), who, with other honourable gentlemen opposite, was most discomforted by my revelations about this vaunted tax concession, made much of the fact that a man on £200 a year would have his tax cut by 34.6 per cent. That amounts to 12s. a year. Anyway, few men with a dependent wife and child earn only £3 l'5s. a -week. They are trie people who are to enjoy a reduction of their tax by 34.6 per cent. Good luck to .them'! I wish it were double. A bachelor earning £300 a year, or £5 15s 5d. a week, will save 2s. 4d.' a week as a result --of the proposed concession. He will be -able to buy a lot with thai. He will be able, perhaps, to invest in ^acehorses, or he might even be able to get married with the extra 2s. 4d.

75,,"Mr WHITE (Balaclava) [3.35] -TheI hardly agree with the honourable gentleman that it could be described as any sort of a budget. But I do agree with him that the bachelor is the man who is given the most consideration. Contrast the lot of the bachelor who will save 2s. 4d. a week with that of a man, with a dependent wife, earning £300 a year, a rate upon which there is a much greater number of taxpayers. They will each get 9d. extra a week. Perhaps, they will be able to build a larger house and live more luxuriously on that. The savings of a man, with a dependent wife and one child on the same income will be 7d. a week for himself and each of his dependants. Their new house will not be quite so magnificent. A man and his wife and two children will get 4d. extra a week each. They are people whose breadwinner earns £300 a.year, which would be about the average salary of most Australian taxpayers. That shows the hollowness of the Government's claim, which was headlined in the newspapers, that the income tax would be reduced by 40 per cent. As the number of dependants of a taxpayer increases the weekly saving that he will be able to make as a result of this munificent .gesture diminishes. I now turn'to the taxpayers whose income comes from property The property owners are the ""people whom honourable gentlemen opposite habitually talk about with great unction as bloated capitalists who tread .on the faces of the workers. They are the exploiters. A taxpayer with the magnificent income of £200 a year from property and without dependants will save lOd. a week as the result of'this is not in the spirit of cricket to compel dislegislation. He will be able to buy more property with that! He will be able to load himself up with more Commonwealth Bonds. The Minister for ""Works and Housing his more fervent if not more vocal days, used to refer vehemently to the bondholders as vampires sucking the blood of the people. But times have changed. The Labour Government has exhorted the people, to -purchase bonds. If they could not fight for Australia, 'they were urged to buy bonds. Last year, a person who earned the "" magnificent"" income of £20.0 a year paid tax of £8 19s. per annum. Under the new tax proposals, he or she will "" beneMr ""White. f it "" by a reduction of lOd. per week. According to honourable members opposite that would enable him to become a bigger capitalist. Yesterday, the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) stood up all those familiar aunt sallies, and knocked them down to > his own satisfaction. He tilted at the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company1 Limited, the Melbourne Club, capitalists and profiteers. If any one lives on the earnings of the working man, it. is certain honourable gentlemen opposite, and the Communists who live in their camp. However, I do not desire to harry their feelings by referring to that matter extensively I wonder whether the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini) is aware how onerously the income tax bears upon certain classes. Recently, a number of senior officers of the Royal Australian Air Eorce were retrenched. I do not propose to discuss the why and wherefore of their retrenchment, but the Government gave to those men a gratuity for, we hope, their long and distinguished service to Australia. Judge their surprise when they discovered that they were obliged to repay as income tax 5 per cent, of the amount. A gratuity of that kind should be exempt from tax. In my opinion, that action was unfair. Recently, the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin) referred to a certain action as not being "" cricket""I am glad to know that the honourable gentleman has begun to play the game lately-bu t I contend that it tinguished officers of the Royal Australian Air Force to pay income tax on their gratuity. ( Mr Lazzarini), in Income tax is also levied unfairly upon some men, who, during the war, serv.ed eutside Australia. To-day, I received a letter from a man who formerly resided in Shanghai, but who was passing through Australia in 1940. As there were difficulties in the way of his leaving Australia, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. Because he could not leave Australia for overseas service, he resigned' his commission and served aboard an American army transport, which was continually in the waters of Papua, New Guinea, the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines. Now, the Taxation De-. partment has ruled that he must pay income tax on the income derived from the Government of the United States of America during the period of his service. He wroteThe income was not taxed by the American authorities, but they deducted tax from salaries on behalf of tlie Australian Taxation Department. This man is regarded as a ""civilian who did not serve in the forces. His desire for active service caused him to resign his commission in the Australian Imiperial Force and seek employment on an American army transport. In' such 1 cases as this, the Government should be generous, and exempt the men from income tax. My correspondent addedMy income was not derived from sources within the Commonwealth, but was paid by the American Government, who did not levy tax. The. vessel was operating in an area not subject to Australian income tax . . . American Government accepted f u l l responsibility for compensation for injur y and loss of life. No resppnsibility was accepted by ' the .ComniionweaJth. Government. When a vessel is on the high seas under the American flag, the crew are subject to American law, and do not enjoy the rights of British subjects. Service on American ships is no.t recognized hy the Australian Government as "" war service "". I am not eligible for the Pacific Star, not eligible for any repatriation benefits for sickness such as malaria contracted whilst serving in the islands, and not' eligible ' for membership of the Returned Soldiers' League. This matter affects many Australians who worked for the Americans in the islands for periods of six months upwards, therefore it would be appreciated if the subject could be brought before the House. This man is required to pay income tax to honourable gentlemen opposite who supon the money which he received while he port the Government. I urge them to was employed by the American Governpersuade caucus to direct the Government ment. Is that justice to a man who to alter this decision. enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and saw .war service aboard an American We would feel the iron heel of caucus if transport ? Some time ago, I asked the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) a question about the taxation of the incomes of Australians who were serving with Unrra. This excellent policy of' the Government, but I cannot organization ' is doing wonderful service believe that the Honourable member for . to-day in starving Europe, where many Denison (Dr. Gaha) could be silent, what. people are suffering from sickness and ever the circumstances. The Governfamine. One of the duties of the servants ment's financial proposals are mostly of Unrra is to re-organize the. adminismake-believe. ! trative machinery of the war-devastated countries.

Since this Government has ' been in office industrial activity in the electorate has expanded enormously. In the town of Yass, which is only 35 miles honourable members which will show distant from Canberra, this Government clearly that, as the result of the adminishas established a leather factory and a.. tration of the Government, the incomes of clothing factory, and to-day there is not an empty business establishment in the town. A clothing factory has also been established at Boorowa. This Government also created a small arms factory at Young, which has since been converted to the manufacture of textiles. A t Cootamundra a clothing factory and rice mills are in operation, and the bacon factory and abattoirs have been enlarged. A clothing factory has been established at Harden. A small arms factory was opened at Wagga which is to-day occupied by the Dunlop Perdriau Rubber Company.

In June, 1941, savings bank deposits totalled £252,231,000, and by April, 1946, tbe total had increased to £.649,735,000. WhatI have said with regard to the establishment of industries in rural areas, the increase of the incomes of primary producers and the expansion of savings bank deposits, is a complete answer to the arguments of honourable gentlemen opposite who could show no such results after governments which they supported had been in office for a quarter of a century. The Government has also provided subsidies of £54,000,000 for primary producers. remarks because I am sick of the crocodile. tears of honourable gentlemen opposite. The verdict on the Government's administration can be left safely to the people. The figures that I have given cannot be challenged. Without any doubt this Government has administered the affairs of the country in the best interests of the people at large, and I am quite confident of the answer that the people will give to the question whether the destinies of Australia should be placed in the hands of the political parties represented on the benches opposite,, or'be left in the care of this Government, which has proved its capacity by pulling the country out of its difficulties in days when it was overtaken, by war, drought and' bush fires. Had this debate been broadcast to-day, the people of Tumut and Wagga who had cared to listen to it would have heard the rodomontade that has just been delivered by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller). His remarks had no connection with the resolution which the committee is considering. Nevertheless, I shall be Increase. compelled to observe the ruling of the 1030-40. 1043-44. Chair in that regard.

The memorandum circulated with the resolution sets out at page 2 the incomes that will have to be earned by different persons in order to bring them within the taxable scale. It is rather important that I should point to something which does not appear to have sunk home sufficiently in the minds of honourable members occupying the Government benches, namely, that the whole picture cannot be viewed by looking merely at what the direct income tax I make these happens to be; one must also take into consideration the indirect .taxes' that have to be paid. As my time is limited, I can give only a brief outline. It is worthwhile to point out that indirect taxation totals over £100,000,000 per annum. If that be divided by the total number of human beings in this continent-the old and the young; the infant in arms; the invalid.; and those who are about to depart fromthis ""vale of tears""-it will be found that the taximposed upon each of them is approximately £1S per annum. I should have thought that the Labour party, in particular, would have been the first party to direct.its attention to indirect taxes, which bear directly on the man with a low income.",28,Income Tax Bill 1946
94,Mr Spender (Warringah) [4.0],"'mostly on luxuries. The honourable member shows by his interjection that he has no knowledge of ? the sources from which the revenue from indirect taxes is derived. In 1943, there were 3,370,000 wage-earners in the Commonwealth of Australia, of whom 2,930,000, or 87 per cent., earned £8 a week or less, the average income o£ the total number being £247. a year. Deducting the amounts allowable in respect of wife, children and medical expenses, we find that the net income is approximately £147 a year, and on that the tax is about <£9. Indirect taxes are hidden, and affect the cost of everything that has to be purchased. Eor example, there is a 12$ per cent, sales tax on furniture, carpets, linoleum, crockery, kitchenware, electric irons, and cutlery. Every man, even one on the smallest income, pays a substantial proportion of the .amount that he earns annually on the sum. of those items. The sales tax collections in that year-totalled £29,672,000, an average of £4 0s. lOd. a head of the population. The excise tax totalled £46,000,000, an average of £6 8s. a head. The customs tax totalled £21,000,000, an average of £2 15s. The entertainment tax totalled £6,981,000, an average of 19s. Id. a head. In order to illustrate the bearing which indirect taxes have on the poor man, I point out that he strikes on behalf of the Government one-half of every box of matches that Ke uses. The Government should take steps to relieve the man on the low income of the harsh burden that is laid on him by indirect taxes. I do not claim that that can be done in rapid steps; but I do contend that some steps to that end can be taken, particularly in the removal of sales tax from capital goods, which would enable purchasers to refurnish their homes at a much lower cost, after being denied the things they have needed during the last six years. There has been no attempt to deal with this form of taxation, which bears with particular severity on the working man. My next point deals with the property tax. The property rates are iniquitous,' particularly on low incomes. I have in mind, not the business tycoons about members opposite whenever they speak, but the people on low incomes who endeavour to save and invest, so that, when they reach the end of their working days, they may not be dependent upon any government, or the charity of any person or institution. I say deliberately, that such persons are taxed at so high a rate that many are worse off than are others who have made no provision for themselves and are drawing the old-age pension. Let' me cite a case which is typical of many cases of which ""every honourable member in this House has knowledge. It is that of a retired railway employee whp has a pension of £111 a year. He -also has a cottage, which he was able to purchase by saving during his working days. Because the cottage is the property of his wife, she is said to be not dependent on her husband, and he is regarded as having an income of something over £200, On which bas to pay a tax of £23 There should be a more, sympathetic approach to those who are on the lower ranges of property income, so that some encouragement might be given'to thrift. My next point deals with the treatment of persons who' have a mixed"" income, from . personal exertion and property. In this respect, too, ther'p should be a completely new approach in the years that lie ahead, by whoever happens to be in charge of the treasury bench. A person with an income of £50 from property and £500 from personal exertion, is taxed on both amounts at the rate applicable to a property income of £550. Every one of us knows that a person who endeavours to improve his' position by investing in property ultimately finds that his investment' is of no value to him. I shall next deal with tbe discouragement of thrift by the policy pursued by the Government in respect of trust accounts, usually in the Commonwealth Bank, established by parents on behalf of their children who have not reached' the age of 21 years. The interest payable on the savings bank account is added to the income of the father and is taxable at the personal exertion rate applicable to",29,Increases Oe Income Oe Primary Producers Between 1939 40 And

Their assessments included £3,305,000 of supertax, £3,154,000 of war-time company tax, and £10,360,000 of undistributed profits tax. It is easily seen that taxation on this scale denies industry the means to expand, a fact that has long been recognized in other countries. Eor instance, in the United States of America, cuts have £980,000,000 in excess profits tax-whic h is the same as our war-time company tax-sur-tax , and capital stock tax. ' In Canada, the standard rate of 40 per cent, has been reduced to 30. per cent, and the excess profits tax from 20 per cent, to .15 per cent. In South Africa, excess profits tax has been reduced from 15s. to 10s. in the £1, whilst in the United Kingdom excess profits tax is to be discontinued this year, and there is to be a reduction of the standard rate from 10s. to 9s. in the £1. In Australia, however, no attempt has been made to reduce company taxation. If only some relief ' were given in regard to the super-tax, or the war-time company tax, it would greatly help the economy of the country. There seems to me to be a great fallacy in the Government's reasoning, in that Ministers hold the view .that if taxes are cut the revenue must decline.' The fact is, that in times of expanding enterprise such as the present, if taxation is reduced within certain limits the total yield will almost inevitably increase, and this certainly applies to company taxation. During a previous debate, I contested the Treasurer's claim that taxpayers would £17,000,000 this year as a result of tax cuts. I have here a letter written by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to the' honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Government. Fadden), in which he said that it was unlikely that the 1946-47 collections of revenue would be affected by more than £15,500.000 by the tax cuts. We may be sure that ' that was an overMr Spender. estimate. Even on that basis, however, the tax cuts amount to no more than a reduction of 1 \ per cent, of collections from direct taxation, or 5 per cent, of the total collections for last year from all taxation, direct and indirect. In 1943-44, 15,697 comViewed in this light, it is evident that the Government has made no real attempt to afford relief to taxpayers, but has merely made a political gesture which was wrung from it by the insistent -demand of public opinion. I hope that tax rates on income from property will be reduced, in favour of the persons on small incomes. I hope that, in the case of composite incomes, the Government will abandon the been made whichinvolve iniquitous proposition that the whole of the property income must be taxed at a rate applicable to the' total income of the individual. In particular, I appeal to the Government to amend section 102 of the Income Tax Assessment. Act, which must be read in conjunction with sections 95, 98 and 99, so as to limit taxation of genuine trust accounts and genuine trust property to income derived from them at a rate that such income itself would attract. ""Where parents have established genuine trust accounts for the benefit of tbeir children they should not be penalized for their thrift and foresight. I rise to refute certain statements of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell). The first is that no Labour government had imposed a means test in regard to the payment of maternity allowances. I remind himthat in the budget introduced, on the 10th July, 1931, the Treasurer of the Labour Government, Mr Theodore,, provided for the reduction of the amount of the maternity allowance from £5 to £4, and it was further provided that no maternity allowance would be payable to any mother if the combined income of her husband and herself during the prebenefit by as much as ceding twelve months exceeded £260. That was the first application of a means test to the maternity allowance since it was introduced by the FisherI wish now to expose the fallacy of the argument that certain specified millions of pounds have been lost to Commonwealth revenue as the result of the reduction of income tax rates. As a matter",31,Increases Oe Income Oe Primary Producers Between 1939 40 And
101,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [4.27],"of fact, it would be profitable for tbe Treasurer to reduce taxation, especially on lower incomes, in tbe case of men with families. There was a reputed reduction of income tax last year by 12 per cent., but the actual result was that the receipts declined by only £500,000-fro m £215,000,000 to £214,500,000. Moreover, the Treasurer admitted that £43,000,000 of income tax remained uncollected, while a further £50,000,000 was unassessed. This indicattes clearly that with a reduction of income tax at a time of expanding economy, when war-time controls are being lifted and industry is, free to overtake the war-time lag of production, the national revenue must increase. The returns from income taxation will probably remain steady, or may even increase, as the' result of a reduction of rates, and it is quite certain that the total revenue collected by the Government from all sources will increase. In the year before tbe last reduction of income tax, the total taxation receipts amounted to £345,000,000, whereas last year, according to the financial statement just released by the 'Government, revenue from all sources amounted to £360,000,000, and this notwithstanding the non-collection of income tax amounting to £43,000,000, and the non-assessment of tax amounting to £50,000,000. All the talk of the millions that have^been foregone in remissions of taxes is sheer nonsense. I proved during the . 1920's that if rates of tax imposed in respect of certain income groups, particularly the lower groups, were reduced the spending power of the'people would be so increased that greater revenues would be derived from indirect taxes and thus the total revenue of tbe Commonwealth would not suffer. High taxation has always brought about diminishing returns; the higher the rate of tax the less will be the buovancy of industry and the ultimate -collections by the Government. I seek substantial improvement of the lot of taxpayers in the £400 to £700 income group, as well as of those in the lowest income group. When I was Treasurer I * increased the exemption for single men to £300. able gentleman was Treasurer the average year. The innovation under which the worker did not earn £300 per annum. able member will examine the statistics he will find that in 1927-28 there was an all-time high record in employment and wages. I have brought before the Taxation. Commissioner a specific case of hardship which I believe merits his most sympathetic consideration. Under the uniform taxation law which was introduced in 1942, a taxpayer whose wife earns £50 a year has her income added to that of her husband in order to determine the rate to be applied to both incomes. The result of that is to increase greatly the tax paid by a man whose wife has an income from her own personal exertion. The case which I brought before the Taxation Commissioner concerned a teacher whose wife, as a patriotic gesture, accepted an appointment as sewing mistress at a school at an annual salary of £52. She was appointed to the post by the' Education Department in April, but because of a mistake on the part of the department she was not paid salary for the first quarter until some time during the succeeding income tax year when she was paid a total of £65. However, the addition of that £13 in the succeeding year so increased the rate applicable to the income of the husband that he had to pay an additional £30 15s. Since then the law has been amended, ancl a wife may now earn up to £100 without affecting the rate of tax imposed upon her husband. In these.days very few women in employment receive less than £100 a year. A wife should be able to earn much more than that before her income is added to that of her husband in order to determine a common rate to be applied to both. gentleman is in error -The income of the wife is not so added now. the matter with officials of the Taxation Department who have assured me that it is.

He realized that he would have to pay income tax on it in. respect of the financial year 19.45-46, would reduce the number of attempts to but when he was compiling his income tax return in consultation with a taxation expert, he found not only that he would have to pay tax for the year referred to on his university allowance and the dividend, but also that he would have to pay provisional tax on the whole amount to cover 25 per cent, of the previous year, despite the fact' that for ten months of that year he was a prisoner of war in Germany. He has beeninformed by taxation advisers that the income tax, plus the provisional tax, will be little if anything less than £600, leaving him £350 to pay insurance, living expenses, &c, with no surplus out of two years' income to go towards his re-establishment in civil life, about which the Government professes to be concerned. well. well! Why, this man was a prisoner of war for ten months. He is not doing so -well as the honourable member is doing on his £1,000 a year, and the honourable member has never been in the Army. The second anomaly that I bring to the notice of the Government affects a widow whose former husband purchased for her an annuity. The Treasurer is dealing with the case at the moment; but, for the life of me, I cannot understand why the Taxation Department arrived at its decision. When the husbanddied, the widow drew the annuity. She has now been advised that, notwithstanding that the annuity was taken into account as a part of her husband's estate for assessment of probate duty, she must pay incometax ou the annuity. I ' do not know how that decision is reached. I understood that insurance benefits were not taxable. The two anomalies that I have cited are extraordinary, but, owing to the complexity of our tax laws, anomalies are always cropping up. It is high time that the whole of our tax procedure was reviewed in order that anomalies might be avoided. It is also necessary that the returns on which tax is assessed be simplified so. that taxpayers may know, -without having to go to experts for advice, just what their liability will be when caught in the taxmesh. That evade taxes, because people would be aware of their tax liability from year to year and make provision for it, instead of resorting to evasion when finding themselves likely to be short of cash with which to meet their tax commitments.

In order to cushion the shock to the taxpayers affected by that reduction, the Labour Government told them that their contribution was for the purpose of certain social service benefits. Indeed, the Treasurer created a trust into which he undertook, on behalf of those taxpayers affected, to pay one quarter of the annual receipts from income tax, or £30,000,000, whichever was the less. In the first year of the operation of the fund , an amount of £27,800,000 was paid into it , and £2,300,000 was disbursed from it . The balance was £25,525,000. The cash substitute of that amount was taken from the special trust fund , spent for war purposes and replaced by internal treasury bills or government IO TPs. There can be no complaint about the spending of cash for the purposes of war. Nobody disagrees w it h that. The resources of this country, including those resources in the fund , had to be marshalled to the best advantage in the conduct of the war, but the method adopted of putting tbe money into the trust fund , immediately taking it out, spending it , and deluding the low income earner that the money was still in the fund to be spent on social services is an action to which attention must be drawn.

110,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"end of the first year of its operation. The same technique was adopted in the financial year 1944-45. An amount of £27,500,000 in cash was put into the fund, taken out, spent and replaced with treasury-bills. balance, and it was purely a paper balance, with which the fund commenced the year 1945-46 was £53,000,000, which was represented entirely by the Treasury IO TPs. As I have stated on previous occasions in this chamber, the fund on the' basis of cash resources is bankrupt. The actual expenditure on social services . for 1945-46 was £53,100,000, or £11,600,000 less than the estimate.. Cash to the amount of £6,600,000 was withdrawn from the welfare fund during the year to finance the deficiency between the income of the fund and payments on social services. honourable gentleman expect the Treasury to do with the balance of cash held in the fund? could be held iu the cash resources of the -community. As I shall prove, it is not being used to the extent and for the purposes for which the money was raised. Three points arise from the adoption of the procedure to which I have drawn attention.. First, the total government examount of cash that he could lay his penditure for the year is shown in financial statements as having been about £6,600,000 less than the actual figure. Secondly, social benefits were curtailed by some millions of pounds, obviously because the cash could not be found from the welfare fund. Thirdly, the £6,600,000 in cash was obtained most probably from disposals trust funds, transferred to theNational Welfare Fundi n exchange for treasury-bills, and then spent on social services. As the cash had to be used and ' as it was an expanding fund, the cash should be available at short call for the purposes of' the fund. l treasury-bills are for. Government has done. While the fund was in credit to the ' amount of £53,000,000, the sum of only £6,600,000 could be found from it to relieve expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Those facts cannot be denied. The whole of the expenditure on social services, with the Consequently the paper exception of an amount of £6,600,000, was met out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund instead of from out of the National Welfare Fund, which was provided for the purpose. How was the amount of £6,600,000 obtained? It was obtained most probably from the Disposals Trust Fund, transferred to the National Welfare Fund in exchange for treasury bills, and then spent on social services. As the result of much tedious interrogation, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) stated in reply to a question that the amount of £6,600,000 was used as a part of the Disposals Fund of £25,000,000. It is apparent that the amount of £6,600,000 in question was transferred or appropriated from disposals, put. into the trust fund so that that amount.of cash should be available, and treasury bills of an equivalent 7 amount were retired. The Treasurer's dilemma is obvious. He had to finance increased social services, but he could not pay for them with treasury-bills. Consequently, he had to find cash, and the extent of hissocial services was conditioned by the hands upon. Internal treasury-bills have remained static at £85,500,000 during the year. Consequently, it is obvious that a"" trust fund cash transfer such as I have described, has in fact taken place. If not, I should like a satisfactory explanation of it. Because the cash balance in the National Welfare Fund has been spent, there is now no opportunity to make large and substantial reductions of social service contributions or personal income tax, if social services are to be increased. The fund can be replenished only out of tax or other revenue, so .the unfortunate taxpayer has to pay twice for bis alleged benefits. As this, deficiency cannot be made good out of the IO TPs now in the fund, the charge will have to fall on general revenue, or social services will have to be curtailed: That 'is obvious because there is not sufficient cash in the fund to meet the demands",36,Social Services Contributionbill 1946

In any case, it is unfair to the contributors on' low incomes who, in fact, are providing for their social services by virtue of this contribution.

I desire to make some additional observations on the concessional allowance system which the Government has adopted in preference to the straight-out deduction method t h a t was formerly in operation. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and I have always disagreed on this subject. No one could possibly doubt the sincerity of the right honourable gentleman, and I personally respect his opinion on taxation matters generally, but on this subject our views are irreconcilable. I have never been able to understand why the right honourable member for Yarra has accepted the concessional allowance in preference to the straight-out deduction system. The deduction method, which I advocate, is simplicity itself. It is only necessary to arrive Whilst that section has no at the amount of income, make _ the deductions to which a taxpayer is entitled in respect of his wife and other dependants, and of medical, dental and other allowances, and then apply the appropriate rate of tax to the remainder. The right honourable member for Y a r r a has always argued that it is not fair that the man on the higher income should enjoy the same concessional allowances for the",37,Social Services Contributionbill 1946

For instance a man with an income of £200 and no dependants is taxed £12 18s., whereas a man with an income of £400 and no dependants is taxed £68 7s.; roughly, on twice the amount of income he has to pay five times the amount of tax. A man with an income of £400 and no dependants is taxed £68 7s., whereas a man with an income of £800 and no dependants is taxed £198 7s. or, with twice the amount of income he pays three times the amount of tax. To take another contrast: a man with an income of £200 and no dependants pays £12 18s., whereas a man with an income of £800 and no dependants pays £198 7s. or, with four times the amount of income he pays fifteen times the amount of tax. left? point invariably taken by the right honourable member for Yarra; but I consider that in upholding the concessional of the Australian Country party ( Mr allowance system he ignores the effect of Fadden) has used in favour of straightthe "" graduated rate of tax. As all out concessional deductions as against students of taxation know, the basic conthe rebate system. I concede to the right sideration is, not how much is taken honourable gentleman his point that the away, but how much is left? The system he advocates is much more simple, graduated system of taxation is applied but when we come to considerations more comprehensively in Australia than of equity, the arguments are all in in any. other country, but I emphasize favour of the concessional rebates method. the indisputable fact that the concesInstancing the effect of the taxation sional allowance system, as against the curve, the right honourable gentleman straight-out deduction, is not only said that a taxpayer with an income of extremely complex but also unjust. Another argument against the system 'come of £800 and no dependants would which the Government kas adopted is pay £198 7s. in tax.

Life insurance is comparable with fire insurance of buildings and equipment. If respect of property they should also be applied to the family expenses of the taxpayer. The arguments apply with equal force in each instance, in my opinion. Quite apart from the consideration that the adoption of the concessional allowances system by the Government has caused the banking-up of heavy arrears through the failure to issue assessments, owing to the necessity to employ expert staff, I contend that the method is unjustifiable on the other grounds that I have mentioned. I urge the Government, therefore, to take prompt steps to revert to the straight-out deductions system, .particularly, in view of the fact that our graduated ratesof tax ensure that persons in the higher income ranges shall pay disproportionpeople on the lower income ranges.

119,Mr Burke (Perth) [5.25],"I wishother taxpayer would have only £187 2s. left. With the statutory exemption standing at £250, the pre-war figure, it means nothing to a man with an income of that amount that, under the straight-out deduction system, he may deduct £100 for a wife and £50 for each dependent child up to the age of sixteen years. As he pays no tax, the deduction is of no value. This method conferred a tremendous advantage on taxpayers in the higher income brackets ; but, as the. right honourable member for Yarra( Mr a bank, usually in the CommonScullin) has been at great pains to'emphasize, it meant nothing at all to workers with a comparatively low income. It cannot be denied that the right to make deductions before the rate of tax is fixed would be of considerable cash value to men with higher incomes. In short, the straight-out deduction method favours the more privileged class in the community to the detriment of the underprivileged. For several days during this period of the session, honourable gentlemen opposite have been arguing that the Government's taxation proposals are not equitable to the family man. The proposition submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party is inconsistent with that argument. that the Government is favouring the single man without dependants as against the married man with a. family has also been answered by. other supporters of the Government, again and again, most effectively. I shall now deal with that aspect of may think so; but the fact remains. the matter with which the right honourable member for Darling Downs began his speech. He has advanced the same argument repeatedly when matters of a. similar nature have been, before the chamber. I have not previously form of security, and an investment that joined issue with him, because I is fancied by the trading banks of this have believed that he had no real country, because they earn interest and faith in his proposition. But he yet the investment can always be con-, has made it abundantly clear to-day that verted into cash whenever required. he does not understand the implications of the trust fund system. He has said to be drawn on to an amount of that the cash provided by means of this £6,000,000. tax is not, in effect, retained in the form of cash it could be so retained only by the matter in a moment. . Treasury-bills time-honoured practice"" of placing it represent an investment which earns under the mattress, or in a tin buried interest and have the added advantage where it would not be disturbed. If that practice were adopted, it would not have any effect in the present situation, under which the available cash is more than sufficient to purchase the goods that are procurable, because it would not be in circulation. But when a trust fund is established, obviously it must be placed somewhere for safety; and if there is no need to use it, the interest it earns augments the principal. Customarily, the proceeds of a tax which are allocated to a fund are deposited in wealth Bank, and interest is earned, upon the money. The bank does not keep' it in .a strongroom or a safe, or return the identical notes when the money is withdrawn, but lends it for the various purposes for which loans are made normally; for example, housing. In a time of war, that avenue for investment is closed to the bank, and tliere are only two ways in which it may lend the money and earn interest upon it. The. first is by investing it in Commonwealth bonds for a fixed term, or in treasury-bills. ' The right honourable gentleman. said: "" That is all right; but if you invest the money in Commonwealth bonds or treasury-bills, The contention your fund is bankrupt"".

' Solely by means of taxation. the purpose of paying interest to the f u n d ; and if that money be not required it, too, oan be invested in treasury-bills.

It has been as low' as | per eent. The argument of"" the right honourable gentleman is exceeded in puerility only by his. interjections. The fact has been established that the contributions to any such fund are either deposited in a bank and earn the ruling rate of interest, or are invested in Commonwealth inscribed stock. If the wish be not to have a long term investment, but to have a liquid security, the form most fancied is that of treasury bills. One of the principal investments favoured by trustee companies or trustees of estates is Commonwealth inscribed stock, and in many instances that is the only security in which they iare allowed to invest trust funds. So we have a trustee security, with a guaranteed rate of interest, and the bills which the right honourable gentleman as 1 0 U's can be cashed at any time by the Treasury when they f a l l -due, or can be discounted prior to the date of maturity if the money be needed. The only purpose of the argument advanced by the right honourable gentleman is to mislead the committee, and deceive the country as to the nature of the Government's transactions. Certainly, it is a most unreal argument, and one that should be dissipated for the benefit of tbe country. . Dame ENI D LYONS (Darwin) [5.37]. I confess to a feeling of very great disappointment. I came into this Parliament nearly three years ago. In ' the first Taxes are raisedfor speech that I made, I professed what might be termedmy political faith . I remember particularly pointing to the need for the encouragement of youth in this country; the need for the encouragement of the birthrate. I mentioned cerThat tain factors in our domestic economy which militated against that desirable objective. I referred particularly to the basic wage and its operation, and said that it was too meagre. I claimed that it was assessed on a wrong basis, t h a t. it should be determined according to the needs of a man and his wife-or , shall I say, a man and a dependant;, in other If the money in the words, a double unit-and that the children should be a charge upon the general -community. I believed that if I waited long enough, when the war was over and the financial position showed some signs of making it feasible, this Government would take steps to ensure something of that kind. But I have looked' in vain -for that reform in tbe measure that is now before us, providing, as it does, for certain things that are very well worthwhile,, but excluding other things of very much more importance. The Government proposes certain measures which w ill mean an increase of income for a large number of old-age pensioners, and will make it possible for other persons to become eligible for the pension. W it h that, I am heartily in -accord. But I suggest that, having regard to tbe future, it is much more necessary to concentrate upon the other end of the scale, and that f a r better results would accrue if .we did so. It is"" generally agreed at tbe present time that the basic wage does not adequately meet described the needs of even the smallest family. That is a matter of general opinion. But it, is also, as I see it, easily demonstrated fro m statistics, because of one particular fact : The regimen that is used to determine the variation of the basic wage includes a certain number of items.' I particularly draw attention to the fact that the basic wage is not assessed on",41,Notes
126,Mr Eadden,The interest on the wel,42,Notes
127,Mr Burke,"those items; but from time to time the variation is decided upon them, because they are regarded as a means for obtaining an indication of the variations of the cost of living. Each of the items appearing thereon represents a group of commodities that are necessary to the living of a family. I point out, however, that there is one group of foods which, next to dairy products, are regarded as the most important preventive foods that may bo given to children. They are represented * by one item, and that item does not help us in any way to get a true picture of the cost of the group. I refer to fruits and vegetables, which every dietitian in the world to-day insists must ""form a part of a well-balanced diet, particularly for young people. The only item in the "" C "" series which represents that group is potatoes; and for very good-reasons. Throughout the last several years the price of potatoes has been maintained artificially at a low level. Therefore, the increase of cost in that particular group of foods has never entered in any way into. a variation of the basic wage and the cost of living. Until the basic wage is revised, many people in this country will not get the right quantity of foods to maintain them in health. ' Every survey that has been made in the last few years shows that' to be true-that there are .thousands of undernourished children in this country. been the case. Dame ENID LYONS -That has always been the case. It has been, and still is, partly due to the fact that the people have not been sufficiently well instructed as to the kinds of food that should be consumed. It' is also true that people on the basic wage have not the means to provide a sufficiency of those foods. So, I look to the time when the basic wage will be revised. This Parliament has no power to do that. But it has in its hands a power which could have been, but has not been, used to clear the way, at any rate for some improvement-that is, by extension of the child endowment to cover the first child. In respect of every family, that would have the effect of raising the basic wage by 7s. 6d. a week, without, as [121] happens under the present system, giving to a large number of people with no family responsibilities a rise equal to that obtained by those who have assumed such responsibilities. I am perfectly well aware that, at the present time, one of the difficulties that we face is the circulation of too much money relative to the volume of goods that may be purchased. I suggest, however, that the sort of goods which would be purchased by the family man, as. a result of my proposal, are not, for the most part, in the class of. goods that I have mentioned, namely, those that are in short supply. We are not short of food, but we are short of'the organization that will ensure its proper distribution. Money diverted into tbe hands of the mother of a family would be expended in legitimate channels and would not have the same impact on the national economy that any other increase would have. All spending will be in legitimate channels and we shall not have the inflationary tendency that follows when moneyis put into the hands of persons lacking proper responsibility. Some people will say that this is not the proper time to introduce a reform of the kind that I advocate. Obviously, the Government-believes that it is not. However, the Government can find money for a thousand other things, and this is something that .we cannot afford to neglect, because it is really an' insurance for the future. We are now creating a tremendous hospital organization, the cost of which will be staggering, and we think we are doing something splendid; but if we founded our social services on the well-being of the children there would be no need to assume such a staggering burden for health services. An extension of child endowment is the first reform that any government with a sense of responsibility should undertake. It would ensure a better family life in tbe future for children born into the'homes, a better chance of getting help for mothers who have to carry out the duties connected with the raising of children, and a better chance, also, for the men who, in the future, should beexpected . to produce still larger families. We are all the timedying but for population, and the neglect of this end of the age scale can be",42,Notes
128,Mr Mountjoy,"That has alwaysno longer excused. I repeat that I am bitterly disappointed that the Government has not seen fit to do what I suggest. I will not rest until this matter of child endowment, which wasintroduced by a government representing -parties on this side of the House at a most difficult period of our history, is extended as it ought to be. I have believed up to the present that the time was not opportune to make a move. However, the time is now ripe, and unless the Government takes appropriate action it will be condemned by the people who put their faith in it in the past. During the last few minutes, we have listened to a most extraordinary speech ov this measure, the purpose of which is to provide a method of financing the social services of the country. Naturally, honourable members on this side of the House are interested in the subject of the basic wage, aiid in measures designed to improve the ""standard of living of parents and children, and, indeed, of the whole community. At the moment, however, the committee is not considering that aspect of the basic Avage, or related subjects. It is dealing with a measure to impose a tax on incomes for the financing of social services which have'been introduced during the last two or three years by tbe present Government. I am very interested in social services, because it has been my privilege, during the last few years, to look very closely at the shortcomings of social service provisions in Australia. Working.with me on the Social Security Committee were members representing all parties in this Parliament. From time to time, the committee made recommendations to the Government, which later brought down legislation to give effect to them. The recommendations were themselves based on evidence submitted to the Social Service Committee by witnesses representing all sections of the community. There is now in operation a whole range of social services designed for the uplift and betterpeople about which she talks so much ment of the people. These include provisions to deal with unemployment and sickness, and others designed for the special benefit of families. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) departed from the this side of the House act in unison, but realms of reality and practical politics as they apply at the moment. In no other period of the history of Australia has so much been done in so short a time for the uplift of the people as has been done by this Government, despite the fact that during most of the time the country was at war. It seems to me highly improper that the honourable member for Darwin should attack the measure before the committee in the way she did. Everybody knows that the basic wage is out moded, that it bas its short-comings, but what did honourable members on the opposition side ever do about it when they had the opportunity? What would tbey do if they were in power to-morrow? What did they do when an attempt was made to obtain increased power for this Parliament, so. that it might legislate in respect of some of the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Darwin? While she may have been, in her own mind, opposed to the policy of her political friends, she nevertheless used the air to support that policy, and to oppose the very things which she now advocates. It is time that somebody told the honourable member for Darwin the truth, and dis^ regarded for the moment the fact that she is' the. only woman in the House. We all meet here on equal-terms, and I am becoming just"" a little tired of listening to what is described outside this House as "" sob s t u f f be c a u s e that is what it amounts to. There may be, and. I believe there are, short-comings in our social services as they now exist. I say that, not in apology for the Government, because it has not yet had time to give full effect to Labour policy. the next Parliament. shall advance progressively, .and later on the honourable member for Darwin will have an opportunity to support, not only with her voice, but also with her vote, measures for the betterment of the now.

She practically suggested. that Mrs. Jessie Street should replace the present honourable member for Wentworth. If the honourable member for Darwin will read the recommendations of the Social Security Committee she will see what the Government is aiming at in the way of social services. She will then be in a better position to understand what the Government has done, and is doingnot merely talking about-for the less fortunate people of the community in a most difficult time in our country's history. Silting suspended from 6 to S p.m. . I 'sympathize with and support the views, expressed by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) as to -the desirability of including the first' child in the benefits of the child endowment scheme. Very grave consideration would have to be given to the subject in order to bring about that desirable result in the best possible way We should, at all costs, make certain that any liberalizawill have to be scrapped or reduced betion of the child endowment payments shall be permanent. desire to bring about a repetition of the factors which ultimately broke down the child endowment system in New South Wales. In the original Child Endow-, ment Bill, brought down in this Parliament by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), then Minis-ter for Labour and National Service, the first child was excluded from benefit because the basic wage was deemed to provide for the needs of a man, his wife and one child. I believe that the time has now come when the basis on which the basic . wage is determined should be altered to cover the' requirements of a man and his wife only, and that all children should be brought within the scope of the child endowment scheme. At the same time, I urge that the regimen on which the basic wage is computed should be reviewed. In stead ..of the basic wage. being computed ou the basis of 40 or 50 items, we might very well adopt the New Zealand system, in which 110 or 120 items are taken into account, including the items mentioned by the honourable member for Darwin. Investigation and review along those lines is long overdue. The only way in which provision for such a change could be made in the bill now before us would be to wipe out some of the benefits tbe Government has included in it, in order to provide sufficient money in the National Welfare Fund for the payment of child endowment in respect of all children. The Government is not likely to adopt that course. The only other way would be to introduce an .entirely new bill. I should like to see established a self-contained child endowment fund. When the original legislation was introduced by the honourable member for Fawkner, approximately 90 per cent, of from the pay-roll tax, and the balance, to cover anomalies which were discovered as experience was gained of the operation of the scheme, was to be met from general revenue. In my view, all social service funds should be made as self-contained as is possible. If they are made too'much dependent upon contributions from general revenue, sooner or later the benefits cause of the diminution of tax receipts We have no in days of financial stringency. I am totally opposed to the imposition of taxes earmarked for special purposes, as is done in connection with the National Welfare Fund, unless adequate steps are taken to ensure that the funds so raised are sufficient, to carry out the purpose for which they are provided, without reliance on other budgetary assistance. As instances of sound schemes of that kind I cite the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund and the Federal Aid Roads Fund. Reference to the last budget papers submitted to the Parliament shows that the contributions to"" the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund are invested in Com-, monwealth Consolidated Stock, the New South Wales Rural Bank, and debentures issued by the Sydney County Council, all of which return an interest rate of 4 or 5 per cent. The moneys placed to the credit of the National Welfare Fund,",44,Notes
134,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [S.o],"the contributions to the fund were derivedhowever, are largely invested in treasury bills, or what may be described as Government I Oil's. In the one case the assets, are realizable on the market, whereas in the other they merely represent a changeover from one compartment of the public purse to another. I am especially opposed to reliance on taxes imposed year by year for social services of this nature. The danger in this system is that in any sudden upset of our national economy taxes may not be able to be levied and services may consequently have to be diminished at a time when their continuance is of the highest national and individual importance. In my opinion, the proper way to finance social benefits is by means of ""a contributory scheme, not subject to a means test, that would build up in good years a fund, unassailable by the Treasurers of the day, which would be able to meet the pinch of lean years. fall in bad years just as the receipts from taxation would fall? in the fund would be available just as are the assets of insurance funds and the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, the beneficiaries of which are paid in the years of depression just as they are in» the years of plenty. Australia has had very striking lessons' in that regard. . Mr Fisher first introduced the maternity allowance without a means test. A Labour Treasurer, Mr Theodore, on the 10th July, 1931, however; reduced the long-standing maternity allowance from £5 to £4, and brought in a law which provided that the allowance would not be paid in cases where the income of the claimant and her husband during the preceding twelve months exceeded £260. It has taken fifteen years to restore the maternity allowance to a proper basis. orable gentleman vpte for its reduction? honourable members will read the Hansard record they will find that in 1932 I solidly general voted for the retention of the invalid and old-age pension in this chamber through the whole of a long all-night sitting. In 1931 I was in bed with appendicitis for two months, and was not in the House during the period when the proposal to reduce the maternity allowance was discussed. The records of the Parliament will prove the truth of that statement. As then Leader of, the Country party I said, as I say now,, that the best means of lifting people out of the effects of troublous times is not by increasing but by diminishing the burden of taxation. When I was able to return to active politics following the death of my son in 1933, I supported every move which' would enable the country to return to a state of prosperity. In 1931 invalid and old age pensions were reduced by a Labour Treasurer by 2s. 6d. a week. In the following year a similar reduction was effected because of.the difficult position that had arisen as the result of the failure of the Government to collect the desired revenue from taxation. The Labour Government also reduced the permissible income of applicants for the invalid and old-age pension from £84 10s. to £78 per annum, and war pensions were for the first time treated as income for the purpose of calculating the social pension. An abortive attempt was also made to treat the value of the pensioner's home over and above £500 as property. These reductions were made despite the fact that the Labour Government had introduced a new tax, the sales tax, which touched the people in the lower income groups to a greater degree relatively than those in the higher income groups. The obvious alternative to this system, which was so subject to a downward alteration with depressed conditions, was a national contributory scheme to cover the whole field. Such a scheme was introduced by me in 1928, and by a subsequent Treasurer, Mr Casey, in 1938; but on both occasions the Labour party strenuously opposed it. As a very unsatisfactory alternative, the present Treasurer, in February, i943, established the National Welfare Fund, ostensibly for the purpose of making the future safe for the recipients of the benefits. On the l l t h February, 1943, he proposed to pay into this fund out of revenue ' an' amount of £30,000,000 a. year, or a sum equal to one-quarter of the total annual collections from the income tax of individuals, whichever was the less. In order to finance this fund, he increased the income tax on individuals by an amount of £43,000,000,",45,Notes

He also made the personal exertion rate commence at 6d. in the £1 on £104 and rise to a maximum of 18s. 6d. in the £1 on incomes in excess of £5,000 per annum. In effect, this permanently fixed Commonwealth income tax collections 'on individuals at £120,000,000 per annum at the least. It also fixed for all time a permanent income tax on the lowest scales 'of wages and salaries. He admitted disguising the volume of this tax by increasing the number of instalments from 40 to 52 each year. On the 29 th September, 1943, the Treasurer took pride in this accomplishment when he said that, as an important contribution to the budget, the Government had obtained the approval of the Parliament in the previous March to increase the rates and widen the field of income taxation on individuals. The right honourable gentleman saidThe increased yield is expected to exceed last year's collection by £43,000.000, and this w ill cover tlie requirements of tlie National Welfare Fund nnd make some provision for other expenditure. In his budget for 1943-44, the Treasurer showed the first payment into the fund as £29,750,000, and in the succeeding year, a paymentOf £30,000,000,. even though very few payments were being made out of the fund owing to the failure by the Government to obtain parliamentary en dorsement for, or to implement, the. necessary legislation. The Leader of tbe Australian Country party has shown conclusively that this fuud has been used for other purposes, and that the balances that remain are represented only, by treasury-bills. In the financial year 1945-46, the Treasurer, realized that this original tax was not quite sufficient to meet the position, and effectively"" prevented any lightening of the income tax burden on individuals. In hi3 budget for that year, he said that a new approach was essential, and that he would "" charge all health and social services to one fund -the National Welfare Fund-and impose a social services contribution at a flat rate on all incomes from the lowest up"". as a flat rate, would return £46,000,000 per annum, and that expenditure in 194546 would amount to £65,000,000. Tn his financial statement for 1946-47, he esti[122] mated that the income of. the National Welfare Fund would be £61,000,000, and -that expenditure would amount to £77,000,000, leaving a deficiency of £16,000,000. right honourable member's time has expired. Efforts by honourable members opposite to discredit what the Labour party has . done in the field of social services fall flat in view of its great achievements some of which occurred in the years when we had to battle against a hostile Senate. I remind honourable members that it was-j not till two years ago that the influx of Labour adherents . to the Senate gave full effect to the will of the people expressed at the general elections in 1943. A .short recital of what we have done would not go amiss in view of the belittling statements from honourable gentlemen opposite. We have increased expenditure on social benefits from £.17,000,000 to £77,000,000 a year, a truly remarkable achievement in view of -the fact that we also had to pilot this nation through the / greatest war in history. We have been attacked for not having done something about the basic wage. Any one would think that honourable gentlemen ""opposite instituted all social reforms in this coun: try.

Had the basic wage been increased, the employing class' in this community would have been called upon to pay out millions of pounds, but instead the Menzies Government relieved the employers of the responsibility by paying child endowment out of the Treasury. It remained for the Labour Government to make the child endowment a more, respectable amount by -increasing it 50 per cent. Our policy is that the family man can most be helped by family allowances. We do know, however, that both the rate and the method of compilation of the basic wage oivght to be reviewed. There is no need for me to stress the obvious. Every one knows what we have done in providing social benefits. Before the last general elections, hundreds of women 'said to me, ""We must vote for the Labour party because of .the great job that it has of all people he would support that. I done for us"". opposite have the temerity to criticize our methods, but their criticism is not echoed by the people, whereas the national insurance scheme that was passed by this Parliament during the Lyons regime, but was never operated, was treated with hostility throughout the community. I know of no other, legislation that has received such a cold re"" ception. Meetings of protest against it were held all over the land. £90,000 was expended on taking evidence about the practicability of that scheme, but it never came into force. Even if it had operated, the benefits provided would liave been negligible compared with thosethat this Government has bestowed on the people. The National Health and Pensions Insurance .Scheme was sectional in character and it covered only a section of the people. The act provided unequal benefits for men and women. The amount of sickness benefit was only 20s. a week to a man and 15s. a week to a woman. It made .no provision for medical treatment of a wife or dependent children. A man had to pay Is. 6d. a week for himself for health insurance and an old-age pension, and if he wanted his wife to receive a pension at 60 years of Mr Sheehy. Social Services [REPRESENTATIVES.!

Apart from all the other long terms in office that the anti-Labour forces enjoyed, they bad from 1932 to 1941 to do something tangible for the people, but did nothing except pass the abortive National Health and Pensions.Act. So reactionary are they that I know that when the referendum campaign is being waged they will strenuously oppose this Parliament obtaining power to control conditions of employment in industry so that it shall be able to do more for the workers. amazed by the unfriendly attitude of the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) towards the proposal of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) that child endowment should be paid in respect of the first child in a family, I should have thought Honourable gentlemen am led to wonder what are the views of his colleagues. He described her speech as extraordinary, but her proposal is sound, and I have no doubt that before long it will be adopted'. The' Labour party professes interest in larger families and more family comforts, but the honourable member for Bass does not seem to share that interest. It is true that the Social Security Committee, of which I About am privileged to be a member, has made many recommendations in respect of social services, most of which, I am glad to 3ay, have been adopted. In the last two years the committee has mainly concentrated on medical and hospital benefits,, as requested by the Government, but it has riot been asked to make any recommendation to the Government about family allowances, which are of the greatest importance. The honourable member for Bass said 'that as this bill dealt with the raising of the money for social services it was improper for the honourable member for Darwin to raise the matter of child endowment, but the social services at present operative, are mostly of a negative character. In other words, they provide benefits to help grown people over misfortune, sickness and old -age. They are entitled to that",47,Notes
147,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [8.26],"I washelp.,, but. of more benefit, to, the. country would"" be steps, to. enable, people to avoid the. need. to. seek many of those benefits. The honourable, member for Darwin, proposes something of great wisdom The structure of the nation should be based on the. family unit, and we sho.iild devote more attention to infants and children, who require assistance more than any one else in the community does. The honourable member for Darwin pointed out that the basic wage to-day is not adequate for the needs of a family of threehusband, wife and one child Indeed, the basic wage is less than whal; that family unit requires. The standard on which the basic wage is fixed does not -conform to present conditions, particularly category 3, which contains a large number of protective foods for the maintenance of the health of the individual. During the last few years, the price of those ' fpods has increased greatly. The prices of vegetables, have risen by between 50 per cent, and 60 per -cent. Eggs, which are not subsidized, are much dearer than they were a few years ago. The price of fruit, which forms an important part of the diet of a family, has increased considerably. All those foods are not taken into the calculations when the basic wage is being computed. Rents and the cost of clothing also have increased steeply in the last few years. As those alterations have not been taken into account, a family is not able to live comfortably on the basic wage and maintain its health. Therefore, the basic wage should be re-assessed on a -new and sounder basis. -Commonwealth Parliament to determine the basic wage? is not the proper authority to do so. In my opinion, family allowances should be payable in. addition to the basic-wage. I consider that the basic wage should be fixed on the basis of the needs of a man and his wife, and a. family allowance should be added to it. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy) mentioned that the Labour Government of New South Wales was the first government in Australia to introduce child endowment. Whilst that statement may be correct, I point outthat this Parliament deals,, notwith New. South Wales alone, but with the whole of Australia. The Menzies Government has the' credit for having introduced' a scheme of child; eh: dowment applicable to the Commonwealth as a whole. After the next elecr ti'ons, a government formed by honourable members on this side of the chamber will deal with child' endowment. I commend the honourable member for Darwin for having raised this matter. have listened to many speeches to-day on this very important measure, and the general complaint of honourable members opposite is that Australians are very heavily taxed. Some honourable members even contendedI do not agree with them-that we are the. heaviest taxed people in the world. But even if we were, we live in the best country in the world. However, the truth is that we happen to be one of the most lightly taxed peoples. that my statement is correct. able member will tell his constituents that. member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) spoke a good deal about taxing people in the lower income groups.

They do not like the hollowness of their professions to be exposed. They do not like the public to be told the truth about the legislation that is being submitted to Parliament. , The social services contribution which will be'required under this measure will be a definite burden on the wage-earning community. A man earning £3S5 a year, who has a wife and two children to maintain-a n average family man-wil l not be pleased at having to contribute £27 17s. 6d. a year for social service benefits, most of which were being provided free by the Menzies and Fadden Governments. Such persons are valuable members of the community, though they would be even more valuable if their families were larger. This impost will fall on many artisans, tradesmen, and clerks. I do not think any one will disagree with my statement that an impost of £27 17s. 6d. a year on a man who is earning little more than £7 a week will be a hardship, especially as he will receive for it very little more in social benefits than he was previously receiving without any such tax. The Government's policy in respect of social services offers no inducement to thrift. Under the national health and pensions scheme enacted by the previous Government there was no. means test.

He said that a man with an income of £125 a year would be called upon to pay 5s a week in social services contribution. The official statement issued to honourable members by the Treasurer indicated that a man with an income of £125 a year and no dependants would have to pay only £3 4s. a year, which is a great deal less than 5s. a week.

188,Mr Bryson (Bourke) [8.58],"W ecan be excused on tbe ground that bis arithmetic was at fault, but he went on to refer to a man with a wife and two children whose income was £3S5 a year. He attempted to prove that the social services contribution payable by that man is out of proportion to the benefit that he will receive from the social services fund. His income tax of £27 17s. 6d. a year, he claimed, is most unfair. But-he conveniently forgot to mention that the wife of such a man receives from -tlie National Welfare Fund £19 10s. a year by way of child endowment. In deliberately omitting to mention that, he merely followed the lead that had been set by previous Opposition speakers, who attempted to misrepresent the position in regard to tax reductions. Almost without exception, honourable members opposite have claimed that the tax reductions proposed by the Government are insuffi? cient, and that a much greater reduction should be made over the whole of the income tax field. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) not only wanted the income tax to be reduced, but also demanded a. big reduction .of the company tax reduction. honourable member to change his mind. mind. The honourable member ismisrepresenting me. latest statement, the honourable member demanded some reduction. every other member of the Opposition has demanded further tax reductions. Some of them have gone even further. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), for example, demanded that the Government should immediately pay child endowment in respect of the first child. Such an extension of the scheme would involve an additional expenditure from.the National Welfare Fund of £18,000,000 per annum. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr tion, they suggest that the basic wage Ryan) supported that proposal, and also spoke in favour of the reduction pf income tax, the company tax', and various other taxes. Mr RY.AN -That is not correct. Opposition were reasonably honest, when demanding additional expenditure on social services they would suggest where the additional revenue could be' raised. Demanding in one breath that income tax shall be substantially reduced, and in the next breath that social service payments shall be increased, does not make sense. Those honourable members opposite who intend to contribute to the debate would assist the committee if they were to make sensible suggestions, not all sorts of demands with tongue in cheek. Had they the opportunity, they would not do what they claim should be done. Members of the Opposition have also dragged the basic wage into the debate, and have claimed that it needs to be revised. I agree that it should be revised upward. Such a revision should have been made many years ago. I remind honourable members opposite that about 1918 or 1919 the government of the day, led by the present right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), appointed what was known as the Piddington Basic Wage Royal Commission, which conducted the most exhaustive inquiry into the cost of living that has ever been made in Australia. The commission was representative of employers and employees, and the chairman was appointed by an anti-Labour government. In a unanimous report, it recommended' a considerable increase of the basic wage, and drew up a complete regimen for the fixing of it on the.basis of the costs of food, rent, &c. The GoAlmost vernment refused to accept that' unanimous report; and in all the subsequent years the anti-Labour governments that have been, in office did not make a genuine effort to improve the basic wage. Rather, they endeavoured at every opportunity to grind the worker down a little further,' and take from him some of the very meagre wage he was receiving. Now that, the members of the parties which then composed the Government are in the cold shades of Opposishould be revised. If they were given the task, I 'am sure that the revision would be downward rather than upward. the depression was 6s. a week.",52,Notes

Advocacy of the revision of the basic wage may appear to be very good window-dressing before a general election. I have been agitating for its revision for many years. As a member of the industrial movement, I have endeavoured to induce various anti-Labour governments to revise it upward, but on all occasions I received scant courtesy from them. When the present Government submits a proposal for the improvement of the basic wage, honourable members opposite will violently oppose it, as they have opposed every proposal designed to benefit the more poorly paid section of the community. This Government has endeavoured to do things. So far it has succeeded in conferring quite a number of benefits on that section of the community which needs them most. make the strides it would like to have made; nevertheless, it has improved the lot of the lower-paid section of the community. I remind the Opposition that in a short period, it increased the old-age Although that legislation b.ecame the law pension from £1 Is. to £1 12s. 6d. a week. of the land, the Government of the day That could have been done years ago. According to honourable members opposite, the old people can exist on £1 Is. a week; one of the greatest examples of political thereforethey should not be given more than that. This Government increased the child endowment from 5s. to 7s. 6d. a week. In future legislation it will provide for an increase of the income which an invalid or an old-age pensioner will be permitted to earn and still be entitled to the pension. It also the community. After leading the people intends to liberalize the conditions under which those pensions may be obtained. It has made provision for unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits, and will continue to improve its record in regard to the conferring of social benefits. But these cost moucy, and that need is the basis of the proposals we are now considering, which have caused members of the Opposition to shed "" crocodile tears "" on behalf of the lower-paid section of the community. I remind those honourable members .that their national insurance proposals would oblige the lower paid section of the community to pay for those benefits at a considerably higher rate than is involved in the proposals of the Governwarmly support the proposal of the ment, which has decided to apply what it believes to be a fair system for the raising of -the revenue that will be needed. . Tax is being imposed according to ability to pay. The person with the largest income will make ' the greatest contribution. He is in a position to do so. Probably he willnot derive any benefit from the National Welfare Fund. The person on the low income will make the least contribution. The man with a wife and two children on £385 a year who pays an income tax of £27 17s. 6d., referred to by the honourable member for Richmond, receives, as I have said, £19 10s. a year by way of child endowment, apart from hospital, sickness, unemployment and other benefits to which he will be entitled in return for his payment of a social services contribution of £8 7s. 6d. a year. That is a considerably better proposal than any which the Opposition has advanced. It has not been' able to The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) reminded the committee of the national insurance scheme which a government that he supported passed through this Parliament in 193S. did not attempt to implement it, and it has not yet begun to operate. That is hypocrisy ever set in this Parliament. The. attempt was made to delude the people into believing that they were being given a social service that they would enjoy for the whole of their lives. Such a scheme would prove exceptionally expensive for the lower-paid section of "" up the lane"" with promises, the Go-, vernment left'them there. Having gone so far as to translate its promises into law, it did not have the decency to implement its legislation. No member of the Opposition, since the bill was passed in. 1938, has made a reasonable effort to have the act proclaimed. Even in this year, they still do not want it to be put in operation.

197,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [9.13],"Ihonorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), which I believe represents a desirable extension of the child endowment. That reform would meet the needs of the. scheme that we who now sit on the Opposition side of the chamber introduced in 1941. At that time, we made provision by way of a family endowment scheme for each child in the family under sixteen years of age, other than the first child. ""We did not include the first ehild-hecause the Arbitration Court, having investigated the basic wage, had come to the conclusion that it was adequate for a man, his wife and one child. The judges of the court said that it would provide a bare allowance for a man, wife and two children, and that hardship would be caused to a family of more than two children. Therefore, we provided for the needs of a family consisting of more than one child. There is good reason to believe that to-day the need exists for an extension of that scheme, if the requirements of those families in which there are several children, or even only one child, are to be met. That is particularly so when the head of the family is receiving the basic wage, or very little more. As the honourable member for Bourke( Mr member .for Darwin (Dame Enid Bryson)' pointed out, it is not unusual to have violent dislocations of purchasing power after a war. Indeed, after World WarI . a royal commission was set up to go fully into what should be the basic wage, and it recommended a figure so much higher than the then basic wage that the Arbitration Court did not accept the recommendation lest weakened capacity for successful .competition might lead to unemployment. Since World War II . , similar factors have been' operating. Most honourable members must have reached the conclusion that the method of computing the basic wage is to-day divorced from reality. It is difficult to believe that the basic wage represents a real assessment of the needs of a Working man and his family. The official Government view is that the purchasing power of the pound has declined by only 19 per cent., but we all know that the decline is much more than that. A little while ago, I read a newspaper article written by an investigator whom the paper had sent around the shops to price articles.' The examples cited in the article are not extreme, and most' honourable members will be able to recall others of a similar kind. The investigator examined the position in regard to the needs of himself and his wife in the matter of clothing. He could make no comparison in regard to children's clothing from. first-hand knowledge, but a neighbour had handed. over to him tbe invoices for the purchase of clothing for a boy six years older than his own. Here is the result of his investigations1030. 1946. £ s. d. £ s. d.

The costs in 1946 were £12 lls' -6d., compared with £6 10s. 3d. in 1940. Then he had a look at some of the .items to which reference was made to-day by the honourable Lyons), including fruit and vegetables. It has been impressed upon us that these foods are important as a protection against sickness, but to all intents and purposes they are omitted from the basic wage regimen. Eor these, items the figures were found to be as follows:1939. 194C. s. d. s. d. Oranges2 0 2 6 Apples, per doz. 1 4 2 9 Bacon1 10 2 3 Plum jam, 24-oz. tin 0 7£ 1 3 In addition, the scarcity of some of the commodities has frequently caused the housewife to. pay more than the prices mentioned Although, so far as needs are concerned, we are concerned mostly with persons on the basic wage, we must remember that in Australia few persons are'on the basic wage. In most industries there is a loading for skill, however little skill may be required. This is an additional reason why wages should be reviewed. Eor instance, in the metal trades, while the basic wage itself has fluctuated according to variation-of the cost of living, margins for skill have remained steady. Consequently, the benefit which the skilled worker formerly enjoyed . as a recompense for his skill has diminished. Let us consider the matter from the point of view of the ex-serviceman. The Army, instead of following the civil practice in regard to child endowment, paid endowment for all children, including . the first. A certain payment was fixed for a singlesoldier. Then the married soldier received so much more^ and if there were children, there was a special . loading for each child. In my opinion, there should be -a basic payment for a man and his wife, and a substantial loading for all children, including tbe first. volve a reduction of the basic wage. ings already given have not resulted in any reduction. The basic wage in Australia will rise, probably sharply, in the next few years, and this will be an opportunity for the Government or the Ar1 bitration Court to work out a new arrangement under which a man and his wife will be regarded as the unit, in assessing the basic wage. Even a single man is usually putting money aside for the time when he will marry, or he may have already assumed responsibility for the maintenance of some members of his family. In the Army, a married private was required to allot 3s. 6d. a day to his wife, making f l 4s. 6d. a week. In addition, his wife was paid f l l is . 6d. for herself, f l Is. for the first child, 14s. for tbe second, and 10s. 6d. for the third. Thus, apart from what her husband received, a soldier's wife with three children bad £5 Is. 6d. a week coming into the home. For his part, the husband, in addition to the pay he retained, received food, clothing and shelter, a certain amount of medical .attention, and concessions on certain purchases. It 'was worked out by a parliamentary committee which considered gratuities to servicemen that a private in the Army, with one child, was on a financial basis comparable with that of an industrial worker receiving £8 a week. Today, hundreds of thousands of servicemen are back in civil life. Their families had become accustomed during the war to an income equivalent to £8 a week, which is a comparatively high rate of pay for industrial workers. In fact, the average wage worked out by Government authorities is £5 19s. 8d. for adult male employees engaged in factory employment. The wife of an ex-servicemen, if present rates continue, and if no provision be made for family needs, will be much worse off now than when her husband was in the forces. . What .applies to the wife of a private, applies with greater force to the wife of a non-commissioned officer or to the wife of an officer. It is' obvious that if the living standards which existed' during the war-and they were not regarded as high-ar e to be maintained 'there must be a general increase' of wages. member's time has expired. member has risen, I shall take my second p.eriod. I have no wish to labour the point, because I am sure that honourable members of all parties will give serious thought to this matter. Parliament must examine the problem carefully, although honourable members may well ask what role Parliament can usefully play. Its capacity to do something practical is limited by various considerations, some of them constitutional and some associated with policy. At the present time, there is a limit under the Constitution to tbe power of Parliament to deal directly with industrial matters. I am one of those who do not desire to see any extension of the industrial power of the Commonwealth if such extension would take away powers which rightly belong to the States and destroy the need for co-operation between the Commonwealth and tbe States. If we are to look to the Arbitration Court to remedy this position entii-ely we shall find that its hands are tied. The court may deal with the question of the basic wage.

Honpoint out the sources from which the addiorable members opposite have asked how tional moneys could be obtained. The could this be done. The honourable Prime Minister has told us that the member for Bourke( Mr Bryson) number of those engaged in gainful empointed out that a considerable sum of ployment has increased by 400,000 since money would be required to give effect to the 30th June, 1945. At that date some the proposal of the honourable member 2,600,000 persons were so employed; at for Darwin. I believe he estimated the the 30th June, 1946, the number had inamount to be £18,000,000.

202,Mr Conjslan,From what source,57,Notes
203,Mr Holt,"If I had the time at mycome into the taxable field during the current financial year, and their number will be added to as discharges from the forces continue. ' The Government has reduced ineome tax this year by a total amount which represents approximately 8 per cent, over the whole income tax field. I emphasize that percentage be'cause it has been represented that thu reductions range from 20 per cent, to more than 41 per cent. the full year since the war ended amounts to £37,000,000. nounced by the Prime Minister in relation to income tax collections last year represent an over-all reduction of 8 per cent. If they are related solely to income tax derived from personal incomes they represent a reduction of only 11 per cent. Tbe point I make is that even with the minor reductions already announced there have been consequential increases in volume derived under certain other headings. For example, the revenue from excise, which covers luxury items such as beer, tobacco, cigarettes and the like, has been increased, and as more purcha.s-, ing 'power becomes available, as the result of income tax reductions, receipts from that source will grow considerably. Although there has been a considerable decrease of the rates of sales tax, the yield from that impOst has increased until, for tbe year just ended, it was almost £6,000,000 more than the budget estimate. As more goods become available for consumption, and the .reductions of income tax become effective, we can. expect purchases to increase with resultant accretions to the revenue from sales tax. Last year governmental expenditure was reduced by £84.000,000 in respect of defence and war services alone, and we can, I believe, con.fidently envisage a very much greater reduction under that heading this year. It is not possible to give a complete financial picture because of the absence of details. I have yet to meet a Treasurer who will, even allow the members of his own party to know exactly what is happening with his finances-and I am sure the present Treasurer is no exception. If such reticence is displaved. towards the Treasurer's own' colleagues what chance have we to learn the facts of the financial position of the Government? We are able to glean sufficient information, however, to enable us to form the conclusion that not only would taxation reductions on the scale we have suggested be possible but also that the social reforms sponsored by the honourable member for Darwin should be within our. reach in the near future. I hope that the committee will not decide this matter on a party basis, and that honourable members generally will support the proposal which the honourable member for Darwin has so ably presented for their consideration. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [9.40]. -This debate and debates on the taxation proposals of the Gdvernment generally have demonstrated clearly the disturbing fact that there is still insufficient appreciation of the special difficulties of families. There has been constant talk of doing something for those in the lowerincome ranges, but there has never at. any stage in our history been sufficient realization of the particular needs. of families. That criticism applies not only to the present -Government, but also to its predecessors. I have pointed out on many occasions that the granting of concessions in taxing measures to taxpayers with families does not in any way meet the situation. I am very much indebted to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) for his able speech in support of my proposal. I had not intended to make any particular move in this matter other than to direct the attention of the committee to the need for making special ' provision for families.

MENZIES (Kooyong-Leade r of tbe Opposition) [9.55] I do not propose to occupy any time in discussing the basic issue in relation to this and the next measure. As all honourable members know, we on this side believe that in order a form of contributory social services to produce complete security, complete soundness, and a proper establishment of the rights of contributors to receive benefits without a means test, a contributory system ought to be introduced. RutI will not discuss that, because I have no doubt that it will be the subject matter of a great deal of discussion elsewhere in the next month or two. Taking the bill against the background of the' existing law, I agree with the Minister that it -liaises from 12s. '6d. to £1 :a week the income that an invalid pensioner or an old-age pensioner may have without his pension being affected. In the case of a. blind pensioner, the amount of allowable income is increased from £5 to £5 7s. 6d.'a week. Certain items of property are eliminated from consideration in the assessment of a pension, and an anomaly is disposed of by removing the disqualification for pension benefit of an adult invalid whose parents are deemed to be adequately maintaining'him. Assuming the acceptance of the present general structure of the legislation, I agree. that these amendments are such as to command the support of both sides of the House. They will confer real relief in ""a great number of cases. They will extend benefit to persons 'not 'now entitled to benefits, 'and I -believe 'that in each case the 'benefit will be of a kind of .which the House and 'the country will approve. I therefore do not propose to offer any objection'to the second'reading. introducing this bill, the. Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) saidI t is with considerable pleasure that I move the -second reading of this bill , which provides a substantial measure of relaxation of the means test in relation to 'invalid and old-age pensions payments. I am sure that the Prime Minister. ( Mr Chifley) and my other Cabinet colleagues would permit me to say that this bill is the first step in a long-range plan designed to eliminate completely the means I rise to say a few words particularly -about the abolition of the means test and the part that this bill will play in the achievement of that most desirable objective. The abolition of the means test has received wide publicity recently, particularly since the introduction of by the Labour Government. Social reform has .always been in the forefront of Labour's policy, and to Labour alone goes the credit for the improvements that have been made in our .social order. In common with other honourable members on. this side, I support the abolition of the means test, particularly, as it applies to social, services. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and members of the Liberal party have held out the .abolition of the means test as ah electioneering bait, and I propose to deal with their approach to 'the problem and with the criticism levelled against the Labour party in that regard before dealing with the "" provisions of this bill. It is only a few weeks since the Leader of the Opposition took exception to an advertisement that appeared in the-press'over the names of the leaders of the Australian Labour party. He stated that the advertisement misrepresented the facts and was altogether undesirable. I produce another advertisement which was inserted in a Sydney journal by the Liberal party to explain its social services programme. I claim that this, advertisement is dishonest, and that it was inserted for the",59,Chifley
208,Mr Daly (Martin) [9.57],"I ndeliberate purpose of misleading tbe people. Compared with it , any political advertisement which may have been published previously fades into insignificance,. It readsALL TO. GAIN AND NOTHING TO LOSE. The Liberal party maintains that the means test is humiliating, and a penalty for thrift. It contends that social benefits should be enjoyed by all. When social services are placed on a contributory basis,'the means test can be abolished. Pensioners and other people without means will not be asked to contribute when the means test is abolished. The Liberal party will not reduce, pensions and it will not. curtail the present pension payments! It will not reduce child endowment but will extend this benefit to the first child. The contributory social security plan of the Liberal party will remove the fear and uncertainty of the future, and provide protection ii) sickness, unemployment, incapacity, &c. A Liberal government means a better to-morrow for every one. When we read a fine-sounding advertisement like that, we should examine the background and achievements of those who inserted it . The Liberal party and the Australian Country party have been in power in this ParliamentI say that they have been in power because they had majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate-for approximately 35' years since federation, but they have not done anything to achieve the objectives stated in that advertisement. Labour party which was in office for short periods, including the economic depression and World War II two most tragic periods in our historyhas a great record, particularly regarding social services. To expose the hollow hypocrisy of the advertisement, I refer to the statement of the Ministerf or Labour and National Service when introducing the bill. He relating to permissable income and the amount of property that a pen^ sioner may own, had not been altered since 1923. What has been the position"" since that year ? United Australia party5 Australian Country party governments were in power until 194.1. with the excep' tion of the period 1-929^31, when the Scullin Government was in office but not in power. honourable members opposite did not make aaiy effort to abolish the means' test. Consequently, my purpose in speaking this evening is to expose the hypocrisy of those members of the Liberal party who were associated with the publication of the advertisement, and' to warn the electors of the type of people who are making these promises in the hope of winning votes, at the forthcon> ing elections. On the other side of the ledger, the Labour Government, in its comparatively brief period of office, increased pensions by 50 per cent, in the last five yearsa notable achievement compared with the sorry record of those who inserted the advertisement. Honourable members opposite emphasized the necessity for abolishing the means test. Wh.iu will happen? Not .once have those honourable m.eBabers. made any practical suggestions for abolishing the means test. When' they make these promises, theyshould suggest a practical method of implementingthem. Let us examine what the abolition of the means test would entail. I support the principle of the abolition of the means, test from our social services legislation. However, its removal would necessitate the provision of an additional £40,000,000. In passing, I point out that we heard references this evening to child endowment. If child endowment were The payable in respect of the first child, an additional £18,000,000 would be required. Those two alterations would increase t h e the cost of social services by £58,000,000. How would that money he provided ? We cannot print bank notes, for the purpose of meeting the cost of social services. We must have a sound financial approach. I presume from what the Leader of the Opposition has stated, that the money would be. obtained from a form of contrimentioned that the provisions butory social services scheme on the lines of the National Health and PensionsB ill . On one occasion, I heard the honourable member for Richmond( Mr. Anthony) refer ' to the outstanding features of the national insurance legist lation which the Lyons Government introduced in 1938 but never dared to implement, so great was the public outcry against it . If honourable members oppoI n all those year.s, site propose to abolish the means test, do they consider that their national insurance scheme should take the form of that proposed in 1938? I shall mention a few features of that scheme in -order to warn the people of what they may expect if the Liberal party gets an opporthat in operation in Great Britain. This tunity to abolish the means test on that basis. Incidentally, this proposal has been given considerable prominence by honourable members opposite in advocating the abolition of the means test. The National Health and PensionsI n surance Bill, which was introduced by the then Treasurer, Mr Casey, excluded various classes such as farmers, shopkeepers, self-employed persons and the unemployed. It did not include unemployment sustenance. There were no health provisions' for wives and families. It was a retrogressive social measure because it ignored the cardinal principle of taxation, namely, that the tax should be paid by those best able to bear the burden. It imposed upon the workers in the lower income group a charge which they could not pass on, as an employer could. The contributory scheme provided that a man should pay Is. 6d. a week for health and old age benefits, Is. for medical treatment for his wife and children, and Is. 6d. to enable his wife to receive a pension when she attained the age of 60 years, a total ^of 4s. a week. For that payment, the husband was entitled to a pension of £1 a week, and his wife to a pension of 15s. a week. Those are a few of the features of the so-called national insurance scheme which, I assume, would be revived by honourable members opposite if they had an opportunity to give effect to their proposals for the abolition of the means test. If the people have only that promise increase social services by £58,000,000 a to look forward to, they will have no prospect of getting reasonable benefits for their social services contributions. If the Opposition does not revive that policy, it might adopt a contributory scheme like that in operation in New Zealand. ' That scheme imposes a contribution of Is. 6d. in. the £1 or part of £1 of income, and Id. in every 10d., plus a. special war tax of 6d., making a general flat rate of 2s. in the £1. To my mind, that is not a sound proposition, because it places on the lower-paid worker the Mr Daly. same burden as that which is borne by the more highly paid worker. That basis is not equitable. If we look further afield, perhaps the Opposition would introduce' a scheme like requires a male to contribute 4s. 7d. for ordinary national insurance, plus 3d. for workers' compensation. The employer contributes 4s. 2d. making a total of 9s. a week. The contributions payable by a woman amount to 3s. 9d. a week, and the employer contributes 3s. 3d., making a total of 7s. a week. These contributions are levied on all persons earning in excess of £1 10s. a week. For those payments, a man is entitled to receive £1 6s. a week when he is unemployed or ill. That scheme is not comparable with the benefits payable under our progressive scheme in Australia. Those are a few of the proposals which members of the Opposition would have to consider if they bad an opportunity, as a Government, to introduce a national insurance scheme and abolish the means test. I say quite frankly that their proposal cannot be adopted, and honourable members opposite are endeavouring to mislead the people by glossing over the actual .and factual approach to the problem. It is a dishonest approach. When considering the increase of £58,000,000 which the complete abolition of the means test would entail, we must bear in mind also that for every Is. by which the rate of pension is increased the pension bill rises by £1,000,000. . That does not take into account the increased number of persons who are eligible for invalid and old age pensions. Honourable members opposite cannot promise to reduce taxationby 40 per cent, and at the same time year. The explanation of their proposal is that they desire to relieve the budget of all payments for pensions and other social services, and place that burden upon the shoulders of the workers, as they proposed to do under the national insurance scheme in 1938. Obviously, that must occur if the Liberal party has an opportunity to reduce taxation by 40 per cent, and increase social service payments by £58,000,000 a year. I shall give the actual costs per capita on a contributory basis under any schema which, will be necessary to implement proposals contained in the Liberal party's advertisement. services on a contributory basis, judging by the total cost for 1945-46, would be £53,000,000. The additional estimated cost resulting .from the abolition of the means test on invalid and old-age pensions and widows pensions would' be £44,500,000, a total of £97,500,000. At the SOth June last, tbe total number of bread-winners was 2,920,000. Therefore a total contribution of 13s. a week would be required. Of course, that could not be paid by unemployed persons, pensioners and persons over the age of 65 years. That is what the people may expect if they fall for the gag which is contained in the advertise1 ment. In my calculation of a contribution of 13s. a week, I did not take into account two factors, first, the expanding cost of social services, and secondly the expansion of social service plans, including health and various other schemes which the Labour party may have in view. That is a summary of what is offered to the people by those who bitterly criticize the proposals and efforts of this Government to abolish the means test and give the people a comprehensive range of social service benefits. I shall now examine the Labour party's general programme of social services. In some quarters, it is believed that the Government's social services scheme is an additional tax. That is not so. „ The Australian contributions are levied on incomes progressively, according to ability to pay, from 3d. to a maximum.of Is. 6d. in the £1. The reason for the Government's social service contribution is to ensure that a portion of the total income tax received from personal exertion shall be used exclusively for social service payliberalize pensions is the removal' of the ments. Many thousands of people who enjoy the social service benefits as provided do not make any contribution by way of taxation tb the scheme. In fact, there are 1,000,000 bread-winners in Australia who do not pay any direct tax, but all of them are entitled to social serthey indicate that the Government has vices benefits. For the information of honourable members, I cite an example. A man with a wife and two children receiving £300 a year will pay £11 17s. a year, or 4s. 6d. a week. This will be The cost of all social a social service contribution, not income tax. Prior to these reductions by the Government, his payments totalled £17 8s. a year. For his. contribution he receives the benefits of the social service . legislation which, for the year 1945-46, involved an expenditure of £53,000,000, and included maternity allowance, child endowment, free medi-' cine,, unemployment and sickness benefits. Although such a man is required to pay 4s. 6d. a week as social service contribution, he is entitled to 7s. 6d. a week child endowment in respect of his second child under sixteen years of age; so he pays 4s. 6d. a week and receives 7s. 6d., in addition to enjoying the other benefits that I have mentioned, which are costing the' Government £53,000,000 a year. Similarly, for every other child he would receive a further 7s. 6d. a week endowment. The Government should be congratulated on its commendable approach to the whole problem of social services. It is taking steps which will result in. the immediate relaxing, and the ultimate abolition, of the means test in relation to invalid and old-age pensions. Under its long-range plan, the means test will be completely eliminated frOm our social service legislation. The chief measures that are being proposed immediately are an increase of permissible income from 12s 6d. to £1 a. week for old-age and invalid pensioners. in general, and from £5 to £5 7s! 6d. a week for blind pensioners; and the lifting of the property bar from £400 to £650. A further measure which will be received with satisfaction is the elimination of certain property, from consideration in connection. with the assessment of pensions. Another immediate' measure to means test in respect"" of invalid adult pensioners in relation to the income of parents. That is a highly desirable variation. All of the steps which I have mentioned, will be received with satisfaction, by the general public, and a well-prepared plan to ensure the removal of the means test as it exists to-day. Personally I regret that it has not been possible for the Government to go further than it has gone, but I am gratified that some substantial advance is assured. One effect of the Government's immediate programme will be to improve the lot of 42,000 invalid and old-age pensioners, and to bring 88,000 additional persons into the range of pension payments. These measures will involve an additional expenditure of about £4,500,000 a year, which, spread over, so many people in the community, will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect. The Government is.to be complimented upon this progressive policy, and I have no doubt that the people will indicate in no uncertain way their endorsement of what is being done. I emphasize that the ultimate objective of the Government is the complete 'abolition of the means test by providing for ""an increase of permissible income and a progressive lifting of the property bar year by year. I give my enthusiastic and sincere support to this part of the bill. Before concluding my brief speech, I wish to make some comparison, of 'the social services benefits now available with those in existence at the time this Government assumed, office. In 1941, at the time of the defeat of the Menzies Administration, invalid and old-age pensions, maternity allowances and child endowment only were being provided. The1 maximum rate of invalid and old-age pension was 21s. 6d., and pensioners in institutions were receiving only 6s. 9d. a .week. ' Considerable increases have been provided since this Government assumed office. The rate of invalid and old-age pension has been increased to 32s. 6d. a week, and the rate for pensioners in institutions to lis. 6d. a week. In addition child endowment and maternity allowance payments have also been increased. In June, 1946, as the result of the generous policy 'of this Government, the following social services were being provided :-Invalid and old-age pensions, allowances to the wife and one child of invalid pensioners, funeral benefits for invalid and'old-age pensioners, maternity allowances, -child endowment, widows' pensions, and unemployment and sickness benefits. This is no mean achievement after five years of war which made exactins: demands on all the members of the Mr Daly. ministry. An increased coverage has been given to many deserving people in the community. The cost of our social services in 1945-46 was more than £53,000,000, and the estimated cost for 1946-47 is £62,310,000. The Government is to be congratulated upon its progressive approach to this problem. Its various social service benefits are being financed on a sound basis, and the payments being provided will bear comparison with those of any other country in the world. The money that is being expended will relieve the sufferings and poverty of many people in the community. This substantial measure of social security is an instalment of the new order which the Government is gradually introducing. A truly humane measure of relief is now being provided for the most deserving classes in the community. Many of the people who will receive help are, through no fault of their own, unable to help themselves. The Government has a great df>al to be proud of, and I believe that it will continue to apply a generous social service policy. In conclusion I bring to the notice of honourable members the .following short poem headed "" Tory Promises"" which has been published in an influential section of the press and presents an excellent summary of the Opposition's approach to the elections and the social security policy:How radical the Tories get. As polling day draws near! They'll promise anything-yo u bet!The cleft hoofs disappear! They'll cut down taxes, and they'll give A shorter working week; They'll guarantee that workers live In ways they rightly seek. Their promises are many, but We give them nought of heed substantially When these deceivers pose and strut Por well we know the breed! consequence of certain remarks made by the'honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly), my speech will need to be somewhat longer than I had originally intended. I have no objection -to the bill. I believe, however, that in two respects the principles underlying recent social service legis'ation in this country are unsound. First, no proper contributory system is being established, and, secondly,",60,Holloway

Like myself the honourable gentleman is a member of the Social Security Committee and has had the opportunity of studying social service legislation. It seems to me that some of his remarks are entirely at variance with information which we have gained as members of the committee. The honourable gentleman said that he approved of the abolition of ""the means test. So do I , and so do all other honourable members on this side of the chamber. We shall later set out our views on this subject in considerable detail for the benefit of the electors. "" The honourable gentleman referred to .an advertisement in a Sydney newspaper whichoutlined the policy of the Liberal party-in regard to social security. The advertisement stated that ""The Liberal party maintains that tbe means test is humiliating and a penalty on t h r if t "". We heartily agree with that statement. I believe that the honourable gentleman would also agree with it publicly if we were not. on the eve of general elections. The advertisement also stated, "" When social services are placed on a contributory basis the means test can be abolished "". That also is true. Some of the remarks of the honourable member in regard to the attitude of honourable gentleman on this side of the chamber on social security measures were quite unnecessary. true. Labour Governments did a great deal to promote social security in this country. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr should know that. There is something Bryson) ""must know that the first social service legislation was placed on our statute-book in 1909 by a government of the political complexion of honourable gentlemen' now sitting on this side of the chamber. For many years and, indeed, until quite recently all the social service legislation ""placed on our statute-book was introduced by governments holding views similar to those held by honourable gentleman .now sitting in opposition. It was left to the'Scullin'Government to reduce pensions in 1929, and although the have listened with interest to present Government has been in office since 1940, and has had control of vast His remarks surprised public funds, it did nothing to eliminate the means test until the last few weeks. I believe that it has acted now only because we are fast approaching the time when we all shall'face the' electors. The Government must have realized the need to liberalize its policy. If it had not done so it would undoubtedly have been found wanting by the electors. Honourable members' now sitting on this side of the chamber were instrumental, in 193S, in having passed by' the Parliament a national health and pensions scheme, but that act was not proclaimed owing to the outbreak of war. Had it been proclaimed, it would at least have given to this country a better basis for social security legislation than it now has. I am somewhat astonished that you Mr Speaker, did not raise your eyebrows rather more than you did when the honourable member for Martin described as "" hypocritical"" the attitude of Opposition members towards the means test. I resent that description; because we are at least sincere in promising, not only the introduction of a contributory scheme, but also the abolition of the means test. The honourable member for Martin knows that there are three methods whereby social security legislation may be financed. The Government is adopting the first method, by ""soaking"" the people at the top, in order to provide for the people at the bottom, of the economic scale. That is the worse system which any government could apply in any country. I have said previously, and I repeat, that no other country has embraced that principle for the financing of social legislation. The honourable member for Martin to be said for each of the other two systems. The New Zealand system, of a flat rate tax, provides more security for government finance than does the system here proposed. Finally, there is the contributory system, under which one part would be borne by 'the employer, a second part by the employee, and the third part by the Government out of Consolidated Revenue. That system has been adopted 'in many countries, including Great",64,Witha Libebal Social Sectjmty Plan ^ Without She Means Test

211,Mr Ryan,"In the days gone by nonInvalid and Old-age [REPRESENTATIVES. j | Britain, where the results have been extremely good. I have no doubt that it will be followed in Australia at some time in the future. Under such a scheme, the abolition of the means test would be perfectly feasible. The means test has been abolished in the United Kingdom, and it could be. abolished in this country. Further details of our proposals will be published in the near future. The people will then know that they have within them the means for providing greater security than will be possible under the scheme adopted by the Government. The bill' contains three main features of which I approve The permissible income is to be raised from 12s. 6d. to £1 a week. For some time, members of the Opposition as well as ministerial supporters have been advocating' this proposal, the adoption of which is long overdue, because the value of the £1 has depreciated very .considerably, what was worth 12s. 6d. when the permissible income was fixed at that amount being now worth considerably Jess. T next commend' the alteration in respect of the property bar to the receipt of a pension. This was raised from the £310 fixed in 1909 to £400 in 1923, at which figure it has remained until the present date. The bill proposes to raise it to £650 The third feature that I commend is the removal of the disqualification in repounds invested in a Commonwealth spect of adult invalids whose parents are deemed to be able adequately to maintain them. The granting of these concessions will somewhat increase the demands on the national revenue. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) informed the House that 42,000 pensioners will have their pensions increased, and that 88,000 additional persons will become entitled to the pension, the aggregate, amount of which will be increased by £4,250)000, from £29,000,000 to £33,250,000. Ever since I have been a member of this House, I have held the view that the disqualification in respect of the pension should be on an income, not a capital, basis. Many honourable members know of applicants for the pension who have been -debarred from receiving it because their -capital has exceeded £400, even though Ifr. Ryan. Pensions Bill 1946. they did not derive any income from it. I cite one case as tyjrical of many cases that have come to my knowledge. An old man had a property in the Mallee district of Victoria, the estimated value of which, according to the Department of Social Security, was approximately £1,000. He derived no income from it, and could not sell it. It was a waste heap of sand, on which there was practically no grass. I ' have known of three or four similar cases. The owners of the properties could not sell them and had no income from them, yet, under the old system, were debarred from receiving any benefit under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. . I make one further point in relation to the income which may be earned without incurring disqualification for a full pension. At present, an income of £1 a week may be earned by working, or may be derived from an annuity or a small pension. But there are many persons who obtain £1 a week from an investment in Commonwealth bonds or from preference shares. Because they possess the capital which returns them this income, they are debarred to-day from obtaining any bene-, fit under the act. That principle of disqualification because of the possession of capital should be reviewed, with the object of making the disqualification relate to income. ""Why should a man who receives £.1 a week from an annuity or a small pension be more favourably placed than the man who happens to have a few hundred security which returns a similar income? The granting of this concession might increase the number of persons eligible for the pension; but I doubt very much that it would. There is one other point; it relates to. the amount of capital which should be regarded as a disqualification. If a man or woman be allowed to haye an income of £1 a week and still be entitled to obtain the pension, why should it not be possible to capitalize such an income at, say, 3\ per cent, per annum, the present government rate, and regard the resultant amount as the permissible capital ? That would raise the capital limit to £1,600. Thrift is still a virtue, and we should do all that we can to encourage it. The time will come when the means test will be abolished. I hope that that will occur before long. But until that time does arrive, tbere is no reason why thrift should be discouraged as it is being discouraged to-day, by making this benefit dependent almost entirely on the possession of very little or no-capital. The, principle upon which this legislation is based should be altered so as to allow the points that I have raised to'be met. I hope' that the Minister will review the matter, with a view to determining whether action may be taken in the directions I have suggested. warmly commend the Government for having brought down this bill to provide a substantial measure of relief for invalid and old-age pensioners, at a cost of more than £4,000,000 a year, whilst simultaneously providing for reductions of taxes aggregating £17,500,000 If there is any section of the community which deserves not merely our sympathy but also our whole-hearted consideration, it is that section which is composed of the aged and the physically afflicted. Even if there be a few aged persons who are in needy circumstances because of their own thriftlessness, the fact remains that the great majority of the old people have lived an honest and honourable life and have contributed their share towards the development of this country. Therefore, they are entitled to expect that, in the eventide of their lives, they will be able to experience a real sense of freedom from want. There rests upon us, also, the same obligation in respect of those who, because of invalidity, are prevented from taking their places.in industry. [Quorum formedJ] I am particularly pleased with the effect which the easing of themeans test will have on elderly people who derive modest incomes from superannuation schemes. There are a great many people who, upon retirement from the Public Service or other employment, receive superannuation-of £2 a week. At present, such persons have their pensions reduced because of the superannuation they receive. . In future, however, a married couple whose only income is superannuation of £2 a week will be able to receive full pensions of 32s. 6d. a' week each, giving them a total income of £5 5s. a week. Where the amount of superannuation is £3 a week, the couple will be entitled to pensions of 22s. 6d. a week . each, giving them the same total income of £5 5s. a week. In addition, they may own their own home, and have other assets valued at £119 without their pensions being affected. The position will be the same where a married man has no superannuation, but is able to derive income from bart-time employment. I am also pleased that pensioners are not, in future, to be penalized because they bold small life assurance policies, and that certain, other items of property are to be disregarded. The Government is to be congratulated on removing the means test for parents in dealing with applications from invalid children over 21 years of age. This will be welcome news in many a home, over-which hangs a cloud of sorrow because of the permanent affliction of a'son or daughter. It will bring to the invalid a new ray of hope and a feeling of relief from the sense pf utter dependence which in the pasthas had a most depressing and disheartening effect. -Some people, no doubt, will criticize the proposed liberalization of the means test on the ground that it will not benefit the majority of pensioners who are entirely dependent on their pensions. The Government has a complete answer to such criticism, because it can show that it gave its first attention to those pensioners by .increasing the maximum rate of pension, from time to time. When Labour took office in October, 1941, tlie maximum pension was 21s. a week. It is now 32s. 6d., an increase of 51 percent, in less than five years of Labour rule.. This increase included 5s. fid. a week granted in July of 'last year. In no previous period of five years, since old-age pensions came into operation 37 years ago, was there anything like this percentage increase -, In addition, the Labour Government has introduced allowances for the wives and children of invalid pensioners, and provided a grant of £10 towards the funeral expenses of the pensioner. ITo previous government has a better record so far as the welfare of bid-age and invalid pensioners is concerned. I sincerely hope that the relaxation of the means test provided for in",65,Witha Libebal Social Sectjmty Plan ^ Without She Means Test

It would be futile for one to indulge in flights of fancy relative to a bill of this description.. The Minister in introdealt with only certain aspects of it. He stated that atomic energy was those relating to shrouded in such mystery that little had been heard of it outside the flights of imagination of certain novelists. This bill is"" designed to vest the ownership of uranium and certain other substances that are known .to exist or may subsequently be discovered in the Commonwealth and its territories. The bill vests in the Minister power to prohibit the possesin the sion of or dealing in any of these It is also desirable to substances except under licence. Coma recommendation . was monwealth officials may enter land or Parliamentary property and search or interrogate persons ancl insist that all past and future discoveries be immediately notified to the Government This, of course, is necessary, because we ,are dealing with a force which the Lilienthal report on the international control of atomic energy described in the following language:The atomic bomb, which appeared at the very end of hostilities, made it clear that plans which had been laid at San Francisco for the United Nations organization would have to be supplemented by a specific control of an instrument of war so terrible that its uncontrolled development would not only intensify the ferocity of warfare but might directly contribute to the outbreak of war. This bill is.designed to control the use of certainsubstances' and to promote research into atomic energy. I have no",71,Overseas Telecommunications Bill
224,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [11.8].,"-doubt that these controls' will have to be extended as investigation proceeds and new substances are found fromwhich atomic energy may be produced. This is only one of many legislative enactments that will have to be passed by Empire' countries and, indeed, by countries throughout the civilized world. Until international controlis agreed upon and exercised, as a matter, of sheer survival, nations will have to take control of all substances within their boundaries capable of developing atomic energy for defence, if for no other purposes, and encourage research into the development of atomic energy. Because of its peculiar geographical position and the fact that it has extensive deposits of uranium, Australia should not be laggard in its own defence. It may be that greater developments will take place outside of international control because of the . great importance of this new weapon. No international agreements relative to the use of atomic energy have yet been made. Every nation in the world, in the interests of' its own safety, however, is taking control of energy-producing-substances and developing research into this important subject within its own borders. This intense concentration will undoubtedly give a great impetus to the production of , atomic energy. Legislation along similar lines to the bill now before us will have to be passed by the parliaments of New South Wales and Queensland, as recent investigations have revealed the existence of deposits of thorium in the coastal sands of both of those States. .It is diffithe United States of America'of course cult to gauge the extent of the deposits of uranium, and thorium in Australia. In vestigations that have already taken place, following the passage of legislation in South Australia, has revealed the-existence -of substantial deposits of uranium in that State. But the amount of thorium extracted from mohosite found in sand on the north coast is minute. It would seem that legislation similar to this must be introduced in State parliaments other than the parliament of South Australia, because I take it that this, legislation applies only to Commonwealth territories. i? under a misapprehension. This is a bill for an act to control all deposits where ever they occur in -Australia.. pression from the Minister's second reading speeeh in which the Minister used the term "" Commonwealth Territories "" that the legislation applied only to those territories, but I am glad to have his assurance that it is all-embracing. Legislation of a like kind has been passed in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand and in the United States of America, but, whereas the United Kingdom and Canada areagreeable to Australian scientists working with their scientists on research into and development of atomic energy, the United States of America is jealous of its researches. Therefore plans envisaged by Australia must unfortunately be developed into close co-operation with the rest of the Empire., I say "" unfortunately because, when the day of international control arrives,,obviously there will be the closest co-operation between all countries in the use of this new-found force for the betterment and benefit of mankind and not destruction. But while nations are concentrating on the development of atomic energy as a means of defence, the work they do on it must be a closely guarded secret, and development will be on destructive rather than constructive lines. The Commonwealth Government meanwhile should arrange for an exchange of scientists working on atomic energy between the different parts of the British Empire in order that we may keep abreast of developments. The jealous action of has been dictated by Russia's rejection of the.main proposals by the United States of America for the control of atomic energy. Although not necessarily closing the door to ultimate agreement on international control it indicates the difficulty in reaching world agreement in this important connection. In the long run, whether a formula can be arrived at will be dependent on the decisions of the Security Council of the United Nations and, of course, the Atomic Energy Commission. This bill deals with certain specific substances, but the day is not far distant when other substances must be taken into account as sources from which atomic energy is likely to be developed.",72,Dedman
225,Mr Dedman,The honourable member,73,Dedman
226,Mr Harrison,"I gained the imThe report on the international control of atomic energy says5 The view has been expressed by one official energy in any process included in the that it may not be long before we may be able to extract atomic energy from common material such as clay. So power taken under the bill to provide for the proclamation of other substances is well taken, because at the moment science does not know from what substances atomic energy may be developed. But uranium is the greatest source of energy known to scientists, and it is necessary to control it. The bill is designed not to affect the mining of minerals that may be 'found in close association with uranium, and I know that the Minister would not seek, in controlling uranium, to interfere with the development of other minerals necessary for Australian industry. They may be mined under licence. Although the bill seems' to have all the necessary safeguards regarding control of uranium and other substances, one point seems to have been overlooked. The legislation passed in the United Kingdom provides that no person may apply outside the United Kingdom for the patent of an invention which relates to the production or the use of atomic energy without the approval of the Minister, unless such application has been approved in the United Kingdom. has provided against leakage. should we, by inserting a similar provision in this legislation. ""We can do nothing but help the Minister in his desire in the national interest to control substances from which atomic energy may be developed.

I presume it would be. Would all heavy metals automatically come within the purview of this bill? Is the Minister to have power to deal with any discovered methods of releasing fision process?

State judge might, with great advantage, have been secured for the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but he considered that he was not able to transfer, after a considerable number of years of service, because he would not have had credit for any portion of his service with the State. Therefore, I warmly approve of this bill . I b.elieve, if. I remember correctly, that I had a bill not unlike it rather hopefully on the stocks a *few years ago. Certainly I am glad to see it again, and to assist in passing it through the House. of the Opposition for his assistance. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The eighth Spender) asked me the f o l l o w in g question:Section 27 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act provides for preference in employment for ex-service men and women, but in tion to the engagement for employment by an employer of a person who is' already employed by him. I ask tlie Minister for Post-war Reconstruction whether it is a fact that before positions in the Public Service are advertised in the press, peoplehave already been temporarily appointed to them, so that when the matter of a permanent appointment arises, the act can be evaded or avoided by the person already beniporarily engaged and employed by tlic Government in that position? In particular, I ask the Minister to inquire into certain positions advertised by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture for Trade' Commissioners overseas. Were the provisions of the act avoided in the manner that. I have described when the Government made these appointments? W ill the honourable gentleman also inquire into other appointments in the Department of External Affairs, and, indeed, in other Commonwealth departments, for the purpose of ensuring that the intentions of the aet shall be observed? I inform the honourable member that the Government departments do not Acting Minister for External AfTairs avoid the preference provisions of the thatRe-establishment and Employment Act as of I major suggested by him. As regards the honorternal Affairs, those appointed from outside able member's specific questions, I have the Commonwealth Public Service to perbeen informed by my colleague the manent executive positions in the department Minister for Commerce and Agriculture forces thatEight positions of Assistant Trade Commissioner were advertised by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture in the press of the first week of March, 1946, and in the Commonwealth Gazette of 7th March, 1946. The. advertisement referred specifically to the provisions of the Ee-establishment and Employment Act, No.. 11 of 1945, and stated that "" as amongst applicants preference w ill be given to persons with the necessary qualifications in accordance with the provisions of the Act.."". This condition has been complied with fully by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in making the appoint-, ments and I wish to 'state that my colleague objects very strenuously to the answers toquestions implication in the honourable member's question that certain action had been taken to avoid the provisions of the act. ments, seven of the successful applicants are ex-servicemen, some with very long applicant enlisted in. the Royal Australian Air Eorce, but as he was employed in a reserved occupation he was not permitted to join that service. sub-section 5 states that nothing Of the eight persons appointed, only the section shall apply in relaone was previously employed in the Department of Commerce and Agriculture .in a temporary capacity for a very short time. I suggest that if the honourable member for Warringah were to study the Trade Commissioner Act and the regulations thereunder he would ascertain that it is not possible to temporarily employ person's in any government department with a. view to subsequent appointment to the Trade Commissioner Service. The act provides for appointment for specific periods, which precludes any action being taken along the lines suggested by the honourable member. I think he will .agree that in regard to the foregoing appointments the Commonwealth Government has fully complied with the provisions of the. act. I . have further been informed by the n the last twelve months, during the period expansion in the Department of Exhave, in general, been members of the armed and entitled to the benefits of the Re-establishment and Employment Act.

It is a fact that a strike Denmark is not yet available. The took place because two ex-servicemen negotiations of amended contract prices were not unionists and had refused to join for the second two .years of the longthe appropriate union. The matter was term purchase agreement with the referred to the State Industrial ComGovernment of the United Kingdom are mission, as the men were working under proceeding satisfactorily.
