In other words, Section 12 of the principal Act is quite plainly existing service personnel are denied the right antique. It reflects nineteenth century British available to every other employee in Australia, views about the relationship between defence perthe right to sue the Commonwealth for money sonnel and the Crown.

First of all, there has been a ment can make to the poor in our society is to sebig increase in provisional taxation, which is the cure economic growth and economic prosperity direct result of big increases in farm incomes and by producing jobs; by producing more resources improvement in business and property incomes. for welfare projects; by producing more funds for Secondly, there has been a significant rise in the pensions and benefits. The primary thrust of the prescribed payments system-a tax, of course, Government's economic policy since the day it which was introduced by the previous Governcame to office has been to ensure economic recovment and which applies this year for a full year for ery and to secure sustained economic growth the first time. Thirdly, as the Opposition conwithout inflation. That is the greatest contristantly mentions, there has been an increase in the bution we can make to the alleviation of poverty revenue collection from the Medicare levy. One in this society. That overriding commitment, and reason for the increase is simply that it applies for the cost of that commitment, has not prevented 12 months and not for five months, as it did in the redistribution measures through the tax system. last year. Not in any sense is this an increased burThe tax cuts we have introduced are biased in den because many taxpayers and particularly favour of low income earners and against high inmost lower income earners make big savings when come earners. comparing their payments under the Medicare program with those through the old private health The restructuring of the tax scales is clearly insurance system. progressive. Just to take two fairly extreme examples, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse To judge the impact of the tax cut we need to and dependent children with a taxable income of compare like with like-that is, P AYE payments $10,000 will have his tax reduced by 45.7 per cent, under Fraser and PA YE payments under this while a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and deBudget.

Underlying the tax cuts is a clear progressi,ve product under this Government. In 1982-83, after commitment. Indeed, once a taxpayer with a the last tax cuts of the Fraser Government, dependent spouse and dependent children has PA YE tax collections as a percentage of GDP in taxable income greater than $28,000 a year, the gross terms were 12.7 per cent and in net terms tax cut reduces both in absolute as well as pro11.5 per cent.

So we can put those arguments aside, that the $250 pensioner tax rebate will not begin and they are practically the only arguments on to ease out until taxable income of $5,534 a year is which the Opposition has rested its case. reached. Single pensioners will therefore pay no Let me turn to another suggestion that crept tax until their income exceeds $106 per week. into the Opposition Leader's speech, though, to Further still, we have introduced a tax rebate for give him some credit, he did not have the hypocsocial security beneficiaries.

Of course Let me now turn to what the Government has we would have wished to have dome more, to done in relation to pensioners. We have provided have provided more generous welfare benefits, an increase from November of $2.50 a week for bigger increases in pensions, more comprehensive single pensioners and $4.20 a week for married social security benefits. But I repudiate utterly pensioners. Because of the negative CPI for the that in framing the Budget the less well off in this six months ending June 1984 there would have been no pension' increase under the automatic We were committed to ending the discrimiindexation 'provisions.

We estimate the honouring that commitment. SoI simply ask Medicare impact on the CPI at $2.15 a week and, again that honourable members remember what therefore, we have compensated for that and the Opposition Leader said, that they look at what added a little more. the Opposition did when in government and look at what we have done in 18 months in very diffiThis increase also represents our commitment cult economic circumstances. to raise pensions over the first three years of our Government to 25 per cent of average weekly Finally, let me mention the utter shallowness of earnings.
