173,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae,"Wednesday, 27 August 2008 ----Forrest Electorate: Gas Supply Ms MARINO (Forrest) (9.30 am)-I rise to speak on the continuing gas crisis in Western Australia and how it is still disproportionately affecting businesses in the south-west, in my electorate of Forrest. I have to again ask the question: why was it that on 3 June, when Apache Energy’s operations at Varanus Island exploded, wiping out one-third of the state’s gas supply, in spite of the logistics involved, south-west businesses experienced a sustained 100 per cent cut in their supply of gas? There is now concern that businesses affected by the gas shortage believe they may not be able to get fully back on their feet until at least next year and may never recover their losses through insurance or compensation. I want to inform this House that the gas supply to Western Australian businesses, particularly those in the south-west of the state, has still not fully resumed. I have many questions I want answered by the authorities who have presided over gas allocation decisions, including why, in the immediate aftermath, south-west businesses were not able to enter into negotiations for the supply of any reduced amounts of gas that was available. What entity distributed, and on what authority did the energy provider distribute, gas to industry? Why wasn’t there any transparency of process afforded to businesses so that industry knew what businesses were being allocated gas and in what proportions? It is indeed premature for the WA Labor Premier to declare the gas crisis over. He may want it to be over in the minds of voters, as he has prematurely called a state election for 6 September, knowing full well that the report on the investigation by NOPSA into the cause of the explosion at Varanus Island will come out well after the election results. Since8 August 2008 it has been announced that the Varanus Island facility is producing at 60 per cent capacity. However, this increased supply has not yet been provided to businesses in the south-west. I want to know what businesses are now receiving an increased supply of gas as a result of this increased production. Indeed, many south-west businesses were faced with no security of gas supply and, with the daily lottery through Alinta, were faced with the prospect of terminating staff and going out of business, an option none wanted to take. Instead, they secured alternative gas supplies, most paying around four times the amount of the usual supply cost. They also entered into contracts that, in some cases, would be in effect for extended periods beyond the shortage. Since securing alternative supplies, the same businesses have again reported that they have been unsuccessful in attempting to contract and negotiate with the gas entity from Varanus Island to resume gas supplies at the original price. Why have these businesses been precluded from having their gas supply recommissioned by their original gas supplier? It has been reported that, in securing alternative sources of gas, many businesses have had to also negotiate the transport costs of the gas with a third party at an additional cost. I want to know whether this process was as transparent as possible and whether any assistance could have been given ex gratia by the state government. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Notices
174,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,"Mrs Judy Wild Justine Elliot, and I presented a 2008 Australian government community award and plaque-a beautiful plaque-to Mrs Judy Wild, who was nominated by the Melaleuca Home for the Aged in East Devonport in my beautiful electorate of Braddon. Judy Wild has been a volunteer with many community based organisations for more than 30 years and has always displayed genuine compassion. Her concern for her fellow citizens is unparalleled, and she gives freely of her time. Judy’s commitment to Melaleuca Home for the Aged has been immense. Judy is an active member of Melaleuca’s auxiliary and is the current president. She was one of the original steering committee members when it was first formed, more than 25 years ago. The committee works tirelessly to fundraise to provide many items of furniture and equipment for Melaleuca, which has benefited all the residents. The auxiliary fundraising efforts have seen phenomenal results, and without their efforts Melaleuca would struggle to provide the high quality of care that residents deserve. Judy has received life membership of the auxiliary for her dedication and involvement for the past 30 years. She is also the coordinator and major force behind Melaleuca’s biennial art exhibition and formal dinner. The event is the auxiliary’s major fundraiser every second year. Along with other auxiliary members, Judy gives of her time freely. She has provided weekly bingo sessions to the residents of Melaleuca for the past 10 years. She readily makes herself available for resident activities that require an extra pair of hands and is always open and sincere in giving her time. Over the past 25 years Judy has visited many residents as an act of kindness and, although not related to them, she will spend many hours talking or just being there. Judy was appointed to the Melaleuca board of management in 1995 and has served tirelessly on the board, which meets a minimum of 12 times a year. Judy has also been involved in many other activities. For instance, with Meals on Wheels she has for more than 20 years enjoyed many hours with older persons, delivering meals around the beautiful city of Devonport. Judy has devoted 1½ days per week for many years volunteering at St Vincent de Paul in East Devonport, where she assists with the never-ending tasks of sorting, cleaning and preparing clothes for resale at the thrift shop. She has been a member for many years of the City of Devonport Lions Ladies. She was a founding member of the Devonport Girl Guides Association and was involved in the creation of the hall at Devonport 30 years ago. She has been an active member of the AFS students abroad association for many years as well. I congratulate Judy on her sterling efforts and her wonderful work. She is a great person and a deserving recipient of the 2008 Australian government community award in my electorate. Mitchell Electorate: Small Business lies for Small Business, a great initiative.

I also doorknocked businesses on the corner of Windsor Road and Old Northern Road. These businesses are being ignored by the state agency Roads and Traffic Authority.

176,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (9.36 Am),"Last week I had the opportunity to participate in PolMitchell, all of which play a vital role in our local economy. I am proud to stand up for them in this place. We do need to do more to make it easier to own and operate a small business, but we also need to make it easier for people to get into small business. The Labor government’s recent axing of funding for programs such as Commercial Ready and Building Entrepreneurship has certainly not made it easier for small business. With higher petrol prices and the collapse of consumer confidence in recent times, we ought to have small business and small business operators very much in the spotlight of policy making at the moment. In addition to these businesses I visited on the Pollies for Small Business program, I want to recognise those small businesses that recently won awards at the Hills Shire Times True Local Business Awards night, which I attended recently. These are great local businesses: Karin Murton Hair Design at Northmead, Bakers Delight North West, Sparks Shoes at North Rocks, Robert Cliff Master Jewellers, Spoilt Rotten Doggy Boutique at Castle Hill, Eurolounge restaurant and bar, Hillside Hotel at Castle Hill, Louis Carr Real Estate, Power Ford at Baulkham Hills, Norwest Child Care Centre, Hills Swimming at Kenthurst, Dural Flower Farm Florist and Tom’s Family Butchery at Annangrove. I want to applaud and congratulate in particular these award winners for their fine products and services and for achieving so highly in each of their categories. It was so pleasing on the night to see the truth of industrial relations in this country. The truth of industrial relations in this country is that we have employers and employees working in partnership to produce great results most of the time. You can see this when you attend awards nights like that one and you see all of the employees and the employer celebrating the fine achievements that have come from such close cooperation and work. It was great to be involved in the first national Pollies for Small Business program. The contribution of small businesses to the community is sometimes underestimated, and I enjoyed immensely the opportunity to raise the profile of small businesses in Mitchell. I will be working in this place to ensure that small business is in the spotlight of policy making in the coming years, especially with the collapse of consumer confidence and the tough times that small businesses are facing at the moment. Blair Electorate: RAAF Base Amberley resent the Minister for Defence at RAAF Base Amberley in Ipswich, where I will be opening the building for No. 33 Squadron. I had the opportunity to participate in the Australian Defence Force parliamentary program, for which I was stationed-if I can put it like that-at RAAF Base Amberley between 4 August and 8 August. I want to thank group captains Rob McKenzie and Paul Hislop for their cooperation and their friendliness during the time, as well as all the personnel at RAAF Base Amberley. It certainly deepened my understanding and appreciation of the role and the operation of the ADF and of what goes on at RAAF Base Amberley. That says something for a person like me, who has lived in Ipswich all his life and who has played sport with and socialised with, worked with and even worshipped with members of the ADF. The military has been an important part of the city of Ipswich since 1860. We call our football teams the Diggers and the Jets and we call our basketball team the Force, which is an indication of the affection with which we hold RAAF Base Amberley.

It is a funding commitment to make the RAAF base at Amberley a superbase. It is good for the economy. It will bring in thousands more military personnel to the area and their families as well. We warmly welcome them. It will enhance the defence capability at the base. It will enable personnel mobility, morale and esprit de corps, training outcomes and also attraction and retention to be improved in the local area. I witnessed a number of important developments. RAAF Base Amberley at the moment is like a construction site. I would also urge the government to think about a better use of the Amberley State Primary School, the land for which we have purchased from the state Labor government. I would like to see the cadets there use those facilities. I have publicly said that in the local media in Ipswich. I would urge the government to do so. We also look forward very much to the 24 Super Hornets to be based at Amberley. It is a $117 million commitment from the Rudd Labor government. We look forward to their arrival and their continuing operation for many years to come in the Ipswich area. It is tremendous for the local economy; it is tremendous for the local community. We love the military in Ipswich and we look forward to them being more involved in our local community. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Royal Perth Golf Club Sir Donald Bradman, one of Australia’s greatest sporting figures. Sir Donald would have turned 100 years old today. Last week in my electorate I had the privilege of attending a celebration and re-enactment of an event that took place 100 years ago, on 22 August 1908. On that day 100 years ago the result of five years of hard work by a group of golf enthusiasts saw the opening of the South Perth Golf Links by the then Governor Admiral, Sir Frederick Bedford. The Governor and his vice-regal group teed off at 3 pm on that day. Once they had completed the then nine-hole course, His Excellency adjourned for tea and in a short speech declared the links open. During the last 100 years the club was expanded to an 18-hole course and received a royal charter and is now known as the Royal Perth Golf Club. The current club president, Frank Bryant, and his committee invited me to attend the ceremony and participate in the reenactment. The re-enactment subcommittee, ably led by Jeff Carr, a former club president and police minister in the Lawrence government, did a magnificent job on the day. The event was enjoyed by the 132 golfers who participated on the day and the 360 guests who attended the cocktail party that night at the clubhouse. The cocktail party was attended by local MLA John McGrath, the local mayor and many of the councillors, and South Perth CEO Cliff Frewing. On the day, local golf radio commentators Ian ‘Chooky’ Fowler and Keith Ellis were in attendance as well. The Governor of Western Australia, His Excellency Ken Michael, and his wife, Julie, arrived by long boat at the Mends Street Jetty to be met by many club members dressed in period costume, which provided the local riverside restaurant clients with a spectacle they probably will not see for another 100 years.

The Royal Perth Golf Club is an important part of the community, as are over 4,000 clubs and associations throughout Australia that have become the meeting places for our communities, our families and our children. They provide a family-friendly environment for people to meet and socialise and also provide many benefits to the community. This club is what could be described as a good corporate citizen and over the past five years it has raised, through its annual charity day or by allowing the course to be used by other charity groups, nearly $500,000 for local charities and associations. The golf club hosts the annual Telethon Day in Perth, which is run by former club captain Barry Trevenen. Some of the groups that have benefited from this fundraising are SIDS and Kids WA, NGALA, the Clontarf Foundation-which was mentioned last night by the Governor General-the City of South Perth, Como Secondary College, Lady Gowrie Child Centre, Southcare, South Perth Primary School, Curtin Primary School, Kensington Primary School, Manning Primary School, Como Primary School, Collier Park Primary School, WA Youth Centre in Bentley, Edmund Rice Camp for Kids, the Speech and Hearing Centre, Holyoake, Cystic Fibrosis WA, Parkerville Children’s Home, the Cerebral Palsy Association and the Constable Care Child Safety Project. Werriwa Electorate: Organ Donation ter, Australia’s only organ donor and tissue donor register and one that saves lives. It is the lifeline for many Australian people who are on organ donation waiting lists. I have produced a fact sheet which I hand out regularly at railway stations and community meetings, and I have certainly spoken on local radio encouraging my constituents, staff, family and friends to support this issue and to register, and, furthermore, to actually discuss this vital issue with their families. I understand that presently there are almost 1,900 people at any one time on Australia’s organ donation waiting list. They are waiting for kidneys, hearts, livers, lungs and pancreases. Some of these people will die on this waiting list. Last year across Australia there were just 190 donors. Their organs saved more than 600 people. This year, up to May, there have been 102 donors, and their organs have saved almost 350 lives. Currently in New South Wales we have only 21 donors and we desperately need more. But more locally, in my electorate, we have Debbie Roberts, whose daughter Rebecca sadly passed away at age 20. Rebecca had discussed with her mum the issue of organ donation and, as a result of Rebecca’s selfless donation, four people have been given the gift of life. Two people have received kidneys, and another two have received corneas. I do know that Debbie has received touching letters from grateful recipients of her daughter’s organs. Whilst they do not know the names of the people, for privacy reasons, the families of those recipients regard themselves as heavily indebted to Rebecca. This is a local family from the Campbelltown region. What we see this family doing is giving the greatest gift that one human being can give to another, and that is the gift of life.

That is why I have chosen this as a method to use in my electorate. Encouragingly, surveys indicate widespread support. As a matter of fact, 90 per cent of Australians favour organ donation. That is why this campaign takes on added relevance. We must transform these high levels of support into people becoming potential donors. Since the establishment of the Australian Organ Donor Register, it has been effective in increasing the rates of people donating and consenting to donate. This is a campaign we all should get behind, as members of parliament, as people who are concerned about their communities. This is something that needs to be established across the board. (Time expired) Herbert Electorate: Townsville Hospital that Townsville is Australia’s largest tropical city. We have a level 6 hospital that services all of North Queensland. Yesterday, that hospital went on code yellow. What does code yellow mean for a hospital? It was the first time it had ever happened. What does code yellow mean? It means that, at three o’clock yesterday afternoon, there were 24 patients who could not get a bed. There were patients lying on beds in ambulances outside the door of the hospital. Our community, our medical professionals and our state government have known for two years that the Townsville Hospital is not coping. Mr Beattie, the former Premier, came to Townsville and said, ‘We’ll build you an $85 million new wing and provide more beds.’ Nothing has happened. But what do the local state members-and there are three of themdo? In this morning’s Townsville Bulletin we read: Thuringowa MP Craig Wallace said Health Minister Stephen Robertson was ‘aware the hospital is experiencing maybe its highest demand ever’. Thank you, Mr Wallace! In the same article we also read: Mundingburra MP Lindy Nelson-Carr said the inpatient bed shortage was caused by winter ailments ... And: Townsville MP Mike Reynolds said he was ‘extremely sympathetic’ ... Well, for heaven’s sake! That really helps, doesn’t it! Three state members have known about this problem for several years, the entire medical profession have known about it for several years, and all they can say is: ‘Oh well, it is winter,’ and, ‘Sorry to those 24 patients, but we cannot give you a bed-you will have to do something else.’ I wonder what that something else is. How could the state government allow a level 6 hospital-a tertiary treatment hospital-serving the whole of North Queensland not to have any beds? What to do about it? I certainly know how to solve the problem immediately. Yes, of course there is a master planning process going on. It has been very slow and it needs to speed up. We need the beds now. The solution to that is to get hold of the hospital administration and toss them out of the hospital and replace them with wards. The buildings are there, the services are there and the space is there. Just move the administration to an adjacent buildingthere is space to do that-and replace the floor area that they currently occupy with wards. That will immediately provide tens of new beds.

(Time expired) Oil Exploration Australia) (9.51 am)-A number of years ago I was working for a company called Woodside Energy, and at that time one of our main assets was in the West African nation of Mauritania, an impoverished nation on the West African coast where oil had never been looked for. At the time when the company for which I was then working began looking for oil, the global oil price was between $10 and $12.50 a barrel-if that seems plausible today. Oil had never been found. There was great exploration risk and great country risk. The fiscal terms in the contract that was eventually concluded reflected both international norms and the risk inherent in that country. In 2001 a very fortunate and significant discovery was made. That discovery meant that massive mineral wealth from oil was available to that country. What was required was the creation of a regulatory, permit based regime with environmental standards, all supported by international norms and standards. The World Bank, the IMF and the European Union were engaged, along with industry funding, to create a regulatory regime that was world’s best practice. Most importantly, the great principle of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was put into place to require that all government revenues from the oil industry were publicly and transparently disclosed. This is a principle that underpins the oil industry in East Timor. The company for which I worked took this principle into Kenya, in East Africa-not an easy environment-and into Libya, in North Africa. I note that a number of weeks ago there was an article in the Melbourne Age that reflected very poorly both on me and on employees of that company for the role that we played in bringing about the industrialisation and the development of the oil sector in that country. When asked by a journalist whether or not my company went by the book in this West African nation, I said that going ‘by the book’ in West Africa normally meant being corrupt. But we wrote a new book. We had to create a new book and we did that with the IMF, the World Bank and the European Union all working with us. We did that also with magnificent support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the then Australian government, and the support of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Alexander Downer. We had on board at that time an outstanding employee, Brendan Augustin. Brendan is a diplomat of significant status and standing and he earned himself great credit for being the person who argued the hardest and the toughest to get the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in place in that West African nation. Unfortunately, in the last two years there have been two coups in that nation-two significant changes of government-but the principles that we established to make sure a transparent oil regime is in place are there today thanks to Brendan.

On Monday, I met with Margaret Spriggs, based in the Oxenford and Coomera Community Youth Centre, a centre that enjoys my full and complete support. Margaret is the coordinator of the Northern Gold Coast Communities for Children Initiative, or C4C, a program currently funded by the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. C4C focuses on developing and delivering education, support, a strong family unit and, most importantly, healthy fun for parents and their children. C4C offers initiatives in a safe environment for over 1,500 northern Gold Coast families every week. Projects cater for everyone in the community, from infants to older members. The program includes five early-year hubs, which are attended by over 700 families every week; mobile community centres that work to deliver activities in areas with no community centres; active and healthy childcare activities for 500 parents and children; a read and grow program; and Ready Set Learn. C4C programs and many like them around the country help to hold our social and community fabric together, and it is outrageous to think that the Northern Gold Coast Communities for Children Initiative may be destroyed in June next year because of the dud Labor government’s inability to continue to fund it. The current funding allows the Northern Gold Coast C4C to develop programs specifically tailored to develop and assist families and youth who have no community stimulation. The Howard government promised to renew the program for another four years. To date, there has been no indication of that from the dud government and there is nothing in the forward estimates. cial indicators for child abuse and neglect, domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse and has an acute abundance of families and individuals who suffer from extreme hardship and are socially disconnected from any form of family and friends. C4C has undoubtedly improved the social network and infrastructure of the northern Gold Coast. The program, its community development workers and the families whose lives it has enriched need assurance that this government cares about the social fabric that links the community and that this government sees the invaluable benefits to the community and will continue to fund the program. I take my hat off to Margaret Spriggs and her team of development workers, who go into the community every day. Margaret, I thank you, and the over 1,500 families you touch every week thank you. I implore the Rudd government to show that it understands by reinvesting in the program. Solomon Electorate: Jape Family Business the Jape family for their significant business celebrations. Last week I had the pleasure of attending the Jape Furnishing Superstore’s 30th birthday celebrations. As with so many Chinese-Timorese family businesses operating in Solomon, the history of the family and the store is fascinating. Jape Kong Su arrived in Darwin in 1975, just after Cyclone Tracy. Although he spoke no English and knew very little about Australia, he was able to establish and successfully operate a small business supplying urgently needed accommodation in Darwin.

Two sons also started a new business venture, and the Jape Furnishing Superstore was opened in October 1978 at the Jape Shopping Centre. In 1989, the furnishing superstore was relocated to its current address in the next big project, the Jape Homemaker Village in suburban Millner. Today the Jape Furnishing Superstore employs over 300 staff and is a leading domestic and commercial furniture supplier in the Top End. The Jape Homemaker Village has grown from strength to strength since then, to include national stores like The Good Guys, Spotlight and Freedom. Additionally, major franchise businesses such as Forty Winks and Fernwood Women’s Health Club provide great options for people in Darwin and Palmerston. I know the people of Solomon enjoy shopping in the precinct, which offers a wide range of largely specialty stores in a convenient location. Solomon is home to people from all corners of the globe, and this diversity has shaped our part of the world for the better, particularly in our local business community. In the business community, Territorians of Chinese origin provide profound benefits to the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Successful businesses operated by the Lai, Lee, Yap, Tchia, Mu and Lay families, to name but a few, have been significant in the development and prosperity of Darwin and Palmerston. I should also say that, just like all the Chinese-Timorese community businesses in Darwin, the Jape group not only serves Territorians in the business community but also is very active in the wider community by being involved in local community work and donating to charities, schools and social groups. Once again, I congratulate the Jape family, along with all the Chinese-Timorese family businesses, for their valued, continuing contribution to the people of Solomon. constituency statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to provide a more robust legal basis for air security officers to lawfully discharge their firearms on board aircraft. The air security officer program was introduced by the coalition government in December 2001 to address the threats of terrorism in the skies following the September 11 attacks. The presence of armed covert officers on domestic and international flights is part of a multilevel approach to enhancing security on flights in and from Australia. This measure is complemented by enhanced airport security procedures-better and more thorough screening, the presence of Australian Federal Police at airports and other security efforts. The air security officer program is another line of defence to ensure that the skies are safe for travellers. Since December 2001, air security officers have been placed on a number of domestic and international flights to provide security for the Australian travelling public against the threat of hijackings. Many countries have similar programs, and the air security officer program introduced by the previous government meets international best practice.

Air security officers are highly trained in negotiation skills and defensive tactics, and the use of firearms is always intended to be employed as a last resort. The officers are trained to respond appropriately and in accordance with the level of threat. Thankfully, there have been no incidents requiring an air security officer to discharge their firearm. Perhaps this is a testament to the effectiveness of the scheme. Certainly, it is a program which the coalition regards as a legitimate and necessary component of aviation security. At the moment, the legislative basis by which air security officers may lawfully discharge a firearm on an aircraft occurs via the periodic issuance of notices under regulation 144 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. These regulations permit air security officers to carry and discharge a firearm in the legal conduct of their duty without risk of prosecution. It has been suggested that the legal basis for this arrangement is unnecessarily cumbersome. The provision of such notices may also be inconsistent with the intent of the Civil Aviation Act 1988. To provide greater certainty regarding the lawful conduct of air security officers, the legislation before us proposes to amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 so that new regulations can be made under this legislation to permit air security officers to lawfully discharge their firearms without risk of prosecution. These amendments would also permit an extraterritorial provision applying to Australian aircraft or aircraft engaged in Australian international carriage. This is to permit an air security officer to lawfully discharge a firearm on board an Australian aircraft outside Australian territory. The opposition supports the air security program and any legislative effort to improve its efficient functioning. It was, as I mentioned earlier, an initiative of the former government. It is an initiative that is valuable and should be maintained. I therefore in this debate call on the Rudd Labor government to guarantee its future. To do so would be a sign that it takes this component of aviation security seriously. I raise this point in the light of what is at best disturbing ambivalence from the Rudd Labor government regarding the air security officer program. Earlier this year, there was a spate of media articles flagging that the number of air security officers was to be cut by one-third. The media reports also claim that the Rudd Labor government will reduce the rest periods that air security officers are permitted to take at the end of long-haul flights and that it is considering plans to rotate air security officers to other areas of the Australian Federal Police for periods of three months-in other words, to take them out of their fundamental role. Obviously, these measures will seriously compromise the capacity of air security officers to protect the flight deck in a security emergency. Unfortunately, the response of the government to these concerns has been totally inadequate. It has simply failed to give any assurances about the continuation of this program. For example, I note that the recent budget failed to offer explicit funding for the air security officer program beyond this financial year, and I am informed that redundancy offers are currently being circulated to air security officers. This is clear evidence that the numbers are being reduced. I also note the evasive answers offered by Senator Ludwig in the other place in response to some specific questions by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. On 14 February this year, during questions without notice, Senator Ludwig failed to provide any assurance that the Rudd government would not cut the air security program by the levels flagged in the media-in other words, by at least a third. Instead, the representative of the Attorney-General in the other place couched his answers in weasel words by citing ‘operational requirements’. MAIN COMMITTEE However, in spite of his attempts to fudge, he did admit that there had been changes in the presence of air security officers on international flights. SoI ask the government again: will it guarantee the future of the air security officer program? Are the changes cited by Senator Ludwig simply code words for ‘reductions’? Will the government keep the air security program at the level of the previous coalition government? Or does the government intend to play fast and loose with the security of the air-travelling public and cut the initiative further? I appreciate that the operation of this program depends, at least to some extent, on it being secret, on people not knowing which flights the security officers are travelling on, because no-one has suggested that the nation can reasonably bear the cost of there being an officer of this nature on every aircraft. So there does need to be some level of confidentiality about the operations. But, if the service is not being reduced, if the government has nothing to hide, it could at least come out and guarantee that the service is being maintained at the levels that applied in the past and that there will be no reduction in the number of security officers being employed. Why are redundancy offers currently being circulated amongst employees? Unless the government can give some confident assurances to the people of Australia that this program is not being wound back, the public will have a right to be at least deeply suspicious that a veil of confidentiality is being used to cover up a sinister winding-back of this program. Who knows what risks there may be to the Australian travelling public? I now turn to some of the particulars of the bill. I noted earlier that the coalition is happy to support any legislative amendment to make more efficient and effective the functioning of the air security officer program. One question I do have concerns the application of any extraterritorial regulation made under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. In raising this matter, I accept the need for an extraterritorial provision to apply to air services officers on an aircraft outside Australian territory. However, the opposition is concerned that such a provision will not lead to additional Australian regulatory requirements on overseas airlines in foreign jurisdictions. I refer specifically to section 134 of the bill, which states: (1) Any provisions of the regulations may be expressed to apply to and in relation to any of the following: (a) Australian aircraft; (b) aircraft (other than Australian aircraft) engaged in Australian international carriage; (c) passengers on board, and members of the crew of, aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) or (b); while the aircraft are outside Australian territory. Clearly, the above provision surpasses the current extraterritorial provision under section 6 of the Aviation Transport Security Act, which is limited to Australia aircraft and then on board the aircraft. I am concerned that the proposed wording may provide a precedent for the Office of Transport Security to tie any regulation to both Australian and foreign airlines’ overseas operations in the air and on the ground. This matter had been raised with the opposition by the aviation industry, who are unhappy with the response that they have received from the Office of Transport Security to these concerns. As a consequence, I seek an assurance from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government that any extraterritorial regulation made under these new regulations will be solely in the context of the operation of the air security officers and that this legislation will not become a precedent to impose any further domestic obligation on overseas airline operations, both in the air and on the ground. I informed the minister’s office during the briefing that he provided to my staff on MAIN COMMITTEE Monday that I would be raising this issue. I hope therefore that in his summary in response to this debate he can provide extra advice on the intent of section 134 of the bill and assurances that this will not be used to create a whole new precedent for and a whole new method of making regulations for the aviation industry. Pending that assurance, the opposition are happy to support the bill. We strongly support the operation of the air security officer program. The fact that the Australian aviation sector has been free of terrorist incidents is important, and undoubtedly the presence of air security officers provides a deterrent to those of ill intent who threaten danger to our aviation industry. SoI support the legislation but I do seek an assurance from the minister about the way in which the regulations will particularly apply. I would also strongly urge the government to give the Australian travelling public confidence that they have no plans to wind back this program, there will not be cuts to its budget, they are not seeking to reduce the number of air security officers and this program will be maintained as an important part of Australia’s line against terrorism in aviation in this country. (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 deals with some of the harsh realities that our society must now face. It puts in place new regulations to be made under the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 to permit air security officers, otherwise known as ASOs, to use their firearms on board aircraft in Australian territory or on board Australian aircraft in foreign territory. Of course, this must occur within the course of their duties. The situation today is that ASOs using their firearms cannot do so without the risk of prosecution. This bill will change both the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to allow the use of firearms by ASOs under these conditions. This is indeed a tough amendment. It is a complicated amendment but it is an amendment that as a member of parliament you do have to give some additional thought and attention to. These laws are for extreme circumstances. The fact is that, while 9-11 style incidents occur rarely and we do the best we can to prevent them, they do happen. They have happened and, in my view, they will happen again unless we take clear steps to prevent them. When they occur we need to have the laws in place to deal with the situation and protect our citizens, and we need to have the laws in place to protect the innocent citizens from other countries who may be visiting our country or on our aeroplanes operated out of our country. I want to go through a little detail on the ASO program. The ASO program involves the placement of covert armed security officers on select domestic and international flights to protect the flight deck. The Attorney-General’s Department has carriage of the ASO program, with the Office of Transport Security providing transport policy input and managing legislation provisions that support the program. Currently, the ASO program is underpinned by the ATSA, the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 and the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988. These regulations and the acts under which they are made effectively permit an ASO to engage in conduct necessary for the performance of duties that would otherwise be contrary to Commonwealth legislation-for example, the possession of a firearm on an aircraft. There is no point having these laws and regulations without the personnel carrying them out clearly understanding what their position is. The purpose of the ASOs is for security on aircraft. At the moment the ASOs know that under the current regulatory environment they run the risk of being sued. In an extreme crisis situation such as these people are being trained MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 1 Bill 2008
188,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (10.13 Am),"The Aviation Legislation Amendmentfor, there needs to be clarity around their rights and responsibilities. The situation at present is dealt with by CASA issuing periodic notices. The current notice expires on 30 June 2008. The AGD, CASA and the OTS have agreed that these notices should not be renewed as they imply that it is safe to discharge a firearm on board an aircraft. It would be much better to replace the notices with new regulations under the ATSR to provide a more appropriate basis to deal with the discharge of firearms. The other important matter in this bill is the operation of these regulations in places other than Australia. ASOs operate internationally and it is important these provisions are given effect internationally, or ‘extraterritorially’, as the terminology has it. The Australian Government Solicitor has said that the ATSA, and thereby any regulations made under it, does not currently have extraterritorial operation. Therefore, also contained in this bill are provisions giving powers under the ATSA to enable regulations to have effect extraterritorially. The specific effect of this is that these regulations will now apply to Australian aircraft or aircraft engaged in Australian international carriage and the crew and passengers on board these aircraft. Leaving aside the technical aspects of this bill, it is pretty simple. It is about providing a greater level of security for our flying public. The program which this bill forms only a part of involves the placement of covert armed security officers on select domestic and international flights to protect the flight deck and personnel. It is a sad comment on our society that we now have to take these measures. I sincerely wish it were otherwise. But we all know that today we live in a world where, for whatever reason, people arrive at or are driven to beliefs and actions that are so extreme they will do anything to get a point across or to pursue their beliefs. We know that aircraft are being targeted now as potential weapons of mass destruction, with innocent passengers’ lives treated as inconsequential. September 11 showed the reality of the risk and the horrific impact on thousands of families when there is not in place a strong aviation security system. This bill is part of an improved security system to protect the innocent against such attacks. I commend this bill to the House. rity became a major political issue in this country. When on September 11 2001 three hijacked planes struck domestic United States targets and a fourth crashed after passengers sought to retake control of the aeroplane, the world changed. The parliament was quick to pass measures to strengthen air security in this country. By 19 October 2001, the minister had announced new measures to protect air security, including placing air security officers on domestic and international flights. The air security officer program commenced in December 2001, with air security officers deployed to fly on domestic flights. To date, the program has expanded to also cover some international flights to Singapore and the United States. Air security officers are specially trained AFP officers who are armed when travelling and travel in teams of two or more. The pilot is the only person on board, other than the air security officers themselves, who is aware that there are armed security officers on board. According to the AFP, the integrity of the program relies on these ASOs blending in with other travellers. The random and covert nature of these deployments is considered to be an important deterrent to any attack on board a flight. Unfortunately, the threats that air security officers work to prevent are very real. On 29 May 2003, a Qantas Boeing 717 flight from Melbourne to Launceston was the scene of an onboard knife attack that injured two crew members and two passengers. Thankfully, the asMAIN COMMITTEE",182,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 1 Bill 2008
189,Mr Clare (Blaxland) (10.19 Am),"There are no prizes for guessing what day air secusailant was subdued before doing any further damage. But these threats need to be prevented, and air security officers need to be empowered to do their job of protecting airline crew and the travelling public. So what does the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 do? The measures in this bill will permit air security officers to lawfully discharge their firearms on board an aircraft in Australian territory or on board an Australian aircraft in foreign territory. The lawful discharge of a firearm can only occur in the course of their duties-and that is an important point to make-in preventing unlawful interference with an aircraft. Unlawful discharge risks prosecution. The system, as I understand it, will be equivalent to that which applies to police officers. Before becoming a member of parliament, for four years I was an adviser to the police minister in New South Wales. I got some experience working in the area of police powers and worked with the Police Association and the police service in New South Wales to make sure that police had the powers they needed to do their job. Those powers included those following the implementation of the new gun laws across the country in 1996, which were measuresvery good measures-introduced by the Howard government. There was also the introduction of other laws, like move-on powers, knife law legislation and drug house laws. The important point is that the people who have an obligation to protect us must be given the powers they need to do their job. They need to be given the skills and the resources that they need. I know the member for Werriwa would concur with that, having worked in this area as well. Existing regulations do not allow an air security officer to discharge a firearm in an aircraft without the risk of prosecution. Obviously, this puts them in a pretty unworkable position, and that legislative defect has until now been addressed by the periodic issuing of notices under regulation 144 of the Civil Aviation Regulations. This bill moves the existing set of regulations from the safety legislation framework to the air security legislative framework. The bill also deals with the complicated extraterritorial issues created by the air security officers program. Extraterritoriality refers to the effect of the laws that apply beyond our national jurisdiction. The Australian Government Solicitor has advised that the Aviation Transport Security Act, and thereby any regulations made under the act, does not currently have extraterritorial operation. This means that, unless the act is amended to enable regulations to have extraterritorial effect, a regulation cannot be made under the Aviation Transport Security Regulations to permit an Australian air security officer to lawfully discharge a firearm on board an Australian aircraft outside Australian territory. The bill will amend the regulation, making the power under the Aviation Transport Security Act to enable the making of regulations that have extraterritorial operation. The amendment will be modelled on existing section 27 of the Air Navigation Act 1920. Under this approach, regulations will only have extraterritorial operation if specified and will only apply to Australian aircraft or aircraft engaged in Australian international carriage and the crew and passengers on board those aircraft. The bill also makes a small technical amendment to the Civil Aviation Act. Section 23 of the act currently says that an aircraft or person must not, amongst other things, carry dangerous goods on board an aircraft except in accordance with the Civil Aviation Act or with the written permission of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. So a minor technical amendment to section 23 is required to make it clear that an aircraft or person must not carry dangerous goods on board an aircraft except in accordance with the Civil Aviation Act or with the writMAIN COMMITTEE ten permission of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or in accordance with the Aviation Transport Security Regulations. We all have a duty to ensure that passenger aircraft in this country are as safe as possible and, in a post September 11 environment, the air safety officer program is an important part of ensuring this safety and protecting aircraft crews and the public from threats that could eventuate midflight. I hope that air safety officers never have to discharge a firearm on board an Australian plane, but I am glad that there are men and women who are willing, trained and able to do so if the need arises. The least we can do as legislators is to ensure that they are not in the position of being prosecuted for doing so. These laws provide quite properly for the exceptional and terrible circumstance where it is necessary for them to discharge their weapon to protect passengers, the crew and the safety of an aircraft. I think that is appropriate and I think it is the least that we can do. I commend the bill to the House. ment and Local Government) (10.26 am)-in reply-I rise to thank members for their comments on and contributions to the debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. Australia’s aviation security regulatory framework has multiple layers of protection to ensure passengers in our aviation industry are safeguarded and it is able to respond quickly to threats of unlawful interference with a plane. This bill makes technical amendments which will enhance the air security officer program. The air security officer program places covert armed security officers on select domestic and international flights to protect the flight deck. Currently air security officers are allowed to discharge firearms on board an aircraft through exemptions granted under safety legislation. The government is concerned that providing ongoing exemptions for officers under safety legislation is inconsistent with the purpose of safety legislation. This is because the exemptions imply that it is safe to discharge a firearm on board an aircraft. To fix this, the bill amends the regulation-making power under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. Currently, section 6 of the act allows offences to be created under the act for all aircraft engaged in Australian international carriage. However, it does not allow regulations that would overcome offence provisions containing other legislation, such as an offence for discharging a firearm as contained in the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991. The proposed new section 134 creates a regulation-making power sufficient to address this problem within the geographical coverage of the current offence-making power. This will allow regulations to be made permitting on-duty air security officers to lawfully discharge their firearms on board an aircraft in the Australian territory or on an Australian aircraft in foreign territory if it is for the purpose of preventing or responding to an act of unlawful interference with aviation. This bill will provide an appropriate and permanent basis to deal with the lawful discharge of firearms by air security officers under aviation security legislation. I note that the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia have expressed concern that this amendment extends the powers of the Aviation Transport Security Act into operations that are currently not subject to the act. I can assure the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia that the government does not intend to use aviation security legislation to interfere with the legitimate operations of airlines beyond the minimum necessary to ensure the secure operation of Australian aviation. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 1 Bill 2008
190,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional DevelopBill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008 implements elements of the previous coalition government’s 2005 aviation discussion paper. It will address some regulatory issues associated with oversight of the system of international airline licences and mandatory airline insurance. The international airline licence system, established under the Air Navigation Act 1920 and its accompanying regulations, ensures that scheduled international air services occur in accordance with bilateral air services agreements struck between Australia and our international aviation partners. There are, however, inefficiencies associated with the administrative framework of international airline licences. One such problem is that, once issued, international airline licences remain in force indefinitely and the conditions associated with that issuance are difficult to vary. This has led to licences remaining in force even though the airlines they were issued to have ceased to exist or to operate services to Australia. Licences also may not reflect new requirements, creating discrepancies based on the time of issuance. Interestingly, this system of perpetual licensing was introduced in 1994 by the Keating Labor government, and the previous coalition government recognised the need for it to be modernised. This bill will end perpetual licensing. It will implement a scheme where existing international airline licences will be cancelled and reissued with standardised and updated conditions. The bill will enable the making of regulations to achieve this objective. Airlines will have to demonstrate their compliance with safety, security and insurance regulations to be reissued with a licence. This change will ensure that international airline licences remain consistent with the latest aviation practice and relevant international agreements. Regulations are disallowable instruments, and the coalition will ensure that any regulations made are appropriate-that they protect the safety of Australians who travel by air but do not impose unreasonable burdens on the aviation industry. The new system will allow airlines to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the event an international airline licence is not granted by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It will also clarify the application of international airline licences to common commercial aviation agreements such as code sharing, where two airlines sell tickets for the same flight, and wet leasing, where one airline sells tickets for a scheduled international service but hires the aircraft and crew from another airline to operate the flight. Additionally, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is currently limited in its ability to regularly audit and enforce the rules regarding non-voidable insurance for passenger-carrying air operators. Under the proposed new system, the entire regulatory framework for international airline licences will move under the Air Navigation Regulations 1947. This will simplify the current system. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 1 Bill 2008
191,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (10.30 am)-The Aviation LegislationThe bill proposes that air carriers be required not to obtain a certificate of compliance from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority before operating a flight but to provide a declaration that they have appropriate insurance. Failure to provide such a declaration would incur a minor administrative penalty. The authority to carry passengers, however, will only be valid whilst carriers hold appropriate insurance. If the insurance were to lapse, the authority to carry passengers would automatically lapse. Carrying passengers under these circumstances would trigger criminal sanctions. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will also be given authority to regularly audit air carriers and ensure that they are in compliance with mandatory insurance rules. This will streamline the administrative processes and enable the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to proactively enforce insurance requirements for air carriers. To date, the current system surrounding the issuing of international airline licences and carriers’ liability insurance has not resulted in any major breaches of public safety, and such a breach may never occur. The coalition accepts, however, that this regulatory framework can be finetuned and improved. That is why, under the previous government, the then Department of Transport and Regional Services issued a discussion paper in 2005 proposing a number of changes to Australian aviation regulatory processes. Such changes included revising the system of perpetual licensing introduced in 1994 and the system of mandatory carriers’ liability insurance introduced following the Monarch Airlines crash in 1993. The coalition discussion paper also suggested that Australia should accede to the Montreal convention. Parliament has now approved a bill doing just this and the coalition-in fact, all parties-were happy to support our accession to that convention. Likewise, the coalition are willing to support further implementation of the changes suggested in the paper, such as finetuning the system of perpetual international air licences and the rules regarding mandatory carriers’ liability insurance. The discussion paper was widely circulated amongst the Australian air travel industry in 2005, and its proposals met with the approval of key aviation stakeholders. Further consultation with carriers, including our major airline operators in Australia, has confirmed that these measures still enjoy industry support. The coalition are proud of our efforts in government to modernise Australia’s aviation legislation. We supported acceding to the Montreal convention and are happy to support the latest round of changes to improve efficiency in the air travel industry and to protect Australian passengers. ers on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008. This is obviously an important bill for the future protection of standards in airline licensing and for improving insurance compliance issues, but it is also an important bill in that it continues to build a regulatory regime that creates a stable and secure environment for operators in the industry. This bill also gives me the opportunity to talk about the establishment of Avalon as a future international airport site and how important this is to the future of my region. But I will get to that later. Firstly, the thrust of the bill, the direction of the bill, is about maintaining Australia’s reputation for having the safest, best regulated and best quality airline industry in the world. Mr Deputy Speaker, it probably would not surprise you if I said that there was often a lot of hyperbole in this place. There have been times when there has been an overstatement or two, but it is not an overstatement to say that Australia does have the reputation for the safest airline MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Aviation Legislation Amendment International Airline Licences And Carriers Liability Insurance Bill 2008
192,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (10.37 Am),"I am pleased to be one of the first speakindustry in the world, and the importance of that reputation cannot be overstated. Just on this note, I cannot let the moment go without mentioning what seems to be a worrying spate of recent incidents with an important Australian airline. I am, like many Australians, watching this very closely. I am sure the airline is watching this closely and checking its systems, and I hope this run of incidents does not continue. However, that matter aside, this amendment bill is another step in ensuring that we keep the mantle of having the world’s safest airline and the world’s best airline industry. The Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008 will improve two regulatory programs related to the aviation industry. It will amend the system of international airline licences so that the conditions attached to those licences can be standardised and the government’s capacity to audit compliance can be enhanced. It will also amend Australia’s system of mandatory carriers’ liability insurance to streamline the administrative processes and grant the civil aviation authority, CASA, improved powers to audit and enforce compliance with this scheme. There are two important decisions. Having standardised, agreed licence conditions which are of a high standard is a big step forward in the airline industry. However, having standard conditions for licences is one thing; the real test is enforcement of those conditions. How many times have we seen good laws and good regulation become useless laws and useless regulation because of a lack of compliance? I have seen that a lot in my lifetime, particularly in my time on council, and it is certainly something that I look forward to ensuring does not happen in this place. Another important purpose of this amendment is to make sure that there is not another example of that. This amendment actually improves the capacity of the government to audit international airline licences so that compliance is improved. In my view, that is extremely important. It is absolutely important in this industry that we have rigorous and uncompromising compliance regimes. This amendment also deals with insurance. Insurance is an integral part of the airline industry. Insurance is a significant cost to the industry. The Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959, the carriers’ liability act, requires carriers to maintain minimum levels of insurance to protect passengers in the event of an accident. The scheme is supplemented by provisions in the Civil Aviation Act 1988 which allow CASA to enforce the requirements as a part of their management of safety issues via the air operator certificate process. This bill improves the ability of CASA to proactively enforce insurance requirements for air carriers. Importantly, for operators, the bill also streamlines administrative processes. Going into a bit of detail on this bill, it is important to know that the system of international airline licences is established under the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the regulations that go with it. International airline licences make sure that we comply with bilateral air service agreements and arrangements. These are important agreements between Australia and our international aviation partners. International airline licences must be compliant with these agreements because they are effectively final checking mechanisms of various safety and security protocols that must be in place before commencement of operations. After consultation with the industry, it was clear that a number of technical problems exist with the existing administrative framework for international airline licences. To give you just one example: under the current provisions of airline licensing, once a licence is granted it lasts forever unless an airline contravenes a provision in the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Air MAIN COMMITTEE Navigation Regulations 1947 or the conditions in the licence itself. Today licences exist for airlines that were long ago defunct. The bill will move the entire regulatory framework for international airline licences into the Air Navigation Regulations 1947 and give the regulations the capacity to deal with the granting, variation, suspension and cancellation of international airline licences by the security of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. The regulations will then be updated to rectify the current administrative deficiencies in the international airline licences system and enhance auditing processes. I think this builds on an already strong regulatory system for our airlines; it improves them even more. The strength and robustness that our airline licensing and regulatory system generates generally is important when establishing new airport facilities. I want to take this opportunity to talk about a very important aviation licensing issue in the region of which my electorate forms a part. I also note that the federal member for Corio is here. I think the strength of the airline regulatory system overall bodes well for the ultimate establishment of Avalon Airport, not just as a domestic airport but ultimately as one of Australia’s most important international airports and a very important airport for my region. It is very important that these sorts of regulatory systems are in place so that people have the confidence in new and establishing airports like Avalon. I do believe that one day we will see Avalon as an international airport. I note that the Australian government, the Rudd Labor government, has no objection in principle to the establishment of an international terminal at Avalon Airport and encourages new international services. I would like to put on record my sentiments about Avalon and its importance to the region. Firstly, I want to say this: clearly if Avalon went international the tourism industry in my region would go to a whole new level. In short, tourism would go ballistic. The boost to existing levels of tourism in the city of Geelong, the Otways and of course the Great Ocean Road would be just huge. Job numbers and the range of jobs in tourism would just explode. Tourism would also explode across the Bellarine Peninsula, the Surf Coast, Colac Otways and of course Geelong itself. Local jobs for tens of thousands of people moving into the area are very important. That is just the most obvious impact. Of greater significance again would be the broader industry benefits, and those are the real key. Geelong is currently at the start of a major industry transition process. We are diversifying from traditional manufacturing and looking to future industries. There is a wide range of industry groups, academics and companies working on this transition. The greater Geelong region today has its eyes firmly focused on the future. We are looking at high-tech manufacturing, advanced health research and bioindustries. An international airport at Avalon is absolutely vital in assisting the region in diversifying from traditional manufacturing and to high technology and high-skill industries in the future. An international airport at Avalon would boost all these industries. An international airport would bring specialist service skills in itself. It would also give us the ability to bring in products just in time for other industries and to export products more efficiently. It could spawn new aquaculture or other food product industries, for example, and our region is doing a lot of work on that. It would allow visiting experts and delegations to land on our doorstep in a fully modern city. The establishment of an international airport at Avalon would benefit our region immensely, and I am 100 per cent behind that push. I also understand the caution that is needed to get it right. An international airport at Avalon would mean moving Australia’s border to our MAIN COMMITTEE very own doorstep. Avalon would become Australia’s border. There are very important issues of security, quarantine and customs. This would require a very thorough major development plan. It would require not just a good licensing and airline insurance system but an airport plan that would serve us all well for decades to come. As I understand it, the landowner of Avalon, the Australian Department of Defence, would be pleased to receive a fresh major development plan for consideration. I also understand Avalon are keen for the development of international services from the airport and will be submitting a new proposal for the consideration of Defence, hopefully in the not-too-distant future. I hope very much for the sake of the region, for the future of the region, that this goes ahead. This bill that we are considering today, which is about the integrity of our airline licensing system, gives me confidence. It gives me confidence that we have the regulatory structures in place to protect air travellers, protect operators and one day allow the people of Geelong to fly overseas from Avalon with all of the confidence in the world of making it there and back safely. It also gives me confidence that the local airline industry in our region can one day soon have international carrying capacity, bringing new industries to our region and exporting our products to the world. Avalon is very important for our future in our region. I commend this bill to the House. lowed my colleague and neighbour the member for Corangamite either in the House or here in the Main Committee. Clearly it is Geelong day today in the Main Committee, as evidenced by the member for Corangamite and me being here now-as it will be of course at the McG in just over a month! We wait with great anticipation for that event. I congratulate the member for Corangamite on what he has just said about Avalon and echo his sentiments in relation to that. What you have just heard is a very erudite rendition of the issues which face Avalon and why Avalon is so important for the Geelong region, and I completely concur with my colleague’s statements in relation to that. I will refer to Avalon a bit later in my speech, but I think he has put the issues very well and it is very important for us as a country to deal with that. I rise today to speak in support of the Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008. It seeks to amend the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988. This bill will introduce and amend measures in relation to international airline licences and carriers’ liability insurance. On international airline licences, in essence this bill moves the regulatory framework into the Air Navigation Regulations 1947, which exist as part of the Air Navigation Act 1920. It will put into the power of the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government the ability to deal with licence alterations. It will also update existing administrative deficiencies in the international airline licence system. In relation to insurance, this bill will toughen, it will improve, the insurance requirements for international airlines and it will enable CASA to have better abilities to audit and enforce those insurance requirements while also improving the administrative processes which surround that. The culmination of all of this will be to provide greater clarity and assistance to Australian aviation operators in dealing with all of these administrative processes. It will enhance insurance provisions and it will ensure the interests and safety of the Australian travelling public. MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Aviation Legislation Amendment International Airline Licences And Carriers Liability Insurance Bill 2008
193,Mr Marles (Corio) (10.50 Am),"I think this is the first occasion on which I have folThe aviation industry, in particular the international aviation industry, is a growing industry worldwide-it is certainly a growing industry in this country. The first scheduled international service arrived in Australia in December 1934, and the international aviation industry as it stands now would be beyond the wildest imaginations, one expects, of the pilots who flew that first plane back then. Just over 50 years later, in June 1985, there were 30 licensed international carriers trafficking just under five million passengers in and out of Australia. Now, two decades on from that, we see that these figures have grown exponentially again: in 2007, 22.7 million passengers travelled with 55 licensed carriers on almost 120,000 separate flights in and out of Australia. This is an industry which is growing despite the whole lot of adversity it has experienced over the last decade. We have seen jet fuel prices in Australia more than double in the five years from June 2002. We saw rising insurance costs in the wake of September 11 2001, and we saw a decline in international aviation travel as a result of that event. And we have seen increased airport usage costs which, in turn, when one thinks about security, relate to that event as well. But in the face of that we have seen an industry which has continued to grow such that in the June quarter of last year the aerospace industry in this country accounted for almost three-quarters of one per cent of national GDP. Yet it is an industry which was consistently let down by the former government, and the delay in this needed legislation reaching this parliament is another example of that. On 28 May this year I rose to speak in support of the Civil Aviation Amendment (1999 Montreal Convention and Other Measures) Bill 2008. That was in essence a bill which ratified Australia’s obligations in relation to international carrier liability insurance as prescribed under the Montreal convention. It was in June 1999 that the then Minister for Transport, the then leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, the former member for Gwydir, announced a consultative process with a view to ratifying the Montreal convention. That occurred in June 1999. Yet by the time of the November election last year, in 2007, absolutely nothing had been done to ratify that convention. It took this government to pull that off the shelf, dust it off and put it into action. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill was ultimately passed by this parliament on 26 June this year. In this bill we have another example of failure on the part of the previous government to do anything meaningful for the aviation industry in this country. We have seen a complete lack of will on the part of the conservative parties in this country to put their shoulder to the wheel and do some hard work in the area of aviation. We saw an inability on their part to commit resources to assisting one of this nation’s most important and growing industries to conduct their business better and to conduct it with greater security and at the same time with less red tape. The origins of this bill in relation to international airline licences can be traced back to September 2005 when the then government released a discussion paper. Shortly after that the feedback from the stakeholders was received and collated; it was positive in relation to moving down the path that we are currently moving down today. So from the start of 2006 until the end of the Howard government in November 2007 they were completely aware that the aviation industry wanted the measures that we have before us today, yet they did absolutely nothing. For more than half of their final term in office, the Howard government did absolutely nothing on the issue that we are talking about today except squabble amongst themselves as to who should be the leader and look in desperation at the election which they had to MAIN COMMITTEE face at the end of last year. While busy with its infighting, the Liberal Party did nothing to help an industry which now represents almost three-quarters of one per cent of national GDP-an industry which, as I said, ferries 22 million international travellers in and out of this country. It is an industry which is absolutely integral to the future of this country, and the Howard government did nothing about it. But this country can now relax in the knowledge that the Rudd government is in place and is here to support the nation’s aviation industry and the nation’s travelling public. That is what we did when we passed the civil aviation bill earlier this year and that is what we are doing in dealing with this bill today, the Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008. Going to the bill specifically, previously I noted that this can be thought of in two distinct parts. The first is in relation to improving the system of international airline licences and the second is in relation to improving the system of mandatory airline insurance. I will start with international airline licences. The international airline licence system that we have in this country was established under the Air Navigation Act 1920. The licences which are provided under that act serve an important purpose. They serve for scheduled international air services the function of making sure that there is compliance with bilateral air service agreements and with the arrangements which exist between Australia and its international aviation partners. As well they provide a final checking device to ensure that the safety and security obligations of the international airlines which currently operate in our skies meet the obligations under those airline licences. So these international airline licences, as a piece of architecture, are clearly critical to the whole system of air safety in this country. The amendments in this bill in relation to that system will strengthen the existing provisions and safety guards which are provided under those licences and in the same breath remove the excessive complexity which exists around them. The current situation pertaining to international airline licences is one which sees international airline licences, once given, remain in force indefinitely-barring, of course, a contravention by the licence holder of any of the obligations contained in the licence. That has over the years become out of date, if you like, and created a range of anomalies. It has given rise to the situation where a number of licences exist for airlines which no longer operate in Australian skies. It has also given rise to other anomalies by virtue of the changing nature of the regulatory regime over the years. Depending on when a licence was given, the obligations under it may differ from those of a licence given at a different time. So for each of the licences that now apply there are different obligations. That gives rise to inconsistent regulation across the whole sector. It also gives rise to a nightmare for the regulatory authorities trying to audit these licences and ensure that there is compliance, because the obligations under the regulations differ from one licence to the next. This bill, first of all, seeks to rectify that situation. It does so through a number of means, and there are two that I specifically want to refer to. Firstly, it moves the regulatory framework for all international aviation licences into the Air Navigation Regulations. In doing so, it gives the power to the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for the granting, variation, suspension and cancellation of international airline licences. That is an important administrative step forward. Significantly, this bill will also provide for time constraints on the licences-that is, the licences will exist for a particular period of time and there will be an obligation on the part of the holders of inMAIN COMMITTEE ternational airline licences to have those licences renewed on a periodic basis. That in turn will mean that the regulations and obligations which flow from those licences will be consistent from one carrier to the next. This begs the obvious and important question about whether or not that will increase regulatory burden on the licence holders. But I am happy to report to the Committee that there has been extensive consultation with the currently operating international airlines in this country on this provision. They do not anticipate that there will be any problems with complying with these requirements and they are quite happy to do that. It is important to note that, in circumstances where for whatever reason a licence is withheld as a result of measures in this bill, an appeal process will allow review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The government believes that the provisions contained in this bill, as they relate to international airline licences, will provide the travelling public with much greater safety by standardising the requirements of international carriers operating in Australia and will assist the operators themselves in clarifying and simplifying their regulatory and administrative obligations under the international airline licence system. As I stated, this is a measure which is long overdue. In relation to airline carriers’ liability insurance, the existing provisions can be found in the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959, which are supplemented by provisions in the Civil Aviation Act 1988. These acts in combination require that carriers operating in Australia maintain minimum levels of insurance to cover passengers for loss in relation to any accident. They also enable CASA to enforce insurance requirements as part of the air operators certificate process. This bill also puts in place important reforms in relation to that process. It will make it absolutely clear that an air operators certificate is only valid-and, as a consequence, the operator is only legal to fly-if there is insurance maintained under it. If, for whatever reason, that insurance lapses then the certificate lapses and it becomes illegal for operators to fly in those circumstances. It becomes illegal in circumstances where there will be significant penalties imposed upon the operators themselves-penalties which ultimately go to criminal sanctions. So this is a very important strengthening and toughening of the regime in relation to insurance. To complement that, this bill also provides for improved auditing powers on the part of CASA in relation to enforcing air operators’ insurance requirements. We are beefing up the powers of the regulatory authority to ensure that the insurance is in place. In the same breath as doing that we are easing the regulatory burden and cutting the red tape for these airline operators when it comes to meeting their insurance requirements. Currently it is incumbent upon these airlines to obtain a certificate of compliance from CASA in relation to their insurance. What will be sought as a result of this bill is simply a declaration from the operators that they have that insurance in place. Indeed, a failure to meet that particular notice requirement will be met with a small administrative penalty, but it will not prevent an airline from flyingprovided, of course, that the insurance is actually in place. So while on the one hand we are toughening up the substance of this regime, on the other hand we are actually cutting the red tape to make it easier to comply with on the part of the airlines. The member for Corangamite, who has just spoken, mentioned Avalon Airport. I want to briefly mention it as well. He has said how important Avalon Airport is to my electorate of Corio, to his electorate of Corangamite and to the entire Geelong region. At the moment it is a domestic airport which links into an international network. But, as the member for CoranMAIN COMMITTEE gamite said, we have very strong aspirations for this airport to in time become an international airport. I have spoken on that often in this place and I do not intend to repeat that now other than to say that it is absolutely imperative, as the member for Corangamite has said, that Avalon does become an international airport. In that context, this bill becomes very important. If Avalon becomes an international airport we will of course see as a result more Geelong people travelling internationally. So this regime, which puts in place more secure and safer airline travel-and airline travel which has more comprehensive insurance requirements as part of it-will be very important for both my constituents and the constituents of my colleague, the member for Corangamite. It is a very important measure for our country; it is a very important measure for the city of Geelong. In conclusion, this is another piece of legislation which should have been before the House years ago. It has a very small impact on the public purse. It is ultimately another example of the failure of the Howard government; it is another example of the inaction of the Howard government-particularly during its death throes in its last term in office. This is something that has been sitting on the books for years now and should have been before us way before this time. But it is good news that it is before this chamber now and that we have in place a government which is committed to ensuring the future of the Australian aviation industry. It is doing the detailed work to make sure that we have a safer and more secure industry for those who are travelling on airlines but also an industry which has the red tape removed from it so it is easier for those airlines to conduct their business in this country. This bill supports the interests of the aviation industry. This bill also increases the safety of travel for the Australian travelling public. I commend this bill to the House. this important debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008. It is an important bill because it will facilitate the much needed overhaul of two important aviation industry programs. Firstly, it will amend the system of international airline licences, IALs, so that the conditions attached to the licences can be standardised and the government is able to check that airlines are complying with licence conditions. Secondly, it will amend Australia’s system of mandatory airline insurance to streamline the administrative process and grant the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, improved powers to audit and enforce compliance with the scheme. The system of international airline licences will be revamped so that existing licences can be reissued with standardised and consistent conditions. Our system of IALs makes sure that flights are conducted in accordance with the bilateral agreements Australia has with our aviation partners. It also provides for a final checking system to make sure that all the safety, security and insurance approvals are in place before an airline starts services. The system that has been evolving for decades has been hampered by the government’s limited ability to cancel, amend and audit licences. Under the existing system, licences are on issue to airlines that no longer exist or that no longer fly to Australia. Different licences are subject to different conditions, and the government has limited ability to check that airlines are actually complying with the conditions. This bill will remove the entire regulatory framework for IALs in the Air Navigation Regulations 1947. Regulations will later be drafted to deal with the granting, variation, suspension and cancellation of IALs, rectifying the current administrative deficiencies of the system. This bill will give regulations the capacity to deal MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Aviation Legislation Amendment International Airline Licences And Carriers Liability Insurance Bill 2008
194,Mr Clare (Blaxland) (11.10 Am),"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution towith the granting, variation, suspension and cancellation of international airline licences by the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. The bill also amends Australia’s system of mandatory carriers’ liability insurance to streamline the administrative processes and grant CASA improved powers to audit and enforce compliance with the scheme. The Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959 requires carriers to maintain minimum levels of insurance to protect passengers in the event of an accident. The scheme is supplemented by the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, which allow CASA to enforce requirements as part of their management of safety issues via the air operator certificate process. Under the new system, carriers will no longer need to obtain a certificate of compliance from CASA before flights are operated. Instead, operators will be obliged to provide CASA with a declaration indicating that they have obtained that insurance. If the operator allows its insurance to lapse, authorisation to carry passengers will automatically lapse. The authorisation will automatically be reactivated as soon as the operator secures the appropriate insurance. If at any time an operator carries passengers without appropriate insurance, it will be subject to administrative and criminal sanctions under the Civil Aviation Act in addition to the criminal penalties that are currently imposed under the carriers’ liability act. The bill will also streamline administrative processes. It will cut down the paperwork for CASA’s oversight of the mandatory insurance scheme for airlines. It will also improve the ability of CASA to proactively enforce insurance requirements for air carriers. The Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008 will provide significant and long overdue improvements to the aviation industry. CanI also use this opportunity to commend the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for his focus on and the attention he has given to aviation issues in the short time that he has been minister-and some of those issues, it should be pointed out, bear heavily on his electorate. There has been the development of Australia’s first ever aviation white paper as well as his decision-and this was importantnot to allow the expansion of Bankstown Airport as Sydney’s second airport. Unlike the situation in Avalon described by the members for Corangamite and Corio earlier today, a major passenger airport is not wanted at Bankstown. Bankstown Airport is already the main general aviation airport for the Sydney region and-this may surprise some members-it is one of the busiest airports in the world. The threat of more movements and large passenger aircraft is not one that is welcomed by my local community but, under the master plan that was approved by the previous government, it is one that could occur. It just requires the runway at Bankstown to be lengthened and strengthened. Because this work-the lengthening and strengthening of the runway-would cost more than $20 million, it therefore constitutes a major development and so requires the approval of the federal government. My community was very relieved and very grateful when earlier this year the minister ruled out any expansion of the airport to become Sydney’s second airport. It is a good example of the difference a Labor government makes. Bankstown Airport is a great place to create local jobs but it is a bad place for large passenger aircraft. The minister recognised this and recognised that Bankstown is not the place for such an airport, so I thank him very much for that. Airports are a key part of our economic infrastructure. They provide jobs, they move freight and they underpin our economic growth. But they also have an impact on the commuMAIN COMMITTEE nities that live around them. They create extra noise and extra traffic and, as I said earlier, the minister understands this better than most. The people of Blaxland are very grateful for his decision in relation to Bankstown Airport, and I, as the member for Blaxland, thank him on their behalf. I look forward to the aviation white paper when it comes forward and I also look forward to the feasibility study that is currently being conducted on the M5 East duplication in Sydney’s west. It is a project that will help Sydney airport and make it work more effectively and more efficiently. It will reduce congestion between Sydney airport and my electorate and it will make the electorate of Blaxland a better place to live and work. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House. ment and Local Government) (11.16 am)-in reply-I thank all members for their contributions to this debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (International Airline Licences and Carriers’ Liability Insurance) Bill 2008. I particularly thank the member for Blaxland for his very generous comments. In the short time he has been the member for Blaxland, he has been an outstanding representative of his local community and has made strong representations about Bankstown Airport and other infrastructure issues involving Western Sydney. This bill streamlines and improves two aviation regulatory schemes. The international airline licence system will be updated to enhance the Australian government’s ability to ensure that airlines are complying with licence conditions. The bill will also improve the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s ability to ensure that airlines hold an appropriate contract of insurance to compensate passengers in the event of an accident. These changes will streamline the mandatory aviation insurance scheme and cut down the paperwork for airlines and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority alike. It is in the context of developing a national aviation strategy that the government continues to pursue reforms through the two pieces of aviation legislation which will be carried by the House of Representatives today. As the member for Blaxland mentioned, we also need to embark on a national aviation strategy. It is something that we have never had from any Australian government before now. I had a successful meeting this morning with my department again on the work leading up to the production of the aviation green paper. As an island continent, we rely very much on aviation-more so than most countries on earth-for our economic productivity and our cultural and other links with the rest of the world. That is why, whilst individual pieces of legislation such as this are important, it is also important that we actually have a strategic, long-term framework. That is what the government is doing in producing a green paper, which will lead to a national aviation strategy through a white paper process in 2009. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Aviation Legislation Amendment International Airline Licences And Carriers Liability Insurance Bill 2008
195,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional DevelopSAS Signaller Sean McCarthy Debate resumed from 26 August, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 8 July 2008, of SAS Signaller Sean McCarthy, an Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. Signaller Sean McCarthy is indeed a great example to all Australians. It is with a sense of pride, mixed with great sadness, that I rise to honour this fallen warrior, the sixth to die serving our country in Afghanistan since 2002. I pass on my sympathy and support to his family-his parents, David and Mary, and his sisters, Leigh and Clare-whom I had the pleasure of meeting and speaking to in the unfortunate circumstance of Sean’s funeral on the Gold Coast on 18 July this year. Sean is the second warrior from my electorate of Fadden to fall in Afghanistan and be buried; he is the second to have had the Australian flag draped over his coffin. Sean was born in New Zealand, but we proudly call him our own. He was a student at Trinity Lutheran College in Ashmore, where he graduated in 2000. At school, he represented Trinity on the sports field as a member of the 2/15 rugby team and Trinity water polo team, in addition to serving on the student representative council. He is remembered by the school as a reliable and trustworthy young man with a great sense of personal integrity and maturity, which was apparent to all who interacted with him. Staff recall Sean as being quick-witted and having a great sense of humour while remaining courteous and considerate towards others. It is no wonder that, in looking at his funeral as a testimony to his popularity, many from his school turned out with stories and anecdotes from their time with Sean. Indeed, one of his very early primary school teachers turned out to speak glowingly of Sean as a young man. Sean was clearly popular with his peers at school and with his colleagues and compatriots in the Army. He was disciplined, focused and a great example of the modern digger, the modern Sean enlisted in the Australian Defence Force on 10 July 2001. He was posted to the 7th Signals Regiment on 14 July 2003 and went into the Special Air Service Regiment on 15 January 2007. He was an active member of the regiment until his tragic death on 8 July this year. Sean was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. He was not married. He was 25 years old. Sean’s operational experience included Special Operations Task Force5 in Afghanistan in 2007, Operation Astute in East Timor in 2008 and redeployment to Afghanistan in 2008. Having served for only seven years with three operational deployments, Sean never shirked his responsibility and his duty to move into the operational theatre and to defend Australia’s interests. Sean was awarded a Special Operations Command Australia commendation. In speaking to Sean’s CO in the Special Air Service Regiment, I was told that when Sean was given the commendation he simply shrugged his shoulders and got on with the job. There was no great public ceremony and there were no great words-he simply accepted it as a matter of doing his duty. He received the Australian Defence Medal for service, the International Coalition against Terrorism Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Medal and the Return of Active Service Badge. MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Aviation Legislation Amendment International Airline Licences And Carriers Liability Insurance Bill 2008
196,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.20 Am),"Benjamin Disraeli said:Signaller Sean McCarthy’s sacrifice was not in vain. He is a beacon of inspiration to other peacekeepers to provide a better future for the people they serve-in Sean’s case, those of Afghanistan. He stands tall as a man who believed that all people, wherever they may live, should have the opportunity to live in a better world, one free from violence, intimidation and repression. Though it can only ever be of small comfort to his family, Sean sacrificed his life serving and doing what he loved: taking care of, serving and representing his country. George Orwell once wrote: We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. Sean was such a man-a committed, dedicated soldier who fought for you and me and for us as a nation to keep us safe. On Remembrance Day this year, Sean’s name will be etched onto the War Memorial Roll of Honour to join those of the other five great Australian military heroes who have given their lives during the Afghanistan campaign. His sacrifice will never be forgotten. Fadden and all those members who will be here this morning to pay tribute to Signaller Sean McCarthy and to thank him for his service to his country. I am often asked: what is the most difficult part of the job of Defence minister? Despite the many and diverse challenges of the portfolio, the answer is without challenge: news of the loss of one of our people in a theatre of war. That is without doubt the toughest part of the job. It is tough for a number of reasons. It is tough because it is the loss of a person in the prime of his life-fit, active and highly skilled, with so much to offer. It is tough because it is the loss of a person who is leaving people behind-mums, dads, brothers, sisters, often wives or partners and children, and, of course, there are always mates. It is tough because we know that the person we have lost, unlike some in our society, was doing something really meaningful and worthwhile with his life, doing something for others-indeed, doing something for his country. You cannot help but ask, despite the dangerous nature of the vocation: why is it that the good guys suffer such a fate? I did not know Signaller McCarthy, but I am sure that he was one of the good guys. He must have been, because he dedicated his life to the defence of his nation and its people, putting his own life on the line so that we collectively could be safe. Sean was fatally wounded on 8 July while serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan’s Oruzgan province, where more than 1,000 of our men and women in uniform are working and fighting to both provide hope for the Afghan people and make the world a safer place in which to live, work and travel. Signaller McCarthy was killed when the vehicle in which he was travelling was struck by an improvised explosive device. This is another aspect of the event which saddens me. Losing a soldier in a small arms firefight is tragic enough; but to lose him to a cowardly act-that is, the use of an IED-to me, somehow makes it even more tragic. Ironically, the increasing use of IEDs is somewhat a measure of the toughness and skill of people like Sean McCarthy. It is a statement of fact that the insurgents in Afghanistan do not like taking on our people head-to-head. To Sean McCarthy’s father and mother, David and Mary, and his sisters, Leigh and Clare, I again extend my sympathy and thanks for his service. He was an outstanding soldier, displaying courage and professionalism in the most demanding of environments. The Chief of Army has told of Signaller McCarthy’s determination and the high standard of his work throughout MAIN COMMITTEE",197,ANZAC The Professional Australian Soldier
197,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Minister for Defence) (11.25 am)-I thank the member forhis military career. In recognition of this, Signaller McCarthy was awarded a Special Operations Command Australia commendation on 20 June 2008 for his actions in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of Special Operations Task Group Rotation V. Sean was awarded this for his excellent application of battlefield craft in a complex, dangerous and confusing situation. He was highly regarded by his colleagues, and his sense of humour was well known amongst those who served in his regiment. I take this opportunity today to remember those who have also given their lives in Afghanistan in the name of their country: Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Trooper David ‘Poppy’ Pearce, Private Luke Worsley and, of course, Sergeant Andrew Russell. On behalf of the Australian government and, I am sure, all members of parliament, I offer our prayers and our support to Signaller McCarthy’s family and friends. I extend reassurance to them and their families-to all of those affected-that his sacrifices will not be forgotten, nor will the sacrifices of those who went before him. To all those who continue to serve under the Australian flag, I say that we do appreciate their work, we do appreciate their sacrifices, and we, the Australian government, will continue to provide, as best we can, all the capability, training and protection they need and deserve to do their job as effectively, efficiently and safely as possible. the great pleasure and great honour of representing in the Australian parliament, I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and colleagues in the Australian parliament in extending my personal condolences to the family of Sean McCarthy. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition together said so very eloquently in the parliament yesterday, and as the nation’s Minister for Defence has just alluded to, he was a remarkable man. As such, Sean McCarthy is honoured by all of us here in the parliament for his service to our country and for paying the ultimate price with his life. Signaller Sean McCarthy was a member of the elite SAS. He was one of those men who stood out amongst other men for his remarkable physical attributes and for his character, which is one of the features of those who are selected for this very elite group of men who wear the Australian uniform. Signaller Sean McCarthy was only 25 years old. He was a man who loved rugby. He was a soldier who died wearing the Australian uniform and under the flag of our great country. He was killed when a bomb exploded near his vehicle while he was serving in Afghanistan. Personnel who served with Signaller McCarthy, who was also known as ‘Seano’, said that he was ‘a bloody good bloke’ and a very talented soldier. One of his Army mates, Aaron Pearce, said that Signaller McCarthy loved a joke, loved taking care of children and would never let a friend down. Never letting a friend down is a characteristic of Australians. It is perhaps an especially powerful characteristic of those who wear the uniform of our country and perhaps an even more powerful characteristic of those who wear the uniform of the SAS. Signaller McCarthy is the sixth Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan since 2002 and tragically, of course, the second this year. He joined the Army in 2001 and began serving in the SAS Regiment in January 2007. He served his first tour in Afghanistan later that year and was posted to East Timor earlier this year before being sent back to Afghanistan. I want to let the people of Ryan know that I had the unique privilege of meeting the President of Afghanistan in May in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt, when I attended the World Economic Forum there. I asked Hamid Karzai what he would say about the death of any AustraMAIN COMMITTEE",198,ANZAC The Professional Australian Soldier
198,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (11.30 Am),"On behalf of the federal seat of Ryan, which I havelian to constituents who live in my electorate of Ryan, whose emotions might be so profound that they would question the presence of an Australian in uniform in his country. His remark to me was very simple and very profound. He said that Australians were doing great things in Afghanistan and that the people of Afghanistan just wanted what we in Australia had. I asked him what it was that we in Australia have that his people wanted. President Karzai said to me, ‘Our people want freedom to live in peace, just like the people that you represent, Michael.’ I was very touched by that and by the context and tone in which he put it. It was very simple, very eloquent, very compelling and very profound. SoI would say to the people of Ryan and the families, friends, neighbours and loved ones of Signaller Sean McCarthy, and indeed all those other Australians who have died in tragic circumstances and terrible circumstances wearing the Australian uniform in Afghanistan, in Iraq and in all other theatres of conflict around the world, that they are doing a very unique thing; they are doing something which I suspect very few in this place and very few in our country would have the capacity to do. I think it takes a very special person to sign up to the Army, Navy and Air Force of our country. As the son of a man who wore the uniform of the special forces of his country, and as the grandson of a man who fought the Japanese in World War II, I think that my father and my grandfather were special individuals as well. My grandfather paid the ultimate price. He was tortured by the Japanese. He is a man I never met. My mother tells me that he was an incredible person, an incredible individual, who served and fought for freedom in the context in which he did in the 20th century. I make those remarks because I can only think that Signaller Sean McCarthy of the SAS must have been a very remarkable person. He was not someone I knew, but anyone who wears the uniform of the SAS must be a remarkable individual. On his previous tour in Afghanistan, Signaller McCarthy was recognised by the Special Operations commander for his courage, his focus and his professionalism. His mission was to try and do his bit to bring about peace and stability in that part of the world. He received a specific commendation for maintaining his presence of mind and an excellent soldier’s skills while in contact with the enemy. Australia has obligations to be a very good global citizen by helping out our friends in times of need. As President Hamid Karzai said to me when I had that unique opportunity of meeting him not as a minister of the Crown, not as a senior member of this parliament but just as the federal member for Ryan, he wanted to pass on his thanks to the previous government, to the current government and to those who have enormous responsibility to make decisions that involve putting the lives of Australians at risk. The times demand that Australians step up to the plate, and we have done so with remarkable skill, remarkable professionalism and remarkable dignity but also with compassion. It seems to be a thread that runs through all who wear the uniform of our services that they also have that capacity to be compassionate no matter which theatre of conflict they find themselves in. So, on behalf of the people of Ryan, I express my thanks to Sean McCarthy and my condolences to his family, friends and all those who knew and loved him. I want to end my remarks by also saying that I have just had the opportunity of speaking to some grade 7 students from the Moggill State School. The occasion was their visit to the Australian War Memorial, where they had the unique opportunity and privilege to lay a wreath to honour those that came before them. It was a very special opportunity for me to see grade 7 MAIN COMMITTEE students, who have marvellous lives ahead of them, get to really understand at this stage of their life that the Australian War Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier are very profound places in this country. They were very touched by the red poppies all around them. SoI say to them: thank you for making the trip from the western suburbs of Brisbane. Moggill State School has a tradition of sending grade 7 students to Canberra, to their nation’s capital, and it is a tradition which I very much support and encourage. I also encourage all other schools, not only those in my electorate of Ryan but also those throughout the country, to perhaps initiate that tradition. For those who have been to the Australian War Memorial, it is a place that is very touching. It is something that is very significant to me, as the son and grandson of two men who in different times and different theatres wore the uniform. I thank the school for the invitation that came my way to be part of that special ceremony and I thank the students for doing their bit to honour those who have served and made enormous sacrifices and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. This condolence motion is very important for all of us. When a nation sends its young men and women overseas to help bring peace to the world, it does so with deep anxiety. When we do, we know that we are putting people at serious risk. But we also know that, as citizens of the world committed to achieving peace, we have to do what we can. This has been the course of Australian history since prior to the First World War. We have accepted our obligations as world citizens and we have not flinched at accepting our responsibilities. So, when someone like Sean McCarthy has his life taken, we grieve. We grieve because we asked him to put his life at risk. This, of course, is the tragedy of war and it is an enormous cost. It is why Australians for over 100 years now have paid their respects to the many thousands of young Australians who have also had their lives taken in the service of their nation. Sean McCarthy has now joined those hallowed ranks, along with his comrades who have also fallen in Afghanistan: Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Trooper David Pearce, Commando Luke Worsley and Sergeant Andrew Russell. We know, as others have said, that Sean was a career soldier with seven years of service. He was still young-25 years of age-with his whole life before him. Yet he enlisted to serve and did so with total commitment. After recruit training, he was posted to the 7th Signal Regiment and then in January 2010 to the Special Air Service Regiment-based in your home state, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer. After service in Timor-Leste, Sean was deployed to Afghanistan with the Special Operations Task Group. Here the responsibilities were to support the Australian Reconstruction Task Force, to help develop the Afghanistan security forces and to help reinforce the legitimacy of the Afghan government. These are huge responsibilities, undertaken, as we now know, in the most difficult of circumstances. But, as we expect of Australian service men and women when they depart our shores on these tasks, they are undertaken with total commitment and courage. Along with his mates, this was Sean McCarthy’s task on our behalf. He lost his life doing what we asked him to do. As we all know now, he did it so very well. In addition to his service medals, in 2007 Sean received the Special Operations Command Australia commendation. This was awarded for his excellent application of battle craft in a complex, dangerous and confusing situation. This is testament to his skills as a soldier, to the excellence of his training and, most importantly, to his personal character, as shown by his MAIN COMMITTEE",199,ANZAC The Professional Australian Soldier
199,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (11.42 am)unwavering commitment. As a nation, we mourn the loss of Signaller Sean McCarthy and I want to extend my condolences to his family. There can be nothing worse in life than losing a loved one, and we as a nation remain in the family’s debt. I do want to make some closing remarks as a parent and as someone who has children under the age of 22. I know I share this with my colleague the minister and others in this place. The responsibilities I have as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel mean that I get to meet some fine young Australians who, at the early age of 17 or 18, are putting on the uniform of one of the services and committing themselves to the task of defending Australia’s interests. Frankly, I do not think that the nation understands that commitment well enough. We owe these Australians-all of these people in uniform-a great deal more than we give them. I am finding it hard to choose the word which will aptly describe what it is that we must do. It is not just gratitude, because they are making a sacrifice. As the Prime Minister said, there is no greater honour than to wear that uniform. Sean McCarthy has done that for us. As we know, and as parents of previous generations know only too well, there can be nothing sadder for a parent than to have their son or daughter die before them. In this case, it was a young person who had made a commitment on behalf of this nation-bravely, courageously, with dedication and with great honour. I say again: my condolences to his family, his friends and, most of all, his comrades-his mates-with whom he fought. in supporting this motion of condolence for the loss of Signaller Sean McCarthy in Afghanistan on 8 July 2008. Signaller McCarthy was conducting vehicle patrols with coalition forces when an improvised explosive device was detonated. He and two of his colleagues were seriously injured. Despite being evacuated and receiving medical attention, Signaller Sean McCarthy succumbed to his wounds. At 25 years of age, Signaller McCarthy had already given so much in service to his country-both in East Timor and now in a second tour of Afghanistan-which he gladly and readily performed. Sean McCarthy will be remembered as a courageous soldier and an all-round good bloke, highly respected by all those who served with him. Signaller Sean McCarthy was described by his commanding officer at the funeral service as: ... a highly respected soldier who served with distinction in the Australian Army and with great pride as a member of an elite team, the Special Air Service Regiment. He died doing his duty in a high-risk environment; it was a soldier’s death. His loss, whilst tragic, was not in vain. He fought and died for the enduring values of freedom and justice. Sean’s father, David, said of his son: He was lucky enough to find a career that he loved and was very passionate about. I know he’s my son, but those guys are doing some things over there which make them real heroes. Sean Patrick McCarthy was born on 5 January 1983 in Auckland, New Zealand. On 10 July 2001, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the Australian Defence Force. After the initial recruit training and completion of the mandatory courses, Sean was posted to the 7th Signal Regiment on 14 July 2003. Ten days after his 24th birthday Sean became one of our nation’s elite sons when he was posted to Special Air Service Regiment on 15 January 2007.

200,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11.48 Am),"The opposition joins with the government todayThroughout his short but active career with the regiment Sean proved that his posting was well deserved. He was deployed as part of the Special Operations Task Group in 2007 and Operation Astute in East Timor the following year. After these two missions he was redeployed to Afghanistan, which became his most recent and indeed last posting. Sean was decorated several times in recognition of his service in East Timor and Afghanistan. He was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with the International Coalition Against Terrorism Clasp, the Return from Active Service Badge, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal and the NATO International Security Assistance Force Medal. Sean also received the Special Operations Command-Australia commendation on 20 June 2008 for his actions in Afghanistan the previous year as part of Special Operations Task Group Rotation V. Sean was awarded this for his outstanding application of battle craft in a complex, dangerous and confusing situation that is becoming all too common for our soldiers serving overseas. This commendation stated, in part: I commend you for excellent achievement in the application of battle craft beyond the standard expected whilst acting as a special operations electronic warfare operator during operation SLIPPER, Special Operations Task Group, Rotation V. Despite being in contact with the enemy, you maintained your presence of mind and displayed excellent soldier skills. You showed courage and mission focus. Your actions demonstrated excellent application of battle craft above your recognised training levels in a complex, dangerous and confusing situation. Your deeds have brought credit upon yourself, the Special Air Service Regiment and Special Operations Command. Signaller McCarthy could be like so many other young men in our nation-enjoying a game of rugby, which I am told was one of his great passions; spending time with his mates; and looking forward to buying his first home. Time and again our service men and women give up these personal comforts in order to bring comfort and security to others less fortunate. During Sean’s life he was well liked and loved by all those who met him and those who served with him. His fellow soldiers, who referred to Sean as ‘Seano’, describe him simply but accurately as being ‘a bloody good bloke’. A close Army mate, Aaron Pearce, told others of how the young signaller ‘loved a joke, loved taking care of children and would never let down a friend’. These words are an accurate description of the brave signaller’s life and personality and have been confirmed by many. And whilst, at only 25 years of age, he had a very short time in this world, he had many great accomplishments in both his military and personal lives that will live on forever in the memories of his family, friends and loved ones. He was honoured by the Special Operations Task Group during a ramp ceremony in Oruzgan Province, southern Afghanistan, before his body was flown back to Australia to RAAF Base Amberley. On 17 July this year over 1,000 people, including friends, family and colleagues, came together for the service at the Gold Coast’s Sacred Heart Church. Mourners came to celebrate the life of SAS Signaller Sean McCarthy. Lieutenant General David Hurley, Vice Chief of the Defence Force; Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, Chief of Army; and Major General Tim McOwan, Special Operations Commander Australia, paid their respects to one of their own. Sean’s casket was honoured by being carried by the Special Air Services Regiment honour guard and draped in the Australian national flag. George Orwell once wrote: MAIN COMMITTEE We sleep safely in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would harm us. Those rough men are now minus one more comrade tonight, yet they stand ready as always not only to defend the freedom and liberty of our country but, in the case of Sean McCarthy, to defend the freedom and liberty of those who we do not know but whose human rights we preserve. Sean McCarthy joins Andrew Russell, Luke Worsley, Matthew Locke, Trooper David ‘Poppy’ Pearce and Jason Marks, all of whom have made the ultimate sacrifice not only for their country but also for the people of Afghanistan in the hope that their country can have the opportunity to know peace. To the men and women of the ADF: we share our prayers with you on this day. We thank you for your willingness to serve and wish you safety in your work-that you may return to your loved ones when the job is done. I pay tribute again to Signaller Sean McCarthy, his family, friends and loved ones. I know their grief is one we can never take away. I say to them that their grief is one which our nation shares today, as we send our condolences to them. I say to his parents, Dave and Mary, and his sisters, Clare and Leigh, that I know we cannot ease their pain but we acknowledge that the service Sean gave was above the call of his duty, and he has paid the greatest of prices. Australia is proud of him. He will not be forgotten, as those who have fallen before him will not be forgotten. I can assure them that, at the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember him. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

Peter Drew Durack QC Debate resumed from 26 August, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 13 July 2008, of the Honourable Peter Drew Durack QC, and place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (11.57 am)-As a fellow Western Australian, I rise to record condolences on the death of the Hon. Peter Durack, who died on 13 July 2008. I also offer sincere sympathy to his friends and family, that hard working and very talented pioneering Durack family from the Kimberley region in Western Australia. Senator Durack served for 22 years in the Senate, becoming Attorney-General in 1977 during the Fraser government years. It was also during that time that he implemented several historically important legal reforms. Senator Durack earned respect from all sides of politics, basically because he was a thoroughly decent man with a genuine commitment to good government, a genuine commitment to good policy and a dedication to human rights and legal reform. Senator Durack served one term in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, from 1965 to 1968, prior to his appointment as the Commonwealth Attorney-General in 1977.

Senator Durack also served as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. He was a very strong advocate for freedom of information laws and a champion for the rights of individuals who had disputes with government. He presided over the Freedom of Information Bill in 1978 and the Freedom of Information Act in 1982. In spite of his considerable achievements in the political field, Senator Durack was respected as a true gentleman and someone who provided counsel, advice and support to many Liberals, including the member for Curtin, as well as mentoring those not involved in the political environment. I offer sincere sympathy to his wife, Isobel, his children, Anne and Phillip, and his four grandchildren on what is the most important loss of all-the loss of a husband, the loss of a father and the loss of a grandfather. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

The digital environment is a complex one and the transition of television from the analog to the digital environment presents a number of challenges, one being the retransmission ‘black spot’ sites across Australia. The Government is currently examining options for maximising viewer access to digital television services where the signals provided by broadcasters prove to be deficient. The costs and technical aspects of conversion are also being investigated and the Government will consider all facets, including any possible assistance programs, in the decision making process. On 18 December 2007, the Minister announced the establishment of the Digital Switchover Taskforce, which will oversee the major tasks, processes and timeframes necessary to drive digital television takeup and achieve digital switchover throughout Australia by 31 December 2013. Information in relation to the switchover timetable and related issues, such as the conversion of “black spot” television transmitters to digital, will be made available publicly once all issues and factors have been addressed as outlined above to ensure a smooth transition from analog to a digital environment for viewers.
