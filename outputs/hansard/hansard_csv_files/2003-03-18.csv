119,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (4.00 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 200212592 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 Macquarie, the member for Mitchell, the member for Parramatta, the member for Makin, the member for Mallee, the member for Wannon, the member for Fadden, the member for Dawson, the member for Lindsay, the member for Robertson, the member for Gippsland, the member for Hinkler, the member for Indi, the member for Sturt, the member for Canning, the member for Hume, the member for Barker, the member for Fisher, the member for Dobell, the member for Lyne and the member for Hughes. NowI move to the other place: Senator Alston, Senator Calvert, Senator Eggleston, Senator Lightfoot, Senator McGauran, Senator Barnett, Senator Boswell, Senator Chapman, Senator Coonan, Senator Ellison, Senator Heffernan, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Minchin and Senator Santoro. These are the 38 government members and senators who opposed the stem cell research bill just last year but who now support a war in Iraq. On stem cells, the 38 claimed to be driven by the sanctity of life-a belief that embryo cells, too small to be seen, and which will never develop into a human life, need to be preserved at any cost. Yet, on Iraq, where tens of thousands of innocent civilians, babies, children and women will most certainly be slaughtered by the US war machine, these same 38 members of parliament have no concern for the sanctity of life. These are real lives, not single cells, frozen forever in research laboratories. These are real human lives-babies resting in their cots, children playing in the streets and women caring for their families. I believe we could stand here and watch this chamber for a century or more and we would not see a worse act of hypocrisy. I honestly do not know how these people sleep at night, given the impassioned speeches they gave on stem cell research, the frantic campaigning, the high emotion of defining these cells as human lives and then arguing for the sanctity of life. Yet, on Iraq, we see fawning compliance and silence from the government backbench as the 38 government members and senators I listed passively sit and watch the Prime Minister lead Australia down the path of folly, hell-bent on war in Iraq, which will have shocking consequences for tens of thousands of human lives. This is the double standard of the little Tories in this place. Sanctity has been replaced by hypocrisy. How do they live with such a shocking double standard! Not for them the sort of principle displayed by the members for Franklin and Lowe, who are passionate defenders of the sanctity of life on stem cells and passionate defenders of the sanctity of life in Iraq. I do not mind the disagreements in this place-in fact, I always enjoy the contest of ideas and the clearing house across the parliament; it is a robust part of a healthy democracy-but not for a moment can I stomach the double standards of the 38 members that I have listed. Not for a moment can I comprehend their hypocrisy on Iraq. This is the arrogance of power. This is what happens to people who argue from a position of convenience and not of conviction. They pick and choose their principles to suit the issue of the day. One moment, on stem cells, it is the sanctity of life; the next moment, on Iraq, it is the destruction of life. They never apply to the issue a consistent set of values and beliefs. They are the cafeteria conservatives of Australian politics. From the backbench to the cabinet room, the arrogance of power has seeped through the Howard government. Just look at the Prime Minister himself. His first instincts are always authoritarian and arrogant. Given a choice between backing the powerful in our society and backing the people, he always goes with the powerful; he never backs the people. Take the arrogant way in which the Prime Minister has committed our country to war in Iraq. There Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12593 has been no public consultation, no respect for public protest and no openness and transparency with the Australian people, just a mad rush to say ‘yes’ to the United States. Two weeks ago, the government produced an updated defence strategy, and we have appropriations in this bill that act on defence strategies of the government. This was another little echo out of Washington. In a post-Cold War world, the government sees just one super power-what it calls the primacy of the United States-and it will march with them irrespective of Australia’s national interest, irrespective of Australian need, even in a march of folly. This was the basis of the strategic review, a remarkably simplistic document that even goes as far as endorsing the ‘son of Star Wars’-that is, American missile defence. Incredibly, this is not to protect Australian cities and territories; rather, it recognises that, under this government, wherever the US Army goes across the globe, the ADF will automatically follow. This is not a white paper; it is a tissue paper to cover the government’s radical shift in defence policy. The old DOA was defence of Australia. Under the Howard government, the new DOA is defence of America. The Howard government has turned Australia’s national security upside down. It has handed over our sovereignty and our foreign policy making to the United States and left our country exposed to the adventurism of the Bush administration. This is a government that backs the powerful; it does not back the Australian people. The Prime Minister’s record on democratic reform is just as bad. His record on foreign policy is appalling. But let us look at his record on democratic reform. There has been no independent Speaker of the House of Representatives, no reform of the parliament and its committee system, no community cabinet meetings, no experiments with Internet democracy or deliberative democracy and no republic, let alone a democratically elected-that is, directly elected-Australian president. Under this government, power is concentrated in the hands of the few, not the many. Indeed, this is the new dividing line in Australian public life. It is not a question of left versus right but a struggle between the insiders and the outsiders, a struggle between the powerful and the people. I argue-I passionately believe-that too much power in our society is concentrated in the hands of insiders. This is the downside of globalisation. While it opens up new opportunities for the exchange of economics and information, it also allows the old establishment to entrench its power across the globe. This is why Labor is antiestablishment and fights for the people, not the powerful. We are willing to take on the economic establishment in this country-the companies that believe not in competition but in the worse excesses of cowboy capitalism: the insider deals, the preferment, the restrictive trade practices, the corporate greed and the irresponsibility. Labor’s policy aims to empower the outsiders to build an economy that ensures competition by all and assets for all. This is the purpose of our economic ownership agenda-to develop a stakeholder society in which all Australians have opportunities to save and accumulate assets across the life cycle, with nest egg accounts, lifelong learning accounts, family accounts, matched savings accounts and, of course, superannuation for the retirement years. We aim to disperse economic power and ownership into the hands of the many, not just the few. We can no longer tolerate a society in which the top 20 per cent own 65 per cent of the nation’s wealth while the bottom 20 per cent of Australians own absolutely nothing at all. So, too, we should not tolerate Australia’s social establishment-the insiders’ club that looks after its own with preferment and special deals, the toffee-nosed snobs who pass extraordinary wealth and social status from one generation to the next. We need a society based on equal opportunity, affordable services and 12594 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 education for all. We need these things for the vast suburbs and regions of the nation, not just for the gentrified elite. I am also opposed to the political establishment-those who want to concentrate power in their own hands instead of decentralising our democracy and empowering the outsiders, those who feel left out of the decision making process. The media establishment, of course, is a big part of the problem-the self-serving commentariat that claims the right for the suburbs but who, in practice, never live west of Annandale or Yarraville. This is why the right wing elites in Australia are so out of touch with public opinion. Just look at the disgraceful coverage of the Iraqi issue by the Murdoch press. Under the ownership and control of an American citizen, they have acted against Australia’s best interests; they have acted against the interests of our country. I noticed recently an analysis by Roy Greenslade in the Guardian newspaper on 17 February. He pointed out that there are 175 Murdoch newspaper titles around the world and that-surprise, surprise-175 of them have backed the war in Iraq. One hundred per cent have shamefully backed unilateral American policy with regard to Iraq. Greenslade writes: How lucky can Murdoch get! He hires 175 editors and, by remarkable coincidence, they all seem to love the nation which their boss has chosen as his own. The truth is that we need more diversity, more choice and more accountability in the Australian media. We need to transfer power from the insiders to the Australian people. We need to democratise Australia’s media laws. Shamefully, the Howard government is moving in the opposite direction. We also need to break down the power of the legal establishment, with its system of preferment, exorbitant fees and featherbedding. In this place, the legal elites are represented by the Liberal Party. I find this to be an extraordinary figure: there are 44 corporate lawyers in the Liberal caucus; 20 in the Senate and 24 in the House. Of the 25 Liberal members of the Howard ministry, 17 are corporate lawyers. That is nearly 70 per cent. No wonder people like yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, cannot get a look-in with the Howard ministry. It is colonised by corporate lawyers. Forget about 50-50 or 60-40; the Liberals operate under a 7030 rule. or 60-40; you have a 70-30 rule. That is, 70 per cent of your ministry is controlled by wealthy barristers and the top end of town and 30 per cent is for everyone else. In fact, the best way to get Liberal preselection is to own a wig. Just like the British Tories, they love to dress up; it is the best way of getting Liberal Party preselection. The Prime Minister has surrounded himself with 43 fellow lawyers. Quite honestly, not even Rodney Adler needs that many. Not even Rodney Adler needs 43 fellow lawyers around him. This is not a liberal party; it is the lawyers party of Australia. I have mentioned the economic establishment, the social establishment, the political establishment, the media elites and the legal establishment. My final target in this speech is the foreign policy establishment: those who believe in the imperial right of the United States to control and police the world, with our Prime Minister tagging along as deputy sheriff. This government believes in the primacy of the United States. I believe in a tripolar international environment: the United States as a superpower, sure; but also China as an emerging super-",103,Representatives Main Committee

121,Mr Latham,"I hear the member for La Trobe interject. I say to him: forget about 50-50Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12595 power and the European Union as a supranational power. This government believes in concentrating global power in the hands of just one country; I believe in dispersing power across the globe, recognising three major powers and not just one. This is one of the reasons why I oppose the war on Iraq. I believe this war is based on a dangerous doctrine: the Bush doctrine of pre-emption. Sixty years ago, mankind developed the capacity to destroy itself, most notably through nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Since then, the world has managed to survive, mainly through policies of deterrence and containment. In the post-war years, this was known as the Truman Doctrine. The United Nations also played an important role. It may not be perfect, but it is still the best system we have for fostering international goodwill and cooperation. To ignore and then belittle the will of the United Nations at this crucial time represents an appalling shift in Australian foreign policy. Even worse, and without any real debate, the Howard government has embraced the Bush doctrine of pre-emption. This doctrine overturned 60 years of successful US foreign policy60 years of deterrence and containment. It gives the US a mandate to launch pre-emptive strikes on other nations that it deems to be evil. Bush has abandoned President Clinton’s emphasis on multilateralism and gone down the dangerous path of unilateralism. Make no mistake: a world based on threats of military action, a world based on pre-emptive strikes, is a world about to do itself terrible harm. The folly of this approach can be seen on the Korean peninsula. At the Sydney Olympics 2½ years ago, the North Korean and South Korean teams marched together. This was seen as a wonderful sign for the future. It gave the world hope for political and economic cooperation resolving an international trouble spot. Eighteen months ago, the North Korean leadership was in China studying the benefits of economic openness and liberalisation. Again, it seemed that the North Korean problem would solve itself. Like other communist regimes under the weight of economic failure, it was going to reform from within. Then, 14 months ago, President Bush-seemingly from nowhere-included North Korea in his axis of evil speech and threatened military pre-emption. Not surprisingly, North Korea is now racing to defend itself, weaponising its nuclear power. In response, Japan has said that it, too, needs nuclear weapons. This is the problem with pre-emption: it creates an international environment based on suspicion and escalation. In our country, bizarrely, the Prime Minister has said that we now need a nuclear missile shield to defend ourselves against North Korea. This is the madness of pre-emption and escalation. None of it has anything to do with the war against terror-not the development of Japanese nuclear capacity nor creation of an Australian missile shield. Osama bin Laden, quite frankly, must be laughing himself silly at the folly of American and Australian foreign policy. We cannot run the world according to threats and first-strike thinking-not a world in which 26 nations have chemical weapons and 20 have biological weapons, not a world in which India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons, and not a world plagued by the nonstop violence of the Middle East. History tells us that deterrence and containment are the only answers, along with the age-old hope of cooperation between nations. This is where I fundamentally disagree with President Bush’s policy. In outlining his new doctrine in September last year, he said: In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action. 12596 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 I believe that, in this new world as well as in the old world, the only path to safety is international cooperation; multilateralism, not unilateralism; containment, not pre-emption; and peace, not an unnecessary war in Iraq. Along with most Australians, I do not want a world in which one country has all the power. I do not want a world based on axis of evil rhetoric and the constant threat of pre-emption. There is a better way: it is called the United Nations. This means respecting the findings of Hans Blix. This means respecting international opinion-in this case, the position of France, Germany, Russia and China. It means sharing power across the globe instead of allowing one nation to appoint itself as the global policeman. There was a time, of course, when George W. Bush seemed to believe in these ideals himself. During the 2000 presidential campaign, he said that he wanted the United States to take a lower profile in international affairs and to be-I use his words-‘a more humble power’. His radical shift in policy has, in fact, humiliated his nation. He has provoked anti-American sentiment internationally; he has divided the Western alliance and badly damaged NATO. I ask this simple question: who was the last world leader to unite France, Germany, Russia and China? This is an unprecedented coalition: from the right wing Gaullists in France, to the Social Democrats in Germany, to Putin’s Russia, to the Communist Party of China, international opinion is united all right-it is united against the United States. Around the globe, people do not want a world in which one country has all the power. They want power sharing and cooperation. This should be the basis of Australia’s foreign policy. The Howard government believes in a unipolar world in which the primacy of the United States is beyond challenge. I believe in a multipolar world, recognising not just American power but also China as an emerging superpower plus the importance of the European Union. Australia is one of the few countries in the world well placed to have strong relations with all three. In the Labor Party, this is not just an opportunity for the future; it is part of our political legacy. Just as Curtin established the US relationship, just as Calwell established the European Migration Program and just as Whitlam established relations with the People’s Republic of China, the next Labor government will have to realign and rebalance Australia’s foreign policy. Nothing is more important than getting these relationships right. The great irony of the government’s strategy is that it actually weakens our relationship with the United States. Like any alliance, ANZUS works best when it is based on an equal partnership, when both partners bring something important to the table. Under the Howard government, Australia brings nothing but subservience. This is hurting the strength and viability of the relationship. In practice, we matter to the Americans when we matter in Asia. What are we going to bring to the table? We matter to the United States when we matter in Asia. The alliance is strongest when Australian diplomacy is able to influence outcomes in our part of the world. This is when the United States has reason to rely on us. This is when the United States has reason to treat Australia as an equal partner. Under this government, of course, our influence in Asia is minor. Our neighbours shake their heads in disbelief when they see Australia echoing the American line and when they see our Prime Minister calling himself-virtually belittling himself-a deputy sheriff. These Asian nations fought long and hard against colonialism. They are proud nations with little respect for countries that act like client states. They have independent foreign policies of their own and they expect the same from Australia. Mr Howard thinks the ultimate guarantor of Australia’s security is the US alliance. This is nonsense. The ultimate guarantor of Australia’s security is the soundness of our foreign policy Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12597 and the strength of our armed forces. We need an alliance with the United States, yes. But we also live in a new world with new threats and new doctrines. The Howard government has not handled these challenges well. The next Labor government will need to repair the damage, to rebalance the relationship between our two countries. I support the American alliance but it must be an alliance between equals, a genuine partnership rather than the deputy sheriff role we have today. I conclude by saying that whether it is the economic establishment, the political establishment, the social establishment, the legal establishment, the media elites or the foreign policy establishment, this is a government that concentrates power in the hands of the few rather than disbursing power and opportunity into the hands of many Australians. We need a change of government. The debate and decisions today contribute to that public mood. This government must go, particularly on the issue of Iraq. (Time expired) ranging in this cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 this afternoon, and I thank you for the opportunity to address the Main Committee. It has been a sombre day in Canberra today and I think we all understand why. It has been a particularly sombre day for me. With so many Defence Force personnel in Townsville and Thuringowa, the possibility of war is something that I have deeply reflected on. Our community has about 120 personnel currently forward deployed in the gulf, and I think about them and their families back home. I would particularly like to say this to families of members of the Defence Force: there are some families who are not receiving any contact information from personnel in the gulf. They say to me, ‘The Americans and the Brits are allowing contact between servicemen in the gulf and home, but our soldiers are not being allowed to contact home.’ That is true and it is untrue. The explanation for that is simply that those who are in the gulf are classified as ‘special forces’; for example, the members of 5 Aviation Regiment from Townsville are part of that group. They are on a very sensitive deployment and for security reasons they are unable to contact home so that there is no information about their location and their potential further operations in the gulf. That is regretted, but I am sure that families will understand that at this time it is better that we maintain proper security arrangements. I would now like to turn to the matter of ATSIC. Some members in this parliament have a lot to do with ATSIC and have large ATSI communities-8,000 of the people that I represent are Indigenous Australians. Other members do not have a lot of ATSI people in their electorates and do not ever see the issues associated with ATSIC. I think that Christopher Pyne’s address in Melbourne in the last week has probably been regarded by many in the Aboriginal community as being spot on. Christopher was saying that the relevance of ATSIC was in question, that what the organisation was not delivering was a scandal and that ATSIC should be replaced. I first heard that from, I think, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, who suggested that services was should be involved in distributing the funds to run those services. In my own patch, in the electorate of Herbert, I have Palm Island. I have been going to Palm Island since I was elected. In the seven years that I have been in the federal parliament, the federal government has probably put $100 million into Palm Island but you are hard-pressed to go there today and see where any of the money has gone. I am talking about $100 million. Yes, you can see a dam, a second water supply for Palm Island, but you cannot see much else.",106,Representatives Main Committee
122,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (4.21 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I propose to be rather wide12598 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 All you can see is a community that is dysfunctional. It is dysfunctional not only in terms of how the number of different groups do not get on together but also in terms of community services, health services, education services, roads and sewerage. It is a disgrace. The peak body charged with delivering services on the ground and getting better outcomes for Indigenous Australians is simply failing Indigenous Australians; that is the scandal. Yet you see the much publicised goings on down here in Canberra, you see the terrible waste of taxpayers’ money and you see a government which is trying to be at arm’s length, trying to empower Indigenous people to make decisions for themselves and trying to be remote from that. But it is not working. I feel very deeply that Christopher Pyne hit the nail on the head: the government needs to move to solve that problem, to put every last dollar into the benefit of Aboriginal people on the ground, at the coalface, in terms of health, education, domestic violence, drugs and the whole range of things that I see when I go to Palm Island. I would now like to turn to the issue of nurses and nurse education. I know there has been somewhat of a public debate about how best to educate and produce registered nurses. WhatI have been finding in feedback is that young men and women are going into the nursing profession but they do not last. They do not stay there; they move on. The thing seems to be that they do not get enough practical experience and do not understand what nursing is about before they finish their university degree. I have had some hospitals come to me in absolute frustration that they are continually battling to get nurses and cannot get nurses to stay in the profession. They are operators at the coalface. Their solution is to maintain the university degree aspect of nursing training-they do not dispute that at all-but to increase the practical component. They want to see an increased practical training component that will benefit not only the nurses themselves but also the hospitals in our community and, particularly, at the end of the day, the patients. What needs to happen is something like a six-month internship in a hospital before a trainee nurse goes into formal education in a university and then, every year, six months of training on a rotating basis. This might mean that, for example, the university will have to schedule its courses on a rolling basis. You might not have the traditional going in in March and finishing in November; you might actually be operating over the Christmas break, for example. There are some possibilities there. The benefit for nurses is, apart from the practical training, that they can be paid while they are working on the job. The hospitals have no difficulty at all with providing the funding to pay nurses’ wages, and that is how it should be. No-one expects them to work for nothing. So the nurses would benefit and the hospitals would benefit. I think there needs to be a debate in this country. I am aware of some trials that are going on in Sydney that adopt this particular model. So far, so good; it is working very well. I would ask my community to consider supporting that kind of process-where nurses benefit, hospitals benefit and, ultimately, patients benefit. Turning to the arts in Townsville, I note that the country’s pre-eminent regional dance group, Dance North, has its headquarters in Townsville. The company is currently headed by Henry Laska, and I want to congratulate Henry because he has pulled off something that we have wanted to pull off for a long time. I have to say that he had a bit of backing from a member of the government who represents the electorate of Herbert. I was pleased to do that because Henry’s long experience in the arts as a manager and financially stands him in good stead for his appointment to the board of Playing Australia. That is an appointment that has Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12599 not gone unnoticed in Townsville. It has also not gone unnoticed in the arts community right across the country that finally we have a regional representative on the board of Playing Australia who knows what he is talking about. It is a big feather in the cap for Henry Laska. It is a big feather in the cap for Dance North, for Townsville and for regional Australia that Henry has been appointed to the board. I know that he will do well. I wish him well. He will represent regional Australia fiercely, as it should be represented. I would now like to turn to a visit that the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, paid to Townsville last Tuesday. It was a very successful visit for a number of reasons. Dr Nelson is responsible for schools, higher education, science and training. Each of those particular facets of his portfolio received attention while he was in Townsville. I was particularly pleased to see Brendan visit the Australian Institute of Marine Science and James Cook University. Anyone in the marine science field anywhere in the world will tell you that AIMS and JCU are the standout institutions. From anywhere in the world, if you want to go to the best centre of excellence in marine science, you go to Townsville-either to the Australian Institute of Marine Science or to James Cook University. Professor Stephen Hall, the CEO of AIMS, is a first-class scientist and manager. Professor Michael Kingsford, Professor of Marine Biology and Aquaculture at James Cook University, is a first-class leader of his team. Dr Nelson told us that he was recently at a meeting of Fulbright scholars who had come to Australia from the US. One of them said, ‘I am going to James Cook University,’ and Brendan said, ‘Why are you going to James Cook University?’ The scholar said, ‘If you want to go to the best place for marine science in the world, you go to James Cook University.’ Once again regional Australia has a course that leads the world, and we will continue to do that. I am also pleased that Dr Nelson spoke with Gerry Smith, the manager of TADEC, which coordinates the Jobs Pathway Program for the city. Gerry raised an interesting issue with Dr Nelson-other members may have come across the same issue-which is that Jobs Pathway providers are only funded on an annual basis. This causes some uncertainty among staff because they do not know whether they are going to get funded for the next year. Gerry spoke to the minister, and it is a great country that we live in where somebody 2,000 kilometres from Canberra can have the opportunity of buttonholing a minister and saying, ‘Minister, when you are down in Canberra, this is what you need to do.’ Gerry told him, ‘You need to give us more certainty; you need to perhaps extend the funding cycle to make it a two-year funding cycle.’ To his very great credit, Brendan is a minister who listens and takes action. I know that he came back to Canberra and instructed his department to have a look at the possibility of doing this. If we can achieve that, providers like TADEC right across the country will benefit from the fact that we were able to buttonhole the minister and make a sensible suggestion and have that suggestion taken up. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is getting much more customer focused these days. Under the leadership of Russell Balding, the ABC’s focus is certainly more strategic. Russell is a very impressive leader, in my view. He knows where he is taking the corporation, and he is taking it in a very positive direction. He proposed in the current triennial funding that NewsRadio be extended to a number of areas across the country. I see that it could go to Grafton and Kempsey, as well as to Townsville. I would like to see NewsRadio come to Townsville, although it is on the Net if people really need to listen to it. My interest is in Russell’s focus on the rollout of regional television news. The debate about the commercial sta12600 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 tions removing their news services from aggregated areas has raged over the last year and a half, and it is refreshing to see that the ABC is proposing to bring back local news services to regional areas. That is a mighty step forward, and it has my absolute support. I entered the television industry in North Queensland before some people in this room were bornMs Roxon-That is for sure! not referring to Mr Charles! At that time, the ABC had local news services and a local current affairs show, all run out of Townsville. With the effluxion of time, these things disappeared, and the viewing audience-the customers, if you like-were disadvantaged by that. It is great to see the ABC proposing to bring back to North Queensland a local news service-like the one they now have in Canberra-and to run it out of Townsville, right up to Cairns. Why shouldn’t we have a local news service? Townsville is Australia’s largest tropical city. It now has a population of 150,000. The proposed news service, when it extends up the coast, would service a population of about half a million people. The ABC is asking the government for additional base funding, which I strongly support. On average, about $2½ million is required each year, which would be a great investment to put choice back into the delivery of news in local, regional viewing areas. Choice is important. The ABC has to be mindful of its responsibility to broadcast fair and unbiased news services. It has been under some pressure in that regard, and I think the ABC is realising that it needs to get its credibility back. I must add that the current staff of ABC News in Townsville, who primarily run the radio news services, are as professional as you can get. They ask the hard questions and they do not put bias into their reporting. You can be sure that, if you hear it on the ABC in North Queensland, it must be so. It is great to be able to say that, and I pay a very great tribute to ABC staff. Finally, I would like to finish my speech with the matter of the Douglas arterial road in Townsville. For about 40 years the community have been asking for this road to be built. The road will put another bridge across the Ross River and it will cut seven kilometres off a journey from the Upper Ross to the university, the hospital or the Lavarack army base. A huge amount of work was done to bring the state government to the table and to get a funding agreement that would be satisfactory to the federal government and the state government so that this project could be built. I was pleased to announce last week that finally, after 40 years, we were able to declare that a request for tenders would be made this week. The Upper Ross community in Townsville will be delighted to see that this project has got the green light. It has not been with the help of the local Labor members, who felt that this should be fully funded by the federal government even though it is a state government road. Good try! We were not going to be in that, but we have now committed $37.4 million for a new road in our city. When it is built, it will be a lasting monument to the tenacity of the federal government to get the project up and running. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (4.41 p.m.)-I would like to speak in the cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. The particular concerns that I want to raise relate to the expenditure and resources in the child-care and children’s services area. In particular, I want to focus on a number of reviews that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is undertaking. I mention the resources issue and the fact that the minister is undertaking these reviews right up front because, just in the last few days, in the",109,Representatives Main Committee
123,Mr Lindsay,"I am probably referring to just the people on the other side; I am certainlyTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12601 course of the New South Wales elections, we have heard some pretty terrible reports in the media about some of the activities that the minister’s staff allegedly have been involved in. Quite apart from whether or not these activities are lawful-and there are questions that have been asked that no doubt will be answered in due course to ascertain whether or not they are appropriate-I have a great concern about the issue of the allocation of public resources of Canberra based staff who are employed as portfolio staff. They have a large range of issues, a number of which I am going to go through in detail today, that should be perplexing them or should be being worked out or worked on by them in trying to find an answer for the children and young people of Australia, who expect that the minister and his office will use all of their public resources and energy to take forward issues in the portfolio area. I wanted to put that on the record because I think that it has been a step forward to have, for the first time, a minister for children but, if you want to be a champion for children, you do have to make sure that you are also going to champion that the government spend the appropriate amount of money on the programs that will assist them, particularly in the most severely stretched areas, such as the child-care budget. I am concerned that the minister has not taken to this with quite the enthusiasm that we would hope that a new ministry in this particular area would signal. Labor have recently put out a discussion paper called ‘Growing up: investing in the early years’, which has highlighted the importance of our children’s early education and care and the need to adequately invest in this-for the benefit of both the child and their family and the broader community. We have put forward a lot of detailed proposals in that discussion paper. We have had some fantastic responses already and are looking forward to a much longer debate about the content of that paper. The government then, a month later, put out its own early years document, talking about the need to develop a national early childhood strategy, and we support the approach that has been taken by the government in announcing its desire to develop such a strategy. We think it is very important to have a debate about the framework to make sure that the community does understand the need to invest in these early years. Obviously, the issue of appropriate resources that need to be put into any action that would flow from such a strategy will be dealt with further down the track. It is interesting that the document does not mention child care or health-the two main areas where the Commonwealth government has the greatest responsibility in these early years-in very much detail at all. Certainly, the background material in the paper does focus a lot more on health than on child care. We welcome the debate that is going to be had about this strategy, we support the fact that the government is doing it and we will participate in the discussions with the rest of the community about what is appropriate to include in such a strategy. WhatI want to focus on in particular is the broadband review of the child-care sector that is being undertaken by the current minister. It is very relevant to the appropriations bills, because it deals specifically with a single item in the child-care budget that has a fixed expenditure linked to it. A major part of the child-care budget is the child-care benefit, which is allocated to parents depending on their income and the number of hours their children use child care. It is essentially a demand driven entitlement. As long as parents can find places in childcare services-and in some cases there is difficulty-they are able to claim child-care benefit for them. In the long day care area in particular, the numbers are not limited and the government’s budget goes up and down depending on the number of families that have children in child care at any time. But the broadband review, and the expenditure item that relates to it, 12602 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 covers everything in the child-care budget other than child-care benefit. It is only $180 million this year, and it is the only area where there is any allocated funding for quality issues, for inclusion issues and often for accessibility issues. I am going to take a little bit of time to go through the sorts of things that are covered by this broadband expenditure item, because it is currently being reviewed by the government. This bucket of money is supposed to ensure that quality child care is provided in federally funded programs and that it is accessible. Among other things, this small amount of money is supposed to cover the operational subsidy for family day care. Family day carers are those carers who work in their own homes and have up to five-and sometimes seven-children, depending on their ages, to care for. The operational subsidy goes to whoever coordinates 40 or 50 and sometimes up to 100 carers, assists them in making sure that their house is appropriate for the care of children and provides training materials, support and information when they need it. It also covers the Disadvantaged Area Subsidy, which is provided to some services in rural and remote areas and is not allowed to be spent in urban areas, even if they are equally, if not more, disadvantaged in some instances. The National Childcare Accreditation Council and the quality accreditation process that it runs is also funded through this $180 million broadband program. The supplementary services, known as SUPS, in long day care and family day care provide support and training resource materials, particularly to help services integrate disabled children and to assess whether or not extra assistance is required. The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, about which there has been much controversy recently because the government froze expenditure in this area a year ago, provides extra funding for child-care centres to employ an extra staff member for a severely disabled child to help them to participate in normal child care. I am going to come back to that later, because there are now nearly 1,000 children on a national waiting list who cannot get any child care because of the government’s decision to freeze that expenditure. This broadband $180 million is also to cover-and I am only about halfway through the list, so you will see that there are a lot of things to be covered by a pretty small expenditure item-the in-service training program, which has already been cut in Queensland even though the review is currently under way. It is also to cover resource and advisory agencies, and I know some of my colleagues on my side of the House are very concerned because there is not even one in Western Australia. The mobile child-care services, which have in the past couple of years been reviewed and had their funding threatened, have been told that they will be rereviewed as part of this broadband review process. The Multifunction Aboriginal Children’s Services, often known as MACS, support specific programs for Aboriginal children, often in remote areas, and a more integrated service where child-care and health facilities might be provided together. Also covered is Aboriginal playgroups. There is a private provider incentive, which is limited to private providers of long day care. They are provided with an advance on their child-care benefit so that they can use that money for capital works and then recoup it later. It is not provided for any community child carers. There is a very small range of other program initiatives. The government announced that it wants to review this expenditure item and has explicitly stated that the basis for this review is that no extra money will be provided. From our perspective, we are very concerned that you cannot really have a proper review if you are going to say, ‘No matter what feedback we get, no matter what people tell us, no matter how much Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12603 demand there is, we’re not going to spend any extra money but we’ll let you reallocate some of the money within that pool, even though a number of these projects are already under pressure and are finding it very difficult, with the current constraints, to meet their objectives.’ So we have a real concern that the review process has been set up in a way which ensures that the different programs and those involved with the different programs will fight each other. Then we will get into the ridiculous position of saying, ‘Do disabled children need more support than a mother of triplets, who might need special in-home care, or do they need more support than a remote Aboriginal community?’ A real review would look at whether all three of those categories, or families, might need extra assistance. We are very concerned that the sector might end up being asked to make some judgment on how that money can be spent, when really it is a decision for government. A proper review would take account of what the community is saying and maybe make a decision that more money might need to be spent in this area. The government has employed a consultant to run the broadband review project, and on its web site the consultant tries to explain what the review is going to be about. However, anyone who reads it will find that what you really learn is what the review is not about, because there is not very much about what it is going to be about. The redevelopment project, as it is being called on the consultant’s web site, is not about the child-care benefit. It states that the goal of the child-care program remains as is-that is, that there should be accessible, affordable, quality child care. It says that there may be a need to talk about the different aspects of how the broadband expenditure can deliver this to people but that the overall outcome itself will not change. We do not have an argument with that aim: we believe that it is fundamental that accessibility, affordability and quality should be at the centre of a child-care program. However, the consultant’s web site goes on to tell us that the process under which child-care providers are accredited will not be a focus of this review and that there is no agenda for changing the accreditation process. But funding for the accreditation process is found within this pool of money, and it is the major way the Commonwealth seeks to control the quality of the child-care programs it funds, so it is a bit perplexing that it is not going to be part of the review. The next item we find is that the review is not going to be about assessment of any individual need. They believe that some work has already been done on the particular needs for child care and that the process of assessing whether or not need is being met is ‘never complete’. They feel that the redevelopment project is about trying to ensure that the program arrangements are effectively oriented to meeting needs-even though assessment cannot be made of individual needs that might not be met. You can see that there is some confusing language in this. It seems to us that we are not talking about a serious review when we have so many things that are being excluded. In particular, I want to raise here the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, which I have mentioned already. It is the one where there are now 847-and we think the number is still grossly underestimated-children with individual disabilities whose needs are not being taken into account. They are not able to access the program because of the freeze that the government has put into place. The review says that it will not look at their individual situations and the fact that they do not have access to child-care services. I strongly believe that, if we are serious about saying the child-care program is about accessibility, affordability and quality, any serious review of this broadband money, including the Special 12604 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 Needs Subsidy Scheme, must take account of the individual circumstances of the large number of families and children who are not able to get the services that they should. The last point on the web site takes the cake. It says that the project is not about a fight over resources. It will be a great relief to all those who currently do not have sufficient resources to be able to meet their needs that, even though this review will not provide extra money, it is not going to be about a fight over resources! I think the consultants might be kidding themselves, because a lot of people feel very passionately about the services they are trying to provide. They are telling the government-and will tell the consultants too, I am sure-that they currently cannot do it on the budget that they have. It seems to me that there is no way that accessibility, affordability and quality are what the government is really talking about if it is not going to look at the child-care benefit, which has a major impact on affordability; if it is not going to talk about need, which is obviously a major issue in terms of access; and if it is not going to talk about accreditation, which is a major driver in quality. We are very concerned about where this is going. We think that, if you are going to spend money on consultants, you should make sure that they are going to have a proper job to do. The government should be prepared to hear from those consultants what it is that the community and families are saying they would like in this area. As part of this review, there are some basic questions that I think the minister, as the person responsible for running the Commonwealth child-care program, needs to answer. If the review is not about assessing the needs of children in child care, if it is not about the reallocation of resources, if it is not about the quality accreditation process, if it is not about child-care benefit and if it is determined not to change the goals of the program, what is the purpose of this review? If the minister is seriously considering abolishing the operational subsidy to family day care schemes, for example, which are already stretched and running very long waiting lists in many parts of the country-up to thousands when you look at the figures nationally-why does he not just come out and say so? If he said he was thinking about taking away the operational subsidy for family day care schemes, at least then we could have a focused debate on what it is that the operational subsidy supports in family day care schemes. We could talk with family day carers, parents, other community providers and those interested in the community about what benefits are or are not being provided by family day care schemes. Instead, we just get told that it is not about any of this. We do not necessarily have a debate on an area which we hear the government is considering taking resources away from. Again, we do not believe that the government has really been up-front about what its long term intentions are with respect to the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. Twelve months ago, the government froze the funding for this scheme, and there are large numbers of children who are on the waiting list. We have parents ringing us every week absolutely distraught that they have not only the extra pressures from being a parent of a child with often a severe disability but extra expenses associated with that. They cannot return to work, often when jobs are available for them, because they cannot find child care. They are really stuck in what can become the downward spiral of having high costs, a stressful situation and little support from the government when it is needed. For many of these families, even just having some respite is desperately important for them in the way they live their lives. What is the government’s intention? Are they just going to say: ‘As soon as there are 4,000 children across the country on this scheme, no-one else can be on it. We do not care what your Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12605 circumstances are’? Are they going to look at it being demand driven in some way or are the tests going to be harder before you can qualify? That would surprise me, because the tests are already very stringent and some children with pretty high demands and special needs do not qualify under the current system. We are just arguing to retain what is there. We do not know from the government what their real intentions are. We would like to be able to argue properly about these issues and have a debate about what the needs are rather than be stuck in this fake review process where we are really not sure whether the government are intending to do anything. In the time remaining, I also want to focus on one particular group: the Indigenous children in our cities and country towns, particularly in remote areas. This group of children are participating at a much lower rate in children’s services than other Australian children. They also have disadvantages evident in many worrying health statistics and other indicators which show that providing some extra support for multifunction services might make quite a big difference. In the minister’s recently released Early childhood document that I referred to earlier, there are a lot of statistics about how Indigenous Australian children are faring in the 21st century-and they are pretty frightening statistics. I do not have time to go through them in detail, but I would just like to highlight a couple that show that much smaller numbers of Indigenous children are using child-care services compared with other children. For example, five per cent of Indigenous primary school aged children use outside school hours care compared to 23 per cent of the rest of the children in the community, and there are similar figures if we pick out different types of programs along the way. The government should be really worried about these figures. Yet in its broadband review, which includes funding for specific Indigenous services-the multifunction Aboriginal services-we find that we have the same number of services that we had in 1987. We also find the same expenditure that we had in 1987; there has been no growth despite the growth in demand for those services. This is another one of the programs that is under pressure and that needs to be expanded. All that is going to happen is that it is going to be reviewed and they are going to be told that there is no extra money for them. I am very concerned about this review. I am concerned that we have another budget process coming up and there has been no indication from the government that there will be any extra money allocated to these programs. The programs are the key to dealing with at least two of the three major things that the government says it wants its child-care program to have: accessibility, affordability and quality. At least accessibility and quality are being compromised by the government’s failure to seriously address the shortages in this program area. We fear that a broadband review is going to do nothing to ease those problems. 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. Any talk about budgets obviously must include the various programs that this government has brought forward in relation to country Australia. I speak in particular of the Regional Solutions Program, a program that has helped to break down the cultural divide between major cities and my electorate of Parkes. Parkes is the largest electorate in New South Wales. It covers almost exactly one-third of New South Wales and takes in some of the most isolated towns and communities in the state, such as Wilcannia, White Cliffs, Tibooburra, Menindee and Tilpa. The people in these towns and communities have an enormous and generous community spirit and a fantastic ability to pull together to get the job done. In situations where they really need to, they come together and",112,Representatives Main Committee
124,Mr John Cobb (Parkes) (5.01 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)12606 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 act accordingly. But sometimes they do need our help, and that is where the Regional Solutions Program steps in. The Regional Solutions Program bridges the tyranny of distance and it helps communities in my electorate to build their economic base and strengthen their social structure. The program identifies shortfalls and provides a financial framework for the community to fill those shortfalls. The Regional Solutions Program is not a luxury; in the electorate of Parkes it is an absolute necessity. It is an investment that we as a government must continue to make to ensure the survival and growth of our regional towns. I have been fortunate enough to see first hand how regional solutions are working in many towns in my electorate. Over the past 10 years banks have closed their doors across country Australia at an alarming rate. Suddenly banks found that it was in their economic interest to close when they realised how much money they could save by cutting out face-to-face banking and by providing Internet and telephone banking services. Those services are great for the technically minded and for those who are up to date with modern communications, especially if they are in business. But for ordinary people with cash to deal with, for those who hate a recorded message or for those who are not up to speed with the dot com age, it has been a major blow. That is where the Rural Transaction Centres Program has stepped in. The federal government has committed up to $70 million from the sale of 10 per cent of Telstra to put services back and to introduce new services into smaller rural towns. The Rural Transaction Centres Program provides funds to help small communities establish their own RTCs to provide access to services. Each RTC is as individual and innovative as that town wants to make it. The types of services can vary enormously but they include financial, postal, phone, fax and Internet services; Medicare Easyclaim; Centrelink; facilities for visiting professionals; printing and secretarial services; tourism information; involvement in employment schemes; insurance and taxation information; and federal, state and local government services. In my electorate alone rural transaction centres have been approved and set up in Peak Hill, Hillston and Tottenham, and recently one was approved in Lake Cargelligo. The government will provide assistance for the preparation of business plans for the towns of Wilcannia, Menindee, Ivanhoe and White Cliffs. This will enable identification of the services required by the communities and assess the feasibility of establishing a rural transaction centre in each of those towns. The government has given almost $400,000. With the inclusion of Lake Cargelligo in the last few weeks, that will be almost $600,000 to towns in my electorate to get rural transaction centres up and running. The Regional Solutions Program is part of the federal government’s significant effort to work with individual communities in regional Australia to tackle their most pressing needs; needs of people who have the will but not always the finances or the organisation to make things happen. In some towns this means pouring resources into finding solutions to stimulate the growth, development and potential that is already there. We gave $9,180 to the community of Tullamore last year to help them prepare a community development plan. The people of the town were sick and tired of watching services decline in the area so they got together and formed Tullamore Inc. The funding we gave them is helping them to prepare a social and economic development plan and a blueprint for development in the region. That is an example of where a simple allocation of $10,000 enabled a town of around 250 people to have the impetus to actually get up and develop a future for themselves. It does not always require huge funds to make country towns realise the potential that lies within them. Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12607 The people of Forbes felt they needed to provide a key facility for youth in the community. In this case, we gave them $218,000 to help them turn their local gym into a youth and community centre. The centre will provide assistance to increase youth and community development socially, economically, emotionally and physically. The Weddin Shire Council in Grenfell identified the need for an economic and community development officer. We were able to provide them with $110,000 and that will help them coordinate all economic development and a strategic plan. We provided the Bland Shire Council with $55,000 to establish a visitor information centre. The Cobar Mobile Children’s Service was given $20,000 to allow them to more fully service both the Cobar township and the surrounding remote areas with a variety of children’s services. It does not always require huge bucks to help communities. The mobile children’s service works right around Australia, but for the more remote regions it provides the only lifeline that young children in those regions have to normal social interaction with others of their own age. More recently we gave Peak Hill $55,000 so that they can keep a doctor in their town. The community raised enough money to purchase a residence in the town to house a doctor’s surgery, but they lacked the funds to undertake renovations to convert it into a surgery. That is where Regional Solutions stepped in. We gave the Broken Hill Community Inc. $206,000 to develop the neighbourhood centre for the community to incorporate functions of the traditional community. From personal experience, I know that Broken Hill have developed a myriad of communications and community issues that are run out of that centre. I was deeply disappointed to hear that Senator John Cherry was critical of regional initiatives such as the Regional Solutions Program. His feeling was, as he claimed, that the Regional Solutions Program was being concentrated in wealthy areas and National Party electorates. I am not sure how far Mr Cherry has travelled, but my electorate is certainly far from wealthy. If he looked at the map he would realise the vast expanse of electorates, such as Gwydir and Parkes, and the genuine needs of people in places like Wilcannia, Wanaaring, Hillston and Tilpa. I think if he looked a bit harder then he would also realise that the five or six biggest electorates in Australia, including Lingiari, which is held by the Labor Party, are the ones which have got the most money. I have to say, at the same time, that anytime I am accused of rorting things on behalf of my electorate, what it proves to me is that I am doing my job and somebody else is not doing theirs. I cannot sing the praises of regional solution funding enough, nor can I paint a true picture of what it means to my electorate. The examples I have given you only skim the surface. Aside from Regional Solutions, there are many other government programs working for rural Australia. Networking the Nation is working for rural Australia and helping to provide technology programs. The Regional Assistance Program is helping to create innovative job generation programs throughout Australia. Anybody who thinks that Networking the Nation has not done an incredible amount for rural Australia has never set foot out there-of course it has. It has not only stabilised mobile phones right around Australia but created a phone system along highways and other ways that certainly never existed prior to this government coming to office. There are also the innovative job regeneration projects throughout Australia, and rural GP initiatives are bringing doctors to the bush and boosting health services. Finally, we are finding that we have got 25 per cent of country students entering medical schools instead of the eight per cent that were entering 10 years ago. 12608 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 Regional Solutions and some of these other initiatives will come to an end next year. I hope the government will renew its commitment to those vital programs and reinstate our commitment to country Australia. Given an electorate such as mine, I have seen first-hand the difference regional issues are making to the communities they support. They give hope to struggling towns-and they are not all struggling. These towns simply need some help to look at some initiatives, to employ some people and to look at the possibilities that exist within them. They create a positive environment in which they can move forward, and-certainly in my experience-that is what they have done. This is a government that has made an enormous commitment to regional Australia and has backed it up with serious money. It is a holistic approach to regional development, and really you cannot take any other. If we look at country New South Wales and Australia from the point of view of working together, doing everything together and trying to get a state government that will actually commit with us instead of trying to con funds out of us then we will certainly go a lot further forward a lot faster. Regional communities need our help. They deserve it; they are the backbone of Australia. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (5.12 p.m.)-I am pleased to be able to speak in this cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 about the case for greater engagement with China. I have recently led a major delegation to China. One of the things that is extraordinary in visiting both Shanghai and Beijing is that no Australian figure looms larger in relations between China and Australia than Gough Whitlam. As we discovered in our visit, due to the visit of Gough Whitlam more than 30 years agowhen he led the Western world in establishing formal diplomatic ties with China-Gough Whitlam’s name is still invoked at meetings. Every meeting we went to began with talk of the commitment of Whitlam. It gave the relationship with Australia an enormous amount of depth. One thing that Gough reminded me of before we left for the visit to China was that he had his birthday in Shanghai when he visited there in 1971 as opposition leader. The then Premier Chou En-Lai sent him a birthday cake to Shanghai to mark the occasion. As it happened, we had as part of our delegation the current member for Werriwa, Mark Latham. He also had his birthday while we were in China. Our Chinese hosts did present him with a very nice cake, but Mark is not quite there yet-it did not come from former Premier Zhu Rongji or current Premier Wen. Mark has a little way to go before he gets his cake from the Premier. Nevertheless, the thing that struck us most of all in this very significant visit to China was the massive transformation that has been under way in that country since Gough Whitlam’s visit back in 1971. The scale and the breakneck pace of development literally defies description. In Shanghai, four-deck expressways soar over the city streets. A MagLev train is being developed to take passengers back and forth to the airport. In Beijing, the roads, office towers, apartment blocks and stadiums seem to be sprouting up everywhere. It is estimated that up to 120 million people-about six times the population of Australia-have moved from rural to urban areas in search of work. In the 1980s, China set itself some very ambitious growth targets. By the year 2000, it wanted to have a gross domestic product of $US1 trillion, a target that it met. Now China aims to achieve a GDP of $US4 trillion by 2020. It is a staggering goal, one that is very hard to get your mind around, even for a country of 1.3 billion people. The determination of the Chinese government to achieve this goal should not be underestimated by any one of us. In Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12609 pursuing this goal, the Chinese government is also aware of the enormous economic, social, political and environmental challenges that it faces in sustaining growth above seven per cent. But as my colleagues and I learned on our visit, China is also keenly aware of the need for international peace and stability if it is to achieve the level of economic growth that it wants. By any measure, China is already one of the most powerful and influential nations in our region and is emerging as a nation of truly global importance. It is already Australia’s second largest merchandise export market after Japan; ahead of the United States if Hong Kong is included, as it should be. Last year, total trade between our two nations reached $19 billion. China is also central to the maintenance of peace and security in our region. These issues could not be more significant than they are today-the day that the Australian government has committed us to war in Iraq. This issue of security and peace in our region is a very important part of why we went to China. Strong and cooperative relations between our two countries are vital to our national interests. Our leader, Simon Crean, certainly recognised this when, in his first international visit as opposition leader, he went to China for talks with Premier Zhu Rongji. He wanted to establish direct and personal links between Labor and the Chinese government in order to protect and promote the interests of Australia, in particular our jobs and our national security. Our trip just a few weeks ago certainly built on that successful trip of Simon Crean’s and established direct dialogue with the new generation of Chinese leadership that has now emerged following the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Our delegation had high-level access to senior government officials and academics. We were very impressed with the frank and extensive discussions across a wide range of issues which, not surprisingly, covered regional and global security, human rights, China’s move into the World Trade Organisation, developments in regional trade, opportunities to expand economic links between our two nations and employment and education. From a distance-from here in Australia-China’s economic growth seems inexorable and just plain remorseless, but the view from the Chinese leadership is of a far more complex and fragile process. They do feel an enormous responsibility for the future of 1.3 billion people. That is why their primary concern is for international peace and stability. They want peace because they know the future of the Chinese people depends on continued economic growth. Without peace, growth would be jeopardised, causing enormous economic, social and political problems for their country. That is why in relation to Iraq, the issue we are debating in our parliament today, China wants a peaceful resolution. They, like the Australian Labor Party, support disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction and they believe, also like the Australian Labor Party, that the United Nations weapons inspectors should be given the time that they need to do their work properly. During our visit concerns were also raised that, if a war were launched against Iraq, North Korea would be the next target. The Chinese government is, of course, acutely sensitive to threats to peace and stability within Asia. It wants North Korea to be a peaceful, stable, nonnuclear neighbour but it also understands the nature of North Korea’s concerns for its own security. China is putting in a lot of effort behind the scenes to make sure that there is a peaceful resolution to the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula. There remains in China a level of anxiety about Taiwan. It is a source of major security concern for the Chinese government and they continue to seek resolution of this issue through expanding economic ties and other exchanges. 12610 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 The challenges and threats China faces to economic growth are not only external. They are well aware of the massive stresses and strains being placed on China’s environment and infrastructure, as well as its social and government structures, by rapid economic development. The new leadership is concerned to address disparities between the booming eastern seaboard and provinces to the west and north and disparities between urban Chinese and the many hundreds of millions living in rural areas. The Chinese government sees continued economic development as crucial to sharing the benefits of growth, creating more jobs and boosting the standard of living, yet it is well aware of the high environmental and infrastructure costs that unrestrained growth could exact. The enormous demand on natural resources, the degradation of air and water quality and the wear and tear on infrastructure are all issues that the Chinese government understands must be addressed as part of its push for sustained economic development. Australia can be a partner with China in meeting these challenges and helping its drive for economic growth. Though, to date, the bulk of our exports to China have been the raw materials that help to drive Chinese industry-iron ore, fuel and natural fibres-we all know that Australia is much more than a quarry and we have much to offer the Chinese in our services and expertise. There are certainly many significant opportunities for Australian businesses in these areas. Many are already engaged in China, and we saw one example: the Macquarie Bank has been heavily involved in financing the construction of apartment complexes in Shanghai, and a very impressive development it is. Australia also has much expertise in the areas of banking, finance, social welfare, regional development and the law that could be of use to China. The institutional and legal reform now being contemplated by the Chinese government is a monumental task. Australia can offer China our experience in the development and maintenance of a highly evolved legal system marked by the separation of powers between those who develop laws and those who enforce them. It is a system that serves to protect the rights of individuals in relation to the state. It is a system that is fundamental to the organisation of our own society. It is also central to the effective growth and operation of a market economy everywhere. A federal Labor government would certainly join in active dialogue on these issues with China and provide assistance to the Chinese government in helping to entrench the credible rule of law, including training and technical advice. Discussions during our visit also included the very sensitive issue of human rights. Of course Labor’s position on these issues is very well known both here in Australia and in China. For instance, we have consistently urged the Chinese government to give international human rights organisations, humanitarian groups and independent journalists access to Tibet. We certainly believe that by establishing and continuing a dialogue on human rights we can not only raise individual human rights cases but also contribute to the developing and strengthening of legal frameworks that protect and promote human rights in our region and beyond. An area of great potential for Australia is in the export of education services. There is little doubt about the thirst of young Chinese for education and their commitment to learning. During my visit, I had the good fortune to visit Ren Min University, where I addressed a class of about 200 students, all in their early 20s. Of course, I spoke in English. Not surprisingly, perhaps in China, it was pretty incredible that the complex questions that were fired back at me by the students were also in faultless English. They asked me questions about the implicaTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12611 tions of globalisation and what Australia’s reaction would be if North Korea launched an attack. These complex issues were canvassed in an extraordinary display of bilingual and intellectual capacity. It certainly shows the challenge for Australia’s education system in developing the language skills of our young people. This was not a capacity confined to Ren Min University. During my trip, we also visited the high school of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. It is a vocational school of means much more modest than Ren Min. Its thousands of students are drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds but, once again, the openness and the enthusiasm of these people was very impressive. They were learning English and Japanese, and their outlook was decidedly international. Of course, many Australian institutions are already exporting education services to China. In my own electorate, La Trobe University already does significant business in China. The Australian National University is developing joint higher degree programs in economics and public policy with some of China’s top universities. There also exist opportunities for major Australian companies to enter into partnership arrangements with Chinese universities to train the technicians, managers, lawyers, accountants and other professionals that the country desperately needs. Our vocational education and training institutions could also do much to help China meet the massive demand that exists for skilled workers. The growth in services exports to China has been hampered by barriers, such as restrictions on the entry of foreigners into many service industries. That is why China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation is of such significance. It will bring China directly into negotiations aimed at liberalising global trade in services so that Australians and others can participate in the growth and strengthening of the Chinese services sector. A key point of the most recent visit was the chance to exchange ideas about the trading environment and economic development. On our side of politics, we strongly support the liberalisation of international trade and we have consistently backed China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation. We are committed to improving relations between our two countries to make sure a more positive climate exists for Australian business. There is no question that government has a key role to play in smoothing the path for business, particularly when dealing with a highly regulated economy such as China’s. This includes establishing and nurturing close personal relationships between national leaders, as well as fostering closer business ties and encouraging cultural and personal links, particularly through education. Concerns have been raised about the impact the actions of the Howard government have had on Australia’s economic and security relations with China and our region. It is the case that, under this government, there has been an increasing alignment of Australia with the United States at the expense of other interests, including those in our region. The Prime Minister’s deputy sheriff act in the region in 1999 and his government’s continuing pursuit of a free trade agreement with the United States have certainly fuelled perceptions of a progressive disengagement from Asia. This Howard government has been seen to have dragged in the welcome mat and put up the ‘too busy’ sign to many of our Asian neighbours. Little wonder then that China is pushing ahead with negotiations on regional trade agreements that include members of ASEAN and ASEAN plus 3, but not Australia. Labor believes Asia is integral to Australia’s future security and prosperity. The region currently takes 55 per cent of our merchandise exports and is rapidly emerging as a major market 12612 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 for our services. We cannot afford to be locked out of negotiations involving some of our nearest neighbours and most important trading partners. That is why Labor is so committed to building and strengthening ties with China and the region. The China of today is a land of incredible challenges and amazing promise. Australia can and should be part of its future. On behalf of the Labor Party, I want to extend to the Chinese government and the people of China our sympathies and concern over the terrible toll inflicted by the shocking earthquake that took place when we were there. I would also like to thank our Chinese hosts in Shanghai and Beijing for their hospitality and the senior Chinese government officials and academics who gave freely of their time and their thoughts in our discussions. Finally, I also want to say a particular thank you to Senator Peter Cook, who organised this delegation and made sure that it all worked, and to Professor Peter Drysdale, from the Australia-Japan Research Centre at the Australian National University, for his invaluable advice and support. I say again: we cannot afford to be locked out of negotiations involving some of our nearest neighbours. We must be involved in building and strengthening ties with China and the region. That is why we went to China. I would say to the government: do not drop the bundle, do not pull in the welcome mat. We need to be an active participant and an active trading partner in this region for our country’s future and for our country’s security. 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. The week I wrote this speech recognised the seventh anniversary of the Howard-Costello government. That event ought to be marked by noting their greatest achievement: being the highest taxing government in the history of Australia. In fact, they recorded that achievement for seven years in a row without exception. That is some record. Australians have had only one tax cut in seven years. That came with the GST. We still have the GST, but the tax cut has long gone. The government have had a pretty soft ride, courtesy of a pretty-much compliant media, an indulged financial big end of town and an inherited economic dynamic, which was made more effective by the Reserve Bank Governor, Ian Macfarlane, who reduced interest rates when his predecessor, Bernie Fraser, failed. Nevertheless, when analysis is applied to the achievements of this government, it is a very narrow list. Three things stand out from those seven years: the response to the Port Arthur tragedy, which showed a stark contrast to six or seven years before when our Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, tried to get national gun laws through; the response to East Timor; and the nation building task of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. They were all very positive and very clear. It is a pity that that discontinues with the current attitude of the government towards the situation and the disarmament of Iraq. Mr Macfarlane is an interesting personality, and he is a stark contrast to people like Stan Wallis, Stan Howard, Ray Williams, Gary Toomey, Keith Lambert, Paul Batchelor, George Turnbull and Chris Cuffe, and the list goes on and on. The list of financial receivers of big handouts has been a veritable growth industry under this government. My grandfather had a saying that, if the CEO of a company was in the media, was a bit of a media tart, you should take your shares out of that company because you know that person is not doing their job. Mr Macfarlane, to his credit, appears to have got on with the job he was employed to do; albeit, he has been pretty generously served in the economic dynamic of falling interest rates, falling inflation and falling unemployment. You cannot do much wrong when that is happening.",117,Representatives Main Committee
125,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (5.31 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12613 However, that trinity which keeps governments in office and oppositions in apoplexy requires serious analysis. In every Australian city, suburb and region, millions of stories are not being told. They are not being told in the member for Grey’s seat, nor are they being told in mine. They reflect negatively on the apparent impotence of this government when it comes to the formation of a future vision for this country. Buying a home has become harder under John Howard and Peter Costello. It now takes 8½ years of wages to buy an Australian home, which is an extra 27 months of wages compared to seven years ago. The proportion of Australians buying their first home compared to the total is now the second lowest on record. The average size of loans has increased by 67 per cent, while the average mortgage has risen from $104,000 in March 1996 to $170,000 in December 2002. Household debt has doubled in that period, with the average household now owing $82,000. Obviously, the synthesising of foreign debt doubling under this government from $180 billion to a figure approaching $360 billion is difficult to make meaningful at an individual family level. I note the media frenzy has not criticised the government on this issue. Falling interest rates have benefited only a minority of Australians. Consumer debt on credit cards has sky-rocketed and blown out to record levels, at interest rates from 16 to 24 per cent-that is the real interest rate for the majority of Australian families. It is not 4.7 or 4.8 per cent; it is 16 to 24 per cent. The credit card debt of Australian families has trebled to $22 billion. In fact, Australian families are saving less and are paying record bank fees. Total bank fees have doubled since 1997. Australians can save only three cents in every dollar they earn. Throughout the stewardship of the Howard-Costello government, there has been a massive shift of the nation’s wealth to an already privileged, very small group of rich people. That is, of course, a very dangerous situation for any nation state, as has been shown throughout history over the last 2,000 years. In 410 AD, the Roman emperor Honorius was informed by his servant that King Alaric was in the north of Italy with 100,000 Visigoths, poised to invade Rome. Honorius was so confused that he thought the servant was talking about one of his prized poultry. That was his hobby; the emperor was a strange little fellow. Honorius did not appreciate that for years the emperors of Rome had increased taxation on Roman citizens for the benefit of an ever decreasing elite of very rich Romans. The emperor and his privileged group were taken aback when King Alaric and the Visigoths arrived and ordinary Romans refused to fight them; they had nothing to fight for. Louis XIV, the King of France, was a little crazy, like Honorius with his poultry. He was not quite of the real world either; he spent far too much time with potted orange trees. They were not the only things about Louis XIV that were potty. Louis XIV and his predecessors had achieved exactly the same results as Honorius did in Rome. They transferred the wealth of the nation to fewer and fewer privileged people. As that folly marked the end of ancient empires like Greece, Egypt and Rome, it also doomed the reign of Louis XIV and his offspring. If you look at the reigns of some of the royalty in Holland-the Dutch, of course, were the originators of world capitalism-and the royalty in Portugal and Spain, you find similar stories. The point I make is that, notwithstanding how things change, some principles remain the same regardless of the millennium or century in which people live. The point is this: if you do not share the nation’s wealth fairly among the majority of citizens, the fate of the nation will be determined as it was in the past. 12614 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 Observation of city, suburban and regional Australia reveals many stories. Government would do well to listen to them for they do not reflect favourably on the status quo. We see it every day in our lives. For example, the rate of bulk-billing by GPs has decreased by 11 percentage points in the last seven years, and only 69.9 per cent of GP services are now bulk-billed. More than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk-billed last year compared to the situation when John Howard came to office. In the seat of Port Adelaide, 87 per cent of our GPs bulk-bill, and you wonder how long they can keep going. They are under real pressure; they tell me so. Some of my constituents tell me how difficult it is to find a GP who bulk-bills. We now get people from the eastern suburbs, the wealthy suburbs, coming down to the doctors in my electorate. Some of our locals have found that they have had to keep those people out and refuse them service. You now have to book a GP, and it can take weeks to see anybody. The average out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78, which is a 55 per cent increase since the Howard government came to office in 1996. Take as an example the widespread begging by young and old on the streets of our capital cities. Is there anyone on the government side who would give credence to the idea that some of the begging could be avoided if we targeted funding to the needy and if that targeting of the needy were government policy? Let us examine the begging. I do not mean the professional begging that you see in Sydney and Melbourne-and sometimes in Adelaide, but very rarely. Look at the young mothers and the children begging on the city streets. Does anyone on the government side concede that just maybe that $3 billion subsidy for health insurance is aimed at the wrong group? Could it have been better targeted? On the same theme, everyone in this House is aware of the billions of dollars being transferred from public to private education. By the false god of choice from the coalition has many a parent fallen. Take the example of two working parents on modest wages who, noting the bias of the government against public education, feel compelled to join the bandwagon of private education. Unfortunately for many parents, this not only results in a transfer of their funds but can result in good parenting being replaced by poor parenting or no parenting. It happens, and I have seen it happen more often than people would wish to admit. Under this government, money buys you a degree and merit cannot guarantee you a place. In this country, merit cannot guarantee you a place in a university! The coalition has ripped out more than $5 billion from Australian universities. By 2003 there were 20,000 fewer fully funded places than in 1996. Student fees have jumped 85 per cent since 1996. Some students are now paying $100,000 for a degree. Take the single pensioner with no income other than the pension who pays, even with the rebate, up to $1,500 a year-a sum they can ill affordon health insurance. They do it. Many people in my electorate do it and they cannot afford it. Under the coalition the Australian labour market has dived to an alarming rate of low-paid, low-skilled, part-time and insecure employment. In my state of South Australia 50 per cent of the labour market can be so described. Australia wide the figure is 40 per cent. There are 2.1 million Australians who are affected by underemployment and unemployment. In question time the other week the Prime Minister bragged that 1.3 million jobs had been created by the coalition in their seven years tenure. However, to my continued interjections of ‘How many full-time jobs?’ the Prime Minister was decidedly silent. And so he should be. The quantum figure of 1.3 million jobs is misleading in the extreme, and the Prime Minister knows it. Almost all of those 1.3 million jobs are low-skilled, low-paid, part-time and insecure jobs in retail, hospitality, aged and child-care centres and call centres. Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12615 Where exactly are the full-time, high-skilled, highly paid jobs genuine Australian businesses have been screaming about for years? Where indeed is there any recognition on the government side of the significant skill shortages in the Australian labour market? And they are significant. If even for one moment you think that Australians are relaxed and comfortable, as promised by this Prime Minister, ignoring for a moment the serious international conflicts we face, then simply watch the behaviour of more and more Australians on Australian roads. Watch what happens at sporting events. Go for a walk in a deprived suburb. Listen to the anger in the voices of talkback radio participants. Talk to the people who have to deal with the victims of violence and child abuse. Read the letters to the editor pages. Ask yourself this question: are these the indicators of a relaxed, comfortable, inclusive and fair society? Go and visit an emergency admission centre at any public hospital and you will be shocked. It will illuminate things for you for all the wrong reasons. Observe, just for a moment, the abandonment of mentally ill people on the streets of our cities and suburbs. Take account of the fact that depression is now the second most prevalent disease in this country. Even a former rightwing extremist like former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett recognised that. It was too late, mind you, but he did at least recognise that and change his views. The evidence on Melbourne streets was overwhelming. Take a look at the increasing failure to attend to transport, power and tourism infrastructure maintenance in this country. Will the former power failures in Auckland in 1998 be repeated in Australia? You bet they will. Will Australia ever get the right balance between road, rail and shipping transport? Not under this government. Take the classic example of the partisanship of the government and their intention to increase pharmaceutical charges by 30 per cent. The highest taxing government in the nation’s history intends to tax the poor and the chronically ill even more than the unacceptable levels that they face today. Why do we pay benefits to take them away in taxation? The poor should not be paying taxation. It is just a ludicrous situation to take money away in the form of taxation and then try to give part of it back in terms of benefits. It is just a waste of time and a self-indulgent waste of energy. It is money that should be going to infrastructure. The highest taxing government in Australian history has transferred, and continues to transfer, more and more of the nation’s wealth to fewer and fewer of the privileged classes. That is true for health: there is a $2.5 billion health insurance rebate at the expense of public hospitals. That is true for education: we have billion-dollar subsidies for religious and ethnic private schools at the expense of public schools. It is out of control. That is true for transport. An exception of course is the Alice Springs-Darwin railway. The coalition has deliberately taken money away from health, education, training and transport and diminished potential job opportunities-full-time, skilled jobs with high pay-for ordinary Australians. The coalition has deliberately created a labour market dynamic that fails to reward the people who actually do the work in our society. Is that an extravagant statement? I do not think so. Have a look at the salaries and conditions of aged care workers and child-care workers. I thought a civilised society was one that looked after its aged and its children. What do we pay our aged care workers and child-care workers? Almost slave wage rates. What about the assembly line workers, teachers, nurses, policemen, policewomen, transport operators, retail and hospitality workers and call centre operators? They run the place; they do the work-and we pay them piddling wages. At the same time we recognise that credit card debt is mushrooming out of control as people in this country live beyond their means. 12616 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 Note the increasing anger in our society: go to the schools, go to the workplace, go for a drive on the roads in any city, and look in our own homes. The state that ignores those warning signs is preparing the way for its long-term demise. Hundreds of thousands of people marching for reconciliation and against the war in Iraq are marching for more than just those two issues. Just as it happened in ancient Rome, ancient Greece, imperial France or Stalinist Russia, so it can happen in what is loosely termed Western democracies. When the real purpose of the state to advantage the majority of the citizens is ignored and when education, health and real job opportunities are limited to the privileged, the government can be seen as writing its own epitaph-but it might also write the epitaph for our own country. As Ross Gittins pointed out in a Monday Sydney Morning Herald a couple of weeks ago, the government could set up a future vision for this country. I will repeat some of his major suggestions. We could set up an education and research endowment fund-that is, take the future skill needs of this country seriously. We could break the impasse on salinity and water rights by compensating farmers in return for moving to a properly priced water regime. We could straighten out and speed up every rail freight track in the land. We could resume borrowings and start acquiring responsible debt. Of course Gittins means investing in worthwhile capital projects-not wasting money on recurrent expenditure that disappears to privileged people around this country-that would deliver both short-term and long-term benefits stretching over the next 10, 20 and maybe even 60 years. It is perfectly responsible, even desirable, to finance them by borrowing. Ross Gittins sums up his article with the profound statement for all politicians: Just think of the political kudos to be had by the politician with the smarts to reinvent that principle. And the guyor the womanwith the head start in pulling it off is the guyor the womanwith the impeccable records of treating debt responsibly. That is the real message in his article. It is a message that ought to be listened to by government and opposition alike. It ought to be particularly listened to by state governments, who are notorious-whatever political persuasion they are-for wasting money and failing to invest in a long-term future. Has this Howard-Costello government got the political smarts to recognise and achieve a future vision? Its track record, I suggest, indicates otherwise. This message ought to be revisited by the Labor state governments throughout Australia, including my own in South Australia. Just prior to Christmas, the state Labor government in South Australia made a very welcome decision to commence the port expressway but, unlike what they said in their election promise, they failed to link it to the decision to build a road and rail bridge over the Port River to achieve what would be the best transport hub in Australia and perhaps one of the best in the world. There are such things as responsible borrowings and good debt. It is time federal, state and local governments realised this important principle. Local government, too, do not do enough in terms of local spending on infrastructure. They ought to be spending 30 per cent of their budgets on infrastructure-as should the states and as should the federal government-but they do not, and that is why we are in such a mess in this country. Australians deserve better Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12617 than what they are currently getting from all forms of government, including the HowardCostello government. But the real leadership, of course, does not come from state or local government; it comes from the federal government. What a pity it has all gone missing for the last seven years. 2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. The Whitlam government determined in the mid-seventies that Australia should have its own gallantry award system in place. Commonsense should have dictated that conferring Australian awards equivalent to those originally recommended would have been the logical way to go. Incredibly, this issue was allowed to drag on for years. When the coalition-to its credit, I might say-finally decided to bring the matter to a head, Mrs Bishop, the former Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, took the quite ludicrous step of refusing Australian gallantry awards to six diggers. At the same time, she conferred those same awards on officers. Her decision caused those six diggers to knock back her downgraded recommendations, and it led to the largest refusal of awards in Australia’s history. Though the minister remained unrepentant, there was only ever one way to resolve this impasse: the six men would eventually have to receive the same gallantry awards as the officers. That is basically what happened. The decision to grant Australian awards close to 30 years after our involvement in Vietnam had finished was unusual in that it broke with the British practice of not allowing gallantry awards to be made past a predetermined date. In the history of imperial awards, however, there had been one notable exception to this. In 1907, King Edward VII, after being very much opposed to the idea, finally relented and allowed posthumous VCs to be awarded to six men who had been killed in campaigns in the latter half of the 19th century. Two of these awards related to actions as far back as the Indian mutiny of the 1850s. The war office was fearful that many next of kin would be encouraged to seek the upgrading of existing awardsthe so-called shoals of applicants syndrome. The terms and conditions under which those posthumous VCs were granted ensured that no such rash rush of applicants eventuated. What can we learn from this? First, a precedent was set when Australian gallantry awards were granted to replace imperial awards which should have been granted but were not. Second, the precedent set in 1907 and repeated in an Australian context showed that the passage of time need not necessarily inhibit the issue of awards, even in the case of the VC. Mr John Bradford of Adelaide is an authority on the administrative processes associated with posthumous awards from the turn of the 20th century onwards. He discovered a decision about the imperial POWs who were deemed to have been killed while making genuine attempts to escape. Quota constraints were not to apply to such awards, as was shown in the Stalag Luft3 great escape, where 50 recaptured POWs were executed at the express order of Hitler. All, including five Australians, received posthumous recognition. Australian POWs who were killed in similar situations while serving in the European theatre of the war also received posthumous recognition. However, the situation regarding our Far East POWs was not so clear-cut. It would seem that in 1946-47 Australian military authorities failed to process a great majority of recommendations for awards to Australian POWs who had suffered a similar fate. Lionel Wigmore’s official history records that there were 27 prisoners of war executed for attempting to escape-the largest single execution occurring on 6 June 1942 at the Tavoy POW camp in Burma. Here, a group of eight POWs, all Victorians and all from the 2nd/4th Antitank Regi-",124,Representatives Main Committee
126,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (5.51 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 200212618 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 ment, were recaptured a few days after escaping. In spite of spirited appeals on their behalf by senior officers, all were executed without trial. Forced to act as a witness to these executions, the camp’s senior Australian officer, Brigadier A.L. Varley, noted, ‘The spirit of these eight men was wonderful. They all spoke cheerio and good luck messages to one another and never showed any sign of fear-a truly courageous end.’ Mr Bradford later located an Australian War Memorial file which listed 22 of the 27 men, including the eight from Tavoy, who were recommended for posthumous mentions in dispatches. Yet, of the 22 recommendations, only three mentions were subsequently confirmed in Commonwealth gazettes and, of these, two are listed as ‘live’ rather than ‘posthumous’. John then contacted the Soldier Career Management Agency, where the service records of these men are held. They confirmed the awards were never made. John Bradford next approached Veterans’ Affairs and suggested that these luckless men should have their service, devotion to duty and gallantry recognised by present day Australian awards. Furthermore, he argued that, since the administration of these awards had been entirely the responsibility of our military authorities, counterarguments based on conditions for imperial awards, end-of-war lists or quotas were largely irrelevant. I believe the following to be a fair analogy. When the jungles to our north give up World War II dead, as they are prone to do on occasion, we proudly accord them the ceremony and honour that is their due. By doing so, we help to bring closure to the next of kin who remain. When our archives yield their secrets, should we not do the same-particularly when it is known that their next of kin were never informed of their loved ones being passed over for recognition? Yet today, while our government has a moral obligation and the means to bring closure to this unfinished business, sadly, it steadfastly refuses to do so. In my time here, which is a relatively short time, I have seen moves which have had some bipartisan support to have VCs awarded-for example, in the case of John Kirkpatrick Simpson of Gallipoli fame, and of course Teddy Sheean, who was a person championed in this House by the member for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom, who has spoken on these issues with some passion. I think it is very difficult for members of parliament to rectify-as King Edward VII did a long time ago when he decreed that the six English soldiers should have their awards granted after some 50-plus years-without that regal authority what has really been an oversight or a miscarriage of justice. But it seems to me that there needs to be a requirement or a capacity for us to have some mechanism to address those issues of unfairness as they come to light. I know there was a Second World War end-of-war list. I know there was a list initiated a long time after the Vietnam War had finished. Those end-of-war lists, to some degree, rectified the unfairness which occurred-and which always occurs-in relation to the awarding of medals of gallantry. It seems to me that there needs to be some process through which members of parliament, if they are made aware of these situations, can refer them to some authority or some group of people which has a capacity to review these things. I am very keen to pursue that-and indeed, in line with some of my colleagues, will pursue it-in an attempt to find some justice and to bring some closure to some of these issues. I greatly appreciate the dedication of Mr Bradford, who has put an immense amount of work into not just this issue but a number of other issues. I thank him for taking the time to make me aware. I thank him for the campaign he is currently running with various ministers and parliamentarians, who are seeking to get justice for these people despite the fact that it is so long ago. Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12619 I think it is timely that the member for Ballarat is in the chamber because I know that she has been approached by one of her constituents, a survivor of the Battle of Long Tan, who is one of many who have been very unfairly treated. A couple of days after the conclusion of that battle-and it was the biggest battle, I think, that Australian troops were involved in during our time in Vietnam-the Vietnamese government of the day decided that they wanted to award some Vietnamese awards to some of the Australian soldiers who were involved in that battle, and to some of the Australian soldiers who showed incredible bravery. It was a very embarrassing situation for the Vietnamese authorities and for the troops involved because, just prior to the awards being granted, the then Australian ambassador stepped in on behalf of the government and prevented these very deserving awards being presented on the basis that the Vietnamese government had not sought or been granted the approval of Her Majesty the Queen of England. It was a very interesting situation: it was a war in which Australian troops were involved and in which British troops were not involved; yet, when the government of the country that we were in part serving wanted to recognise the valour of some of our diggers, it was prevented doing so by the Queen of England. A commitment was made to those troops that approval would be sought by Australian authorities for those awards to go ahead and that they would later be granted. All of this is documented. I have seen a letter from a very high-ranking Vietnamese member of the government at the time which confirms that it was indeed the intention of the then South Vietnamese government to make those awards. The embarrassing thing, from the point of view of the Vietnamese, was that the troops were all on parade awaiting the awards. They had to dispatch a couple of runners to the local market to buy things such as Vietnamese dolls and cigar boxes, which were then brought back for presentation to the troops. This is unfinished business as far as I am concerned and it is unfinished business as far as the member for Ballarat is concerned, and we intend to pursue this issue. As a matter of fairness and decency, I think the minister and the government of the day should accept that the intention was there, the proof is there, and these deserving Vietnam veterans should be granted the right to wear these Vietnamese decorations. They should be granted that right before ANZAC Day so they can wear them when they parade with their mates this coming ANZAC Day. I call on the minister to do this. I assure her that she will have the wholehearted support of our side of politics and it will be a gesture greatly appreciated by those members of D Company, 6th Battalion who would like to wear those awards. They feel very strongly about this, not because they want more ribbons on their chest but because they see it as a recognition of the sacrifices of their mates who were killed that day. They see it as a recognition of the courage of those Australian soldiers who did not survive. So it is unfinished business and I would call on the minister to address the issue. There is plenty of evidence there and there is a need to bring this matter to an end. If it is not done, I can assure the government that when we return to the Treasury bench-as we will in due course, because the political wheel turns, as it is turning now-those recognitions will be made. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the member for Ballarat, a new member in this chamber, for the very wholehearted way in which she has made representation on behalf of her constituent and, in so doing, on behalf of all of those former members of the ADF who have been impacted on by this decision. I was absolutely appalled to pick up the Sunday Times on Sunday and read a banner headline, ‘Prisoners tortured’. I was further appalled when I then read on to the body of the article 12620 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 to find that members of the Special Air Service are being accused, via the Sunday Times and via ABC journalist Liam Bartlett, of torturing Indonesian soldiers who were captured in East Timor. I find the article to be one which lacks credibility. I must say, for a journalist like Liam Bartlett, who has a lot of credibility and a big following in Western Australia, I am very disappointed in what I consider to be a piece of junkyard journalism. This article comes on the eve of the Australian troops being deployed to war in Iraq. It is an article and a piece of journalism which impacts on the very high standing that they have within the military nations of this world. I think it is a very unfair piece of journalism because it lacks any evidence at all. The interesting thing is that there were some matters that have been investigated by at least two authorities, one of them being the Australian Federal Police and the other the United Nations body which has responsibility for these matters. Both of those bodies found that there were no cases to answer. And there is an ongoing investigation-a very inept investigationbeing conducted, under which a particular member of the SAS is being charged. This person has had justice denied-because justice delayed is justice denied-for some 2½ years. Not only does this article, in my view, breach what I would consider to be sub judice rules but it does not give this person, who is facing some charges and who I believe will ultimately be exonerated, a fair go. But most importantly it does not give those members of the Special Air Service who cannot speak for themselves-some because they are on deployment-an opportunity to respond to this sort of stuff. I find it very unfair, and I wonder how much damage it does to the reputation of the Special Air Service and to the very fine reputation of the members of our Australian Defence Force. I wonder how much damage it might do to their well-being should they, in turn, ever have the unfortunate circumstance of being captured. I call on this government to bring to a close this inept investigation carried out by incompetent people and to let the soldier who is facing these charges have his day in court. I do not know whether we can ask for anything more than that. Fairness and justice demand that this man should have his day in court, that this issue should be dealt with and that the SAS should be given the opportunity to clear their very good name. I want to reiterate my disappointment in this article by Liam Bartlett and the presentation of this article by the Sunday Times. It does neither of them any good. Ms KING (Ballarat) (6.11 p.m.)-I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. I thank the member for Cowan for again raising in this chamber the issue of the awarding of medals that are still outstanding to veterans of Long Tan. Certainly I have a member in my electorate who stood on the parade ground and felt humiliated when he was handed a doll instead of the medal that he was expecting. I think the member for Cowan would acknowledge that it has been a problem that successive governments have not rectified, and I am certainly pleased to join with him in saying that, should we get into government, it will be rectified. I ask the government to look at giving some bipartisan support to dealing with this issue. Long Tan was a terrible battle, and people in our community still live with the scars of that battle today. Bill from my electorate does deserve the recognition and the medal that he expected to get as he stood on that hot parade ground and felt humiliated by his treatment on that day. Today, on the day when the Prime Minister has committed Australia to war, it is hard to focus on domestic issues. But, as I will have the opportunity to speak in the House-hopefully, tomorrow-on Iraq, I would like to try to focus today on domestic issues and, in particular, on Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12621 families in my electorate of Ballarat. I want to focus on the failure of the government to recognise that families on middle to low incomes are vulnerable financially and that many of the government’s own policies and decisions are making them increasingly so. While the government has been totally preoccupied about fighting a war on foreign soil, it has forgotten about the lives of ordinary families in my electorate. Under the seven years of this government, we have seen families experiencing increased taxation and families burdened with record levels of debt who increasingly live off credit cards. Under this government, we have also seen a loss of services. All of these factors mean that families in my electorate are more vulnerable to changes in interest rates, stock market prices, price rises and certainly job insecurity. The government has lost touch with the lives of ordinary wage-earning families. Never is this more evident than when it continues to turn a blind eye to the huge payouts being given to failed corporate executives while at the same time it punishes families by putting them into debt through its flawed family payments system. The Prime Minister will tell you that things have never been better for what he likes to call the ‘mainstream’. He will tell you that under this government all the families on low and middle incomes are feeling relaxed and comfortable. The middle income earners of Bennelong, where the median weekly family income is almost double that of families in my electorate, may be feeling relaxed and comfortable, but I can tell you that in my electorate, where the median weekly family income is $700, people are fighting a much more fundamental battle: the battle for their family’s survival. I guess you could not expect much more of the Prime Minister, surrounded as he is by wealth and affluence. Ensconced in Kirribilli, sipping from his extensive wine collection, staff on hands and knees clipping the shag pile on the new carpet with nail scissors, glowing new curtains and carpet to the value of $65,000, watching the online $10,000 plasma TV-now returned-eating in the Lodge from the new $16,000 Wedgwood dinner setting, swanning into the newly refurbished office in Phillip Street with its $3,500 sofa, $4,500 TV storage cabinet and $3,500 newspaper stand-that sure beats my magazine rack at home-how could you expect him to know? There is very little for families in my electorate to feel relaxed and comfortable about, given the financial pressure they are under. The last seven years have been the seven highest-taxing years in Australia’s history. There have been five occasions so far where income tax has been 17 per cent more than our GDP. Every one of those occasions has been under the stewardship of this government. Australians have had one tax cut in seven years but, as with all things with this government, you have got to watch what the other hand is doing. The tax cut was of course introduced alongside the biggest indirect tax we have seen, the GST. Combine this with a whole range of levies that have either been imposed directly or passed down through increased costs of consumer items: the dairy levy, the Ansett ticket tax, the Timor tax and the sugar levy. The sugar levy will have a direct impact on my electorate, with the two largest employers, Master Foods and McCains, now facing an unfair increase in one of their major inputs to production-an increase that will of course be passed onto consumers but which also puts jobs in my electorate under pressure. I am sure I am not in the only electorate affected by this. I suspect that the member for Parramatta, with Coca-Cola in his electorate, shares my views on this unfair tax. Whilst the income tax the government introduced is well and truly long gone, we still have the GST and we still have the continued introduction of levies and surcharges that the government likes to pretend are not really taxes. 12622 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 With the government having squandered the surplus in the 2001 election campaign, it seems its only solution now is to transfer the cost of what generally have been government responsibilities to individuals and families through introducing levies. Families are living under a record level of debt. Household debt has doubled; household debt in this country is over half a trillion dollars. We heard earlier this month that the household saving figures, for the first time, had gone into the negative. In Treasuryspeak, they say, ‘For the first time, Australian families have dissavings.’ In ordinary language, families are spending more than they actually earn. Credit card debt has tripled to $22 billion under this government, with many families carrying several credit cards with over $2,000 limits on each. Mortgage repayments now take up more of the family budget than before. For many people who already own their own home, the housing market boom in Ballarat has been a real bonus, but for many young couples and low-income families trying to buy their first home the squeeze is certainly on. The average size of home loans has increased by 67 per cent, and monthly mortgage repayments chew up nearly 43 per cent of family income across Australia. In some capital cities, it has risen to as high as 54 per cent. The government likes to hit out at the Labor Party when it talks about interest rates, but it does not like it when you point out that, given the proportion of incomes that people are now paying on their mortgages, even an interest rate of half a per cent will send many families broke. A half a per cent interest rate rise in today’s circumstances would be the equivalent of a 13 to 14 per cent interest rate rise. They are not my figures; they are figures the National Australia Bank, when they visited my electorate, gave to me. The proportion of Australians buying their first home compared to the total is now dropping. For families and individuals who have paid off their mortgages, there have been benefits, but for low-income families and young couples trying to enter the housing market it is becoming increasingly difficult. The government’s flawed family payments system is also creating a debt trap for many families. Geraldine McDonald of Wendouree in my electorate contacted my office last year, having incurred a debt of almost $2,000. She had experienced redundancy under two employers during the course of the year and her husband’s hours in the building industry were entirely unpredictable. She had informed Centrelink on each occasion that she thought her and her husband’s income had varied but, under the government’s own system, they were informed that they would now have a debt. The government’s flawed family payments system is totally out of step with the earning patterns of Australian families, with families being hit with end-of-year debts if their income fluctuates, despite advising Centrelink immediately of the changes. The government likes to talk about choice but in fact it has narrowed the choices available to many lowand middle-income families by creating the circumstances under which those families are put into increasing debt. In the context of all this, the government has been shifting the cost of services onto families and individuals. People are now paying for services that they previously did not pay for. We have seen an increase in premiums for private health insurance-something the government said would decrease-and in the cost of seeing a GP. Child-care costs are also increasing. Medicare is under pressure. The rate of bulk-billing has been decreasing in my electorate and now rests at only 57.1 per cent of GP services-10 per cent lower than the national average and down from 65 per cent only two years ago. In every year since the election of the Howard government, bulk-billing rates have decreased. The average out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78-up 55 per cent Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12623 since the government was elected. For many families in my electorate, it is difficult to gain access to a general practitioner. General practitioners themselves are under enormous pressure as their waiting lists blow out and practices desperately try to recruit more doctors. We are about 15 short in Ballarat city itself. As a regional community, we get limited support to recruit doctors, and the pressure on my local doctors, particularly those who bulk-bill, is mounting. The government’s response to this has been that they never saw Medicare as including bulk-billing as a universal service, and they argue that it should not be seen as a universal service. On this, the government are simply wrong. Medicare is not solely about Australian health care agreements; it is also about the provision of general practice services. Most people see the Medicare levy as a contract between themselves and the government for the provision of bulk-billing. We have seen various reports about the possibility of the government means testing access to bulk-billing and, although the government say they will not do it, the reports continue to come out. In the area of child care, it is increasingly difficult for families in my electorate both to access child care and to afford it. It is almost impossible to get accurate information on unmet demand in child care, as the government refuses to release data or advice from the state and territory planning and advisory committees. I managed to get hold of some of this from Victoria last year. This data pointed to a shortage of over 4,500 long day care child-care places in Victoria-60 full-time long day care places in my electorate alone. Recently, our local newspaper, after doing a survey of all our child-care centres, estimated that there were well over 100 families on the various child-care waiting lists in the city of Ballarat alone. The figures, I would argue, are only the tip of the iceberg and not an accurate reflection of actual demand. So bad has the problem of trying to access child care in my electorate become that, prior to 7 a.m. every Monday morning, parents joint a queue outside the front of the occasional child-care centre to book occasional child-care places for the next week. To be fair, the centre also operates a phone queue in conjunction with the queue at the door. Sometimes it can take 45 minutes to reach the front of the queue either on the phone or at the door. The staff are doing the best they can but the reality is that there are just not enough child-care places for the demand. By the time they reach the end of the queue, many of the parents are told that the places and the times that they wanted are not available. Many of these parents work full time and, so that they can work, have to use occasional child care to make up one of the pieces of the patchwork of care for children in my electorate. The government provides no assistance to regional communities such as mine to try to work through the problem. With no funding provided to assist local government in planning nor any eligibility for private provider incentive funding or disadvantaged area subsidies, we have had to resort to trying to fundraise from our local community and our local businesseseven just to get access to data locally to try to attract a private provider into the area. The government has clearly abdicated its responsibilities for planning in child care, for collecting and developing data on unmet need and in ensuring that the quality of child care continues to improve. The government has washed its hands of any direct role in shaping children’s carecertainly in my electorate in Ballarat. There are worrying times ahead for Australian families. Families in my electorate are extremely vulnerable to changes in circumstances. Many families no longer have a financial 12624 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 buffer to see them through if there are tough times. If there is a national problem, a personal problem such as serious illness or one of the kids getting sick, or a local problem such as a factory closure many of my families will not cope. After seven years of this government, families in my electorate are not relaxed and comfortable. They are increasingly under pressure. 2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, which represent the method of financing the government uses to adjust its expenditure following the framing of its budget. It makes adjustments for items which could not have been planned for in the budget for one reason or another. It reminds me of something I see almost every week at the local supermarket: mum takes the trolley full of groceries to the checkout and hopes that the final tally will come to less than she has in her purse; if it does not-and I see this all too often-she has to offload any little treats or luxuries, and sometimes even essentials, so that she can make her expenditure fit her budget. Of course, the government does not have to do this. It does not have to suffer the embarrassment of being caught short at the checkout. The government does not have to worry about such things. It can pull a few tricks out of its hat to square the accounts. I note that the government claims it has made $167 million in savings. That, you might say, is what it took out of the supermarket trolley before it got to the checkout. But normally it does not have to worry. Unlike Oliver Twist, it can come back to the parliament, ask for more and not be refused. In considering these appropriation bills, we should look at the items the government has loaded into its shopping trolley since the budget last May. We should ask how they were overlooked in the first place and just how essential they really are. It is not a big list, but there are some interesting items in it. The parliamentary secretary tells us that these expenditures are essential and unavoidable. They total more than $1.45 billion, so it is not just a few minor items. The effect of the drought has led to some unexpected items, and these make up a large part of the total. So too does increased expenditure on security measures and the payouts to the victims of the Bali bombings-all essential and unavoidable. But it is the largest item on the list which attracted my attention, not because it is lavish or wasteful-far from it-but because it is showing up in these appropriation bills. The item I refer to is $350 million for the rephasing from the 2001-02 budget period to 2002-03 of Australia’s contribution to the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association and Australia’s commitment to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative-that is, $350 million in rephased expenditure. I like that word ‘rephased’. It means, ‘We should have paid it last year but we didn’t.’ We are not given a reason why it was not paid. I can only assume that it was not paid because it is treated as a handout to poor countries and it is considered that they can afford to wait until we, the generous donors, are good and ready to pay them. I would like to be able to rephase some of my commitments. I am sure the electricity supplier would not mind waiting until next year for me to pay my bill; I am sure the local council would not mind if I paid the rates next year instead of now; and I am sure the bank would be happy if I rephased my mortgage repayments until next year as well. But governments can rephase. They can put off until next year what they do not pay now. Who misses out? Only those who might have got their payment earlier. In this case, the heavily indebted poor countries can just wait their turn. Their funding has been rephased.",129,Representatives Main Committee
127,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (6.25 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12625 The obvious reason for the payment being rephased is that the 13th replenishment under the International Development Association was not finalised until 1 July 2002, so the payment could not have been made in the 2001-02 budget. While we could hardly say that the government was dragging its heels with its payment, it does say something about the operation of the World Bank when it allows the process to drag along beyond what was originally expected. I have taken a closer look at the programs funded under this item to see what might be the effect of delaying payments. The International Development Association is a member of the World Bank Group and provides the world’s poorest countries with what it calls ‘credits’. These credits are loans at zero interest with a 10-year grace period and maturities of 35 to 40 years. As we can see from the figures in this bill, we are committing just $350 million as Australia’s contribution to this replenishment of the International Development Association, as well as our contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. When you look at it, that seems like a major contribution. The total for the replenishment is given as $US23 billion over three years of the cycle. Australia’s contribution is roughly three per cent of the total pool of funds. When you look at the amount of $23 billion, it represents less than one-tenth of one per cent of the total of more than $US2.5 trillion owed by poor countries to the World Bank. So we should see it as a drop in the ocean in terms of its overall effect. When we look at the record of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative so far the results are far from encouraging. The initiative was introduced in 1996, but with the requirement that to qualify for the assistance a country must have completed three years under a structural adjustment program. The initial funding started coming online in 1998. The structural adjustment program requires poor countries to follow a strict diet of economic measures prescribed by the World Bank. The program often leads to poor countries cutting spending on education, food subsidies and health care. Instead of investing in their future, poor countries are forced to pay back debts that just get bigger and bigger every day. It is not surprising that only a handful of countries have received end relief under the initiative. Countries such as Uganda received only $350 million but lost other debt relief assistance as a result. Uganda was regarded as one of the most promising countries to benefit from debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, but Uganda’s experience does not hold out much hope for other countries whose debt position is even worse. Two years after reaching its completion point, Uganda has not been able to secure relief from all creditors. Uganda’s debt stands at $1.6 billion-$322 million more than expected under the HIPC Initiative. So here we have the best example even deeper in debt despite the HIPC Initiative. Since its introduction in 1996, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative has failed to lift the debt burden of the world’s poorest countries. To give an example of the process, let us look at Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a country ravaged by years of war and drought. When Ethiopia reaches its completion point in June of this year, it will have received $1.3 billion in debt relief-or 47 per cent of its total external debt. This is expected to reduce the ratio of debt to exports from 284 per cent to 150 per cent. Ethiopia has the third lowest human development indicators in the world. Life expectancy there is 43 years. Despite reducing its debt of 47 per cent, the debt repayments remain high. Ethiopia is facing debt repayments of more than $100 million a year in the coming years, but its debt can only remain sustainable if it meets annual export growth of eight per cent a year. That is a hard task even for better placed economies. When you consider that its exports have grown at less than one per cent a year over the past decade, it is not hard to see that Ethiopia 12626 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 will not be able to sustain its debt repayments in the long term. We should not ignore the fact that Ethiopia is seeking new loans, including one for over a billion dollars to rebuild its warravaged economy. It is clear that, despite programs such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, we are not likely to see a turnaround in the debt position of the world’s poorest countries. At the same time, we are seeing an increase in the number of the world’s population who are living in dire poverty. The debt burden of the world’s poorest countries is the biggest single barrier to those countries improving the living standards of their people. It is a catch-22 situation: countries are poor because of the interest they pay on an outstanding debt, but they cannot improve their economic performance without taking on more debt. To make matters worse, poor countries must earn foreign exchange in hard currencies to pay off their debt. They need to produce commodities that have a world market, such as coffee, but the more coffee that is produced, the lower the price. So poor countries actually earn less and less hard currency to pay the interest on their loans. While developed countries, including Australia, benefit from low commodity prices, subsistence farming is replaced by cash crops, which are subject to fluctuating markets. Drought, conflict and disease can mean that whole regions are left without money to buy food, and starvation is suffered in areas that were once self-sufficient in food production. Poor countries need to refinance loans, taking on new loans to service old ones. On top of this are the requirements of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for structural adjustment. These requirements have meant that poor countries spend less on education and health care, so they do not develop the capacity to improve their output. The ideology of the World Bank and the IMF would rival the worse excesses of Stalinist Russia and Mao’s China in its impact on world populations. However, there have been winners. Countries providing loans have been able to impose conditions where the funds can only be used for purchases from the lending nation. According to one source, over 80 per cent of foreign aid from the United States returns directly through its exports. The effect of this redistribution of the world’s income was seen in the 1980s, when real wages declined by 60 per cent in Mexico, by 50 per cent in Argentina and by 70 per cent in Peru. As we have seen in country after country, they strip their resources to repay debts, but where are they now? Deeper and deeper in debt. If we look for the causes of the problem, it is obvious that one basic economic rule has been broken. As anyone in business will tell you, it is okay to borrow as long as the money borrowed gives you a greater return than the interest paid on it, so the borrowed money should only be used on productive investments. However, countries have used borrowings for other purposes. While many of these should have been seen to be wasteful, many were taken on the advice of the World Bank. While the World Bank was happy to give that advice, or even insist that its advice be taken, when things went wrong it was the people of the indebted country that were left with the debt. The World Bank people were able to pack up their briefcases and set off to another country to wreak havoc on another unsuspecting population. There were, of course, corrupt leaders who were able to appropriate large amounts of loan funds for themselves and send them to foreign banks. Those same funds could then be used by the banks to make further loans to poor countries. As long as a bank can make money on the transaction, there is no morality involved. Many countries have spent huge sums on arms Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12627 supplies-weapons to control their own populations and weapons purchased from rich, developed nations. When I look at this $350 million item in this bill, I see an amount that, were it to be spent here in Australia, could meet the needs of many worthy local programs. When compared to the $2.5 trillion in poor country debt, it is a drop in the ocean. That does not mean that we should stand back and say that we cannot help much so we should not help at all. On my desk calender the other day-and I love reading my desk calender-was a saying from Mother Teresa that said, ‘If you can’t feed a hundred people, feed just one.’ That is the least we should do, but I cannot help but ask if Australia should not be doing more. The problems of poor country indebtedness affect the greater part of the African continent, South America and, importantly for us, southern Asia. Our security is dependent on stability in our region, and that stability will come to depend on the economic conditions of our near neighbours. Being able to feed just one may not be good enough. This $350 million put towards the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative will make a difference to some individuals. But as far as solving the enormous problem of Third World debt, it is a matter of too little, too late. Beyond the question of poor country debt, we should not overlook the status of the world’s biggest debtor nation: the United States. We should not forget the business principle that I mentioned earlier-that debt should be put to productive uses-and we should not forget that our debt may bring about our own difficulties at some future time. The greatest loss to poor indebted countries is their loss of control over their own destiny. Governments are forced to cut spending on health care and on education. They lose the ability to do what this bill is asking-to spend an extra $1.4 billion on some budget extras. Unless we see a way to deal with debt in both rich and poor countries, and the international monetary system that provides the backing for it, we may well find ourselves in the position of the mum I mentioned at the beginning of my speech-at the supermarket being told by the checkout operator to take out some of the luxuries like health care and education. But isn’t that happening already? 2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. With the budget approaching, the Minister for Finance and Administration announced that the starting point bottom line has been downgraded, although he was not specific about how far it has deteriorated. According to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the starting point fiscal balance was a $3.4 billion surplus, the underlying cash balance was a $4.9 billion surplus and the headline cash balance was $4 billion. It is now some years since Australians have received a tax cut. According to Access Economics, bracket creep in the coming financial year, 2003-04, will produce an extra $3.5 billion of revenue. Had that $3.5 billion of bracket creep been returned to taxpayers, the starting point for this year’s budget would have been a $100 million fiscal deficit, a $1.4 billion underlying cash surplus and a $500 million headline cash surplus. That is not a robust fiscal situation given that the economy has now been growing almost continuously since September 1991-for more than 11 years. The causes of the deterioration in the budget starting point to which Senator Minchin referred are probably the slowing domestic economy and the cost of the war with Iraq. The government is being fairly circumspect about the cost of the war. All the Treasurer will say publicly is that it will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. I would be surprised if it were far short of $1 billion, even if the war is a short one. The first place that taxpayers are seeing this is at the petrol pump. Today they are paying, in all states except Queensland, over $1 a litre. In South Australia, $1.05 is not un-",136,Representatives Main Committee
128,Mr Cox (Kingston) (6.44 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 200212628 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 common. This is the result of two things: the spike in world oil prices as a result of the threat of war in the Middle East and the strike affecting the Venezuelan oil industry, and the extra GST paid as petrol prices climb. The government reaps a considerable financial benefit from petroleum resource rent tax on domestic oil production when oil prices climb. It is hard to be too precise about this since we cannot predict how much higher the world oil price will climb, but we can predict that it will climb. Labor has estimated that this financial year GST revenues will be up by about $220 million and PRRT revenues by $380 million to $410 million. Representatives of the oil majors tell me that the extra PRRT bill this year has already reached more than $200 million. At the moment we have no way of knowing how long the war will last and what will be the effect of its aftermath on oil prices. It is unlikely that the additional revenue from taxes on petrol will be sufficient to cover the cost of the war. If the war goes on for long, it is very unlikely to cover it. The additional GST revenue is, of course, earmarked for the states, so it will reduce the amount of budget balancing assistance required this year and next financial year under the Commonwealth’s agreements with the states on the GST. The total amount of budget balancing assistance that was expected to be required this financial year was $1,690 million and a further $1,061 million in 2003-04. All the additional revenue, both GST and PRRT, resulting from the oil price spike will therefore go to the Commonwealth. That is of little comfort to Australian motorists who have to pay it but it is of substantial benefit to the Treasurer as he struggles to balance his budget. There is another factor that I expect will assist him to keep the budget in balance. During Australia’s involvement in East Timor there was a fall-off in normal defence activity, particularly major training exercises, as resources were diverted to the deployment. The result was that normal defence expenditure was substantially reduced. With Australia now committed to its largest deployment since Vietnam, I would expect that to be the same this financial year and probably next financial year. While it is difficult to forecast the value of normal defence activity that will now not take place, this effect should reduce the pressure on the budget starting point and subsequent budget balance. Of more significance to the budget is how the world economy will fare over the next 12 months and how accurately Treasury can forecast it. The midyear review downgraded the growth forecast from 3¾ per cent to three per cent with a relatively strong bounce back to four per cent in 2003-04. In current international conditions, the question is whether that four per cent will be achieved. The other issue bearing heavily on the budget outlook is the deferral of the sale of the Commonwealth’s majority interest in Telstra. The government has pretended that the falling stock price precipitated this decision because the Commonwealth would not be able to get fair value for its interest in current market conditions. I suspect that the low stock price was fortuitous in this regard and allowed the government to not have to confront the National Party on the issue, despite the effort it had gone to in running the Estens inquiry last year. The Prime Minister, despite his protestations that he is always ready to take unpopular decisions, may also have taken into account the likely proximity of the sale timetable to possible federal election dates and decided that would create an uncomfortable conjunction of events. The deferral also provided the Treasurer with a convenient excuse to escape a rather foolish course of action that he had previously been boasting about: his plan to reduce the value of Commonwealth government securities on issue to zero to close the bond market. He had isTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12629 sued a discussion paper on the subject with a challenge to the bond market to justify, if it could, its continued existence. There was some debate about this in the opinion columns of some major daily newspapers and some circulation of responses to the discussion paper, but the whole thing came to a head at a seminar at ANU a few weeks ago. The discussion paper got an icy reception from academics, commentators, ex-senior bureaucrats and the financial markets. The arguments put by most of this learned group against closing the bond market were many. The most important of these was that without a risk-free benchmark the finance markets would be less efficient and the cost of capital in Australia would be higher. Those bond market traders who were present made the quite reasonable point that the market did not just have to be maintained; it had to be kept liquid to ensure price discovery and so that participants could trade freely. Another substantial point was that however good the Treasurer thinks he is-and some of us do not think he understands what he is doing or he would not have proposed getting rid of the bond market in the first place-he has not brought an end to the economic cycle. A future recession or war, a very relevant point on this day of all days, could well force the Australian government to borrow money. It was widely felt that the Treasurer’s primary motivation for the ‘get rid of the Bond market’ plan was so that he could make a political point that he had paid off all previous governments’ debts. There was, in fact, general criticism of the government’s ‘all debt is bad’ mantra. Some particularly distinguished seminar participants even had the temerity to suggest that public debt is a useful and equitable way of sharing the cost of long-lived public assets across the generations. One of the principals of Access Economics, who had apparently spent 17 years in Treasury-Chessell, I think, was his name-regaled the seminar with a fairytale about the outrageous terms on which the Howard government had sold just about every public building except Kirribilli, the Lodge and Parliament House. The story was that the good fairy at the department of finance went to the property market and offered it three wishes if it would buy the buildings. The property market asked for very long leases with guaranteed tenancies, an extremely generous price escalation clause and another three wishes. The good fairy at the department of finance granted these three wishes, the subsequent three wishes and the three wishes after that. Despite the fact that I am the person who originally told the Auditor-General that he should look at this financial disaster, I am not going to steal all of Chessell’s fairytale. I just want to point out that he missed one of the wishes that the department of finance granted: a lavish refurbishment of its own building before it was sold. The policy point of Chessell’s fairytale was that the reason the good fairy at the finance department had granted all the property market’s wishes was that it would get the best price for the assets and be able to pay off more government debt. What the good fairy did not seem to care about was that the taxpayer was stuck with paying the huge escalation clauses on the leases, which made the Commonwealth worse off in the long run. This is an appropriate place to make the point that the Howard government has performed a pea and thimble trick with debt reduction. It will, by the end of this financial year, have reduced net government debt by some $61.7 billion, but it has sold $55.4 billion of assets to do so. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing sales of non-financial assets and financial assets in each year the government has been in office together with the reduction in net debt it has achieved in each of those years. Leave granted. 12630 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 The table read as follows: 30th June 1996 to 30th June 2003 SALE OF NON-FINANCIAL SALE OF FINANCIAL TOTAL ASSET NET GOVERNMENT 98/99 1,351 7,027 8,378 -12,533 99/00 2,223 9,385 11,608 -17,296 2000/01 2,489 6,228 8,717 -13,848 2001/02 853 -626 227 -3,690 2002/03 1,425 -404 1,021 -1,452 Source: ABS Government Financial Estaimates 199/2000 and 2000/01 (Cat 5501.0) Budget Paper No. 1 2002/03 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2002-03 largely been an exercise in shifting assets around on its balance sheet to make it look like it is fiscally responsible. It has been an exchange of assets for debt rather than any serious attempt to control its own expenditure. Some of the participants at the bond market seminar canvassed the options for maintaining a liquid bond market by putting any cash from the sale of Telstra or any future budget surpluses into an asset fund. The most obvious possibility mentioned was a fund to cover the Commonwealth’s roughly $80 billion in unfunded superannuation liabilities, which it carries on behalf of its own current and former employees. As a superannuation fund run by trustees, the assets would be out of the reach of politicians who might dissipate them capriciously. The seminar eventually got to the point of discussing how the Treasurer could extricate himself from his own terrible idea. Reports of the seminar must have so shocked him that he made a brief appearance on talkback radio and announced to an obviously breathless audience-who would not ask him any difficult technical questions-that, because of the deferral of the Telstra sale, closing the bond market was no longer an issue. A few days later an article appeared in the Australian Financial Review quoting the Treasurer saying that he would keep the bond market liquid, with no explanation of how.

I am pleased that the Treasurer has taken this decision. I hope he has not been encouraged to do so because he is about to move the budget into deficit. The big question about the up-coming budget is whether the Treasurer is going to bite the bullet and exercise some real financial control. We see each year an outlook for prospective surpluses that look quite healthy, but every year as we approach those surpluses we find that they have been spent. At the end of last year, on 2 December, the Prime Minister was reported in the Australian Financial Review saying: When you have a low level of government debt and you have a surplus, there comes a time when people might want some of the surplus returned by way of general or specific tax cuts. I’m not making any promises in any particular areas, I’m just stating the principle that if you’ve got a bit left over the automatic assumption shouldn’t be, ‘Oh whacko, we’ll spend it.’ The assumption rather should be that we should find some capacity to give it back to the people who own it, and that’s the taxpayer. It is going to be a very interesting budget this year. Access Economics calculations of fiscal drag or bracket creep were $2.3 billion in the financial year we are now in, $3.5 million in the financial year we are about to go into, $5 billion in 2004-05 and $6.2 billion in 2005-06. This government has only provided one set of tax cuts, and they were tax cuts that accompanied the introduction of the GST. The previous government provided tax cuts on $7 billion, more than returning to taxpayers the proceeds of bracket creep. We have a government now that is running a budget that flies very close to the fiscal wind. The Treasurer has abandoned using the fiscal balance which was originally his preferred measure of the budget bottom line and has gone to the underlying cash balance. If you take out Access Economics estimates of bracket creep, you will find that the budget this year would be in deficit by about $200 million, that the prospective starting point before the Iraq war is taken into account would be about a $1.4 billion surplus and that the prospective deficits in the out years would be about $800 million. We are looking at a situation where the government is going to have to get disciplined if it is to preserve enough of the surplus to give anybody any kind of a meaningful tax cut. The opposition has started taking a lot of decisions on government measures in tax bills, with a mind to preserving the budget surplus so that the government can in fact continue to have the opportunity to provide tax cuts. This budget is going to require a very disciplined approach by the Treasurer-a disciplined approach that he has not exhibited since his first budget in 1996. Every year since then, he has made policy decisions that have added to outlays. On each occasion in an election year, he has made policy decisions that, over the forward estimates period, would reduce the budget bottom line by $20 billion. In the non-election calendar years apart from 1996, there have been significant policy decisions which have had a detrimental effect on the budget bottom line. If he wants to preserve the possibility of providing tax cuts, he is going to have to get back to some serious fiscal discipline. I do not believe that he will, but we will be watching him very closely and we will be encouraging him to put some priority on making sure that there is tax relief available for ordinary taxpayers in Australia, because they certainly need it. bate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. It is a broad-ranging debate, and I am going to address my remarks particularly to education and",142,Representatives Main Committee
130,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (7.00 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the de12632 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 training in the electorate of McMillan. Just before I do that, I want to place on the record my admiration for Federation Health. Federation Health is a not-for-profit health insurance fund which started in the Latrobe Valley, operates primarily in the Latrobe Valley and across the Gippsland region and has expanded to provide services in private health insurance right across Victoria and Australia. It was originally formed as a working man’s health insurance society and has a very proud history of helping people in difficult circumstances and of helping people to come together and cooperate to form an organisation. My mum and dad were both long-time members of the precursor body, the Yallourn Medical and Hospital Society, and it is a matter of public record that I am a member of Federation Health and continue that long family association with this great, local, not-for-profit insurance fund. As a member of Federation Health, I got a letter in the mail a week or so ago in relation to a scheme they had put in place to assist those people who either contributed to fighting the bushfires in East Gippsland or were affected by the fires in East Gippsland. They described the fighting of the bushfires in East Gippsland as ‘a great example of genuine, unselfish mateship’, and it certainly was that. They put in place a bushfire assistance package for members of Federation Health who were direct victims of the bushfires or who volunteered their services to assist communities affected by these bushfires. This is a great example of why the not-for-profit sector should be encouraged to take a bigger role in private health insurance; this is exactly the type of activity you do not see from the big private health insurance funds. They are not linked into local communities in the same way that Federation Health are and they do not have the same regard for what happens to communities when they are affected by a natural disaster-in this case bushfires. Well done to Federation Health. In particular, I want to pay tribute to Stewart Cramer, the Chief Executive of Federation Health. I have known Stewart for many years now and have a great personal regard for him as a man of integrity, as a man who conducts himself always with a great deal of dignity and as a man who is always interested in helping our local community. Well done to Federation Health. They should be proud of what they have done here. As the local member for the district in which most of the Federation Health members live, I am very proud to have such a community minded private health insurance fund in my electorate. I will now bring my remarks around to education and training, which is an issue of critical importance in my electorate. You have some familiarity with my electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a fellow Victorian. You would know that the people of Gippsland have gone through a difficult period which has involved a lot of restructuring and a lot of reorientation of a number of our industries, which has meant that a lot of people have lost their jobs. For a lot of communities that have traditionally been able to depend on one particular area of industry for their employment, those jobs just are not there any more. We understood that the way to deal with some of these structural issues in terms of our local economy was for us to focus on education and training for our population. The people of the Gippsland region, whether they were in West Gippsland, the Latrobe Valley or South Gippsland, got behind this idea and did not just carp, whinge and talk about the old days and pretend that we could go back to those days if we just tried hard enough. People understood that we needed to focus on education and training and that this was our future. To that end, I brought the entire shadow cabinet to Monash University’s Gippsland campus in Churchill, where we met with a great proportion of the senior academic and administrative staff from that campus. It was a very positive day and there was a great exchange of ideas. We Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12633 heard first-hand from the people at Monash University, Gippsland, of the importance of the work that they are doing. We were also given a lot of examples of the effect of that work that they are doing in our community. I know that Simon Crean, the Leader of the Opposition, and Jenny Macklin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, were both very impressed by what they saw at Monash University’s Gippsland campus. The reason that I brought them to the Gippsland campus of Monash University-I said this at the time, and I do not mind repeating it in this place-is that our university is not just a part of our future; it is nearly all of our future in the Gippsland region. It is not just the university courses which are on offer; it is the people who are employed in the university who can be a part of the economic and cultural renewal of the entire region. Regions are at their best when there are new people coming in. There is no doubt about that at all. Post World War II, when we had a flood of new migrants come into the Latrobe Valley, the district changed forever. Places like Pakenham, in the western part of my electorate, are at their best right now. Pakenham is going through an economic and cultural renewal because of all of the new people coming in. All of these new people, all of these new ideas and new ways of doing things, and having to set your community up in a different way to service that, places stresses on communities, but it is always an exciting time. It is always a time of dynamism and new ideas. Our university can be a real centre for dynamism. It can be a real centre for new ideas. It can be a real centre for the new people which drive both of those things. Because of the nature of university staff, you tend to have a lot of people who come to your region and stay there for a little while and then maybe move on. Some of your people might move to another campus and then come back. The moving around of people is an important part of regions not just taking the view that we need to keep everyone in our region but taking a bigger, more realistic view about bringing people into our region and not being afraid when people leave our region, hoping that they will come back when they are ready to and keeping the door open for people to do that. It is with a great deal of regret that I advise the parliament of a decision made by Monash University-not by its Gippsland campus but by the Monash University Council, administered from the Clayton campus-to close the Gippsland School of Engineering. The Gippsland School of Engineering has a long and proud history. It has trained a lot of first class engineers who went on to hold very senior positions, not just in Victoria but right across Australia and overseas. These people have played a key role in engineering, and it is a real tribute to the professionalism of the education they got when they were at the Gippsland School of Engineering that they were able to rise to the senior positions that they hold in engineering in Australia. There has been a lot of debate in the Latrobe Valley community in particular, and in the Gippsland community more generally, about what the closure of the Gippsland School of Engineering means. I vigorously opposed the decision and campaigned against it. I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, on this issue, and he also felt strongly about this issue as someone who is very familiar with the Gippsland region. In the days when he was a minister in the Keating government and subsequently in all the roles he held in opposition, leading to his becoming the Leader of the Opposition, he was always actively involved with the Gippsland community. He wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, who at that time was Professor Peter Darvall, and made plain the federal opposition’s position on this. 12634 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 The position is simple: we disagree with it. We do not think that it is a decision which can lead to a good outcome for Monash University or for the people of Gippsland. Subsequently, following a public meeting and a lot of public outcry about this, Monash University Council advised us all that they were going to review the decision they had made. I wrote to the people organising the review and detailed my opposition to the proposed closure of the Gippsland School of Engineering at the Churchill campus. I pointed out in very plain terms how bitterly disappointed I was with the decision that was made and the way in which they had gone about making it. Those in the Gippsland region felt that it was a slap in our face, that we had given a lot to Monash University and that in return we were being treated with contempt by the Monash University administration. I understand that that review panel is still doing its work. I wish to use the forum of the federal parliament to repeat the message I gave to Monash University at the public meeting about this that was organised at Monash University and, subsequently, when I appeared personally before the review panel: shutting the Gippsland School of Engineering would be a massive mistake by Monash University. Any possible small financial benefit they might get from doing it would be massively outweighed by the enormous loss of community support that would follow. A serious risk to Monash University’s ongoing funding is the likely result of the university going down this path of reducing and withdrawing services from the Gippsland campus. Let me make it plain: if Monash University thinks that I am going to support a funding model in which it gets all the money from the federal government directly at its central campus at Clayton and is then able to make, with complete autonomy, decisions which will affect the Gippsland campus detrimentally, it has another think coming. I will not support Monash University getting essentially a blank cheque from the federal government so that it can then decide what funding the Gippsland campus needs. If Monash University proves itself not to be trusted with deciding how much funding goes to the Gippsland campus to provide a decent range of university courses to the Gippsland community, I will not support it being allowed to get that funding directly and make the decision in a centralised way. Monash University needs to understand that this is a very serious matter. What is at risk here for the university is not just the Gippsland School of Engineering, from which they are hoping to save a few thousand dollars a year by closing, but the entire way in which it administers its campuses. I am just one voice, one person, in the opposition. But let me tell you, if Monash University closes the Gippsland School of Engineering, I will campaign and I will work as hard as I can to try and get the opposition to take another position. If Monash University proves itself not to be trusted to deliver proper university courses in partnership with, and in meeting the needs of, the local community then I will argue for another position. I will work to get a position which says that, where university campuses are linked to major universities not located in regions, we look at another model of delivering university services to people who live in regional Australia. That might mean a contracting model, where the federal government would then say, ‘Monash University, you have got a campus in Gippsland so we will pay you an amount of money to deliver the following range of courses to the Gippsland community.’ Monash University would not then have the autonomy to decide whatever they wanted for the Gippsland campus, but the federal government might have a direct role in contracting with Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12635 Monash University to provide those services. So Monash University should not be under any illusion about how big a deal this is to me and how big a deal this is to the Gippsland community. There have been a number of very good submissions made to the review panel-in particular, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union made an excellent submission which runs to some eight or nine pages. The submission talks about the importance of engineering to Gippsland and how critical having an engineering school is to our region, to our regional economy, and the implications it has for jobs if Monash University get their way and shut the Gippsland School of Engineering. There have been a number of other excellent submissions made to that review as well and there is not enough time allotted to this debate for me to deal with all of those today. It seems to me-and it seems to all of the Gippsland community-that the decision that Monash University has taken in relation to the Gippsland School of Engineering is incredibly short sighted. As a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that the state government has just gone through the brown coal tender process. We have got a lot of brown coal in the Latrobe Valley and it has been a big part of the development of the Latrobe Valley for more than 50 years. The brown coal tender process has seen a number of companies successfully tender to be given the rights to explore mining leases in and around the Latrobe Valley, with a view to substantial large development associated with the exploitation of that coal resource. These are very big projects. One project that I could think of would be in the order of between $6 billion and $8 billion. Another project-which the state and federal governments just contributed some money to-is the Latrobe magnesium project, which would run to nearly $1 billion. There are several other projects that are of that similar size and scale and would involve the employment of literally thousands of engineers in the Gippsland region. So what we need Monash University to do is not make short-sighted decisions, but to make decisions which are in the interests of not just Monash University but also of the Gippsland region. Imagine our having a number of these projects going on in the La Trobe Valley, with a demand for full-time engineers employed at good salaries in senior positions. We could with reasonable knowledge predict that we would need to employ several hundred of these people in maybe four, five, six or seven years time. We could sit down and work in partnership with Monash University and train a lot of those people in the La Trobe Valley. What a great boon for regional education that would be. This is an important issue to our community. It is about the relationship which we in the Gippsland region have with Monash University. We want that relationship to be a positive one, but we are not going to allow ourselves to be treated shabbily by Monash University. We will not take it. We will fight it, we will resist it, and we will do everything we can to make sure that local students are able to access engineering as an option when it comes to higher education in our district. I would urge Monash University to change their mind in relation to this, and I hope that the review panel comes to see that the decision that was made was the wrong one. Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (7.21 p.m.)-I rise to speak in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. Today we have been distracted by the events surrounding Iraq, and it is a little strange to speak about anything else. I will have a chance to speak about Iraq tomorrow, so tonight I will focus on matters much closer to 12636 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 home. I am talking about the welfare of families and individuals in Isaacs. I see us all as being under more and more pressure as the direct result of actions and inactions by this government. The pressure is coming from less money available to meet everyday costs and a decrease in the services that we expect from the government. This government is the highest taxing government on record. We have had one tax cut since Howard came to government, and that was when the GST was introduced. The benefit of that cut has now been more than wiped out, and we still have the GST. Real work opportunities are diminishing under this government. We hear constantly of full-time jobs being lost and replaced with part-time or casual jobs. This does nothing for the peace of mind and financial security of ordinary families in my electorate. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about a quarter of Australians who are in work have part-time or casual jobs and over 600,000 of these people would like full-time work. As a result of this, more and more families are going into debt just to survive. Household debt has doubled over the last seven years, with the average household now owing $82,000. Credit card debt has tripled. Then we add the dreaded family tax benefit debt to the gloomy picture. The family tax benefit system is a mess and must be addressed with some urgency. The mess is because of the inadequacy of the system to recognise how real people live. The result is a continuous and increasing burden on Centrelink clients and a reduction in the benefit the system is supposed to bring. The family tax benefits system is supposed to assist low-income families. However, the current system puts many hurdles in the way. This is something that I and most of us on this side of the House have been saying for quite some time, but it is now being said by the Ombudsman. When will this government take some notice and fix the system-or is it that they just do not care? The first hurdle is the madness of requiring a family to accurately estimate its income a year in advance and which member will earn it. Do the architects of this rule, or those who insist on it, understand that most families cannot know with any certainty what lies ahead of them? Families do not have a crystal ball. Circumstances change: people get promoted, work overtime, change jobs, lose jobs, find jobs, partners start working when a job comes along or the kids are at school, a partner loses his or her job or the family needs more money. As soon as a family’s income changes, so too does that family’s entitlement to family tax benefit. This is not unreasonable, but the rules of the system insist that these changes be backdated to the beginning of the financial year, and this is where the troubles start. We know that across Australia about one million families are not getting the correct payment. We know that 700,000 families ended up with a family tax benefit debt last year of an average of $850. At the other end of the scale, we know that about a quarter of a million families are being denied their top-up payment because for one reason or another they did not lodge their tax return on time. We have a situation where the government moves fast enough to recoup the overpayments but is not so forthcoming when it comes to paying out what it owes. We are not talking about pin money here; we are talking about families who are not high income earners. We are talking about families who need this money to provide shelter, food and education for their children and themselves. Let me give two examples of families in my electorate who have battled this system. These examples are from files of my constituents, but these stories are retold on a daily basis in other families. Maria-not her real name-had her first baby in December and worked up to her child’s birth. She did not apply for the FTB in that year because she had received a salary for six months. In the following July, Maria applied for the FTB on the basis that she would Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12637 not have any income in that financial year as she was not planning to go back to work. The following January, Maria was pregnant again and looking forward to her second child. Unfortunately, the family had meanwhile clocked up a debt on their credit card and that was worrying Maria. She decided to go back to work part time for a few months to get rid of the credit card debt before her baby was born. Maria found a job and immediately advised Centrelink of her change in expected income. Maria was told on the spot that she was in debt because of the retrospective of the FTB system. Maria was dismayed and upset. She was returning to work to pay off the credit card debt and was now in debt to Centrelink. When faced with this, the minister advises families to overestimate their income to avoid getting into debt with Centrelink. Another constituent of mine, Louise-again, not her real name-took that advice. Her family had incurred a Centrelink debt in the previous year and they were concerned about this happening again. Louise and her husband advised Centrelink of a new estimate of their income-an estimate above their real expectations. The crunch came when Louise went to buy medicines for their son and discovered that their new income had led to the loss of the health care card. Even when this family’s entitlement to the family tax benefit is adjusted at the end of the financial year, they will not recover the extra they have paid on their son’s medicines. A third family in my electorate of Isaacs discovered a variation of this problem. In July 2001, MrB became very sick and had to stop work. Up until that point the family had been relying on his income alone and MrsB was in receipt of FTB part B. Mr and MrsB went to Centrelink to see what assistance they could get in their changed circumstances. MrB was put on a disability pension and MrsB went on to a carer’s allowance. Mr and MrsB then set about adjusting to the big changes in their lives: the deteriorating health of MrB and the change in their financial circumstances. Some 10 months later, in May 2002, Centrelink wrote to the family stating that the payments they were receiving were based on an estimate of the family’s income of $33,000 for MrB and nil for Mrs B. MrsB rang Centrelink immediately. She was understandably mystified about how Centrelink could get this estimate so wrong given that the family’s income-that is, a disability pension and a carer’s allowance-is actually paid through Centrelink. Centrelink then advised MrsB that because she had been paid the family tax benefit part B since July 2001, and was not entitled to it because of her carer’s allowance, the family would have its income cut with the withdrawal of that payment. A few months later MrsB received a notice stating that the family owed Centrelink over $1,600-the overpayment of family tax benefit part B. Mr and MrsB are now facing a third cut in their income as their payments are reduced by the repayments of that overpayment. We are talking about a family that is struggling to exist with a disability pension and a carer’s allowance, with a sick father and husband needing constant medical care and who are struggling to meet all of the costs, both financial and emotional, that go with all of this. MrsB asks how Centrelink can get this so wrong. It is a very good question. We are not getting any good answers. My question is: how can we have a system that is so insensitive and inappropriate in how it looks after families and people in need of assistance? Not only does the system not work but it adds strains and tensions to the lives of its clients. We have a social security system that is supposed to assist those on low incomes, but it does not work. To add insult to injury, these families and others in the community are being asked to cope with a Medicare system that is 12638 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 creaking to a standstill. Again, all the signs are that the government just does not care about this. Some say that the government is not only allowing this to happen but is actually interested in the demise of Medicare. The Prime Minister is now on record as saying that as far as he is concerned, Medicare should only exist to provide health services to low-income people. A universal national health insurance is the key to good health in our community. It is something most families treasure, and for good reason. The fear of diminishing access to good and affordable care is an issue that is raised with me over and over again. The present government seems to be hell bent on reducing the present system to a safety net style of health care for those on low incomes, with the rest of Australians on their own. A universal health care system means that anyone can seek medical advice and treatment when they need it without having to worry about the health of their bank account. It is the reason we pay the Medicare levy-a progressive tax. This is a far fairer way of running a health system than what will quickly become a second-rate health care system for low-income earners with the rest of the population having to find and use whatever they can afford, regardless of their health needs. Casey Council, in my electorate, has recognised this as a primary concern for the people in Casey. The council wrote to the health minister late last year, and also to me, to make this point. The City of Casey has noted that it can take residents up to eight days to see a general practitioner and that some of the busier practices in Casey no longer take on new patients. The ratio of doctors to patients in Casey is one to 1,700, compared to a ratio of one to 600 in inner Melbourne. My constituent, Ms A, is a single mother with three children who has been sick with the flu for the last two weeks. She does not have the money to go to the doctor. She rang my office last week to beg me to do everything I can to make sure bulk-billing is maintained. MsA tells me that there is no doctor in Carrum Downs that bulk-bills. Her old doctor used to bulk-bill but does not anymore. MsA reports that the surgery seems to have the attitude that, if you cannot afford the $35 upfront, you can go elsewhere. MsA tells me this surgery will not let its patients pay the gap up front and return with the Medicare cheque later. It insists that its patients pay the full fee up front and claim the refund later. I must go on record as saying that I do not altogether blame the doctors’ practices for this practice. They have got to keep their businesses solvent. The real problem rests with the lack of support for bulk-billing and the lack of a reasonable level of rebates. It is clearly very difficult, if not impossible, for many people. Ms A’s experience is not an isolated case. This stresses the need for a good quality and accessible health system. The other troubling aspect of the decline of Medicare is the falling bulk-billing rates. Bulkbilling rates across Australia have nosedived, but the fall is not constant across the country. In Isaacs, the percentage of doctors’ visits that were bulk-billed has steadily declined from 85.4 per cent in the 12 months to September 2000 to 75.4 per cent in the 12 months to September 2002. If you look at the quarterly figures, the situation is even more alarming. The rate for the September 2002 quarter was just 70.2 per cent. Recent analysis of bulk-billing by the ALP has shown that the national average of around 70 per cent is actually propped up by Sydney, which has an average of around 86 per cent. The Prime Minister’s seat of Bennelong has enjoyed a steady bulk-billing rate in the mid-80s since 2000, with a relatively small drop of only one per cent since March 2000. That contrasts with my electorate and its experiences. The difficulties of finding a doctor in the outer suburbs and the alarming drop in the rate of bulkTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12639 billing are hurting families and those on low incomes. The government must take steps now to address these issues. Recent figures are showing two more trends that are alarming. The first is that the cost of seeing the local GP is increasing rapidly. The out-of-pocket expense of visiting the doctor has increased by 54 per cent in the seven years since the Howard government came to office. The second emerging trend is that the number of GP visits is actually declining, despite the fact that the population is growing. The combination of the falling number of GPs prepared to bulk-bill, the increasing out-of-pocket costs of visiting the doctor and the falling number of visits to the GP all tell me that things are very difficult and that the Medicare system is being killed off. The difficulty is that these people who are not visiting their GP are either not getting the treatment they need or opting instead to go to the local hospital’s emergency department. This has flow-on effects in an already crowded hospital system, which, once again, affects those who can least afford other options. Related to the problems in Medicare are the problems experienced by the elderly and frail in the community who need care. The funding for care provided to residents in their homes is a mess of piecemeal programs largely funded by the federal government. Whilst existing programs are piecemeal, they are also underfunded. Local governments in Isaacs tell me that they are having to turn away clients who are clearly eligible for Home and Community Care funding but are not a priority because someone else is in even more need of the service. Care for the frail aged is important, and so is taking steps to delay or even avoid the elderly needing care. Dandenong council is keen to implement a pilot program with the aim of demonstrating and measuring the improved quality of life and cost-benefits to the HACC program of health promotion initiatives for seniors. Such health promotion initiatives would include exercise, strength training, falls prevention and nutrition. As we are hearing continually, Australia’s population is ageing. Steps must be taken to cope with all the implications of this, and a healthier aged population is in everyone’s interests. Having said that, the immediate needs of the frail aged must also be met. This means addressing the problems of the HACC funding and the shortage of nursing home beds. There is an absolute shortage of beds in Australia, including in Isaacs, and there is emerging evidence that the distribution of low-care and high-care beds is not matching demand. Not only do we need more beds-and I mean more beds that actually exist, not just licences that are being held by someone who is planning or hoping to build-we need to address the issue of the demand for high-care beds moving faster than the demand for low-care beds. In the time. I have taken today, I have talked about several issues that are detrimental to the well-being of the people of Isaacs and Australia. I have talked about the mess of the family tax benefits system; I am not the only one to talk about this increasing problem. Many on this side of the House are doing the same, and I am sure the offices of those opposite are also fielding many calls every week from constituents unhappy about the system. The ombudsman has now issued a damning report which says that the system will continue to create problems for its clients. The disgrace is that none of this is actually new. These problems have been talked about ever since the system was brought in nearly three years ago. The government itself in a backhanded way recognised the problems in the lead-up to the last federal election by announcing a one-off amnesty to the tune of $1,000 per family for families in debt. The amnesty lasted only one year, and by then of course the election was over. 12640 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 I have talked about the alarming disintegration of Medicare. I have talked about the fact that it is getting harder and harder to find a doctor who bulk-bills. It is getting harder to find a doctor full stop if you live in outer Melbourne. Once you find a doctor, it is getting more and more expensive to visit that doctor. This is leading to a fall in the number of visits to local doctors, and it is not due to a sudden increase in our collective health. I have talked about the dismal situation our frail aged people are in as they try to get appropriate and timely care. I have talked about the need for people to have access to steady income through reliable, good, ongoing jobs and not to be forced to rely on part time or casual work. All of these issues are vital to the well-being of every one of us. None of these matters is getting the attention it deserves from this government. It is high time this government took a real and caring look around and started to deal with these matters in a civilised and proper manner and did so very quickly. Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, are all about the numbers and sums that together make up the budget of the Commonwealth government. However, today I want to move beyond the numbers and the arguments over surpluses and deficits to consider the human implications of this budget and, in particular, what the budget has meant for the unemployed and for those young Australians seeking to acquire employable skills. Economists sometimes forget that budgets are a means to an end, the purpose of which is to maximise living standards for all Australians. It is my strong belief that a budget must be about more than a dry, annual accountancy document that seeks to make sure the numbers on one side of the ledger are balanced by those on the other. It also must be about more than short-term attempts to bribe the electorate. Budgets are the primary tool by which governments can manage the economy, address social needs and remedy economic failures. They are an investment in the attainment of national priorities. As such, budgets must be about the pursuit of ideals, of lifting people out of poverty and despair and providing them with the opportunities and security to realise their full potential. This is the great dividing line, the great issue of principle, between Labor and the current Howard government. Labor believes that government has a responsibility to invest in individuals as well as the communities in which they live and work. The coalition believes that individuals prosper only when government leaves them to fend for themselves. One of the groups most marginalised by this government’s ideology is the unemployed. In seven years, what have the unemployed got from this government? They have a privatised employment service that recycles them through endless programs with little chance of meaningful employment at the end; they have mutual obligation programs that are more about demonising the jobless than providing them with employable skills; and they have a traineeship and apprenticeship system that is being increasingly exploited by employers as a source of cheap labour rather than as an opportunity to skill-up our work force and improve the productivity of the Australian economy. As the shadow minister for employment services and training, I am disappointed that we as a nation still waste too much of the talent of too many of our people. Unemployment is, without question, still one of the greatest policy challenges we face. Unemployment is a scandal of wasted potential. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians. It damages the social fabric and has profound negative consequences for social cohe-",143,Representatives Main Committee
131,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (7.37 P.m.),"The bills currently before us, AppropriationTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12641 sion. As has been seen in other countries, if it is ignored and neglected, left to a fate to be decided solely by market forces, unemployment creates a permanent underclass. Today, 609,700 of our fellow citizens are without a job. On top of this official figure, more than 700,000 Australians currently work part time and want more hours. A further 1.16 million, who are counted by the ABS as not in the labour force, would still like to have a job. Altogether, nearly 2½ million Australians are not getting the financial and social stability that comes with having enough work. Unemployment amongst our Indigenous communities is currently running at six times the national average. More than 850,000 children-17 per cent of all dependent children-now live in households where neither parent has a job. It is also becoming increasingly evident that a growing section of our community is becoming entrenched in long-term joblessness. The latest data released by the Department of Family and Community Services shows that 394,499 people have been on unemployment benefits for more than 12 months, which is a higher figure than when this government was first elected, despite a decade of economic growth. As well as growing welfare dependency, unemployment is becoming increasingly ghettoised-that is, it is concentrated in a small number of regions or neighbourhoods. While nationally unemployment has been ebbing lower, communities in areas such as Wide Bay in Queensland, the Tweed and Illawarra in New South Wales, outer western Melbourne, and many Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and Western Australia are enduring an unemployment rate of well over 10 per cent. However, the plight of the unemployed and the continuing rise in long-term joblessness should come as no surprise to any member of this parliament. It is no coincidence that this deteriorating situation coincided with the Howard government’s decision to cut funding to labour market programs by 50 per cent, or $1 billion annually. As part of its ideological crusade, the government scrapped much of the assistance put in place by the previous Labor government’s Working Nation program, irrespective of how effective that assistance was proving to be. We have a government that, on the one hand, complains about a growing culture of welfare dependency while, on the other hand, it savages the very programs that would assist the unemployed to move off welfare and return to the economic and social life of our community. We have a government that specialises in vilifying the victims of economic change, labelling them as dole bludgers, job snobs and cruisers. As well as slashing funding for labour market programs, the Howard government has privatised the delivery of employment services. The Job Network, established in 1997 without parliamentary debate or community consultation, is now the government’s flagship assistance program for the unemployed. The Job Network replaced programs delivering specific services with a much more open-ended funding regime centred on employment outcomes. Within the Job Network, intensive assistance-soon to be repackaged as ‘customised assistance’-is the highest level of assistance available and is targeted toward those with the greatest barriers to employment. Ministers Brough and Abbott regularly boast about how much money the Job Network is saving the government. In response, the following point has to be made: both ministers are correct, but this is a boast that has had a human cost as well as a long-term economic cost. Under the Keating Labor government, funding for employment assistance represented 0.67 per cent of GDP. That figure under the Howard government has declined massively to just 0.39 per cent of GDP. On an international comparison, Australia invests 43 per cent less than the OECD average on help for the unemployed. The budget currently before us continues that 12642 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 legacy. Whilst the flexibility and emphasis on employment outcomes that underpin the Job Network have the potential to deliver better outcomes for the unemployed, fundamental flaws in the funding structure and inadequate levels of government support have greatly undermined the effectiveness of the system. It is not just the Labor Party voicing these concerns. In September last year, both the Productivity Commission and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations released detailed evaluations of the Job Network’s performance. Both assessments provided compelling evidence that the current funding model is seriously flawed. The department’s report found that participation in intensive assistance raised the employment prospects of the long term unemployed by a mere 0.6 per cent. As the report acknowledged, the overwhelming majority of job seekers who obtained jobs after participating in this intensive assistance would have got jobs anyway. On top of this, the Productivity Commission found that many job seekers received little or no assistance while apparently in the intensive assistance phase. This is popularly called ‘parking’ in the industry. The report also went on to say: …the Intensive Assistance program is neither intensive nor assistance to some disadvantaged job seekers. Separate research conducted by David Abello from the UNSW and Helen Macdonald from the Brotherhood of St Laurence that involved interviews and focus groups with providers and job seekers concluded: The evidence tends to refute the notion that competition improves service quality. Rather it seems to have exerted a downward pressure on service quality and outcomes. Despite having been a much-touted centrepiece of the Job Network’s design, job seeker choice appears to have played little part in driving standards. Given these findings, it should therefore come as little surprise that the employment outcomes being achieved by intensive assistance compare unfavourably to those that were being achieved under the most effective Working Nation programs such as JobStart. According to the most recent data produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, only 17 per cent of those who participated in intensive assistance found full time employment. In the case of the most disadvantaged job seekers, only one in 10 found full-time work upon completing intensive assistance. As a result of these poor outcomes, job seekers are being increasingly recycled through the Job Network. Information obtained by Labor through the Senate estimates committee process reveals that 49 per cent of people participating in intensive assistance had already been through the program previously, 23 per cent had been through the program at least twice before and five per cent had been through at least four times. Members should note these figures in particular as I recall Minister Brough telling parliament on 27 February 2001 that the Keating government: ... placed upon the Australian unemployed the greatest fraud of all-recycling the unemployed through unemployment programs, giving them false hope, but never delivering. Given the data now available on the Job Network, I would suggest that Minister Brough and his government are guilty of the very accusation that they levelled at the previous Labor government. Importantly, in its report the Productivity Commission considered the implications of the changes due to take effect from 1 July this year as part of ESC3. Specifically, the commission concluded: Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12643 The proposals for Customised Assistance under the Active Participation Model guarantees a much higher level of interaction with jobseekers ... However, there is no guarantee that individual jobseekers will get access to any Job Seeker Account funds or that the 3 day a week requirement need amount to genuinely significant assistance. Accordingly, some jobseekers with large barriers to employment may not get much direct assistance from the Job Network. The Productivity Commission paints a bleak outlook for the long-term unemployed. At the time that these reports were released, Minister Brough issued a press release stating: The Job Network is clearly delivering results. This is nothing short of an extraordinary analysis and highlights just how out of touch with reality this government has become. The two reports I have mentioned do not suggest that active labour market programs are pointless or a waste of money, but they do indicate that without adequate funding their effectiveness will continue to be greatly reduced. Inadequate funding has meant that those who did gain access to intensive assistance did not get the help that they needed. Only five per cent got any form of work experience and only 14 per cent received vocational training. The deficiency in the Job Network is obvious: not enough is being invested to improve job outcomes for disadvantaged job seekers, particularly those lacking relevant work experience in a mainstream job and/or relevant skills. I now wish to turn to another program that the government holds up as one of its greatest achievements: Work for the Dole. Since 1996 the government has spent close to half a billion dollars on this program, and it will spend $147 million in this budget. Despite this significant investment of taxpayers’ funds, every evaluation has consistently shown it to be a mediocre scheme at best. The latest data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reveals that 67.1 per cent of participants were still unemployed following completion of the program. According to research produced by ACOSS, amongst others, these results compare unfavourably with the programs it replaced. For example, the previous Labor government’s JobStart program for the long-term unemployed had a success rate of close to 60 per cent, even though it was assisting people who were far more disadvantaged than those currently participating in Work for the Dole. The reason for the mediocre results is that Work for the Dole offers limited employment experience, much of it in unskilled work, and little formal training. Further research recently undertaken by the UNSW found that participants in the program were stigmatised, making it actually harder for them to secure mainstream employment. The government made much of the ‘wastefulness’ of the previous Labor government’s labour market programs when it scrapped them in 1996. If it adopted the same hard-nosed approach now, it would immediately scrap Work for the Dole. As every member of this House knows, Work for the Dole was never designed to get people into jobs; it was designed as a political exercise. This very fact was confirmed when Minister Brough’s spokesman told the Daily Telegraph in December of last year that the program was not about training but about stopping the unemployed watching Oprah. Not only was this a further crude attempt to vilify and stereotype the unemployed, but such comments highlight the simplistic basis upon which the Howard government develops public policy. Labor do not condone those people who fail to take seriously their job finding responsibilities. Indeed, we introduced mutual obligation. Passive welfare can indeed be debilitating. It is about time, however, that the government fulfilled its re12644 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 sponsibilities as well. While the current government believes that simply keeping job seekers active will lead to future employment opportunities, Labor recognises that without relevant skills and recent experience in a mainstream workplace job seekers will continue to find it difficult convincing employers to take them on. Finally, I wish to turn to the government’s New Apprenticeships system. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, regularly boasts in the House that under his government the number of people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships has doubled. However, this expansion appears to have come at the expense of quality training outcomes, both for the individual as well as for the Australian economy. Job Watch, a community legal centre in Victoria, has provided evidence that employers are increasingly exploiting the New Apprenticeships scheme as a source of cheap labour rather than as an opportunity to skill up the unemployed. A special SBS investigation revealed the case involving fast food retailer Hungry Jacks. When the retailer opened a new outlet in Hornsby, New South Wales, every single one of its 50 new employees were employed as trainees. One wonders who was doing the training. Many of these were high school children simply looking for a little extra pocket money. Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases. Many employers, in particular those in low-skill industries, appear to be exploiting the scheme as a de facto wage subsidy program. According to the Australian Industry Group’s Heather Ridout, the growth in the New Apprenticeships scheme also disguises ‘an alarming fall in technical and engineering apprenticeships’. For example, engineering enrolments in New South Wales TAFE colleges alone are down 35 per cent over the past eight years. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has identified skills shortages across a range of industries, including child care, secondary school teaching, panel beating, metal fitting and metal fabrication. These skills shortages highlight a failure of government policy. Under this government, the nation’s training dollar is not being targeted towards addressing acute skills shortages in the economy or providing young Australians with the skills that will improve their long-term career prospects. Australia must raise the skill levels of its work force if it is to address skills bottlenecks and remain fully competitive in the international economy. This can only be achieved if government works cooperatively with industry to provide the vocational education and training experiences that will both equip individuals and reward employers. Instead of appropriately resourcing those collective institutions already in place-the industry training advisory boards-Minister Nelson has actually cut their funding and created his own ambiguous round table of stakeholders. A further indication of the scheme’s inadequacy is the consistently higher non-completion rate amongst trainees. Thirty-seven per cent of participants in the scheme do not complete their training course. On top of this drop-out figure, between 20 and 30 per cent of those undertaking traineeships are receiving inadequate training. It should therefore come as little surprise to members that skills growth as a contribution to productivity growth has dropped by 75 per cent in the last 10 years, from 28.6 per cent in the late eighties and early nineties to only 2.9 per cent in the late nineties. The Howard government fends off Labor’s concerns about quality by attacking Labor’s record. But what you will never hear from Minister Nelson is how it was the previous Labor government who, in the 1980s, took on the states and pushed them to put in place new indusTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12645 trial arrangements and legislation that enabled the traineeship system to be established in the first place. You will not hear the Howard government acknowledge that it was the Whitlam Labor government that provided the first Commonwealth financial support for apprenticeships back in 1973, when it established the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme. Prior to that time, the Liberals had been in office for 23 years and had done absolutely nothing to put such a scheme in place. It is surprising that the minister for education does not acknowledge Labor’s achievements, given he was an ALP supporter and member back then. Indeed, Minister Nelson was never more correct than when he told the Sydney Morning Herald in 1994: Labor policies are usually much better for people ... The minister was right then, and his statement rings true today. Unfortunately, he is now a member of the government that is destroying the good policy framework which was inherited in 1996. NAAS was a landmark for apprenticeships in Australia. It marked the beginning of what was to be continuous Commonwealth funding for apprenticeships and ensured for the first time that apprenticeships became a national priority. Unfortunately, you will never see such visionary public policy from this government. Under this government, the long-term unemployed have been abandoned to the ravages of the marketplace. The government’s current policy framework is failing to tackle entrenched joblessness. As I have previously mentioned, the number of Australians who are relying on long-term benefits and have been unemployed for more than 12 months is today higher than it was when this government first took office back in 1996. It is little wonder, then, that ACOSS has recently labelled the government’s approach to job creation a ‘policy quagmire’. A serious effort to tackle unemployment, to skill-up the Australian work force and to move us towards full employment requires substantial investment from government, but when you consider the alternative you realise that the cost of this investment is absolutely worth bearing. It is a price we have to pay to end child poverty, to restore social cohesion and to spread prosperity across all sections of Australian society. Instead of finding new and more draconian ways to breach the unemployed and generally make their lives a misery, the government should be making that positive investment now. Unfortunately, however, for seven years Australia has had a government that simply does not believe in investing in our greatest resource: our population. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (7.57 p.m.)-I always like to take the opportunity to speak on any appropriation bills that come before the House, for two reasons. Firstly, I think that the expenditure of Commonwealth money, public money, deserves to be scrutinised and, secondly, I believe that this government has priorities that are vastly different from those of the Australians it represents. Essentially, that is what the expenditure of public money is all about: it is expenditure for the priorities of the government of the day. It is a direct measure of the government’s intentions and the relative importance it places on various policies and components of the budget, and, consequently, it is a direct indication of the direction that the government wishes to take Australia in. After today’s events, we know the direction in which this government wants to take Australia; sadly, that is not where the populace wants to go. The two bills that are currently before the chamber, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-03 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-03, are significant not only in the indications they give us of 12646 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 government intentions but also in their scale. Combined, these two bills represent requests for appropriations of over $1,453 million. Firstly, I will look at Appropriation Bill (No. 3), in which the government is requesting the appropriation of $1,190,967,000. The expenditure of finance under Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes $406,357,000 for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I have tried to investigate what that is being spent on. If any of you deal with immigration matters like I do, you will know that it is certainly not being spent on staffing overseas posts, the staffing of which is currently cut down to ridiculous levels. I would be quite fascinated to know where all that money is going. Also in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) are the following amounts: $245,892,000 for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; $108,165,000 for the Department of Defence; and $94,690,000 for the Department of Health and Ageing. It is fairly interesting that the Department of Health and Ageing is getting the least out of the moneys that are being appropriated in this bill. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) requests $263,750,000 from consolidated revenue for the purposes of capital works and payments to the states and for other purposes. These are very significant bills and very significant sums of money. I plan to deal with a number of the individual appropriations during my contribution this evening. I also intend to put forward my view on alternatives and more appropriate priorities for Australia. One thing mentioned in the portfolio overview of the Department of Health and Ageing is the medical indemnity assurance programs. I have continued to take a real interest in the operation and regulatory framework of the insurance industry and have had a number of questions listed on the Notice Paper relating to the oversight of the provisions of professional indemnity insurance, and medical indemnity insurance, in particular. I believe that the operation and oversight of medical defence organisations have been a continuing story of neglect by this government, a neglect that has threatened to permanently close down portions of the medical profession through the inability of practitioners to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost. It is also prohibiting people from being able to get services from doctors in some areas, because they simply are not providing that service any more since they cannot take out medical indemnity. An article in the Financial Review of 18 February this year illustrates this point. The article, by Morgan Mellish, states: The federal government signalled yesterday it might modify its medical indemnity reforms after several doctors’ insurers claimed they would not survive under the new regulatory regime. Three of the remaining six doctors’ insurers are rebelling against the proposed changes, saying they could be forced out of business. The problems, which affect about 11,000 GPs and specialists, mainly in Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, could lead to a doctors’ crisis in those states. Treasury officials held urgent talks with the insurers yesterday after the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, which covers 90 per cent of that state’s doctors, claimed last week that it was on the brink of collapse. We have seen the collapse of several of these medical insurers. This is a dire situation caused by the neglectful oversight of the government and the continuation of a problem that at least in its crisis stages goes well back into last year. As I said earlier, I have two questions on notice from 16 May last year relating to medical indemnity insurance that remain unanswered by the Treasurer. The problem surrounding the oversight by APRA of medical insurance providers requires significant investigation, and I await the answer to my questions. Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12647 While hoping that the government finally acts in a way that will ensure that the vital services provided to our doctors continue, the government has recently introduced into the House legislation which has yet to be debated: the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. This legislation recognises that these medical indemnity groups were predominantly subscription based membership organisations and were not running as proper insurance organisations and that there have been some problems within the industry overall that have gone unchecked and unregulated. Now the government proposes to bring those organisations under the regulation of APRA and also proposes to introduce capital adequacy tests of $5 million. We are yet to see whether this will meet with the approval of the entire industry. As the article in the Financial Review indicated, there are grave concerns with it. But we need to have some sort of standard of regulation or we will continue to see the collapse of this industry, and if we have the collapse of this industry we will have the collapse of doctors, particularly in specialist areas. Having said that, I have grave concerns about APRA’s ability to oversee that role, and we are yet to see the outcome of the HIH royal commission and what it will have to say in respect of APRA’s role. APRA itself has been gravely underfunded and has been short-staffed for quite some time. I turn now to the issue of private health. Private health is a very big issue in my electorate of Chisholm. Some 65 per cent of my constituents have private health insurance. It is something that they are entitled to have. This government said in the lead-up to the 2001 election that the government’s policies would lead to reductions in premiums and that private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. But since the election in 2001, the government has increased premiums in excess of 14 per cent. This year’s increase of 7.4 per cent comes on top of last year’s average increase of 6.9 per cent. With regard to the CPI, in 2002 it was 2.9 per cent and in 2003 it is three per cent. That is a total of 5.9 per cent, but these insurance companies have raised premiums by 14 per cent. As a result, many families with private health insurance will pay an extra $150 to $250 this year and, together with last year’s increases and the decision by some funds to abandon discounts for regular and upfront payments, many Australian families will now be paying $300 to $500 more for their premium than they did before the election in 2001. That is despite this government’s promises that the introduction of the private health medical rebate would reduce the premiums. It has done no such thing. I put a question on notice last year to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I asked: When assessing requests by health funds for premium increases, does the Minister make it a requirement that, where premium increases are approved, the levels of coverage for the fund are maintained? I at least got an answer; it was a very informative answer. The answer was no. So when they go and approve substantial funding increases they do not ask for anything in return. They actually get nothing in return; we are not guaranteed provisions. I am personally having a fight with my private health insurance provider at the moment, because they have refused to pay a bill to a surgeon who has performed great works on my son’s hands. So it is a bit of a personal crisis, as well, at the moment and I am hoping it will be resolved very shortly. It is an issue that is out there and that is hurting many in our community. This comes on top of the government’s impost through the Medicare levy surcharge. I conducted one of my regular mobile offices on Saturday and I had at least two people come up to me on this very issue of the Medicare levy surcharge. Most people were coming up to talk 12648 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 about how they did not want war, but two people in particular came and saw me about the Medicare levy surcharge. One woman said her husband had recently had a pay rise and they were very happy in their household, but it was actually going to make them $3,000 worse off a year. Why? Because, of course, he went into the next level of taxation with bracket creep, but also they were hit by the Medicare levy surcharge. They have three children in high school and this year they have had to say to the school that they cannot meet their so-called voluntary contribution to the state system. They are terribly embarrassed by this and now they are exploring whether they should fork out for private health insurance to actually claw back this man’s pay rise. This is what people are facing day in, day out, and this government has promised that private health insurance will get cheaper. It has done no such thing. It is impossible, however, to discuss the expenditure of Commonwealth public money without putting that expenditure in context by looking at other government expenditures and programs and investigating the relative value of other funding proposals. One such proposal that I have brought to the House on numerous occasions is the provision of sufficient numbers of Commonwealth funded aged care beds in my electorate of Chisholm. The lack of aged care beds in the community I represent is a disgrace. I recently asked again a number of questions on notice to the Minister for Ageing, the member for Menzies, relating to provisions of aged care beds in my electorate and the surrounding electorates, and I got some very fascinating information back. Actually, this minister answers his questions on notice; I am very impressed. To my surprise and distress, the provision of these crucial aged care services appeared to be weighed heavily towards which party holds the electorate. Several Liberal seats-including Kooyong and Higgins, and even the minister’s own electorate of Menzieshad many more beds allocated than the electorate of Chisholm, despite Chisholm having a population of people over the age of 70 years that is greater than all the adjoining electorates. Mr Georgiou interjectingis 14,057. I currently have an operational shortfall of 239 beds. Kooyong has in excess of 593 beds. Higgins, which has an over-70s population of 12,957-fewer than Chisholm, againhas an additional 247 aged care beds. Needless to say, Kooyong and Higgins are held by Liberal members, one of them joining us in the chamber this evening. I thought it was very informative that my electorate of Chisholm, with the highest proportion of people over the age of 70, has the greatest shortfall. In Chisholm there are currently 1,115 operational aged care beds, both high and low care, and a further allocation of 192 beds; that is, a further 192 beds that the Commonwealth has funded but that are yet to be built. Acting on the assumption-and I accept that it is a flawed assumption-that every bed that is allocated becomes operational, this means there is still a shortfall base on the government’s own target of 47 beds. This is unacceptable. I have people, daily, in my office, who cannot get an aged care bed for their loved ones. Right now, in Chisholm, there is a shortfall of 239 beds, and that is on the government’s own conservative estimation of the actual need in the electorate. It is distressing for so many in my community that elderly people in need of the care provided in aged care facilities can only obtain this care if they move away from friends, family and the community of which they are a part. This is unfair and an unreasonable attack on the elderly and their families in Chisholm.",152,Representatives Main Committee
132,Ms Burke,"Chisholm does! The Chisholm population of over 70s is 15,048; KooyongTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12649 For the majority of people, putting a family member into a nursing home is already a very stressful and strained time. You do not want to then find that you are three bus rides away from that aged care facility. Sadly, two aged care facilities in my electorate have closed down, with no requirement that those beds stay within the zone in which they were provided. Funnily enough, several of those beds moved to the electorate of Menzies-the minister’s own electorate-and it is up in the air as to where several others should go. Not only is there a shortfall; the beds that were there have been moved away. People who put a loved one into an aged care nursing home are often aged themselves; they are either aged children or aged spouses. They do not need the extra burden of having to travel to visit those relatives. I maintain a long standing and genuine interest in the universities in my electorate of Chisholm. I attended one of them, Monash University. I am very proud to boast that there are two very large universities in my electorate, Monash University-one of Australia’s largestand the city campus of Deakin University. My concern for their operation stems from their importance not only as educational institutions but also as local employers. Monash University and Deakin University are two of the largest employers within my electorate. The university campuses in Chisholm have tens of thousands of students enrolled and cover a gamut of educational disciplines. Deakin University has for many years been recognised as one of the leading universities, through study of universities Australia wide. Monash is one of the big eight and has a phenomenal record in both academic and research senses. Unfortunately, these great institutions are not able to provide the services they wish to provide. The government has cut university funding to the order of $5 billion since it came to power, and this is having a detrimental impact upon those universities’ capacity to provide the level of education they desire to provide. There have been cuts to staff. At Monash University in the first year I was elected, there was a cut to the arts faculty of in excess of 70 people. In the next year, there was a cut to the science faculty of 80 people. Yet again, we are going through another round of what might be a compulsory reduction in staffing numbers at the same time as enrolments are increasing, particularly of overseas students. There has been an increase in the cost of higher education. People like my younger brother, who did all his university study through HECS, says he has a HECS bill amounting to the GDP of a Third World nation, and he probably does! He probably should have stayed at university for a shorter time! HECS is growing and students have suffered and are suffering. Academics are suffering. There is an increase in the amount of stress that staff are currently experiencing. There has also been a cut in research dollars. Fairness has been cut from the system. Since 1996, the Howard government has overseen a 22 per cent increase in average class sizes. During the past eight years, the number of teaching staff at our university has been in steady decline. There are now 2,136 fewer teachers than there were in 1996, despite a massive jump in the number of students, particularly overseas students. What you find at Monash University, in what is affectionately known as the ‘Ming Wing’-where unfortunately there was a very tragic occurrence last year when two students were shot and killed-are very large lecture theatres that are completely packed to the rafters and students literally sitting in the aisles on top of one another for what are meant to be tutorials. You cannot have a tutorial with a couple of hundred students and one poor tutor. It is ludicrous. In the short time since I was there as a student, the situation has declined dramatically. Because of a cut of more than $5 million in funding by the Howard government, cashstrapped universities are being forced to load up teachers with more and more students, which 12650 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 is causing a drastic increase in staff workloads and pressures and putting quality under severe pressure. We used to have pride in our educational system in Australia, and I think that is going backwards and that it is to our detriment. It will also backfire for this government, because overseas full fee paying students will ask: ‘Why come to Australian universities if I’m not going to be given the standard and quality of education that I could have been guaranteed previously?’ The other ridiculous thing the full fee paying situation has seen is numerous worthy applicants for places within universities being rejected. I had a student last year approach my office. The cut-off score for law at Monash was 98.7. She received 98.5 and she won the Monash law prize, but she did not get a place in Monash law. She was the last child of nine. She and her twin sister had gone to school on full scholarships; they were both very bright girls. But their parents-funnily enough, after raising nine kids-did not have a lot of money. If she had been able to find the full fees, she could have got into Monash law on a score of 91. It was obscene. The university would not budge, the HECS system would not budge and the university lost out on a brilliant student. She decided to go to Melbourne and do arts. I think that is a tragedy of this system and an indication of the funding crisis our universities are going through. IfI had more time, I would also be talking about the lack of money going into before and after school care within my electorate. We are having a great deal of problems with that. I would also be talking about the baby bonus, where money is being wasted hand over fist in a ridiculous system that is actually not assisting anybody in the work force with the decision to have a child and stay out of the work force. I was going to end by quoting from a rather interesting speech that Tony Abbot gave to the Young Liberals and their conference in AdelaideMs O’Byrne interjectingtained an interesting indictment on the government. The minister said: Until recently, business leaders were generally astounded to learn that comparatively poor people faced higher effective tax rates than they did. That is the situation that this government has put people into. They have actually made it almost impossible to move from welfare to work because, if you do, you are squashed all round-you lose your benefits and you are hit with a greater tax rate. Somehow, this is the government that taxes less and provides more. I think we need to get our priorities right in this country and have a government that genuinely cares about families and which, instead of just using that idea in rhetoric, actually demonstrates it through the delivery of better quality services for our community. I think they stand condemned by their actions. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (8.17 p.m.)-The opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 provides members of this House with a chance to consider the performance of the government-in this case, a government so obsessed with rushing into an as yet unnecessary war that it has dropped the ball completely on domestic matters. Accordingly, I was very pleased to be able to second the amendment proposed by the member for Fraser, particularly the issues raised in his second clause. We have finally heard something from the government about its plans for the health system, but only after it has allowed bulk-billing rates to drop to completely unacceptable levels. In my electorate of Bass, the percentage of unreferred consultations that are bulk-billed",160,Representatives Main Committee
133,Ms Burke,"I won’t, because I am going to run out of time. I thought this speech conTuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12651 has now dropped to below 50 per cent-it is just 49.8 per cent. In other words, people living in my electorate have less than a fifty-fifty chance of being bulk-billed. This makes an absolute mockery of the government’s claim that it supports a universal health system. The situation in reality is far worse than it appears on the surface. It is almost impossible to find a general practitioner in my electorate who is prepared to bulk-bill under the current arrangements offered by this government. In fact, it is becoming harder in Tasmania to find a GP who will bulk-bill than it is to find a Liberal member of the House of Representatives. This is perhaps no coincidence. This government seems not to care about insuring that the most basic of services are properly provided to every Australian regardless of where they live. I suspect that the Prime Minister in particular thinks it is not really all that badafter all, bulk-billing rates in his own electorate continue to sit snugly above 80 per cent. Perhaps the Minister for Health and Ageing does not get the true picture either. In her home territory in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, the rates are generally well above 70 per cent. The picture that is painted is one of stark contrast between reasonably well serviced populations in the big cities and the hopelessly underprovided communities of rural and regional Australia. This will undoubtedly end up being the most remembered legacy of this government: a country divided between those who have and those who have not. These social policies will drag this country back almost to the pre-Industrial Revolution days. The gap between rich and poor is steadily increasing whilst the government looks on, completely indifferent to the plight of ordinary Australians. As I said previously, it is virtually impossible in northern Tasmania to find a bulk-billing doctor-of course, that is if you are able to find a doctor at all. Take the case of a family who moved to Launceston from another part of Tasmania. They were faced immediately with two medical issues. Firstly, the husband became ill with a virus. He was unable to find a general practitioner who would see him and had to visit the local hospital where, after a 5½ hour wait he obtained a bit of relief. The children suffer from a particular condition and required a local doctor’s referral so that they could attend a local specialist school. The family inquired unsuccessfully at around six or seven local practices before contacting my electorate office in desperation. Some practices told them they were not taking new patients; others wanted the fee up-front. I was able to find them a doctor who would bulk-bill them, but even then only after the payment of a small initial fee and having to wait for four days. Families should not have to go through such a convoluted process to obtain basic medical services. You should not have to ring your local MP in order to find a doctor. This example raises a number of issues but, fundamentally, it comes down to two: the lack of doctors engaging in general practice, particularly in regional areas, and the unwillingness of doctors to bulk-bill. The Prime Minister says that the universality of Medicare provides only for the right to treatment in a public hospital and the right to recover the Medicare rebate for general attendance. But the very basis of the second element in the minds of most Australians, if not the Prime Minister, is that GPs will actually be willing to bulk-bill if requested to do so. In this House on 5 March, the Prime Minister quoted from a previous minister for health, Dr Blewett, in his attempt to portray that Australians have no right to have expectations about bulk-billing. He quoted Dr Blewett’s words as follows: Direct billing will be available to everyone, where the doctor agrees, so that the patient does not have to claim a refund for the cost of medical treatment. But this is a choice left to the doctors. 12652 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 That was a choice that was actually not all that hard for a doctor to make when the government provided an appropriate environment within which bulk-billing was a realistic social service for general practitioners to supply. This government does not provide such an environment. As the chief executive of GP North, a doctors’ organisation based in my electorate, has said, the low bulk-billing rate in Bass was the result of inadequate Medicare funding by the federal government. His words were: If the Government was prepared to adequately remunerate doctors through Medicare for providing a service, I dare say you would see a change. This is the reality coming home to roost. The bottom line has to be recognition that the cost of services is greater than Medicare provides. My staff and I have spoken to many GPs in my electorate and they say that they, unlike the big medical firms of Sydney and Melbourne, cannot run viable practices given the numbers of patients they treat under the current amounts they would receive if they chose to bulk-bill. Most of the medical practices in my electorate are mixed practices, and they see patients from all client groups. Until now, they have been happy to subsidise veteran patients under the gold card scheme by direct billing with no co-payment. Now a number of practices have advised their veteran patients that they will either have to pay the full amount and then recover the rebate or make a co-payment. The reason the doctors give is that they can no longer treat veterans for the fee they get from the government. And how does the government respond when its memorandum with the doctors expires? It does nothing-except, of course, to blackmail the doctors with a unilateral indefinite extension of the scheme with no increase in fees after three years. Yet the government remains happy to trumpet that the gold card is apparently alive and well. ‘Just go and find another doctor,’ it says. It says that to the veteran whose doctor has advised him that he will no longer direct bill. The reality in electorates like mine is that there is probably no other doctor willing to direct bill veteran patients-or anyone else, for that matter. It is a gradual process, but ultimately it all ends up going against the patient. It used to be the case that medical practices in my electorate bulk-billed just about everybody who requested it. Many of even those patients, such as the veterans and pensioners who could be bulk-billed, are making a co-payment. An increasing number have to pay the full bill to the doctor themselves and then later claim the rebate. An older couple contacted my electorate office recently. The husband has a disability, and the wife is his carer. Their doctor began requiring them to pay their bills in full and then to handle their own reimbursement. For this couple, and no doubt for many others, this is both a cash flow problem and a physical inconvenience. It is actually not easy for her to get out of the house to leave her husband alone to go around and make the claims and do all of those necessary things. They may also have to go without something else while the rebate is processed and sent to them. It is fine for the Prime Minister to pronounce his rhetoric that says, in effect, that bulkbilling really has nothing to do with Medicare. The Prime Minister says that this is a matter for patients and their doctors to reach agreement about, but that is not what Australians expect and it certainly is not what Australians deserve. The expectation of Australians is that the government will deliver an environment in which it is realistic for doctors to choose to offer bulk-billing to those of their patients who request it. Australians, like the family and the couple that I have already mentioned, should have access to bulk-billing wherever they live and Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12653 whether or not that concept just happens to fit into the Prime Minister’s own narrow definition of what might have been intended. We need more doctors practising in outer suburban, rural and regional Australia and we need a system which actually encourages them to bulk-bill when they are there. This government’s scheme to deal with the former has been a failure and it has done absolutely nothing to address the latter. I also want to draw the attention of the House to the in-progress negotiations on the General Agreement on Trades in Services, known by the acronym GATS. I can see that my colleague is quite delighted that we are going to be touching on that subject. Ms O’BYRNE-It is highly relevant to Australia’s future. Australia was a signature to the agreement from its inception in 1995. I am sure that I speak for the vast majority of Australians-although not my colleague the member for Rankin, I am sure-when I say that I actually knew very little about the agreement when we signed up to it, or of its possible effects on the Australian economy, jobs and service industries. For this reason I think it is important to explain a little of the background. I know that many citizens of this country listen in to or later read the proceedings of this House, and they will be quite surprised and very interested to hear more about this matter and its history. Basically, GATS provides a framework of rules, agreements and regulations which govern international trade in services and is an international treaty overseen by the World Trade Organisation, the WTO. As described in the discussion paper prepared by the Office of Trade Negotiations, under the GATS, WTO members can negotiate commitments to open specific service sectors to foreign competition and to afford foreign suppliers the same treatment as domestic suppliers. Members can also make commitments about the operation of their domestic regulation of services. But there are three very important riders: first of all, the nature and extent of these commitments is a matter of choice for the governments of signatory members; second, member governments can choose not to make commitments in a particular area; and, third, commitments can also be structured so as to discriminate between domestic and foreign suppliers. The current round of negotiations began in January 2000, with negotiation guidelines and procedures being adopted by the WTO services council in March 2001. Under these procedural guidelines, we are now reaching the very serious second stage. WTO ministers agreed that members should lodge initial requests on 30 June last year, with members expected to respond to initial requests with an opening offer by 31 March this year, just days away. It should be noted that an initial offer has no legal status and can in fact be withdrawn or altered at any time. It should also be noted that the members have no obligation to respond positively to any request and there is no requirement for reciprocity. In the Office of Trade Negotiations’ discussion paper, it is stated: In July 2002, the Minister for Trade ... undertook to consult widely in preparing Australia’s response to the requests received from other WTO Members. In responding to these requests, the Government will ensure that its ability to regulate and continue to support public services is maintained, in full accordance with the GATS Treaty. It is really important that Australia participates fully in world affairs, but it is equally importantly that when doing so the interests of Australians are fully considered and fully protected. I hope the minister is able to fulfil his undertaking to consult widely before Australia re-",162,Representatives Main Committee
134,Dr Emerson,"It is highly relevant.12654 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 sponds, and certainly before we make any final commitments-although I am a little dubious, seeing that most of the negotiations are apparently not allowed to be consulted upon because they are secret. The world’s economy, and consequently Australia’s own, has changed much in a very short space of time. We are told that four out of five Australian workers are now engaged in service industries. Out of a total of $31.1 billion in Australian services exports in 2001-02, nearly half went to Asia. Whilst Australia used to import more services than we exported, we moved into surplus following the Sydney Olympics. Trade in services is becoming more and more a prominent feature of our trade performance. And there are real pluses in Australia’s participation in the GATS because it can increase the options and certainty for our exporters in the sector. That is because once a selective commitment to open trade in a particular service is made it is binding. It cannot generally be revoked without penalty. On the other hand, a WTO member can exclude a sector from GATS commitments, whether entirely or partially, and it is also free to determine internally what services sectors will be reserved for state owned enterprises and whether such sectors should be opened to foreign competition. The opening gambits in the current round see Australia having made requests of 35 fellow members. These seek the removal of barriers which discriminate against Australian services exporters. In return, Australia has received requests from at least 22 WTO member countries seeking new commitments or extensions to our current schedule. The requests to Australia cover a wide range of the service industry, from professional services through to health, tourism and the environment and include two sectors which I would like to explore in more detail: first of all, postal and courier services and, second, transport of all types-maritime, air, road and rail. In relation to postal and courier services, Australia has no existing commitments. The pending requests to Australia do not, for the most part, seek full commitments without limitations for all postal services. This, it appears, is in recognition of the government monopoly on the supply of regular letters. However, we are asked to make full commitments in respect of courier services and others in relation to express delivery and postal services. Australia has existing commitments-although not comprehensive-on a broad range of transport services, but we have made no commitments in respect of rail and have made only partial road commitments. We have some key limitations on maritime transport commitments. The requests made to Australia this time around seem to be wide ranging and extensive. In the maritime area, requests are seeking non-discriminatory access to essential port services and to multimodal transport facilities and services. We are also asked to remove limitations on national treatment and market access. Full coverage is sought in respect of road transport, repair of road and rail transport equipment, and passenger and freight transport by rail. Returning to the issue of postal services, it is perhaps pertinent to have a look at the current dispute between Canada Post and US, a United States based private courier company. The essence of the case is that US is suing the Canadian government for $250 million in damages, claiming that the operations of Canada Post breach the free trade agreement between the countries. Amongst the specific claims by US is that Canada Post’s courier service is crosssubsidised by its access to the postal network and that the government provides benefits to Canada Post employees that are not available to others. This scenario would be, of course, a Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12655 possibility here if our domestic postal services were to become the subject of concessions under international free trade agreements. This is not the first time that deregulation of our postal industry and our postal services has been mooted. This country’s approach to postal services and regulation was, until the election of this government, one which balanced service with profit. As a result, we still possess a universal standard letter pick-up and delivery service across the country at a standard cost to the consumer wherever they might live. Unlike bulk-billing, this is an example of where all Australians are essentially treated in the same way wherever they live or work. We must not allow remaining universal services such as this to be put at risk. We have already seen the Howard government tinker with the possibility of radical deregulation of the postal industry. These moves would have greatly jeopardised Australia Post’s capacity to fulfil its community postal service obligations in a uniform manner and at the same cost to all Australians. Australians mobilised to prevent the government pursuing this course, but it is significant to note that, during the government’s little foray into deregulation, overseas postal companies were amongst those lobbying for it to proceed. As a signatory to GATS, Australia should respond responsibly to requests made of it, but above all we must protect the basic services provided to Australians. The jobs of Australian workers must also receive the highest consideration. Sadly, the CEPU, the union representing Australian postal workers, believes it has not been allowed to adequately put forward a case in defence of either. It appears that, in contravention of the minister’s undertaking to ‘consult widely’ in preparing Australia’s response, a lack of transparency and openness on the part of this government has prevailed. I would like to return to the implications of the GATS negotiations for the maritime services industry. Unfortunately, once again we do not have very much detail of where the government is choosing to go with this. We do not know what they are asking for, and the government does not see fit to release the documentation. There is a basic commitment to fully consult, but once again we sorely lack the detail. The DFAT paper that I referred to a number of times, and that was circulated by the Office of Trade Negotiations, refers to market access and national treatment limitations, including Australian flag requirements. Many members who have heard me speak in the past would know that I have raised on many occasions the desire of the government to damage Australia’s national flag. The government continually act in a way that undermines our industry and our jobs and that puts our coast at risk. They have made it quite clear that not only are they complacent about the option of foreign ships and foreign crews working on our coasts but they openly embrace it. Instead of saying, ‘Maybe we should go steadily and surely with this,’ they open their arms and say, ‘You with the dodgy ships, please come on in. We’ll be fine; don’t worry about that.’ AlthoughI am particularly concerned, I am not shocked that the government refuses to be very open in its consultations about what requests have been made of it, or that it would move towards the further deregulation of the Australian shipping industry and the further deregulation of our coast. I am very concerned that this secret negotiation will once more put our fleet, our jobs and our environment at substantial risk. There has been little effort to engage in public debate about how Australia might be proposing to respond, and there appears to have been 12656 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 a reluctance by the government to even permit one-on-one discussions. Its silence and its record speak for themselves. On this issue, we can only fear the worse. In the small amount of time remaining to me, there are so many other things that I would like to touch on, but I do want to raise one particular issue-that is, workplace relations. In my electorate, there is a meat works called Blue Ribbon. This abattoir has been in the media on a number of occasions over the last couple of years. It has had consistent management changes and a couple of investigations into management operations. At each of these steps, we have seen the workers being put through an absolutely dreadful process of not knowing what their future is, not knowing whether they will have a job and certainly not knowing whether they will get their entitlements. Once again, these workers are faced with exactly that. The company that has taken over management of this organisation now requires everybody to sign an individual contract which they are not yet allowed to see. If they do not sign that contract, their future is quite limited. It appears that the company says it can get away with this because these people are trainees; therefore, they are moving from a training contract to an employment contract, and the company has the right to offer them whatever it so chooses. The reality is that most of these people are on a traineeship, but most of them would be hard pushed to tell you whether they received any training. It appears that this organisation got a bit of a handout from the government in order to get some cheap staff. Now it has to pay the appropriate wages for the abattoir industry. The company does not seem prepared to pay them, so it is looking at some potentially very frightening agreements. I think if the agreement was above board and was able to be subject to scrutiny then the company would have no real concerns with putting it forward so that the workers could have a look and so that they could talk to organisations able to negotiate on their behalf. That is certainly not the process that has been gone through. I want to point that out, because this is only a small workplace. It is a big workplace in our town, but looking at the big scheme of things it is only a small workplace. These are workers who do not have the power to argue for themselves very strongly because this is a competitive area of the market in which to get jobs. This government has, once again, failed to provide any kind of industrial relations framework which provides the workers with any protection. I think we have a right to expect that this government, when it talks about more jobs and better pay and about fairer systems, will provide those things for our community. (Time expired) Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (8.37 p.m.)-The cognate debate on these bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, gives me an opportunity to make some observations on the government’s priorities in the expenditure of taxpayers’ money. In particular, in my own area and throughout Australia, we are very concerned about the collapse in bulk-billing that has occurred under the stewardship of this government. It does not really surprise me because in 1987 on the John Laws program and on the Alan Jones program the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister said-and I can remember the words quite well because at the time. I was working for the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke-‘Without punning too much, I will take a scalpel to Medicare.’ He also said that he would tear it right apart. He described Medicare as a disaster, and he said that he would get rid of bulk-billing. These are long-cherished goals of the current Prime Minister; of course, with those statements he lost the 1987 election. He became a little bit wiser and more cunning as Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12657 he got older and, as a consequence, ditched his overt plans to take a scalpel to Medicare, to tear it right apart, and replaced them with covert plans to dismantle Medicare by stealth. He is well under way in implementing his plan to dismantle Medicare by stealth. In fact, in my own electorate there has been a drop of 46,000 in the number of bulk-billed services just in the last two years. Logan Hospital is now being flooded with patients who ordinarily would be able to attend a GP. But because of the collapse in bulk-billing, they find that they cannot afford the up-front cost of going to a GP and, therefore, they are going to Logan Hospital’s outpatients instead, putting it under unbearable pressure. I could spend an inordinate amount of time going through the statistics but the best demonstration of the statistics would, in fact, be a visit to Logan Hospital to see how much pressure that hospital-in a low-income areais under as a result of the Prime Minister’s stated goal of taking a scalpel to Medicare and tearing it right apart. I contrast the unwillingness of this government to find any taxpayers’ money that it might allocate to addressing the problem of the collapse in bulk-billing with its willingness to find money to finance an attack on Iraq. Today is a very dark day. In anticipation of this day, along with other concerned citizens in our local area, I organised a peace rally in Logan City just a couple of weeks ago. A number of people were organised to speak-and I was one of thembut a number of other members of the community who had participated in our rally came forward and said that they would like an opportunity to say a few words about the war, which I had said at that time was virtually inevitable. One of those who came forward was a young lady who was a GP practising in Logan City. She made the very valid observation that it is amazing that this government can find money to fund an attack on Iraq but it cannot find money to address the collapse in bulk-billing and the doctor shortage in low-income areas. I wish to comment on the merits of the argument that the government has put forward that the expenditure of taxpayers’ money on an attack against Iraq is a worthy expenditure. That argument has no merit whatsoever-it is a completely unworthy cause. It is, amongst other things, a waste of taxpayers’ money; more fundamentally, it is a waste of human life. On this very black day in Australia’s history, we see that a tragedy is about to unfold. On the Labor side we oppose the war. When I am asked, ‘Why do you oppose the war?’ I say, ‘There is one very simple and compelling reason: it is wrong.’ The war against Iraq is wrong. It has a number of disastrous consequences, one of which is that it completely undermines the operation and authority of the United Nations. If this world is to have any chance of peace in the 21st century, it must rely on the authority of the United Nations. The United States, Great Britain and Australia-in the actions that President Bush has taken, along with Prime Minister Tony Blair, and as relayed to Prime Minister John Howard as an instruction which he dutifully fulfilled-in turning their backs on the United Nations are helping to destroy it and are helping to destroy any prospect of peace in the world in the 21st century. The United Nations is our only hope for world peace. Once you start, as individual countries, saying that there are circumstances outside the United Nations and outside its charter which warrant an attack on a sovereign state, where does it stop? What do we say to North Korea if it continues along the path it is currently treading? Do we say that it is all right for the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to attack Iraq but it is not all right for North Korea to attack another country? The world will be sent into chaos because there will be no rules governing the resolution of international conflict. 12658 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator. He is a murderer, he has gassed and tortured his people and he continues to torture his people. In doing so, he has created a flow of refugees. But when these same refugees from Iraq arrive in Australia, the Australian government says that they are not genuine refugees. Government members stand up, day after day in this parliament, and point to the cruelty, the oppression and the torture of Saddam Hussein-but when Iraqi refugees arrive in Australia they say they are not genuine refugees. I say that they cannot have it both ways, but this government always seeks to have it both ways. The tragedy, of course, is that if it were not for the Tampa, if it were not for the government’s manipulation of that incident and its role in helping create that incident, then we may not be at war today. It is arguable that the government’s handling of the Tampa substantially boosted its vote at the last election and resulted in its return to power. And if it were not for some hanging chads in Florida, Republican President George Bush may not have been elected. So, but for some hanging chads and the entry of Tampa into Australian territorial waters, we may not have a war. But, sadly, tragically, we do, because of the actions of American President George Bush and because Prime Minister John Howard has taken his instructions from President Bush. Labor has said, repeatedly and consistently, that Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. But we equally say that the weapons inspections are working and that this is a war that is completely avoidable, unnecessary, immoral and wrong. Now, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are saying to the Iraqi people, ‘We are going to liberate you by bombing you, by killing thousands of innocent Iraqi women, children and men.’ In this case, by attacking a sovereign state, the Australian government is the aggressor. It is attacking a sovereign state and it is validating attacks on sovereign states by other countries outside of the United Nations. We, the Australian Labor Party, support the Australian troops, but we oppose the government. We oppose, vehemently, the government’s decision on this tragic day. I despise, too, the treatment of this war by American citizen Rupert Murdoch and his News Ltd organisation, his editors and many of his journalists. They are portraying this as a video game. I have here-only by way of example-the front page of the Daily Telegraph of last Saturday. It says, disgracefully, ‘Boom, boom, boom’. When we go to the story, it says that a White House official told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Boom, we’re going in hard and fast.’ And get this. He says: ‘This time next week, sit by your TV and watch the fireworks.’ This is an American White House official saying that there are going to be fireworks. This is blasting to death Iraqi women, children and men, yet American citizen Rupert Murdoch and his journalists are portraying this as some sort of fireworks display. This is not the Bicentenary of Australia. This is not the Olympics. This is the killing of innocent Iraqi women, children and men. Yet this disgraceful tabloid newspaper says, ‘Boom, boom, boom’. What does that say to children? That this is some sort of video game? When they see it on television, they are being told, ‘Have a look at the fireworks display.’ What is this saying to Australian children? What sorts of values is it trying to impart on them? They will be confused as to whether this is real or some sort of video game. The big feature inside the newspaper says: Tuesday, 18 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12659 The only thing missing when the bombs start dropping over Iraq will be the thumping crescendo of the 1812 Overture. Pyotr Tchaikovsky could not have asked for a more spectacular light and sound show to accompany his legendary celebration of military might. This is a bloody disgrace! That is what American citizen Murdoch is trying to ram down our throats. Just the other day, the Herald Sun in Melbourne said, ‘Our war’. Our war! This should be no-one’s war, but they say it is our war as if it is some romantic notion. The Guardian has done an analysis. Of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, it says, ‘How lucky can Murdoch get! He hires 175 editors and, by remarkable coincidence, they’re all in support of the war.’ We have 175 media outlets supporting the war and supporting American citizen Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch told America’s Fortune magazine: ... once it’sreferring to Iraqbehind us, the whole world will benefit from cheaper oil which will be a bigger stimulus than anything else. That is very consistent, of course, with his famous interview with the Bulletin magazine, where he said: The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy, if you could put it that way, would be $US20 a barrel for oil. That’s bigger than any tax cut in any country. That is American citizen Murdoch’s assessment of the case for war: it would cut the price of oil. Of course, if Labor were ever to dare mention that as a possible motivation, the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, beating their breasts, would say, ‘Oh, my goodness, how could you ever suggest that this war could have anything to do with the price of oil?’ We do not need to, because American citizen Rupert Murdoch has done so. Today in the Australian Dennis Shanahan said, in an article entitled ‘Howard winning own war at home’, that the total number in favour of the war without United Nations support was 22 per cent. That is a great victory, isn’t it? We have 71 per cent opposed, but this magazine, this rag, says, ‘Howard is really going well in getting the support of the Australian people for a war against Iraq.’ He does not have the support of the Australian people and will not get the support of the Australian people, because they know that long ago John Howard signed up to the coalition of the willing, and that meant being willing to attack Iraq with or without United Nations support. And he just waited and waited for his instructions to come from President Bush, and they came by phone from Air Force One from a meeting that Australia did not even attend. The Prime Minister has handed over the foreign policy of this country to the US administration. Not only that, he has handed over other important matters for Australia. We know that the negotiations currently under way on a trade deal-euphemistically called a free trade agreement with the United States-are directly related to Australia’s acquiescence and subservience on the war against Iraq. Just as Australians know that John Howard signed up months ago to the coalition of the willing and a war with Iraq, with or without the support of the United Nations, they know that this is part of the deal. He was dishonest with the Australian people then, and he is dishonest now. Just yesterday, when denying Labor’s correct allegations that these two are very deeply entangled, he said that he saw the two things as quite separate. He is denying statements by his own trade minister and his own foreign minister, and I will just give a couple of examples of those statements. His trade minister said: 12660 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 18 March 2003 ... an FTA would help engender a broader appreciation-in both countries-of our alliance and our common role in helping underpin the stability and prosperity of East Asia and the Pacific. This is now doubly important given the nature of the threats to security-and especially to Western interests-in the region. The deputy sheriff sentiment is alive and well in this government. I will not go through all of these statements, but I will point out that the foreign minister delivered a speech called ‘The strategic advantages of a free trade agreement with the United States’. Then government members look down the camera and say, ‘We’ve never said that; we’ve never linked these two.’ Of course a trade deal with the United States and a war against Iraq are linked, and neither are in Australia’s national interest. When will this Prime Minister start behaving in Australia’s national interest instead of in the national interest of other countries? The sad reality is that, in making these decisions, the Prime Minister has compromised our trade policy and he is also ultimately compromising the alliance with the United States. I support the alliance with the United States-I always have; I am a strong supporter of it-but article 1 of the ANZUS Treaty, the alliance document, says that we must go through the United Nations in resolving international conflict. If the Prime Minister has done anything to the alliance, he has torn up the ANZUS Treaty by ignoring article 1. Now he is entering into a trade deal with the United States that will be discriminatory in its nature. That is what this deal is. It is a deal that will have special arrangements, special market access, between Australia and the United States to the exclusion of East Asia. You would think that this Prime Minister had already done enough damage to our relations with East Asia by offering to bomb them-for example, through pre-emptive strikes-an offer that I am sure is going to be declined. He has done enormous damage with his remarks that he sees Australia as the deputy sheriff to the United States in this region. Now he wants to continue the damage by negotiating a discriminatory trade deal with the United States that excludes the countries of East Asia. What are they going to think about this? I was in China recently, and I know what they are thinking about it. A senior government member told me that it reinforces impressions that Australia no longer considers itself to be a part of this region. The Prime Minister is treading a very dangerous path in entangling trade policy with the military alliance. All it is going to do is further antagonise Australians towards the alliance because, when they find out that this is not going to be a free trade agreement at all, that we will not get unfettered access to the American market, Australians will say, ‘We’ve been dudded again by the Americans.’ I am pro-American, but this administration and the Howard government are reckless in their behaviour not only on trade policy but also fundamentally on the policy of a war against Iraq. The Prime Minister of Australia has today, in his public declaration of support for this war against Iraq-in fulfilling a private commitment made ages ago-dramatically increased the risk of a terrorist attack on this country or on Australians overseas. We are one of only three countries that has formed this disgraceful coalition of the willing-that is, willing to attack Iraq without the support of the United Nations and willing to kill Iraqi women and children. And for what? (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Georgiou) adjourned.

Notes: International migration statistics are subject to varying degrees of reliability and problems of comparability, largely reflecting the individual history and circumstances of each country. Some countries have population registers (notably northern European countries), while others base their statistics on records covering residents and work permits issued to foreign nationals. There are also data from censuses, from surveys on other sources such as bordercrossing records, disembarkation cards, studies on staff mobility in international enterprises etc. Variations are indicated in the table’s endnotes. n/r = not reported by the OECD. n/a = not available/cannot be calculated because of insufficient data. Net Overseas Migration (NOM)-is a measure of the net addition (or loss) to the resident population from migration. NOM is net permanent and long term overseas migration plus an adjustment for the net effect of category jumping. 1999 OECD population figures used as they accord with the most recent migration statistics released by the OECD Figures reported by OECD for Australia and New Zealand are for 1999/00 (July to June of the given year). Figures reported by OECD for the United States are for fiscal year (October to September of the given year). Most countries do not report both Temporary and Permanent inflows. Where it is not specified whether the figures are Temporary or Permanent, the figure is included in the Total inflow column only. Figures include both principal applicants and their accompanying dependents, if any, unless otherwise indicated. Asylum seekers are assumed to be excluded from the inflow figures unless otherwise indicated eg. France (asylum seekers counted in both Temporary and Permanent categories), and the Netherlands. Very few countries identify numbers of skilled inflow, though many report they encourage skilled entrants. Sources: OECD in Figures: Statistics on the Member Countries, May 2001.

The Convention also allows for refugee status to cease in some circumstances. For the purposes of answering this question, “permanent recognition of refugees” is taken to mean access to unlimited stay in a country (whether or not access to citizenship of that country is available). The following table is compiled from a range of sources. It should be noted that country rules may vary from time to time and implementation practices in relation to formal rules may vary. Permanent OECD Country Details Recognition? Australia YesA person found to be a refugee may be granted either a permanent visa or a temporary visa (3 or 5 year) dependent on whether: they abandoned or bypassed effective protection elsewhere; or they entered Australia lawfully; or fraudulent documentation was used to enter Australia. Temporary visa holders may be granted further temporary visas or a permanent visa if there is a continuing need for protection. AustriaA YesA Convention refugee obtains a permanent residence permit immediately. BelgiumA YesA Convention refugee obtains a permanent residence permit immediately. CanadaA YesA Convention refugee may apply for a permanent residence permit immediately. The permit is normally granted within 1 year. Czech RepublicB No Persons granted refugee status receive a renewable 1 year temporary residence permit. DenmarkAB YesA Convention refugee obtains a permanent residence permit after 3 years on condition of satisfactory performance in the integration program, including daily language lessons and job practice. Note: Under changes proposed by Denmark’s new government, Convention refugees will obtain permanent residence after 7 years. FinlandA YesA Convention refugee obtains a permanent residence permit after 2 years. FranceD NoA Convention refugee obtains a renewable 10 year residence permit. A person granted constitutional asylum obtains a renewable 10 year residence permit. A person granted territorial asylum obtains a 1 year residence permit, renewable twice. After2 renewals (3 years), if the circumstances that justified the granting of the status have not changed, the person obtains a renewable 10 year residence permit.

International migration statistics are subject to varying degrees of reliability and problems of comparability, largely reflecting the individual history and circumstances of each country. For example, in settlement countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States) immigrants are classified by their place of birth (‘foreign-born’), which in Australia is referred to as ‘overseasborn’, while in the other OECD member countries the criterion of nationality is applied (‘foreigners’). Therefore, in the above table, the figures for Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States are for stocks of ‘foreign-born’ population and the figures for the other OECD countries are for stocks of ‘foreign’ (ie those not naturalised) population. This is indicated in the table’s endnotes. Stocks of foreign/foreign-born populations are for 1999 unless otherwise indicated in the endnotes.

Australian Taxation Office: Taxpayer Charter (Question No. 154) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 February 2002: (1) Does the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) Taxpayers’ Charter explanatory booklet entitled “Treating you fairly and reasonably” contain a statement that it recognises individual circumstances, including previous history as a taxpayer and level of knowledge and understanding of the tax laws. (2) What criteria does the ATO use to ensure that individual taxpayers are treated individually. (3) Does the ATO have an internal policy document or set of procedures that outlines how this statement in the charter is to be put into practice. (4) How does the ATO monitor compliance to clauses in the taxpayers’ charter. (5) In the instances of reassessing investors in Mass Marketed Tax Effective investments who have had rulings made against them, did the ATO look at every case individually. (1) to (2) Refer to Taxpayers’ Charter Explanatory booklet 1 Treating you fairly and reasonably. (3) Examples of guidelines and policies include the ATO’s Code of Settlement Practice, Policy for the Collection of Taxation Debts and Receivables Policy. (4) The Taxpayers’ Charter has been specifically based on the tax laws which detail certain rights and responsibilities on taxpayers; as well as the rights and responsibilities arising from various other lawsfor example, the Privacy, Freedom of Information, Ombudsman and Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Acts. Other methods used by the ATO to monitor compliance with the Taxpayers’ Charter include: external feedbackfor example, from the Ombudsman and Privacy Commissioner; quality assurance processes including receivables management, public assistance and rulings panels; analysis and response to complaints data; corporate outcomes achieved against benchmarks for service standards and surveys of professionalismfor example, in audit and debt collection cases. (5) The reasons for the ATO’s decision to disallow deductions for these investments include the application of the general anti-avoidance provisions in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.",173,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
136,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Part IVA is not concerned with subjective motivation but with what can be concluded from an objective analysis of the facts. In mass marketed investment schemes, there is often little variance in their implementation in relation to each individual investor and therefore little scope for the individual’s circumstances to make a material difference. However, at the time of the initial imposition of the penalties every taxpayer was considered individually and as a result the majority of them received a significantly reduced penalty. Australian Taxation Office (Question No. 260) Ms O’Byrne asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 March 2002: (1) Is the rental contract for the premises of the Launceston Australian Taxation Office on a month by month arrangement.

142,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for the Arts and Sport has provided the following answer toMay 1999 August 1999 October 1999 February 2000 April 2000 June 2000 September 2000 November 2000 January 2001 February 2001 May 2001 September 2001 November 2001 March 2002. Taxation: Income Tax (Question No. 1145) Mr Beazley asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) What adjustments were made to personal income tax thresholds and marginal rates, and in which years, under the (a) Hawke, (b) Keating and (c) Howard Governments. (2) What was the impact of the adjustments to personal income tax thresholds and marginal tax rates under the (a) Hawke, (b) Keating and (c) Howard Governments on Commonwealth revenue. (3) Can he provide details of the impact in constant dollars. Information on previous adjustments made to personal income tax thresholds and marginal rates, and their impact on Commonwealth revenue, is publicly available in Budget documents. Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (Question No. 1147) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the demise of superannuation investment funds in the Enhanced Cash Management Trust (ECMT) through Commercial Nominees Limited (CNAL). (2) Did the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) give approval for CNAL as an approved fund/trustee for this fund. (3) Is he able to say whether the cash component of the ECMT has been virtually wiped out; if not, will he obtain data from APRA regarding the current cash assets within the ECMT; if not, why not. (4) Is he also able to say whether this fund and this fund manager is a kind of fund and matter that falls within the terms of reference of the current Senate Select Committee on Superannuation; if not, will he recommend that either the existing select committees terms of reference be widened to include evidence going to the issues concerning CNAL and ECMT or a new Senate select committee be appointed to investigate such matters; if not, why not. (1) The circumstances of ECMT and CNAL have been publicly reported. (2) CNAL did not require APRA approval to operate the ECMT. (3) ECMT’s financial position is public knowledge. (4) The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services has already examined the issues and made recommendations concerning CNAL as one of five case studies. Fuel: Ethanol Content (Question No. 1191) Mr Danby asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 4 December 2002:",188,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
143,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,189,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
144,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Is he able to say which countries have legislated a ten percent limit to the ethanol content in petrol. (2) Is he able to say whether there is a suggested worldwide standard of ethanol component to regular unleaded petrol. (3) What percentage of retail petrol sales in Australia in November (a) 2000, (b) 2001 and (c) 2002 had higher than ten percent ethanol component. (4) What percentage of ethanol used in Australian regular unleaded petrol is produced as a bi-product of (a) sugar cane production and (b) wheat starch. (1) The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates ethanol in gasoline vehicles at a maximum of 10%, however, 85% ethanol/petrol blends and 100% ethanol can be used in Flexible Fuelled Vehicles. New Zealand also has a 10% limit. Europe caps ethanol in petrol at 5%. Brazil uses ethanol blends in the range of 20-26%, with vehicles optimised (engines and fuel systems are modified) to run on 22%. There is also a small dedicated 100% ethanol fleet. (2) While there is no worldwide standard on ethanol content, the World Wide Fuel Charter, managed by four international automotive manufacturers’ associations, recommends an effective limit of 10%. (3) (a) & (b) It is not possible to provide an answer to these questions as the first national fuel quality standard for petrol came into effect on 1 January 2002 with the Commonwealth fuel sampling commencing in April 2002. (c) As at 1 February 2003, 615 samples had been analysed, of these 55 (8.9%) contained ethanol; 10 samples (1.6%) contained below 10% ethanol; 38 (6.2%) contained between 10% and 20% ethanol; and 7 (1.1%) contained above 20% ethanol. Most of the results above 10% were from New South Wales. (4) We do not have figures that enable us to confine the answer to ethanol used in regular unleaded petrol as ethanol is currently also added to premium unleaded petrol in some areas. Figures provided by the Australian Taxation Office for the 2001-02 financial year show that 1% of total fuel ethanol produced in Australia was derived from sugar cane and 99% was derived from wheat starch. It is expected that the proportion of sugar cane ethanol will be slightly higher in the 2002-03 financial year. Foreign Affairs: Fiji (Question No. 1205) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 5 December 2002: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to evidence given on 2 December 2002 in the treason trial of Timoci Silatolu and Jo Nata in Suva, Fiji, arising from the armed overthrow of the government of Fiji Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudry, in which it was alleged that the weapons used in the coup were supplied by the Ambassador of Israel. (2) Have any goods identified as diplomatic containers for delivery to the Israeli diplomatic mission to Fiji been transhipped to Fiji through Australian airports or seaports in the past 5 years. (3) What regulations apply to the importation of firearms and other weapons for delivery to foreign diplomatic missions to Australia. (4) What regulations apply to the transhipment of firearms or weapons through Australian airports or seaports to diplomatic missions in other countries. the honourable member’s question: (1) No, nor have I seen any evidence given to the trial. I am aware, however, of a reply to Question on Notice No 1204, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs clarified press reports about the evidence. (2) No. (3) The provisions of the Customs Act 1901, Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 and the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967 apply to the importation of firearms and other weapons for delivery to foreign diplomatic missions to Australia.",189,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
145,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,190,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
146,Mr Williams,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer toAs the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated in his reply to Question on Notice No 1204, the Australian Government’s policy is to prohibit the possession, carriage and use of firearms by members of the diplomatic and consular corps and by other members of the staff of missions and posts (including guards). This policy applies to all persons with diplomatic or consular immunity and to premises with such immunity. A special exception may be allowed for individuals to possess, under prescribed conditions, non-prohibited types of firearms strictly for bona fide sporting purposes. (4) Transhipped goods have the same status as imported goods under the Customs Act 1901. Quarantine: Blueberry Imports (Question No. 1239) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) What is the particular quarantine threat that is associated with the importation of dried sugar infused blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium) from the USA. (2) How does the possession of an import permit by the importer assist in ensuring that the threat is reduced or eliminated. (3) Why is the period of validity of the import permit limited to 6 months. (1) The quarantine risk associated with blueberries from the United States of America is the seed transmitted pathogen blueberry leaf mottle nepo virus. The sugar infusion process renders the seed non viable and therefore incapable of transmitting the virus. (2) Section 13 of the Quarantine Act 1908 prohibits the importation of a plant (including any part of a plant) unless a permit to import the plant is granted by a Director of Quarantine. The decision to grant a permit to import is based on a risk assessment that ascertains the quarantine risks associated with the importation of the product and determines the measures necessary to mitigate that risk. Risk mitigating measures are stated as conditions on the permit to import. (3) A six month validity period is standard for the majority of imported horticultural products. It allows the permit conditions to be amended from time to time to reflect changing quarantine risks in exporting countries. Governor General: Commonwealth Car Driver (Question No. 1246) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Has the Governor General been granted a designated Commonwealth car driver in any State capital city of Australia; if so, in which capital city. (2) Has the Governor General requested a designated Commonwealth car driver in any State capital city of Australia; if so, (a) in which capital city and (b) has the request been refused; if so, why. swer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Governor General has continued the arrangements that were put in place in 1998 during his predecessor’s appointment following a review by the Government of Commonwealth car operations and entitlements. He has a designated Commonwealth car driver in Sydney but not elsewhere. This Sydney driver, of course, remains fully available to perform the complete range of Comcar tasks for other clients when his services are not required by the Governor General. No request has been made for any change to these arrangements. Multicultural Affairs: Adult Migrant English Program (Question No. 1280) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: For the last year for which data is available, what proportion of Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) clients exited the program (a) after they achieved a functional level of English, (b) after they had completed the maximum numbers of hours of tuition that they were entitled to receive or (c) for some other reason.",190,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
147,Mr Truss,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,191,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
148,Mr Howard,"I am advised by the Official Secretary to the Governor General that the an(a) Results for the AMEP are reported to the Parliament annually. The results are for the preceding calendar year. Results are reported under the Certificates in Spoken and Written English (CSWE) curriculum framework. For the 13,618 clients (compared with 13915 clients in 2000) exiting the AMEP in 2001: 58.8 per cent entered at CSWE Level1 (compared with 60.3 per cent in 2000) and on average achieved 13 competencies (13 competencies in 2000) 24.2 per cent (24.1 per cent in 2000) entered at CSWE Level2 and on average achieved 14 competencies (14 competencies in 2000), and 16.4 per cent (15.6 per cent in 2000) entered at CSWE Level3 and on average achieved 9 competencies (9 competencies in 2000). Certificates/statements of attainment were awarded to exiting AMEP clients as follows: level 1 – 39.2 per cent (39.2 per cent in 2000) level 2 – 24.9 per cent (25.0 per cent in 2000) level 3 22.2 per cent (21.6 per cent in 2000) record of achievement – 13.8 per cent (14.2 per cent in 2000) Completion of CSWE Level3 is the measure of functional English used to define the limit of the clients eligibility for AMEP tuition. (b) 44% of clients exited the AMEP in 2001 after they had completed the maximum numbers of hours of tuition that they were entitled to receive. (c) 41% of clients exited the AMEP in 2001 for some other reason. English language outcomes from participation in the AMEP, including whether or not CSWE Level3 (functional English) is reached, are strongly influenced by such factors as: The client’s English language skills on entry to the program; The number of hours of tuition received The client’s age The amount of formal education the client had before coming to Australia; Literacy in first language; and Whether or not their first language uses Roman script. The AMEP is the foundation English language program for newly arrived migrants and humanitarian entrants. Having completed their AMEP entitlement, clients can and do move onto other English language programs administered by other Commonwealth and State/Territory agencies. AMEP Service Providers actively pursue pathways to these opportunities as clients are coming to the end of their AMEP entitlement. The Language Literacy and Numeracy Program of the Department of Employment, Science and Training provides basic to advanced English training for job seekers. Job Network providers can offer English language training. State and Territory governments fund a range of courses through the TAFE system. The AMEP Home Tutor Scheme Enhancement Program, introduced with additional funding by the government in 1997, supports community agencies around the country running informal English classes for migrants. Around 400 agencies were supported in 2001. Education: Higher Education Contribution Scheme Debt (Question No. 1284) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on, 4 February 2003: (1) Further to Table1 on page 7 of his discussion paper on university finances titled “Setting firm foundations” listing distributions of HECS debts, can he, in the same format, list the number of HECS debtors in each band of debt by the year in which they most recently incurred a HECS debt. (2) What is the basis of the projections contained in Table 2.6 of the Higher Education report for the 2002 to 2004 Triennium at page 82. (3) What are the projections through to 2010. (4) What proportion of each category in Table 2.6 is attributable to (a) past, (b) existing and (c) future students.",191,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
149,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The answer to this question is provided at Attachment A. The honourable member should note that, given that the data required to answer this question has been tabulated according to the most recent year in which a HECS debt was incurred, the figures for 2002 are considerably higher than for previous years. This is because the 2002 figures include both continuing students (who may be still undertaking their second, third or fourth years of study) and commencing students. Other years only include students who incurred no further HECS debt after that year, that is they either completed their studies or withdrew from their course and have not undertaken any further HECS-liable study since that time. The 2002 figures also include new debts incurred through the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) which are collected through the taxation system as accumulated HECS debts. (2) The HECS forward estimates produced by the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) form the basis of the table referred to in part (2) of the honourable member’s question. The data inputs that drive the forward estimates are as follows: HECS band rates; HECS non-differential rate; HECS-liable student load; HECS liabilities amounts including up-front payments, payments to universities for student loans and the 25 per cent discount for up-front payment; proportion of HECS students by HECS band and payment option; Bridging for Overseas Trained Professionals Loans Scheme (BOTPLS) loan amounts; Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS) loan amounts; Open Learning Deferred Payments Scheme (OLDPS) loan amounts; OLDPS basic charge; number of OLDPS units; voluntary and compulsory (PAYG) repayments of loans; 15 percent discount on voluntary repayments; HECS doubtful debt percentage; Consumer Price Index (CPI); Higher Education Operating Grant Index; and write-downs due to the death of debtors, remission of HECS debts, and refunds of voluntary repayments. (3) Table 2.6 on page 82 of the Higher Education Funding Report for the 2002-04 Triennium provides a summary of HECS liabilities, payments and accumulated debt for the financial years from 198990 to 2004-05. The table has been extended below to show financial projections through to 2006 in accordance with the normal Budget Forward Estimates requirements. Projections are not normally prepared for periods beyond the Budget Forward Estimates period as they are considered to be potentially unreliable. (4) Information sought on what proportion of each category in Table 2.6 can be attributed to past, present and future students is unavailable as the data inputs used for the HECS forward estimates is not collected on this basis and therefore can not be split to determine these proportions.

Trade: Export Market Development Grants (Question No. 1288) Dr Emerson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) How many exporters obtaining grants over $60,000 under the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme received only 75.62% of their second tranche entitlement in 2001-2002 for grant year 2000-2001. (2) What were the reasons for this. (3) Have EMDG applications increased by 20% this year for grant year 2001-2002, as claimed by the Export Consultants Association; if so, will this result in approximately 1000 EMDG applicants receiving only 50% of their second tranche entitlement for grant year 2001-2002. (4) Has Austrade or his Department made any estimate for grant year 2001-2002 of the likely number of EMDG applicants and what proportion of second tranche entitlement those applicants obtaining more than $60,000 will receive; if so, what are the results of this estimate. (1) In 2001-02, 832 EMDG recipients received grants for grant year 2000-01 which included a second tranche payment calculated at 75.62% of their provisional second tranche entitlement, after receiving an initial payment of $60,000. (2) Demand for EMDG grants increased in 2001-02 for grant year 2000-01. Application numbers for the 2000-01 grant year were up 5% and the claimed value of applications (before assessment by Austrade) was up 10%, compared with the previous grant year. A balance of $34.77m remained of the total EMDG funds of $150m, after paying first tranche payments (up to and including $60,000), grants finalised in 2001-02 for years before the 2000-01 grant year, and scheme administration costs. Outstanding provisional second tranche entitlements totaled $45.98m, giving a payout factor of 75.62 cents in the dollar. (3) Compared with grant year 2000-01, EMDG applications for grant year 2001-02 increased by 23% and the claimed value (before assessment by Austrade) increased by 17%. Austrade estimates that approximately 1,000 applicants will qualify for a second tranche provisional entitlement (over $60,000) in 2002-03 for the 2001-02 grant year. The precise number, and the payout factor to be applied in calculating second tranche payments, will not be known until claims assessment for the year is closed off in June 2003. (4) Applications for grant year 2001-02 closed on 2 December 2002, with 4,163 applications received. It is not yet possible to provide a precise estimate of the proportion of provisional second tranche entitlement those applicants receiving more than $60,000 will be paid for the 2001-02 grant year. Austrade will calculate the exact percentage in June 2003, following close-off of grant assessment for the year. However, at this stage, Austrade estimates that depending on the outcome of applications finalised between now and June 2003 the rate of payment of provisional second tranche entitlement above $60,000 will be less than 50 cents in the dollar. Trade: Wheat Exports (Question No. 1289) Dr Emerson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Over the last five years has Australia exported more than 8.8 million tonnes of wheat to Iraq. (2) What are the ramifications of a loss of exports of this magnitude to Australia’s balance of trade and to the grain industry in Australia. (3) What steps has he taken to ensure that Australia’s trading arrangements with Iraq, particularly grain trading, will not be placed in long term jeopardy should war with Iraq proceed. (4) What assurances has he sought that following any military intervention in Iraq, Australian wheat sales to Iraq will not be displaced by US wheat either commercially or in the form of food aid. (5) Has he received any such assurances from the US.",193,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247

152,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Yes. (2) As there has not been a loss of exports, this question is hypothetical.

Foreign Affairs: Zimbabwe (Question No. 1312) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: What is Australia doing diplomatically, in company with other like-minded nations, to try to alleviate the imminent threat of severe famine in Zimbabwe? Over the last year Australia has worked with other like-minded countries at a number of levels to try to alleviate the imminent threat of famine in Zimbabwe. The Prime Minister chairs the Commonwealth Chairman’s Committee on Zimbabwe (the “Troika”), which also includes President Mbeki of South Africa and President Obasanjo of Nigeria. On 19 March 2002, following the flawed Zimbabwe presidential elections, the Troika agreed to suspend Zimbabwe from the Councils of the Commonwealth. The Troika outlined a program of engagement with Zimbabwe to encourage it to return to the principles of democracy and good governance outlined in the Harare Commonwealth Declaration of 1991. As one element of this program, the Troika “requested the Commonwealth Secretary-General to remain actively involved with the United Nations Development Programme in promoting transparent, equitable and sustainable measures for land reform in Zimbabwe.” Zimbabwe’s land reform program has contributed significantly to the current food shortages in Zimbabwe. The Government of Zimbabwe has to date rebuffed all efforts by the Commonwealth Secretary-General to engage with it on land reform and other issues. There has been no official response to the UNDP’s January 2002 report, which described the land reform program as “chaotic” and “the cause of much economic, political and social instability.” Through Australia’s aid program about $31 million has been provided through the World Food Program (WFP) for immediate relief, and to non-government organisations to assist with long-term solutions. Australia’s assistance has included $2 million for the WFP emergency feeding program in Zimbabwe and $14 million in support of WFP’s consolidated southern Africa regional appeal. WFP now estimates that more than 15 million people are affected by food shortages in the southern African region. About half of that number is located in Zimbabwe. Up to half of Australia’s support for the WFP regional appeal is therefore expected to assist at risk populations in Zimbabwe. Over the last year, Australia has joined numerous WFP monitoring teams to ensure proper and fair distribution of food aid in Zimbabwe. Additionally, Australia has provided $10 million through Australian non-government organisations for projects in southern and east Africa to improve longer-term food security. In a further effort to assist with long-term problems, Australia is also funding a program of activities in southern and east African countries to address the complex issues of HIV/AIDS and inadequate water and sanitation in vulnerable populations. Military Detention: Mr David Hicks (Question No. 1313) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reported statements to the Australian media by the Prime Minister on 2 and 7 August 2002 that the Prime Minister thought it fair that Mr David Hicks, captured while fighting in the Taliban forces in Afghanistan in December 2001 and held without charge in a US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should continue to be held there indefinitely without charges being laid, given the circumstances of Afghanistan; if so, does he share this view. (2) Does he also share in the Prime Minister’s reported satisfaction, on the basis of information the Prime Minister had been given, about Mr Hicks’ physical well-being.",197,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
153,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Was this information supplied to the Prime Minister by his Department, pursuant to its consular responsibilities for the welfare of Australian citizens detained abroad; if not, is he able to say what agency supplied this information to the Prime Minister. (4) Is he able to confirm whether, as reported in The Sydney Morning Herald on 2 August 2002, (a) the Attorney-General wrote to Mr Hicks lawyer in Australia saying that Australia has indicated to the US that it is appropriate that Mr Hicks remain in US military custody with other detainees while Australia works through complex legal issues and conducts further investigations and (b) a spokeswoman for the Attorney-General said Australia was still investigating Mr Hicks to determine whether Mr Hicks could be charged under Australian law and could not press for Mr Hicks release until this was completed. (5) Why does Mr Hicks continue to be detained at Guantanamo Bay, where a US judge recently ruled that Mr Hicks is outside the range of any possible US judicial appeal, because Guantanamo Bay is not sovereign US territory. (6) How many consular visits has Mr Hicks received in the 11 months that Mr Hicks has been in detention in Guantanamo Bay. (7) What were the dates of these visits. (8) What is the normal frequency of consular visits to Australian citizens held in overseas jails or other places of detention, in countries with which Australia enjoys normal diplomatic and consular relations, similar to what Australia does with the US and with Cuba. (9) Is he able to confirm claims by Mr Hicks Australian lawyer, as reported in Australian media, that Mr Hicks is being held in solitary confinement in a cage, with only two 15 minute exercise periods per week, and allowed to write only one postcard to Mr Hicks family every two months, and not allowed to receive mail or visits from Mr Hicks family. (10) Are these acceptable or fair conditions for any Australian citizen to be detained under, either in Australia or overseas, while awaiting a possible trial under any charge. (11) When will he exercise his responsibilities as Australia’s Foreign Minister in charge of Australian consular services to protect Mr Hicks’ welfare and consular rights as an Australian being detained abroad. (1) Yes, I am aware of the Prime Minister’s comments. Yes, I agree it is appropriate that Mr Hicks continue to be detained while hostilities continue in the war against terror, and Australian and US authorities continue to investigate Mr Hicks’ activities. (2) Yes, I am satisfied that, given the high security nature of the Camp Delta facility, Mr Hicks is being held in safe and humane conditions, and is being treated appropriately by US authorities. Australian officials who have visited Mr Hicks for investigative purposes have observed that he is in good health and is being treated humanely. (3) This is a question for the Prime Minister. (4) This is a question for the Attorney-General. (5) Please see my answer to question (1). (6) Given the circumstances in which people were detained, and the high security nature of the Camp Delta facility, the US has permitted Australian officials to visit Mr Hicks for investigative purposes. (7) Not applicable. (8) This would depend on the circumstances of the arrest and detention. (9) Like all detainees, Mr Hicks is detained in an individual, air-conditioned cell and is not in solitary confinement. Mr Hicks is able to send and receive correspondence through a process managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross. I know of no reason why Mr Hicks’ correspondence with his family would be limited as suggested by the lawyer for Mr Hicks’ family. Given the high security nature of the Camp Delta facility, the US has decided not to provide detainees’ families with access to the facility, and Mr Hicks’ opportunities to exercise are limited. I am aware that Mr Hicks maintains a fitness regime which he undertakes within his cell. (10) Please see my answer to question (9).",198,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
154,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(11) I will continue to take an interest in the well-being of Mr Hicks as an Australian citizen to ensure that he is being treated humanely. Military Detention: Mr Mamdouh Habib (Question No. 1314) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Should Mr Mamdouh Habib, an Australian citizen who was arrested in Pakistan 10 months ago on suspicion of involvement with international terrorism, and has been held without charge in a US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since April 2002, continue to be held there indefinitely without charges being laid against him. (2) Does he have up-to-date information on Mr Habib’s well-being; if so, has his Department conveyed such information promptly and regularly to Mr Habib’s wife and children in Australia; if so, on what dates has Mr Habib’s family been so informed. (3) Why does Mr Habib continue to be detained at Guantanamo Bay, where a US judge recently ruled that Mr Habib is outside the range of any possible United States judicial appeal, because Guantanamo Bay is not sovereign US territory. (4) What are the dates of Australian consular visits to Mr Habib during Mr Habib’s reported detention at Guantanamo Bay since April 2002. (5) What is the normal frequency of consular visits to Australian citizens held in overseas jails or other places of detention, in countries with which Australia enjoys normal diplomatic and consular relations, similar to what Australia does with the US and with Cuba. (6) What are the conditions of Mr Habib’s detention, access to exercise and ability to send mail to, and receive mail from, Mr Habib’s family in Australia. (7) Are these acceptable conditions for any Australian citizen to be detained under, either in Australia or overseas, while awaiting a possible trial under any charge. (1) The Government believes it is appropriate that Mr Habib continue to be detained while hostilities continue in the war against terror, and Australian and US authorities continue to investigate Mr Habib’s activities. (2) Australian investigative officials recently visited Mr Habib. Although the visit was not for consular purposes, the officers noted that Mr Habib appeared in good health and was being treated humanely. My department has been in contact with Mr Habib’s family and representatives on several occasions. For privacy reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to provide further detail. (3) Please see my answer to question (1). (4) Given the circumstances in which people were detained, and the high security nature of the Camp Delta facility, the US has permitted Australian officials to visit Mr Habib for investigative purposes. (5) This would depend on the circumstancesx of the arrest and detention. (6) Like all detainees, Mr Habib is detained in an individual, air-conditioned cell. He is able to send and receive correspondence through a process managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Given the high security nature of the Camp Delta facility, Mr Habib’s opportunities to exercise are limited. (7) The Government is satisfied that, given the high security nature of the Camp Delta facility, Mr Habib is being held in safe and humane conditions, and is being treated appropriately by US authorities. Health: Insurance Premiums (Question No. 1345) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Is the health insurance industry seeking approval from the Howard Government for an approximate average 6% increase in health insurance premiums?",199,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
155,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows :(2) Is the case mounted by the health insurance industry for seeking such health insurance premium increases not because of any significant increase in health care costs but principally due to the benefit outlays associated with the significant increase in the number of claims made to the health funds during 2001-2002? (3) What is the justification for burdening health care contributors because of the failure of the health insurance industry to properly anticipate the hike in health care claims during 2001-2002? (4) Did the Howard Government promise that the 30% health insurance rebate would be a panacea for the long standing and long-suffering health insurance contributor? (5) What action does the Government propose immediately to bring the health insurance industry to task and, at the same time, also to protect long standing and long-suffering health insurance contributors? the honourable member’s question: (1) Applications for increases in health insurance premiums are still being assessed by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) and my Department. Details will be announced when the process has been completed. (2) The applications for premium increases are commercial-in-confidence and, as such, the contents cannot be revealed. (3) See (2). (4) No. (5) Under this Government, premiums have increased by just 4.7 percent a year since 1996. However, because of the 30% Rebate families are now paying less than they were in 1996. Under the Labor Government premiums increased by 9% per year (1990-1996). Prospect Electorate: Work for the Dole (Question No. 1352) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) How many persons in the electoral division of Prospect have been participants in the Work for the Dole program in (a) 1998-99, (b) 1999-2000, (c) 2000-2001 and (d) 2001-2002. (2) In the same years, what has been the average time taken for Work for the Dole participants to find full-time work. (1) 180 job seekers participated in Work for the Dole in 1998-99, 439 in 1999-2000, 691 in 2000-01 and 657 in 2001-02 in the electoral division of Prospect. (2) Data is not collected on the average time taken for Work for the Dole participants to find full-time work. Research: Backing Australia’s Ability Initiatives Funding (Question No. 1367) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 5 February 2003: (1) Which organisations received Backing Australia’s Ability initiatives funding in (a) 2001-2002 and (b) 2002-2003 under the categories of (a) Major Research Facilities program, (b) New Industries Development program, (c) Australian Research Council Competitive Grants, (d) Research Infrastructure Block Grants, (e) University Infrastructure, (f) Additional 2000 University Places and (g) Online Curriculum Content. (2) What is the physical location of each funded organisation. (3) At what physical location will or did the research take place. (4) Which organisations are attached to a university or research organisation.",200,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
156,Mr Andrews,The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to,201,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
157,Mr Brough,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,201,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
158,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is set out in the table below:Details of the organisations receiving Backing Australia’s Ability-funding for 2001-02 and 2002-03 follow, in table form. In most cases, funding for 2001/02 was similar to 2002/03. Significant exceptions include ARC Federation Fellowships, where awards for 2003 have not yet been finalised, and the Major National Research Facilities program, where two facilities received Backing Australia’s Ability funding in 2001/02, and 15 received funding in 2002/03. (Location of funded organisations) The physical locations of each of the specified Backing Australia’s Ability-funded organisations are distributed throughout Australia, and involve all States and territories and regional locations as well as capital, and many other major cities. (Location of the research) Research locations are distributed throughout Australia, all States and territories, and in regional centres as well as capital cities. In the case of one New Industries Development Program (In-market Experience Scholarships) the locations of the research also include the Asia-Pacific (including Japan), India, Europe and USA. One Major National Research Facility is associated with research in Japan and USA. Australian Research Council Competitive Grants funds are administered by organisations on behalf of researchers and research teams who have been awarded grants through a competitive peer review process. In the case of Additional 2000 University Places, it is not possible to specify the exact location where university places have been taken up, as these could occur at any or all of the campuses of the universities listed throughout Australia. Similarly, for Research Infrastructure Block Grants, it is not possible to identify the exact locations where the research supported by the infrastructure will take place as this could occur at any or all of the campuses of each institution identified (for the program). This also applies to University Infrastructure, where the funding is for broad based infrastructure to support research and training in universities. For Online Curriculum, the Backing Australia’s Ability funding is not specifically for research, but rather is for development of school online curriculum development. (Attached to a university or research organisation) All publicly-funded Australian universities were recipients of Backing Australia’s Ability funding from one or more of the Backing Australia’s Ability programs specified by the question. All Major National Research Facilities have university or research organisation attachment/affiliation. The New Industries Development Program has some attachments, and the Online Curriculum Content has none. 1.

Australian Research Council Competitive Grants The new funds provided through Backing Australia’s Ability (BAA) are being used to, from 2002: introduce new Federation Fellowships; double the number of ARC-funded postdoctoral fellowships; improve the competitiveness of postdoctoral researchers’ salaries; increase the funding available to the Discovery–Projects and Linkage–Projects programs to improve grant application success rates and average grant sizes; and contribute to the establishment of two world-class centres of research excellence, in information and communications technology and biotechnology. Information on the Centres of Excellence for Biotechnology and Information and Communications Technology has been provided by other portfolios (Industry, Tourism and Resources and Communications, Information Technology and the Arts respectively). It is not feasible to provide the specific physical location of the research carried out. The organisations listed administer the funds on behalf of researchers and research teams who have been awarded grants through a competitive peer review process. The researchers will be located at campuses of the organisations listed.

Melbourne Victoria 3000 Foreign Affairs: Iraq (Question No. 1370) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 February 2003: (1) Is he aware of reports in London’s Daily Telegraph on 19 January 2003 that key Iraqi scientists have been given new identities and smuggled out of the country to postings in South East Asia. (2) Does he know (a) the original identity of these scientists, (b) the identity these scientists have assumed, (c) to what countries they have gone, (d) what postings they have taken up and (e) whether the governments of these countries facilitated or participated in the smuggling of these scientists. (1) I am aware of media reports. (2) No. Foreign Affairs: Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (Question No. 1371) Mr Danby asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 February 2003: (1) How many refugees from the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) does the Government estimate have fled the famine. (2) How many of these refugees does the Government estimate have fled to the Peoples Republic of China. (3) Have Australian diplomats or members of the Australia China Human Rights dialogue attempted to investigate the plight of these refugees; if not, why not. (4) Is the Minister able to say what is the policy of Beijing towards these DPRK refugees. (5) Is the Minister able to say whether Beijing routinely returns starving citizens of the DPRK to the DPRK. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether many of these returned refugees are incarcerated in concentration camps or executed. (7) Has Australia made representations to Beijing or the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) about these practices. (8) What action has the UNHCR taken on behalf of these refugees. (9) Is China a signatory to the 1951 convention on refugees and its subsequent protocols. (10) Is Beijing an executive member of the UNHCR executive. (11) Has China and the UNHCR signed a bilateral treaty in 1995 that guarantees the right to call for expeditious arbitration over differences in refugee policy. (12) Has the UNCHR submitted the treatment of North Korean refugees to arbitration. (13) Has Australia asked the UNHCR for such arbitration; if not, is the Government contemplating such a request; if not, why not. (1) No reliable figures exist. In addition to the estimated numbers of North Koreans in China (see question 2 below) there are thought to be about 6,000 DPRK citizens working in the Russian Far East. (2) No reliable figures exist. Estimates of the number of North Korean in China illegally at any one time seeking food, shelter and work range from several thousands to hundreds of thousands. (3) Yes. The Australian Embassy in Beijing has reported to the Australian Government on the plight of DPRK refugees. However it is difficult to obtain hard information on this matter as the Chinese government restricts access its border regions contiguous with the DPRK and DPRK refugees seek to conceal their presence in China. Australia has also raised the issue of the treatment of returned DPRK border-crossers with the DPRK. However Australian (and other) diplomats do not have the freedom of travel and access to investigate the plight of returned refugees in the DPRK.",201,Sopemi 2001 Trends In International Migration P 247
159,Mr Downer,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,218,Australian Capital Territory
160,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows :(4) China regards those crossing the border illegally from the DPRK not as asylum-seekers but as illegal economic migrants, and seeks to return them in accordance with its bilateral agreement with the DPRK on cross-border movements. (5) China has allowed safe-passage for a small number of DPRK citizens to travel on to third countries. South Korea has accepted a total of 3131 North Korean defectors since the end of the Korea War, many of whom have come to South Korea from China via a third-country transit. (6) North Korea has said that returned border-crossers faced no consequences on return. Other commentators claim that returned refugees face possible months or years of incarceration. There have been no confirmed reports of execution. (7) Australia has discussed these issues informally with the UNHCR. The Chinese government is aware of Australia’s views on these matters. (8) The UNHCR is working to establish a mechanism, in cooperation with China, for it to screen DPRK asylum-seekers in China. It has also sought to open a dialogue with the DPRK on the issue. (9) Yes. China is a signatory to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. (10) Yes. China is a member of the UNHCR Executive. (11) An instrument covering the expeditious arbitration over differences in refugee policy is a standard inclusion when a UNHCR office is opened in a country. UNHCR opened an office in Beijing in 1982 and upgraded its presence from a Branch, to a Regional, Office in 1985. (12) No. (13) No. It is for the UNHCR to initiate such action. Regional Flood Mitigation Program (Question No. 1376) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 5 February 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1176, which areas within the jurisdiction of the Camden City Council and the Parramatta City Council have been designated to be a part of the NSW statewide voluntary purchase scheme allocation. (2) Is there any evidence of serious flooding occurring in these areas. (3) What differentiates these areas from other places in the south-west Sydney basin that have a history of serious flooding. (4) What is his Department’s definition of serious flooding. (1) I am advised that within the jurisdiction of Camden City Council, 161 houses have been identified by the NSW authorities for voluntary purchase, house raising or flood proofing in Camden due to flooding of the Upper Nepean River. In Parramatta City Council, three houses have been earmarked by the NSW authorities for voluntary purchase at Wentworthville due to Toongabbie Creek flooding. (2) I am advised that the Upper Nepean River Floodplain Management Study and Plan (2000), indicates that there have been 24 significant flood events in Camden since 1860 (flood levels in excess of 12m at the Cowpasture Bridge gauge). The highest flood level recorded was 16.53m in 1873. The most recent event occurred in 1988 when the flood level reached 12.8m. In the case of Wentworthville, the North Wentworthville Floodplain Management Study (1998), reported that “the 1990 Coopers Creek Floodplain Study identified seven significant flood events between August 1986 and September 1990 … the largest flood occurred in late April 1988 while the second largest occurred in August 1986. During both those flood events a number of houses were flooded and a significant number of private properties were inundated along Coopers Creek. Similar problems were experienced along Finlaysons Creek and Toongabbie Creek.” (3) The NSW Government, rather than the Federal Government, determines which priority projects within the State will be recommended for funding under the Regional Flood Mitigation Pro-",218,Australian Capital Territory
161,Mr Tuckey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:gramme. Eligible projects are assessed against four basic criteria – effectiveness in mitigating the effects of flooding, economic costs and benefits, social benefits and environmental impacts. (4) My Department does not define serious flooding. Employment: Job Network (Question No. 1380) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice, on 6 February 2003: What were the (a) names, (b) addresses and (c) hours of operation of organisations that are part of the Job Network in the postcode areas of (i) 3074, (ii) 3075, (iii) 3076, (iv) 3082, (v) 3083 (vi) 3087, (vii) 3088, (viii) 3089, (ix) 3090, (x) 3091 and (xi) 3752 on 1 January 2003.

(4) Have these people been executed yet; if not, will the Government make further representations to the Chinese Government. (1) Yes. (2) The Australian Embassy in Beijing made representations seeking the overturning of the death sentences on 9 December 2002. The Chinese response was that the two men had been convicted in a fair trial, conducted in accordance with Chinese law, and that they had received death sentences because of the serious nature of their offences: causing three explosions and “spreading seditious propaganda to split the country”.

172,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:hran, sought assurances from Iran that its nuclear program will be used solely for the peaceful generation of nuclear power. Australia is not, however, in a position to verify such assurances. For that the Government looks to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as the body mandated to verify countries’ compliance with their NPT safeguards agreements. Australia is a strong supporter of the IAEA and its system of nuclear safeguards. (3) Yes. Australia has a good working relationship with Iran, which includes dialogue on arms control and disarmament issues. Australia will continue to urge Iran to conclude an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which would enable the IAEA to apply strengthened safeguards measures in Iran, particularly aimed at providing assurance there are no undeclared nuclear activities. Accepting an Additional Protocol would be an important means by which Iran could assure the international community that it is engaged solely in peaceful nuclear activities. (4) Yes. In bilateral contacts with both North Korea and Iran, the Government regularly raises its concerns about the development and export of missiles and related technology, particularly with reference to ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. (5) The Government is aware of speculation that firms or individuals from countries other than North Korea may have been involved in the supply of missile-related technology, materials or expertise to Iran. Publicly available reports indicate that Russian and Chinese entities may have been so involved. It should be noted that many countries, including Russia and China, apply controls on the transfer of certain items, materials and technologies to prevent the proliferation of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. However, commercial activities that could contribute to missile programs may sometimes occur without the knowledge of governments.

We have asked for confirmation from the Chinese authorities. (3) I can confirm that Mr Wang was sentenced to life in prison for organising and leading a terrorist organisation and for espionage on behalf of Taiwan. This charge included selling military secrets to the Taiwanese Intelligence Services and conspiring to blow up the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
