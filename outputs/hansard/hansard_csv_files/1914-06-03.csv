Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [2.31] -Before -we proceed to the business of the day, I wish to make mention of the' appalling shipping catastrophe, which 'occurred in the St: Lawrence a few days ago, whereby nearly one thousand persons were, without warning, sent to' their long home. Our human relationships are subject to these sudden interruptions, and a heavy toll is levied on the transportation of our commerce across the seas. The. circumstances of the wreck of the Empress of Ireland are peculiarly shocking. Two years ago the world's largest steamer foundered through striking an iceberg during a fog. It was thought in that case that the precaution of slowing down sbould have been taken earlier; the Empress of Ireland met disaster after all the precautions for avoiding injury in a fog which human ingenuity could suggest and prudence dictate had been taken. Again and again after we have made our best arrangements, and enforced the wisest regulations that thought can devise, the element of human error, which seems incalculable, creeps in, and upsets our plans. Now there is recorded another big sea tragedy, nearly one thousand persons of all ranks and degrees of ability and service being swept to a watery grave. These events strike a chord of common feeling. All we can do is to express our sympathy with those near and dear to the victims OF EMPRESS OF",11,Setup

2,Mr Joseph Oook (Parramatta,"for the irreparable loss -which they have suffered. Yesterday, in obedience to this prompting of our common humanity, the Governor General, on behalf of the Government, despatched to the Governor General of Canada the following cablegram :Will you kindly convey to Canada Australia's deepest sympathy with sinter Dominion and relatives of those who have perished in terrible shipping disaster. There we must leave it, paying our tribute to the bravery of those who did their best to save what was left of the wreck. join' with the Prime Minister in offering sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who have been lost in this sad disaster, the suddenness and magnitude of which must bave appalled the whole world. ' In every continent, and possibly in nearly every country, there are to-day citizens who have been bereaved by this calamity, which is therefore worldwide in its effects. Accidents like this, whether great or small, can be made less liable by the wisdom of the legislators of civilized communities, but when everything has been done, mental failure, unconscious misdirection, or circumstances which human effort cannot control, will still occasionally bring disaster. I agree with the Prime Minister that the greatest sympathy should be shown with the Dominion of Canada, and I am glad that the message which he has read was sent by the Governor General. I have read that in every town of importance in the Dominion there are persons now in mourning. We must express our sorrow with them, and the hope that, iu the future, thero will be fewer of these sensational disasters than there have been in the past. I am sure that whatever this Legislature may do with a view to preventing accidents on the waters surrounding our own coasts will receive the hearty approval and support of the people of Australia.

In view of the fact that Colonel Tope, being on the unattached list, is still available for duty-wil l the Minister, under all the circumstances of the case, consider the desirability of restoring Colonel Tope to his former position of Brigadier? 2. Will the Minister make available, in the Library, all papers and, in particular, the written evidence given before the inquiry re accusations as to the conduct of LieutenantColonel J. H. Courtney, at the Kilmore camp, 1912, and Heidelberg oamp, 1913? 3. Will the Minister state the reason of Colonel McShane not being given command of a battalion on the expansion of the forces on the 1st July, 1912, whilst two juniors in his own battalion were appointed commanding officers, and he was not then of retiring age? 4. Was not Colonel McShane recommended for and promised command of the 49th Battalion, and did he not for several weeks actually perform and carry out the duties of the commanding officer of the battalion ? 5. Was it not after the command of the 49th Battalion had been given to an officer junior to Colonel McShane that Colonel McShane applied to be placed on the retired list? honourable member's questions are as foll o w :1. Colonel Tope was placed on the unattached list at his own request, he-as well as all other available officers on the active listwill be considered when any future appointment of Brigadiers are made. 2. The papers in connection with the inquiry concerning the matter referred to at the Heidelberg camp, 1913, will be made available for the honourable member's perusal. There is no record of any such inquiry with regard to the Kilmore camp, 1912. 3. 4, and 5. Lieutenant-Colonel McShane was placed on the retired list at his own request. On the 9th September, 1912; that is, before the present Government came into office. The following answers have, however, been supplied by the Department:3. The re-organization of the militia forces, consequent on universal training, took place on the 1st July, 1912. Lieutenant-Colonel McShane was considered for the command of the 49th (Prahran) Infantry, but as he was within four months of the ape for retirement, he was deemed ineligible by the Promotion Board. [67] 4. Lieutenant-Colonel McShane was recommended by the District Military Commandant for the command of the 49th Infantry, but no promise of such could be given. He administered the command from 1st to 30th July, 1912. 5. Yes. AND TOWNSVILL E COASTAL MAIL .

On Thursday last the honourable member for Batman asked the following questions: 1. Is the Postmaster-General aware that pilfering from letter-pillars in the metropolitan area is a matter of frequent occurrence? 2. Is there not a larger number of complaints in respect of non-delivery of mailed letters under consideration in the Postal Department at present than at any time previously? 3. What, if anything, does the Minister propose to do about it? I was not aware of any complaints, bufc I have had inquiries made, and the Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furnished the following information2. The number of complaints received at this office in regard to the non-delivery of letters generally since 1st January is slightly less than those received during the corresponding E eriod of last year, but more complaints haye een received of missing letters posted in letter-pillars this year than usual. During the past four months, on several occasions, adhesive substances have been found in letterpillars in the metropolitan area, which would indicate that unauthorized persons have been tampering with the pillars. 3. A device designed for the purpose of preventing the illegal abstraction of letters from letter-pillars has been adopted by the Department, and will be fitted to a number of pillars within the metropolitan area as early as possible.

111,Mr Agarwynne,"In q u i r y isThe Deputy Postmaster-General, Brisbane, has furnished the following reportThe service between Gladstone and Townsville is intended to secure expeditious transmission of mails between those places and ports en route. The time allowed under the mail contract would not permit of any delay by the contractors for the purposes of shipping or unshipping cargo at various ports of call between Gladstone and Townsville, and, consequently, they have been compelled practically to refuse cargo for Mackay and Bowen. If the request made by the honourable member were complied with, the time-table would require to be materially altered, and the value of the service for mail purposes would be correspondingly diminished. Shippers at Gladstone bave opportunities for sending cargo vid Port Alma at frequent intervals by coastal vessels not under the contract. The Deputy Postmaster-General does not recommend compliance w i th the request, as it would seriously impair the usefulness of the mail service. MrJ . H .

I have not been a political canvasser amongst these persons. Perhaps the honourable member has done that work, and, therefore, interjects so confidently.

They are the persons whom it is in contemplation to benefit when a measure providing for postal voting is presented to this or any other Legislature. In 1910 84,000 postal votes were recorded. That is the clearest possible proof that this machinery has been availed of, and that it has fulfilled a useful function, and met the needs of the people. I do not know how else we are to gauge it. I do not know how honourable members imagine that it is taking advantage of people who do not need it . However, there is no proof of that assertion; we have simply the bald statement without a tittle of justification. On the other hand is the fact thaf>&4,000 postal votes were recorded in 1910, and the only argument on which the protest against the postal vote is based is the fact that 49,000 of these postal votes were supposed to be for Liberals, while 33,000 say "" supposed to be "" in each case. were 84,000 postal votes cast in 1910? of the total absent and postal votes, and saying that the fact that the majority of these votes was cast for Liberals is alleged to be conclusive argument that something was done to manipulate .the postal vote. I know of no provision in the Electoral Act which is as safeguarded as are the postal vote provisions. The penalties are heavy, the requirements are strict to the point of severity, and the fact that there have been only a few cases of irregularity brought to the Courts and dealt with is the clearest possible proof that nothing very wrong has taken place' in connection with the postal vote.

They were told by the canvassers that they could vote by post. member's answer is not sufficient. it all right. that I dare say ""our crowd,"" as the honourable member calls us, knows just as much as the other side about these things. I do not pretend that every one in our party is an angel, and that every one on the other side is the other thing. I dare say who are operating these provisions' are that if we investigated the matter closely we should find that there is much of a muchness in human nature on both sides in regard to operating this electoral machinery. there is only one party that is complaining about this particular machinery. Our party do not complain. Why do the other side complain ? Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggest that they are not able to take care of themselves, and that these persons are poor little innocents who need to be taken care of kindly and safely by some motherly Act of Parliament? that the methods are more suitable to your side than to ours. member must go further than that when he makes that allegation, for, whether he knows it or not, he is impugning all .the forces in this community which are set for the preservation of law and order; in effect, he is saying that all the administrators of justice, and all officials concerned in the administration of the Electoral Department, are winking at their duty, and are political partisans to boot. orable member has not said it, but what [I have said is implied in his statement. He has said that our party manipulates votes, and that the other party do not. The same penalties apply to this side as to that. The same impositions are placed on honourable members on this side as on honourable members on that side. The electoral law is for both sides, and all sides', and all parties, and no party; it is for every one who wishes to vote. Therefore, every argument we hear from the other side that this or that violation of the law takes place, is simply an implication that the officials of the Electoral Department are not doing their duty, and that they are favouring one side as against the other. I come back to the question again-Why is it that our party do not complain as to the postal vote, while the whole of the other party do ? tions use it mostly, and can do so because they have the methods, is the same implication-that the officials conniving at wrong-doing by this side.

But what are the facts? From 1904 until 30th April, 1914, that is ten years, there have been only ten cases of irregularity. If that is gross and widespread wrong-doing, I should like to know the honourable member's idea of what immunity from crime is. There are ten cases, and not a case of fraud in the whole period.

While that is so in regard to postal voting, there have been numberless cases of fraud in regard to the Electoral Act generally. emerges-that the postal voting sections ql the Electoral Act have been most faithfully administered, and most, severely safeguarded, and that of all the provisions of the Act, they are the one part which has worked well, and as to which there has been no fraud that has been discoverable and punishable.

Simply that the people in Kooyong exercised their vote. with the law. of sickly people there. -orable member for Melbourne Ports must not continue to interject. io this, that when we get a good' poll in an electorate it is evidence of fraud and chicanery? ' Mr Mathews interjecting, pointedly asked the honourable member Not one case of a man for Melbourne Ports to cease interjecting, and I am sorry the honourable member has again immediately done so. If he continues to disregard my authority, I shall take another course. Therefore, this conclusion most' astounding thing that I know of, that, because a vote is taken advantage of to the fullest extent, because it is used extensively, the very thing we are encouraging people every day to do, that is to be regarded as proof positive of fraud and chicanery. The object of the postal-voting provisions is almost to compel people to vote. There is compulsion in our electoral law. We say that people must register, and we say, also, by the mouthsof the Opposition , 1 that if they do vote, and vote well,, they are fraud's* That is what honourable members are saying. What else is there in the argument about the Kooyong electorate?' Bas-any voter in Kooyong been punished for fraud? There are plenty 1 of agencies for finding out what is going on, and we may be sure that if Fraud did take placein Kooyong it would have been unearthed long ago. Some people on to-d!ay, sometimes even before Ministers d'o, and yet as to these matters; concerning whichthey make the most astounding allegations, they know nothing and cando nothing. All they do is to insinuate and imply that fraud has taken place, simply because the people of Kooyong recorded a plumper vote. I say that these facts-,, rightly considered, show to what extent this vote has been availed of; show the need that this vote was intended to meet; and show that the result is satisfactory. All these reasons honourable members bring forward, when they are analyzed, are reasons for the perpetuation of the vote, and not for its destruction or abolition. The reason why there have not been many prosecutions underthis postal vote section is the severity of the safeguards imposed in the Act. Take one or two f acts , 1 for instance. An authorized witness has to say that he knowspersonally the person whosesignature he is witnessing, and if he-cannot show that he does-know that person, and if he does not fulfil other conditions) he is liable to a. fine of £50 and a -month's, imprisonment. , A man r must be--indeed a scoundrel who will run",24,Second Reading

The same thing applies all round. witnessed, the application, properly accredited, goes to the Returning Officer. He is supposed to check it , to find out whether an absent vote has been polled from the same person or if a postal vote has been obtained previously; and if he is satisfied that the application is in order -he sends back a ballot-paper. Then another process has to commence. Further witnessing has to take place. The applicant has again to obtain an authorized witness, who has to certify that he knows something about the person to whose signature he is a witness, and that witness is under penalties that he shall not divulge the direction in whicli the vote is given. Again, the penalty staring him in the face is a fine of £100 or three months' imprisonment. The vote is sent to the Returning Officer, and the signature is again checked. never been a more complete system of checks devised in connection with voting anywhere in the world than is the case with regard to the postal vote. On top of all that, honourable members opposite say, ' ' You cannot safeguard it ; you can manipulate the vote as easily as winking."" Such is not the case, and the fact that the alleged frauds have not been brought to justice and that fine or imprisonment has not been imposed in a single case is the best of all indications that no such manipulation is possible. place, but you do not find the thief. but a lot of robberies have been perpetrated, and the robbers are in gaol to-day and anxious to get out. There, is hot in gaol one of those rascals to whom honourable members opposite refer. Isi t not singular that, though there , is a daily average of 70,000 or 80,000 sick and infirm adults in Australia, honorable members cannot sheet home a case of abuse to any of those people? Honourable members say that abuse goes on, but the fact remains that they cannot prove any case of manipulation of postal vptes. Therefore, . I , -think j we may.,.reasonably infer, that the postal vote has: not been abused, but has done a very great deal of good to invalids and sick people in the community. who will not see. none are so blind as those who cannot When the signature has been see. There are two kinds of blind people, those who will not see, and those who cannot see, and I do not know that there is anything to choose between the two. What is the reason for this postal vote? The tradition, the underlying argument all down the years from generation to generation, is that the country is best governed when all the people take a hand in the government. That is the fundamental theory of our Democracy. It rests upon that principle that the country is most safely governed-whethe r it is best governed or not is a question open to argument-bu t the theory is that society is safest when everybody is given a hand in the government of that society. That is the principle upon which we proceed, and, therefore, the vote becomes a duty to be performed, as well as a privilege to be enjoyed. There are a lot of I venture to say there has people in the community to-day who think that the vote is given to them to use or not just as they choose. That is not the fundamental idea of the vote at all. The vote is not given as a mere pleasurable exercise on their part to enable them to confer a favour on some individual. The reasons for conferring the vote go further back than that. The vote is given to people in these democratic days so that the State may be safely governed, and it is believed to be more safely .governed when all the people take a hand in the governing. Clearly, therefore, voting is a duty, and that is why compulsion .has been imposed upon people to register their names. If we apply compulsion as we have done; we come across many anomalies which will require a great deal of rectification before we reach ideal conditions. Let us take this case: We compel a sick woman to register her name, and we tell her that if she does not register, she is liable to a fine of 40s. After compelling her to register, honourable members opposite are deliberately declining to give her an opportunity to record her vote. Is there anything fair about that? Honourable members lay compulsion on that woman to qualify *4so>-vote, and then deprive her of the only opportunity open",25,Second Reading

174,Mr Joseph Cook,"Quite so, andto her to exercise the vote. The whole thing is illogical to the last degree. There is no reason in that sort of compulsion. Responsibility must carry its corresponding privileges, and the aim of all our electoral measures should be, as far as possible, to confer equal opportunities for voting throughout the length, and breadth of the country. The opportunities never can be equal. Even when we have done our best, there can never be equal opportunities when one man has to travel 20 miles, and lose a day or two days' pay in order to record his vote, while another has only to travel across the street at a cost of ten minutes' effort. The opportunities are not equal there, nor can they be equal when women and infirm and sick people are compelled to qualify to vote when honourable members deny them the privilege of recording their votes. portunity when voting day comes round. They suffer disabilities which are due, not to their own fault, but to the fact that we have laid upon these people the obligations of a civilized community. Honourable members say to them, "" Notwithstanding that we have compelled you to register, and will fine you for not doing so, you shall not vote because there is a fear that somebody might persuade you to vote wrongly."" to which honourable members opposite are driven in their opposition to this B ill . the secrecy of the ballot. say in answer to that is that if these pro visions of the B ill are carried out, the ballot ought to be very secret indeed, and if the secrecy of the ballot is being violated, then the people who connive at the opening of the ballot should be punished and p u t in gaol. them; but do not deprive a woman who is lying ill in bed of the vote because some miscreant outside has not done his duty. cause of something the guilty man has done. are doing in connection with the postal vote. of the vote had gone on to half the extent that honourable members say, it would mean a revision of the postal provisions of this B ill ; but I do not care what manipulation, has taken jplace, .we. have no right --to deprive these people of the vote,' simply because of the possibility of some miscreant doing what he should not do. Honourable members make out an argument thereby fjor"" betueir machinery, and not for the abolition' of the machinery we have. I need not worry the House further. This matter has been threshed out fairly well, and this Government, believing as we do in the fundamental basis of democratic government, believing that people ought tb be encouraged to vote, and that opportunities should be provided for them to do so, propose, if permitted, to re-impose these voting provisions in the Electoral Act, so that those women engaged in their high and holy duty, even when laid aside, and who may not mix with the crowd'to record their votes, shall still be cumbered amongst those who believe in it e i r country, and desire to help in its government. In regard to the sick and They have not equal opthe infirm, the same argument applies. Tha Government believe that, notwithstanding that those people suffer disabilities, illness, and infirmities, yet by reason cf their lifelong service to the State, by reason of the fact that they are still residents of the State, and subject to all the disabilities that the State sometimes imposes upon them, that they are subject to all the responsibilities of taxpayers, they shall not be denied their voice in the That is the position government of the country merely because some temporary -malady has overtaken them.

199,Mr Joseph Cook,"Oh, ypaislanderex'l-courage of my opinions. Minister will probably say, "" If there was any wrong-doing or abuse of the system, .why not prove it?."" My objection to the system is absolutely sustained by the fa/it that it is beyond the wit of man. to devise a means by which any abuse of such a system can be exposed. No one can deny that the system is abused. Money, position, and social circumstances are used as a powerful lever to induce many people, jwhen voting by post, to vote other than ibheir judgment would dictate if they were free from such influences. member is slandering the electors. ideter me from saying what I intend to say in regard to this matter. Bread and butter considerations, or a desire to mainjfcain peace, induce some people exercising the postal-vote system to vote other than * they would do if they were free to exe'r-cise their independent judgment. When .we were in office we extended the facilities for voting by providing polling booths at places where sick and infirm people wei'e located, in order that they might actually place their own ballot-papers in the ballot-boxes. I do not think we could have done more than that, and, as the result of our efforts, the percentage of votes recorded throughout Australia at the last general election was greater than ever before experienced in the history of the 'Commonwealth. therefore, that, although voting by post was abolished, the electoral machinery provided by us enabled a larger percentage of people to vote than would otherwise have been possible. in the hospitals in some of the States. that we established polling places where infirm and sick people were receiving attention, so that they might vote as they flesired, and actually place their own ballot-papers in a ballot-box. sick people living in: their own homes ? ber for Hunter made a proposal last session to enable every sick or infirm elector to vote at home, but the Government .would have nothing to do with it. If the secrecy of the ballot is not to be violated, then every person recording his' vote should put his own ballot-paper in a The Prime ballot-box. I have referred previously to a serious disability that arises under the postal-vote system, and also where absent votes are cast prior to the day of election. In these days, when parties are so evenly balanced, the result of an election might be determined by the postal vote recorded'. Under this Bill postal votes must be cast before election day. Between the day on which they were recorded and the date of election, the political situation might have entirely changed, so that, in such circumstances, the verdict of the country might be given on the political circumstances actually existing,, not on the day of election, but at some prior date. With the postal-vote system in force, it is impossible for the will of the people to be declared as at any particular date. That is undoubtedly a serious defect. I think I am correct in saying that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs last year said that the postal-vote system was capable of fraud. devise any machinery that is not capable of fraud. As long as there are fraudulent people there will be fraud, no matter what the machinery is. ter of Home Affairs spoke of fraud creeping in, in a wider sense, in connection with the postal vote. Even the Prime Minister himself holds that the system, at best, is a very risky one. son yet to condemn it. said about depriving the sick and the infirm of the franchise. I venture to say that large numbers of the sick and infirm have no desire to be troubled with election matters at all. Tbe statistics furnished by Mr Knibbs as to the number of sick people are, no doubt, perfectly correct from a statistician's point of view, but I would like to add that there are many people, seriously ill , who ought not to be approached, and have no wish to be approached. Nothing in the world, however, will prevent political agents trespassing if they think they can secure a vote. It will be seen, therefore, that there are two sides to. this question. First, -we have to consider the health, and welfare of the subject, and, secondly, to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot and provide against fraud and abuse.",28,Second Reading

Speakingi n 3897 at theConvention, Mr Justice ""Barton saidapplicable to any case except that in which the constitutional machine is prevented from: properly working. I am in very great doubt whether the term can be strictly applied to any case except the stoppage of Legislative machinery arising out of conflict upon the finances of the country. A stoppage which arises on any matter of ordinary legislation, because the two Houses cannot come to an agreement at first, is not a thing which is properly designated by the term "" deadlock,"" because the working of the Constitution goes on-r-the constitutional machine proceeds notwithstanding a disagreement. It is only when thefuel of the machine of governmeut is withheld that the machinery of government comes to a stop, and that fuel is money. I suppose that Sir Edward Barton's opinion must count for nothing compared with that of the Cook Government when a party cause is at stake. In 1898 Sir .William McMillan summed up the situation in this wayI do say that if you create any machinery which, under the guise of settling dead-locks, will really be used to create dead-locks, you will strike a blow absolutely at the power and dignity of the Senate. During the discussion on these Bills, M i nisters have made their position clear in regard to an, even more important matter than the double dissolution. An attack has been made on the bi-cameral system of the Constitution and the equal representation of the Statesi n the Senate. The Prime Minister, repeating the statement originally made by the Attorney-General, has challenged us to say whether we believe in an Upper House constituted as the Senate is. Before the Constitution B ill was adopted, I did not regard the constitution of the Senate as the best that we could have, and, with others, sought to the utmost of our ability to prevent it , by constitutional means, from being accepted. Now we have a proposal fro m the Government to alter the representation in the Senate, not in a constitutional way, but for party reasons having no connection with the constitutional issue. The basis on which the Senate is elected is one State one vote. Surely that can be allowed. one vote and one woman one vote, not on the ground of intellectual fitness, but because each man and each woman is a separate and distinctive entity in the community. For the constitution of a revising Chamber can you have a more logical basis than tlie equal representation of each State? -votes in the ,Senate for .every vote..pos-' sessed by New South Wales!'' must have been dreaming; wish to argue this question from a purely party point of view, because I seek to get from the Government a clear, definite, and distinct declaration. It is not a matter that can be passed on gently in order to see how the country feels 65 it. I am referring to a fundamental part of the Constitution, and the question must be tackled in a straightforward way. If the other Chamber, which is a co-ordinate Housei n some respects with this, is not to have a say in these matters, let it be wiped out altogether; but do not let any step with that object in view be associated w it h a political question of this kind that had no particular significance at the last general election. My last complaint aboub the Government is that they have no warrant from the electors to proceed with these Bills as they are doing, and that twelve months ago they had no justification in coming to tliis House without a programme, determined to do nothing unless they got these Bills. They are the worse enemies of Australia-worsee than trusts, combines, and monopolies, because they have an opportunity to protect the interests of the people and will not do it They do nothing, and prevent Parliament doing anything. A gentleman said today, "" Y o u seem to be busy up at the House"" ; and the reply was, "" No, nothing is being done; and that is precisely what the Government want."" They have stopped business for party political ends'. They have hindered the machinery of government in Australia for more than a year in the hope of getting a longer term with a majority in order to do what they have not the courage to do now. They have condemned much of the legislation passed by previous Federal Parliaments; they condemn it now secretly and viciously under the breath; but they say, We have provided for one man "" We shall not interfere with it now,, We cannot do it . "" But if they can get another election on a false 'issue, with powerful press influence behind them, they hope to get a majority; and knowing them as we know them, we do not hesitate to believe that they will then nob stop short of carrying out what are their intentions, but not what they have put before the' electors.

266,Mr Conroy,"^I just wish to saythe Liberals have brought forward with no hope of being able to pass it , I am astounded; because, if we are to judge by his own utterances, the restoration of the postal vote is one of the very first things that should be attended to. Speaking on the l l t h December, 1905, after the late Mr Batchelor had moved an amendment against some of the provisions of the postal vote, the Leader of the Opposition saidI am sorry to hear so many of my friends attacking the postal vote provisions of the Electoral Act. I regard those provisions as the necessary corollary to a universal franchise persons may have misused the privileges conferred by an Act of Parliament, we ought not to deprive even one eligible voter of the opportunity to exercise the franchise. One would imagine, from the statements of some honourable, members, that these postal votes are ope.i to the publio. As a matter of fact, they -re, and ought to be, as secret as if they were placed io the ballot-box. Then after an interjection by Mr Batchelor, he saidDoes he say that we cannot reach such offenders I not. sueh offences are proved, the Government which failed to reach their authors would not continue in office very long. Upon the proposal to require an elector who wishes to avail himself of the postal provisions of t h e Act to go before a postmaster, I am opposed to the honourable member for Boothby, for the reason that there are many cripples who are mentally sound, but whom it would be absolutely impossible to take to a post-office. Why should they be deprived of the right to exercise the franchise f The honourable and learned member for Corio points out that the mere fact of another person looking at the signature of a voter is an offence. In these circumstances, the honourable member w ill see that we are merely restoring the provisions of the Electoral Act to which he gave his f u l l support. with the sick and invalid alone. stores the postal vote as it was, but with further safeguards against the violation of it . safeguards ? penalty for looking at the signature of a voter. adopted, a good many safeguards were passed, so many' that the honourable member for Gwydir pointed out that we f a n a danger of abolishing the chance of its being properly exercised. When we look at the number of votes exercised, and at how many thousands of women who think it much more pleasant to vote in that way, and when we think of the number of people who reside 4 or 5 miles from a polling booth-whe n we add them all up, the surprise to us as a Parliament is that greater advantage was not taken of the postal vote. grant facilities to those people, but not to everybody. ing the electoral law exactly as it was beBecause certain fore, and to try to deal with the matter in any other way is to endeavour to throw dust in the eyes of the public. The honourable member's remark cannot be said to be a genuine and valid excuse. The number of persons who exercised the postal vote throughout the Commonwealth at the last election in which that vote was in use was only 29,000, and in some constituencies there were not more than 1,500 postal votes recorded, although there were as many as 35,000 voters on the rolls of some electorates. 35,000. number on the roll, and the highest number of postal votes recorded in any one constituency was, I think, 1,430. Therefore, all this talk about the abuse of the postal vote, and about the necessity of safeguarding the public against imaginary dangers is not correct. in Queensland, and everywhere else. happened in Queensland, but the evil could not have been great, otherwise the Ministry, of which the honourable member was head, would have put the Act into force. I give the honourable member tliat much credit, that if there had been any frau d he and his Ministers would have been too sound in administration to allow such a thing to take place without trying to fit the punishment to the crime. The total number of postal votes polled in Queensland was only 4,020, so that the proportion was not very great. member see that that is the same proWhen the provisions were first portion as for the Commonwealth as a whole? same proportion, which"" is exactly what one would expect, . ad Queensland is",34,Second Reading

In fact, I should expect a closely settled constituency like Melbourne to exercise a slightly larger proportion of postal votes than country constituencies, because there are perhaps alarger number of old people who have come to live in the cities, and a greater number of women who are necessarily living in the big centres. In the circumstances I have mentioned, any objection on the part of honourable members opposite to the passage of this Bill must be on the ground that they do not propose to allow any legislation brought forward by the present Government to pass. When welook up the utterances of honourable members, this seems to be the very measure that they ought not to have opposed, seeing how carefully it was selected to meet their wishes, as expressed in the utterances by the honourable members for Wide Bay, Gwydir, and Herbert, and other honourable members. seems, as if the Prime Minister had gone to extremes in his desire to meet the wishes of the Opposition, aud to try to legislate on a matter in regard to which this House has always been in entire accord. That is to say, all the leaders and Ministers of the Labour party were fully in accord with the restoration of the postal-vote provisions. Therefore, when this Bill was brought forward, so far from being treated as introducing an element of discord, it ought to have been accepted as a matter of harmony between us all, ward as a test measure. said at that particular time about a constitutional difficulty, beyond the expression of opinion by members on both sides of the House that with parties so equally balanced it would be difficult for the Government to carry on, unless a spirit of conciliation were shown by the Labour party. To cultivate that spirit of conciliation, and to try to meet the wishes of members of the Opposition, what did the Government do? They ransacked Hansard to ascertain what Bills the Opposition were likely to agree to. found that the Leader of the Labour party, and the great bulk of Labour members, expressed the desire that the provisions of the postal vote should be in. operation. measure, and such is the. forceof party, opposition that, I regret to say, honourable members seem not to recognise the olive branch that is thrown out to them, but treat the Bill as if it were a measure which had been brought down by the Government in a manner hostile to them. If honourable members were not treating this Bill in an absolutely party spiritif they were desirous of supporting any legislation at call-the y would recollect what they said in times past, and would bear in mind the words of the honourable member for Wide Bay, that "" We ought not to prevent any citizens exercising the franchise if it is possible to grant it to them."" I have already said that 29,000 citizens did exercise the franchise by means of the postal vote when it was last in use, and those people we now debar from exercising the franchise: Therefore, hon-. orable members can only be opposing this Bill in a spirit of factious opposition. I am glad to hear that the memI t really bers of the Opposition are not going to put forward much argument against the measure; they will only vote, no doubt being anxious to restrict discussion, lest they should be confronted with their own speeches on the subject. I think it is only right that the country should know that the Labour party are acting in such a spirit of opposition that the very measure which the Government have picked out as the measure which more members spoke in favour of than any other measure that could be suggested, is being opposed by them most bitterly, as if it were likely to injure thousands instead of being a boon to thousands of people. Again, on behalf of the great mass of workers in this community, I take exception to the utterance of the honourable member for Wide Bay that, merely because of monetary or social influences, electors will vote against their own convictions. ber said that money and social circumstances were brought into play, and that those interfered with the exercise of that right to vote that ought to be exercised freely by every adult. It is clear that We that slander-if one is to treat it as such . -can . only apply to the working people who support the Labour party.

I decline to believe that amongst the honest, sound workmen of 'Australia can be found people so amenable to influence as to barter their votes for money or for a word of praise. If that is the case, the sooner we find out those voters and take the franchise away from them the better. And the sooner the members of the Labour' party cease talking about such voters being "" the voice of God"" the better, because clearly men of that type are much more fitted to belong to the criminal class than to any other. On behalf of the ordinary average elector -of Australia, I must take exception to the statement made by the Leader of the Labour party that amongst the workers there are so .many with Labour tendencies who yet vote against their convictions. I do not believe that statement, and I say that the honourable member's remarks are a slander on so many workers in the community that ought not to be uttered by a member professing to be acting in the interests of Labour. Members of the Opposition should cease cackling about protecting the interests of Labour when we find them opposing a Bill that would recognise the right of the whole of the workers of Australia as against the 400,000 who are organized. "" No ; we will stand for the 400,000 organized men, and they may be able, by reason of their organization, to beat the others who are disorganized."" member means that nobody is to live unless he belongs to a union, let him say so. However, I am not going to be drawn into an argument as to whether everybody should belong to a.union or not. All I contend is that, whether a man is in a union or out of one, if he has the right and the capacity to exercise a vote, but is in ill-health, or; for any of various other reasons mentioned in the Bill, is unable to attend a polling booth, he should be given an opportunity to vote. We seek to broaden the franchise. I am not going, to argue at this moment whether this is the simplest way to do it , or .whether the mere restoration of'the postal vote would be the best method' which one would wish to adopt to give effect to our desire, but in this way we are restoring those clauses of the previous Electoral Act which allowed a postal vote to be recorded. It is manifest from their opposition to this Bill that members of the Opposition would, if they had the chance, deprive the people of'the country of any opportunity of exercising a postal vote. party knock the postal vote out in Queensland ? with what any party did in Queensland or elsewhere. Considering the expressions of opinion from members on both sides, and the number of members who, by their previous speeches, were fully committed to the postal vote, I say that the Labour party, in opposing this Bill, are acting unwisely. They may be blocking legislation, but I am not sure that that is a good party move, even at the present time, although the people have not had a f u l l opportunity of understanding what has been done. Where the general elector has an opportunity of seeing what is being done by the Labour party, and of seeing how it may Tall to his lot to be deprived of his vote, and to hundreds of others who are mentally capable of voting, but who are incapacitated by illness from going to a polling booth, the elector Honourable members say, must, if he believes in adult franchise, record his vote against those people who seek to deny him and other citizens of their right to vote. We seek to restore the postal vote, which 29,000 electors exercised on a previous occasion. By the action of the Labour party, probably an even greater number were deprived of the opportunity of voting at the last election, because once the provisions were better understood they would be made more use of, and many people would have been able to exercise the vote who, not aware of the absent-voting provisions, found, themselves disfranchised through being unable to attend a polling booth. member tell us what became of the thousands of the postal votes that were not recorded after they were issued? pear that in one or two cases postal vote papers were missing, it is manifest that' they were never recorded at'.alT.

It is precisely the type of men who are constantly breaking the law that we recognise as belonging to the criminal type. The Government have met the Opposition in a spirit of conciliation. The Government Preference Prohibition Bill, for instance, did not affect awards made by the Arbitration Court. It related only to Government employees. I would have gone very much further, but the Government apparently desired to conciliate honourable members opposite, just as they are accommodating them now in connection with this Bill. There has been too much conciliation. I would have cleared the ground at once, and would have said that no man has a right to force another-to enter a union, and to contribute to funds which may be used by secretaries or any one else for political purposes. The Opposition have been met by the Government in a spirit of conciliation, and yet they are not satisfied. They talk of the two test Bills. The Bills were really to test the sincerity of the Opposition-to test whether they would allow us to do any business.

They are afforded an opportunity to vote with us to restore the postal vote system, and if they avail themselves of it they will show that they have at last reached the stage of repentance.

Although all these safeguards were contained in the amending Electoral -Bill introduced last September, the Government now asks us to pass a B ill providing that sections 3, 4, 14, 23, 35, and 38 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1911 shall be repealed, and the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-9 which were repealed by those sections revived and re-enacted. I u other words, Ministers now propose to go back to the provisions relating to the exercise of the postal vote which were contained in the Act of 1909, although in September of last year they regarded those provisions as lamentably deficient in safeguards against bribery and corruption. object to those safeguards? MrJ . H . CATTS -No. The Government dropped the B ill during its second reading stage. TheB ill , besides providing for the safeguards to which I have referred, made an attack upon the secrecy of the ballot; and had the B ill been passed, it would have revived a condition of things that obtained in 1830, the time of the rotten boroughs. out to Ministers that they had got themselves into a hole by interfering with the secrecy of the ballot by compelling each elector to sign the butt from which his ballot-paper, numbered in the same way, was torn, Ministers dropped the B ill . member is not now discussing the B ill before the Chair.

' Mr J. H . CATTS -The B ill provides for the re-enactment in their entirety of the repealed sections of the Act of 1909, which provide for postal voting; and the Government is clearly convicted of hypocrisy in connection with the introduction of the present B ill , because in September last it introduced a B ill to amend the Electoral Act , which provided for the restoration of postal voting surrounded with the safeguards thab I have mentioned, all of which are now omitted. The omission of these safeguards shows that the present B ill is introduced for an ulterior purpose, and not bond fide' for the re-establishment of the postal vote. The Prime Minister, in referring to-day to the invalids and women folk, spoke with his tongue in his cheek, having regard to the B ill introduced last SeptemWheni t was pointed ber and immediately abandoned. If the postal vote were surrounded with reasonable safeguards, such as those suggested last session, there would be less objection to ib.

332,Mr Speaker,"I have not yet beentreat Ministers is to give them the Bill as soon as possible. We know that they have no other legislative proposals that they seriously wish to bring forward. Let them go to the Governor General and receive the rebuff which they are sure to get. Then we shall have a change of Government, and there will be a chance of getting needed legislation of a national character. no intention of occupying much time, but after the glaring statements of the honourable members for Wide Bay and Cook, I should be wanting in my duty to my electors and the country if I made no reply. The honourable member for Cook has stated that the Government should have inserted in this Bill the safeguards contained in the amending Electoral Bill of last year; but, according to honourable members opposite, the weak thing about the Amending Bill was that the safeguards introduced were not sufficient to prevent corruption in connection with the exercise of the postal vote. Now, if there was one point on which they centred their attack on the Bill, it was the weakness of the safeguards proposed. Yet the honourable member for Cook has the audacity to say that were those safeguards incorporated in this Bill, honourable members opposite would vote for it. Eor three or four weeks the Amending ElectorarBill was discussed until we were sick and tired of it, the whole attack being centred upon the weakness of the safeguards proposed for the protection of the postal vote. I represent a country electorate, and I think that it is high time that the opinions of the country electors should be voiced. ' The people living in the country are the backbone They are the pioneers who have sacrificed the pleasures of living in big cities, : where there are all .the advantages of eduprovision is that stated by the honourable cation, amusement, and where there are .churches, telephones, and everything that makes life agreeable, and where, at poll. ing time, all a man has to do is, perhaps, to go across the road and record a vote. Country electors should have equal rights with city electors. . Honourable members boast of the principle of "" one man one ' vote, one. vote one value "" ; ""but where does honourable members, that, the Liberals are equality of value come in when one rrfan has,' perhaps, to travel fo*"" flays to reclasses, who; should not Beucompelled «jfe> 1 cord his vote-the honourable member for Maranoa has repeatedly told us that many electors in his district have to travel 100 miles to record their voteswhile in the city a man can jump on a tram and record his vote in ten minutes? In the country a man may have to spend a week or ten days in order to record his vote. Yet honourable members have the audacity to say, as a party, that they believe in the principle of "" one man one vote, one vote one value."" Their claim is simply nonsense. There is no such thing as "" one value "" in it, when a man in the city can vote in ten minutes, and the man in the country has to lose, perhaps, ten days in order to vote. In regard to the safeguards attached to postal voting, if we look into the absent-voting provisions dealing with persons who are leaving Australia for other countries, we find that the conditions under which these people vote are. exactly similar to those under which they are asked to vote under the postal-voting provisions. The difference is that between tweedledum and tweedledee; it is so microscopic that it may be said to be invisible. Honourable members put that provision in regard to absent voting on the statute-book because they knew that the majority of the sailors who would vote under it would be voting for their side, and, so long as they secured a majority by means of that system, they were perfectly satisfied with it , though they strongly objected to postal voting, because at one election the Liberal party secured a majority of 12,000 votes, which was the assertion of the three Labour Senate candidates in New South Wales. They made that statement at Dubbo and Wellington, and in other parts of the State. It was repeatedly said that, through the postal-vote proviand sinew of the land. sions, the Liberals got a majority of 12,000 votes. One reason more than another why I support the postal-voting member for Werriwa, that the rich people have motor cars and buggies, whereas the poorer people have fo tramp to the polling booths, Those who have to. tramp long distances to polling booths . should, be permitted to vote by post.

The honourable member for Wide Bay occupied some little time in dealing with the system in force in Queensland some years ago. Queensland system with the Commonwealth system. I wish he had done so. He told us how Queensland had first adopted postal voting, and then abolished ston ; but he did not quote his own speech in which he favoured it, because it did not suit his purpose to do so. Nor did he tell the House that the system had been re-introduced into Queensland; and he did not speak of the numerous safeguards attaching to the Commonwealth system, and of the few in regard to the Queensland system. Between the two systems there was as wide a difference as the difference between the poles. Then the honourable member inferred-and it was a wicked insinuation-that the postal-voting system opened the door to fraud and corruption, and that money could purchase scores of votes for the Liberals. The honourable member travelled through New South Wales during the recess, and complained about the manner in which the Prime Minister had slandered the electors of Australia, but the insinuation of the honourable member that the votes of the sick and crippled and halt, and those far removed from polling booths, could be bought, was a most gross slander upon the people of Australia. words being uttered by one professing to lead the Labour party. member explained that facilities for voting had been extended to all hospitals. He showed that the inmates of hospitals and such-like institutions could vote. But if they have that right, why should not those outside hospitals have it-the sick, laid up in their own homes? Why discriminate? of the Opposition knows well that the class who are likely to vote for him will be inmates of hospitals, while those who are laid up in their own homes are likely tb vote for the Liberals. That is the inference I draw from the argument of the honourable member. that people who are so sick that they are either mentally incapacitated or. enfeebled in mind, and are, perhaps,"" not conscious of what they are doing, should have votes, yet people in their f u l l mental capacity are to be denied the right to vote by post if they happen to be mora than 5 miles from a polling booth. The franchise in Australia was He did not compare the the most perfect under the sun until tbe Labour party interfered with the inestimable privilege granted to the people living over 5 miles from a polling booth; and those who are sick and infirm; and w» cannot say that Parliament'is representative of all the electors until we give all the electors the right to vote. When we extend the right to vote to every person, no matter what his position may be, or what may be the condition of his health, we shall be representative of the whole of the electors of Australia. In New South Wales and Victoria, there are pastoral and agricultural societies composed of both Labour and Liberal members of the community. These societies do not recognise parties, they comprise all parties, and the members have real happy times at their annual shows. Each society has a board of directors, or committee of management, and the method of electing these directors is to send out ballot-papers' to be filled in and returned by post. Each member has a postal vote sent to him. There are no complaints about the system. Though there are many Labour members on these committees, they do not complain. They are perfectly satisfied with the system. The local governing boards of New South Wales have power to adopt the prinI can hardly imagine such ciple: of voting by post, and half the shires in that State have adopted it / The honourable And those councillors, six for each shire, are elected by the postal vote in many shires. There is no complaint about it ; there are no indignation meetings throughout the country to protest against that application of the postal-vote system. The people are perfectly satisfied, and everything goes on all Simply because the Leader right. Another instance is that of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the biggest financial institution in Australia.

Surely if bhe principle is good enough for the Australian Mutual Providenb Society, for the local governing bodies and for other institutions, there is abundant reason why it should likewise be satisfactory as part of our electoral law. I .am not speaking with any party feeling, but because I am honestly interested in the country people of Australia, and for their sake I support this Bill. I may be permitted to relate a little experience of my own. A few years ago I vislbed tbe Bourke district, with a view to buying Winbar station, along the Darling River. The station comprises about half-a-million acres, and carried a lot of sheep; it seemed a very cheap proposition. The homestead was 20 miles from a polling booth, and the boundary-rider lived some 40 miles from the homestead. When we reached his hut, we were discussing politics with him, and he told us that in order to record his vote he was obliged to travel 40 miles to bhe homestead and then another 20 miles to the polling booth, making a total of 60 miles. I consider that that man ought to have the right to vote by post. have found a justice of the peace within shorter distance than he had to travel to a booth. As soon as one mentions ljustices of the peace there is a storm of abuse from the Opposition side; but a very careful analysis made in this House only a few months ago showed that there Were more justices appointed from the Labour side than from this side.

' -We are again confronted by bhis measure, which is placed before bhe House to effect a purpose bo which bhe Governmenb declare bhey are irrevocably committed. .That being so, we have a right to inquire whab that purpose is. While that inquiry is pertinent and proper in connection, with all measures, it is emphatically necessary in the case of a measure which, on the, face of it , is designedly introduced for the purpose, not of giving votes to those who have no votes now, but to afford the party on the Government bench an opportunity of going to the counbry while bhe voting machinery remains as it is. That is to say, this Bill is a sham. I contend that if this Bill were rightly treated, you, Mr Speaker, as custodian of the liberties and privileges of the House, would declare it to be an abuse of the processes of this Legislature, because the time of the representatives of the people could surely be better occupied bhan in a fubile discussion on a mabter which, by no manner of means, can affect bhe well-being of any human being in bhis country. The rapidly increasing number of orations: which we hearfrom, the Government bench in favour of this much-needed, reform, as it is called, are intended, not for bhe purpose to which they are temporarily attached by label, bub for anobher and quite obvious purpose.

Silting suspended from 6.30 to 7.^.5 p.m. first of all as a measure of electoral reform, the whole circumstances show it to be a sham. Let us look at the position broadly. The electoral, law of the Commonwealth is the most liberal in the world. The present Act, which was passed by the Labour Government, ex' tends the franchise more widely than that of any other country, and does so without respect bo creed or status. It makes no distinctions,, and sets up no obstructions. One of the results of this law-on e most surprising the Opposiand distasteful to the present Government-was , that a larger poll was recorded at the last general election than ever before. That the Government should introduce this measure as one of extreme urgency, as one which ought properly to be considered before any of those important measures upon which it was returned is, bo say the least, a piece of partisan hypocrisy which, in the circumstances, is quite inexcusable :' If there is 1 'a need for an amendment of the electoral law, there is no excuse for the at-",43,Second Reading

It is a matter of detail, a question concerning the electoral machinery of the country, and that alone. It certainly is a travesty upon affairs, as we know them, that a party embracing all the Conservative forces of the Commonwealth should pose before the country as reformers of the electoral law. It has been a favourite device of Conservatives the world over, and at all times, first of all to ignore reform, and then to choke it by the introduction of specious imitations of, or pretences at, reform. The Government calls itself a Liberal Administration. be denied by any impartial person that in every country there are forces which stand for Conservatism and reaction. Behind which party are those forces to-day ? For the Government which stands where it does, and lives, every day, by reason of the support of the extreme reactionaries of the Commonwealth, to pose as reformers of the electoral machinery of Australia would be a most amusing circumstance if it did not have its tragic side. the lineal descendant of those estimable gentlemen who opposed the Catholic Emancipation Bill, who opposed the extension of the rights of complete citizenship to the Jews, and who have at all times hung on, and still hang on, to a property qualification. descendant of those estimable gentlemen who hang on to, and depend for their chance of success in Great Britain today upon, the retention of the property qualification, and who in this very State -for honourable members oj4>osifce cannot dissociate themselves from their supporters^-ar e dependent for their position upon the property qualification as it exists in the Legislative Council. Labour party, on the other hand, has a clean and a clear record in this matter. It has always stood for the extension of the franchise. It has lived to see the day when every man and woman in this country has, or ought to have, a vote, and can get a vote. But it has seen the day when a right honourable member of the present Government was returned to Parliament-thi s was in "" the good old .days ""-wit h a constituency of, I think, thirty-nine, or, ib may have been, forty voters. I would not rob the right honourable gentleman of one in such suggestive circumstances. thirty-seven. make it an even forty. That such a party should pretend that its one object in life is to extend the right to vote bo the sick and infirm of this country is really astounding. What do the members of that party care about the sick, the aged, and the infirm ? If they thought anything at all about them, if they had one honest desire to extend the vote, would they invite this Parliament, as they have done, and are doing, to reject this measure? This Bill pretends to extend fche power to vote to persons who do nob Ifc certainly will not possess it, yet we are invited not to pass, but to reject it.

The forces behind the Labour party have been responsible for every extension of the franchise during the last twenty years. We have lived to see the property qualification destroyed. We have lived to see the vote extended from men to adults. We have destroyed utterly those barriers of caste The which were set up by the progenitors of those noble reformers whom we see on the Government side of the House. Some of them smile at even the faintest suggestion that there is any connection, hereditary or otherwise, between them and the forces of Toryism in Britain.

Let us look at it fairly. Why are we asked again to consider this measure? The Senate, when the Bill was sent up last session, made a number of amendments. Those amendments, which were subsequently rejected by the Government, made ample provision whereby every infirm or sick person throughout Australia could vote. It was not enough, however, that ample provision was made. We must accept this Bill as it stands, without the alteration of if they have not the right now. No mata comma, without even an attempt to make it read as an intelligent effort at legislation. I venture to say that this Parliament has never before seen a measure drawn as tins has been. On the face of. it , there is nothing from which any layman could gather anything at all of its purpose. It defies, any attempt at open amendment or even at plain discussion. It is introduced for the deliberate purpose of creating a dead-lock. To suppose for one moment that the framers of the Constitution intended section 57 to be abused in this fashion is to suppose that they were traitors to the Commonwealth . The Government has set about deliberately creating a crisis upon a relatively trivial part of the electoral machinery. It does so without excuse or provocation. measure of electoral reform in face of the fact that the franchise to-day in this country is extended to all sorts and conditions of men and women, irrespective of creed or status. It does so in face of the fact that the Senate has agreed to amendmentswhich would extend the franchise to even those persons who, the Government now alleges, are denied the franchise. One of the chief grounds for criticism against the Labour party at the last election .was that the Electoral Act was too liberal, and that, in the absence of safeguards, it permitted fraud. wholesale fraud had been committed; but the most ingenious, . the most meticulous research into the matter has failed to bring forward a tittle of evidence in support of that charge, ffevertheless, the investigation has proved thafc fchere was a heavier poll than ever before, fchat there was no fraud, .and thafc the ..whole trouble; was that^a* larger prorr portion of persons cast their votes for Mr Hughes. Labour than against it. This measure invites irregularities, and threatens to destroy the secrecy of the ballot. The Government pose as being feverishly anxious to effect electoral reform; but what is the position? They say that there are thousands of persons in the country who are, or may be, prevented from voting at the next election. They know very well, of course-sinc e they invite us to reject this measure-that nothing that we can do here can give the people the right to vote ter how the Government posture or attempt to explain away the fact, they can never get out of the dilemma that at the present time no effort is being made by 1 them to remedy what they consider to be an unfortunate state of affairs. Last sessionthe Government did introduce a Bill dealing with electoral reform; but, after carrying it to its second reading; fchey dropped ifc. There are two things that may be said of that Bill-first , that the measure in itself was the complement to the measure before us; and, second, that it proposed to create certain safeguards on the use of the postal vote. But the safeguards in that Bill have now been deliberately and brutally abandoned. This measure, which, along with the safeguards, was quite a different thing, and It introduces this sham might have been discussed fairly, is, as it stands now, naked, without any pretence at those necessary safeguards which ought to be attendant upon any appeal to the people. This measure is. the sole contribution by the Government towards, electoral reform, and it is introduced for the deliberate purpose of being rejected. I ask honourable members opposite to remember,when they are on the hustings, and facefcoface wifchfchepeople, as they soon will be-wher e posturing will no longer serve them-that , with all they have said and done, they have never made We were told that one honest effort to pass a lawfcoextend the vote to the sick and infirm.

I am not going -to say anything on. that measure by way of criticism-good , bad, or indifferent; but. that was a measure for the. purpose of, being, passed into, law, ^whereas the measure. before us is introduced for the purpose of being thrown underneath the table.

I wish to say nothing further on that point, because I do not care about participating in an obvious fraud; and I deliberately call this measure a legislative fraud.

They say that we are opposed to the extension of the postal vote. That is absolutely untrue. We welcome any attempt to enfranchise any section of the community which, by accident or adverse circumstance, is at present prevented from voting. The more the voters, the better for the Labour party. Honourable members can read the writing on' the wall. At every election since 1900 there has been an ominous increase in the number of votes polled, and a more than corresponding increase in the number of Labour members returned to Parliament. What have we to lose by an appeal to the people ? But what have the people as a whole to hope for from the party opposite ? Nothing. hour, when at length the Government has succeeded by what it must regard as Mr Hughes. an unfortunate set of circumstances in obtaining what it pretended to want, do Ministers say, "" This is the programme Every man and woman upon which we propose to go to the country?"" Do they show a readiness to advance that legislation which they have concealed successfully for twelve months ? No. They say that the country is running downhill towards financial bankruptcy; but is there any indication of proposals for re-establishing our financial stability? We are face to face with great social questions, yet the Government offers no solution. All we have is the resuscitation of this wretched sham, uponwhich, the people are told, the Government will stand or fall. It is a worthy measure upon which the Ministry have elected to stand or fall, a thing after I their own heart and likeness, the shadow of a sham; without vitality, without purpose, moving without direction, having no origin which it can claim, and no objective. Al l I wish to make clear is that, in spite of the Bill being a sham, I shall not allow the Government to place on my shoulders the blame of refusing to give to the sick 'of this country a vote. Let them bring down a measure, to be force at the next election,'to give a vote to the sick, the aged, the infirm, those whoin any instance, or by whatever mischance, may be prevented from voting, and I shall support it, providing only that the proper and necessary safeguards surround it which are demanded in all They electoral enactments. able member's Government not do this? ber was, no doubt, asleep in a political hollow log at the time, and does not know that while in office the Labour Government enfranchised the people of Australia for the first time.

The only restrictions we allowed were designed to prevent the repetition of frauds so gross and obvious that no genuine champion could be found to fight their battle.

But nothing will serve honourable members opposite but the rejection of a l l proposals for amendment. To that I shall be no party, and, therefore, I shall vote against the Bill.

They saidYour Committee are of opinion that the sections allowing voting by post should be amended. Ko objection was taken to subsections (ft) and (c) of section 109. Even if the evidence of serious abuse of sub-section (a) testified to by witnesses, does not establish the facts alleged, yet it is clear that the subsection is open to serious abuse. Without concluding that undue influence was used iu connection with the postal vote, the evidence adduced shows that under the present subsection advantage may be taken to destroy the. A r e they not aware that free and secret exercise of the franchise. The' application forms may be witnessed in blank, and these forms may be taken iu numbers by agents for candidates when canvassing, and pressure brought to bear upon persons whose namea are on the roll. The evidence justifies your Committee in finding that many persons who voted by post had not reason to believe tbey would be more than five miles from their polling place on the day of election, and were on that day within that limit. It would appear that the voting facilities provided have been used contrary to the intention of the Act. The provisions of this section were freely, Should they not be so, why availed of. At the general election held on the 16th December, 1903, postal votes were recorded to the number of 10,143 out of a total number of 887,312, equivalent to the proportion of 1.14 per eent.

The figures show that there must be some reason for thc concentration of the practice of voting by post in Melbourne. A return which the Department has supplied me with shows tliat at the last general election 10,124 postal votes were recorded throughout Australia, and of that number inore than half, namely, 5,223, were recorded in Victoria. W ill any honourable member justify that little mouthful of territory that is called Victoria having more postal votes than the rest of Australia ? Let me continue my evidence. But , as it is rather lengthy, I shall give the gist of it . bourne, in the March elections, there were applications for 815 postal votes. In the whole of South Australia, with its territory of 903,690 square miles"", there were only 598 postal votes. honestly given, it does not matter who voted by post. tralia, with an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles, there were only 321 postal votes recorded; and in Tasmania, there were only 240 postal votes. Surely there must be something wrong when one twenty-third of the State of Victoria could record more postal votes than Western Australia and Tasmania put together. the aristocratic portion of the electorate that recorded these votes. Jolimont, with 4,442 votes, had only 1.10 postal votes; whereas the little Gipps Ward, with 3,078 votes, had 368 postal votes; proving that Tasmania did not have as many postal votes as the ninth part of the electoral division of Melbourne. The PrimeM in ister has said that honourable members of the Opposition always sneer and laugh when any reference is made to giving votes to sick men and women. I throw back thab assertion, and ask bhe Prime Minister bo look ab bhe evidence and reporb of bhis Selecb.

There was a scrutineer for each side, and the ballot box was taken to the bedsides, and the old people could give their votes. That was under the freer franchise of the Federal Government, because .the Labour party are strong in Federal politics; but they are not allowed to record their vobes under the electoral law of the State of Victoria, because in that State a Liberal Government dominates affairs, and is descending to the vilest means possible by saying that a man who lives in the country should have twice the voting power of the man who lives in the ciby.

I have a declaration by a woman, who states that I will omit the names, which honourable members may see by referring to the evidenceI was pressed by Lonsdale-street, who brought two policemen to witness my application for a vote by post.

Another gentleman making a declaration saysDuring the progress of the tallying of the votes after the ballot-boxes had been opened by the Returning Officer's deputy, I found about twenty ballot-papers (red ones) on the. floor under the table where I was then standing near. I picked them up, and handed them to the poll clerk, and he accepted same, and they were counted with the others. They had apparently fallen off the table on to the floor. That as soon as I gave them to liim, he put them on the form and sat on them, and when the counting took place, he included them in. the tally. I had previous to this pointed out to Constable Fallon that the said papers were on the floor, and he saw me hand them to the poll clerk. 1043.

Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, from the General Post Office to Victoriastreet, measures 1,000 yards, and within that area there are no less than seven different subdivisions of the division of Melbourne. for the officers to follow the recording of absent votes in such an electorate. the Latrobe subdivision, for instance, at the last election uo fewer than 3,321 absent votes were polled. vote system is restored without any limitation, then every elector on each side of the street will be able to make use of it , and the polling booths w ill be overburdened. vote by post at the polling booths? votes were collected prior to the day of election. When the B ill goes into Committee I hope honourable members will seriously consider the desirableness of providing that in centres of population, at all events, the postal votes shall be collected by electoral officers. I do not accuse any honourable member opposite of desiring to take unfair advantage of the postal-vote system, or of stooping to bribery aud corruption; but I claim that they should join with us in making it as pure as possible, and purity in connection with it can be secured only by providing for the collection of postal votes by officers of the Department. the postal votes recorded at the last election at which the system was in force could have been collected in that way. able member collect them in the country districts ? bribery and corruption in connection with the system are f a r more difficult in rural than in city electorates. congested centres of population that the power of the purse can be brought to bear. who, if guaranteed protection, is willing to prove that he knew how ninety-five Out of every 100 persons voting in the Gipps division for my opponent recorded their votes. fore us last session the following amendment was introduced by the Senate, but Was rejected by this HouseAu elector who, owing to serious illness or infirmity, has reason to believe that he wUl not h i able to record his vote at any polling place during the hours of polling on the day of election may at any time after the issue of the writ and up to within seven days preceding the day of election make application to the Returning Officer of tlie Division in which he is enrolled that he be allowed to record his vote. The Returning Officer on a day previous to the election, and after the time for receiving It is therefore very difficult applications has expired, shall appoint an Assistant Returning Officer, who shall prior to or In on the day of election call at the address of the person who claims a vote. The Assistant Returning Officer, I preI f the postalsume, would be an officer of the Department. The expense of carrying out that provision would not be as large as is involved in the appointment of permanent Divisional Returning Officers, although I think that the action of the Government in making those permanent appointments is f u l l y justified. Before concluding, I wish to make a quotation from the evidence given by Colonel Miller before the Select Committee of 1904The facilities afforded by section X. of the Act, to be of public utility and value, must be elastic, but, at the same time, they should be so safeguarded as to render their abuse at once difficult and involving a serious penalty. The provision was intended to enable electors who would bond fide be prevented, to the best of their belief, from personally recording their vote, to exercise their right of franchise; but the result of the practical experience gained shows that there are several means by which it is possible to apply these facilities in a manner which was not contemplatedfor instance :(fl) The ""Application Forms"" may be witnessed in blank, and these forms may Two-thirds of be taken in numbers by agents for candidates when canvassing for votes, and pressure brought to bear upon persons whose names are on the roll. (b) There is an increased risk of impersonation. (c) As a personal signature of the application is not imperative, tbe door is open to any person to sign for or I recognise that on behalf of the applicant. (d) That these facilities are wrongly made use of by persons who have no reason, bond fide, to believe they will It is in closely be absent more than five miles from the polling place for which they are enrolled, or who are not bondfidei l l , or otherwise prevented from recordThere is in this city to-day a man ing their votes in person, especially bearing in mind the very, liberal regulations made under section 13° of the Act. Honourable members opposite may say In the B ill which was be that, notwithstanding that the voting by post system was abolished in Queensland, every member of the State Parliament, from the Premier downwards, pointing the finger of scorn at it , it has again been introduced.

I have been informed that justices of the peace were appointed, not in tens or fifteens, bufc in hundreds, and thafc every one of them could earn from £ 2 10s. to £ 3 10s. per week in collecting postal votes. them did earn more. Government, if the postal vote system is restored, will introduce additional safeguards. tried to prevent, any mau or woman exercising the franchise. from the first, tried fco broaden fche franchise, and in this Statei t was ouly after repeated attacks by Labour men that Liberal Governments were iuduced to give the workers fair play iu this respect. No inember of our party would wilfully prevent any elector from voting, but we can never forget fche infamies that obtained under the postal voting system which was previously in force in the Commonwealth. existed here, was an absolute curse. We can, if we choose, so frame this B ill with sufficient safeguards to prevent bribery aud corruption, as to make ifc an honour to tlie country ; and I do not believe there is a single man here who does nob desire to make it as perfect as possible. Why nofc join hands in the work? fche B ill was introduced by Mr Kingston, wifch whom I remember collaborating on .a StateB ill in South Australia in 1896; and he was nofc likely to do auy injustice. Dr. Kingston was one of the few statesmen Australia has produced, and his name is revered as a type of Liberal legislator which, I am sorry to say, is not too often met with in our State Parliaments. fche South Australian Act only postmasters and postmistresses, fche case of a woman about to become a mother, a doctor can act as witnesses in connection with a vote, which almost corresponds to a postal vote; and if we had a similar provision [68]2 many of my objections would be reThe State Government, for moved. I do not know of any system of postal voting under the British flag outside of Australia. Because the conduct of many applies in many bodies associated or federated for trading purposes. States and couutries, and not deal wifch associated trading bodies. In all my reading I have not learned that tlie principle of postal voting applies in the United States of America, Prance, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Italy, or Belgium. Of course tliat is no argument, if the principle is innately good; and my I trust thafc the desire is to see Australia lead the van. I have never taken part in any election that has given less trouble than the last I have never prevented, or Pederal election, and I believe it was one of the purest ever held i u Our party, the world, jusfc as I believe that our roll is the most perfect. I remember once at an election in County Sligo, Ire-"" land, I , a perfect stranger, was asked to carry a bundle of ballot-papers from one booth to another, wliere fchere was a shortage. I did nofc understand tnen that candidates in fche Old Country had to pay the whole of the expenses of the election, including those of the officers and polling booths. Every ParliamentThe system, as it formerly ary seat in England costs from £1,100 to £5,000 to contest, whereas, under the Commonwealth Act , it is not possible for me to spend more than £ 1 0 0 , and I have merely to get a few electors to sign fche nomination paper and deposit £ 2 5 , which is returnable under certain conditions. If the Ministry, . even at this late hour, will accept the amendment I thiuk the principle of I have suggested, I am sure that honourable members on this side would be perfectly willing to support it . It is an amendment that has been endorsed by tbe Senate wifch practical unanimity; in deed, I do not believe that there was a ate has as much right as we have fco claim that it represents the people;and if their view be that as then enunciated, how can any one suggest that that In Chamber is against the aged and the sick having a vote ? We cannot stop and, in burglary, but, when he is caught, we can make it very awkward for the burglar; and so we can place proper safeguards in the B ill .

"" Let the Government bring in some measure for the benefit of a single part of Australia-to u p l if t humanity or make the conditions better for Australians-o r let them introduce a B ill insuring that land will be easily available „for settlement;, and I am confident it would very quickly pass. We should not then be asked to worry about two trumpery little Bills such as those the Government have put before us; but, in any case, the great newspaper which sways Victoria has covered the proposals with such contumely and contempt that I do nofc think the Governor General would dare to give a double dissolution upon them. [9.26] I do not know how to describe the Bill before us; but however I may do BO, it clearly has been introduced for the purpose of creating a feafcher-pillow crisis. Have either party any constitutional power to use the Parliament of the nation tp create a crisis simply for fche purpose of transforming the Governor General into a pernicious partisan? against modern civilization and Christian progress. When did fchis partisan business start? I have beard it said that party politics is one of the grand products of oid English intelligence. politics is not a product of England; it is the result of a suggestion by a Scotchman to a Dutchman. K in g William, of glorious, pious, and immortal memory, according to Sir Edward Carson and all Orangemen, wished fco undertake a European war. Prior to that time the Ministries of the country had been made up of Whigs and Tories-of the intelligent and progressive men from both sides of Parliament-and fchere was no party government as we understand it . K in g W i l lian spoke to the Scotchman about raising I am reminded that, now the money for the war, and the Scotchman said, "" The only hope you have is to appoint Ministers all from one side-ap point all Whigs and they will vote any way you desire, and break their necks to stay on the Treasury bench."" TheI f the Government cannot accept Scotchman was a true prophet, and the money was furnished for scandalous wars. When the Duke of Marlborough returned I am to England, he wished to revert to the old scheme of selecting intelligent business members of Parliament as Ministers; bufc when he, too, desired fco carry get on a war against France, he had to follow K in g William's advice; and we have had party government ever since. In this House half the members are trying to keep in office, and the other half are tryin g to get them out; and the whole position reminds me of an experience of mine in Western America. A friend and myself were crossing the prairies of Western Kansas when a buffalo charged us. I very quickly shinned up a tree while my friend took refuge inside a cave. My friend, however, kept running in and out of the cave, and every time he appeared the buffalo had another go at him. A t last I said, "" For goodness sake stop inside; why don't you stick in the cave?"" And he re(Darwin) plied, "" That's all very fine old man, but there's a bear and a rattlesnake inside."" That is the trouble of this Government. There is a bear and a. rattlesnake in the hole, and every time that the Prinie Minister goes in they drive him out, while the Attorney-General is "" up a tree."" tree "" when the election comes. . posed to these elections.

I had to fine half-a-dozen of the peace, and I was sorry to have to do that. Postal voting dulls the edge of honest political endeavour. It pollutes the stream that mingles with the currents of national political life, poisoning everything it touches. I have watched it carefully. If Australia wants to be a TammanyH a l l , put postal voting in this Bill for partisanship. Pointsi n New York at one election that, although there were only 7,000 or 8,000 names on the roll, 14,000 votes were polled. Postal voting will turn the abode of the feeble, the weak, the sick, and those suffering from senile decay into a dark cave of refuge for the unscrupulous organizer. All these things combined will contribute towards assisting materially in bringing us to the point where the postal vote becomes a stealthy, foul blackener of the characters of the people of Australia.
