Such motions shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate, (f) An affirmative vote of not less. than twenty-four members shall be necessary to carry any motion under this standing order. honourable members are in a frame of mind different from that in which they entered upon this debate, and that the mutual arrangement which has been come to will lead to that calm and unimpassioned discussion which the importance of the motion requires. The proposed change is so momentous that none of us can predict, what, -if agreed. to, its result It is only within the last three or four centuries that men have begun to entertain the idea that questions should be decided, by an appeal to reason. times the number .of followers possessed by a man determined the rightness aiid the wrongness of his actions.

A couple of centuries ago no one was permitted to publish reports of parliamentary proceedings, and the House of Commons had noprinted set of -rules to govern its procedure, it being left entirely for the Speaker to say what Was, and what was not, in order. Even to the present day, in Anglo Saxon communities, chairmen of public meetings are held to be possessed of an inherent power to say on what lines the discussion of the business before them shall proceed, and I believe that, even those presiding over municipal bodies and shire councils, are, in some instances, unfettered by rules in controlling debate. In some of the States Parliaments, standing orders which aim at the limitation of debate are in operation, whilst in others, the closure has been applied. I venture to say, however, that the adoption of rules for the suppression of debate, has, in nearly every instance, been attended with serious evil I could quote no better instance of tbe terrible misfortune attached to the exercise of a power such as that sought under the Government proposal, than will be. the consequences which ensued from the application of what were called decrees of urgency in the first and second French Parliaments after the Revolution of '89. In earlier Under these decrees, debate could be completely stifled. A motion could be hurriedly introduced, whenever it was desired, to prevent the use of arguments that might bring the people back to a calm consideration of the matter before them. honestly think that the closure would be so applied in this Parliament? But as more or less scatbe so used. They lent to an absolute abuse of. the powers of the majority.

14,Mr Conroy,"When the decrees of a protest against certain clauses in a proposed consolidation of some statutes.. He was proceeding to point out that a mistake, had been made in the consolidation, and that it really involved an alteration of the existing law, but almost immediately the closure was applied. It afterwards transpired that his view was absolutely correct, and that if he had been listened to a great amount of litigation, which arose out of the alteration to which he directed attention, would have been avoided. want of calm consideration, a consolidation of the laws which was intended to prevent litigation, resulted in a vast increase in the number of law cases. casion, two other honourable members who rose to support the attitude assumed by Mr orable members must see, that under the Levy, were, by the application of the closure, denied an opportunity to express -their views. When the honourable member for Maranoa asks me whether I think that the closure would be harshly applied in this House, I reply that, judging from experience, it probably would be. I will go even further. lowed my arguments, they will recognise that, after all, we are not a Parliament whose actions affect only one particular State. debate intended to regulate the proceedings of a unified Parliament. ture, we stand in an absolutely unique position as compared with the various Stafces Parliaments, the Standing Orders of which have been quoted by advocates of this proposal. We are not a unified Parliament, but a Federal Legislature, and that being so we must adopt entirely different methods of debate. The application of the closure might result in the representatives of some of the smaller States being denied an opportunity to ventilate their views. A t pre-sent the States are safeguarded by the fact that they oan appeal to the common sensethe broad sense of equity-of the public. If , however, honourable members are denied an opportunity to place before the public the rights and wrongs of a particular question,, it must be admitted that the States they represent are being retained in the Federation by force. If it be urged that the closure may not be applied, I ask why provision should be made for it? No power should be sought unless it is clearly necessary, and the necessity for the closure -can arise only when it becomes absolutely impossible to carry on the business of the -country in the absence of such a provision. Do honourable members mean to say that we could not have gone on sitting during ordinary hours for another month or six weeks, and have dealt with all the urgent measures on the business-paper? perience of the past, we could not have done so. honourable members of the Labour Party returned to this Parliament, if not. Thus, owing to the in order that they might take part in the debates, however extended they might be? I have always been in favour of the suppression of licence, but the Upon the same ocGovernment proposal goes far beyond that. It aims at the suppression of debate. Honproposed standing order, it would be within the power of the majority to decree, after a member had spoken for one minute, that he should be no longer heard, and to insure that the question should be put forthwith. As we see from the additional proposals of which the Prime Minister has given notice, If honourable members have f o lit is intended to introduce still further limitations of debate-in my opinion a breach of the agreement entered into to biing forward a set of standing We are not dealing with rules of orders even more stringent than that now under discussion. If the closure As a Legislabe applied it will not be possible for an honourable member to continue a debate, no matter how seriously the interests of his State may be affected. We may take it for granted that if an honourable meniber becomes what I may term too powerful in his arguments, some irascible or irrational member will probably seek to close the debate by the application of the closure, and as a consequence we shall have an absolute negation of discussion upon matters which should be fully and freely debated. I believe that I have made sufficiently clear the difference between what I have called a unified Parliament and this House. If the proposed new standing order is adopted we shall transfer to the Senate the power that now rests with this House, thus really increasing fhe power of a minority. The Senate has not brought into effect any s.uch provision up to the present time. If the people of fhe various States find that it is absolutely impossible to secure a f u l l expression of their views through their representatives in this House, we shall f a l l seriously in their estimation.

16,Mr Conroy,"Fo r what purpose werepractically unified Parliament, instead of being a. mere assemblage of representatives of. the States for the purpose of discussing matters, there might not be the same danger of the transfer of power and influence to which I have referred. Buti f the people of the smaller States form the impression that they may not be able to secure a f u l l and effective expression of their ideas in this House, bitterness of feeling, such as exists in Germany, will arise. One of the -reasons why honourable members can, after some of the most angry debates, walk away and talk matters over outside with an amount of good feeling that would be surprising had it not become customary amongst us, is member is under any limitation to present honourable members can uphold their principles to the fullest possible extent, and when overcome are prepared to submit with a good grace. When, however, rules are applied to prevent a f u l l expression of opinion, extreme bitterness of feeling is that' the probable effect of the application of the closure in this Chamber would be to cause some Of the States to rely for the expression their ' representatives By so much as we focus public attention upon the Senate, by so much shall we strengthen itsalready great powers. must -recollect that that body occupies a very different position from that of any second Chamber in the world. It is elected upon the same franchise as are members of this House. the members of the two Houses were elected upon the same franchise. orable member will scarcely regard that illustration as a good one. seeing that the people of Norway have recently established a separate form of Government. I am sure that he does not desire to bring about the separation of any of the States from the Commonwealth. good reason why this House should modify the terms of the motion under consideration. Their stringent character is beyond question. We are invited to allow a small section of members to affirm that an honourable member shall discontinue his remarks. That is tantamount to saying tp honourable members: "" You need not come prepared to address the House with a well-considered speech, which -is likely to. influence its judg-^ ment""; because if the fate of a Ministry were in the balance, what is more certain than that the closure would be applied, so. as to absolutely shut out from the discussion all our ablest debaters? One of the first occasions upon which a Government would justify the application of the closure would be that upon which, its own safety was threatened. Consequently when an Opposition was about to advance the strongest arguments against the gross misuse of Executive power, or against some maladministration, of so serious a character that no honourable as learned member think that the House would the expression of his views.

It is true that some Labour representatives voted upon the opposite of their views upon side applicable to all parties. Mr 'CONROY -Most certainly. But We there is no reason to suppose that this House will be more far-seeing than any legislative body which has preceded it. If honourable members are in favour of majority rule-as they profess to be-wh y are they not prepared to allow the closure to be applied only with the censent of the In Norway and Sweden majority of the House? Exclusive of Mr Speaker, there are seventy-four members of this Chamber, and. consequently, thirtyeight would be necessary to constitute a majority. work out all right if we could always insure a f u l l attendance.

Who suffer most by the passing of bad laws? The poorer workers of the community, because they have not the capital to go to law to seek redress. They can do ino more than suffer in silence. That is why I strongly object to the unnecessary multiplication of our laws. The rules of conduct by which men are guided are so -numerous ancl complex that no wise Parliament would attempt to deal with all of them. Most of them are determined absolutely by conditions of lif e to which Parliament is a stranger-conditions over which it has no control, and in respect of which, even if it had control, it could not attempt to legislate. The bulk of the citizens have no anxiety to come into conflict with the laws of the country; their only desire is to follow a course of conduct which will enable them to earn their daily bread witnout injury to their fellows. Laws are passed merely to prevent one man appropriating the work of another. Our desire should be to preserve peace, and to enforce the general well-being and security of the people, for it is in, that way alone that we can bring about the advancement of the community. House of Commons the closure can be applied on the affirmative vote of 200 members, or one-third of the total membership. Honourable members forget the difference between a unification and a federation. They also lose sight of the fact that not more than about 300 members of the House of Commons are supposed to attend regularly. It would be an extraordinary thing if 450 members were present at any general debate. When it is remembered that an affirmative vote of 200 members is required before the closure can be applied there, it will be realized that an entirely different state of affairs exists. It is a recognised custom there, too, for many members to pair for the session. Here members would lose their seats if they were absent for two months without the leave of the House. But that could not happen in the House of Commons, which, although it comprises 670 members, has seating accommodation for only 40b. It will be seen that when it fixed D i d not the honourable the affirmative vote for the application of the closure at 200, it proceeded on entirely different lines. If we were to apply the same proportion, it would be necessary for us to provide for an affirmative vote of from thirty to thirty-three members in order to enforce the application of the closure In tlie House of Commons, too, there is the additional safeguard that the rule cannot be applied without the consent of the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees. not so many talkers as we have. would be willing to leave the administration of the proposed rule in the hands of the present occupant of the chair.

Any observations of this kind would be most injurious to the business of the House. Therefore I ask the honourable and learned member not to continue that line of remark. It has been urged that in the preciate, sir,, your reason for intervening. I feel very thankful that last week's proceedings in the House took place under certain circumstances. But other circumstances might arise where it would be absolutely expedient for a party to try' to secure as Speaker not a man whom they believed to be absolutely the best to represent the Hou,se as a whole, but a partisan, in order that he should not be trammelled by any nicety or delicacy of feeling when an effort was made by the majority to apply a stringent rule like the closure. For that purpose, a party might pick out the greatest partisan on their side. What a clanger that would be to the House as a whole ! I can conceive of nothing worse than the selection of a partisan to occupy the Chair of the House. I can well imagine the scenes which might arise here if such an appointment were made.

I find that at page 2635 of the Victorian Hansard, he is reported to have saidIt was perfectly true that this sum was placed on the Estimates by the Berry Ministry, but it had been retained by the present Government, and he thought it would be wrong that anything like a bribe should be held out to the constituency of Warrnambool to return a gentleman whom -they believed would serve them by getting the money granted for local works. At the last election the walls of Warrnambool were placarded with this announcement, "" Vote for McCulloch and £10,000 for the Warrnambool breakwater."" Of course, those placards were issued without the Premier's sanction, and no doubt when the honourable gentleman had found out what had been done, he told his election committee that they had been guilty of gross impertinence and impropriety. Still, however, the placards were issued, and if honourable members wanted to put si stop to the cancerous sore of mere local representation which was eating into the Parliamentary institutions of this country, they ought to reject this vote under the circumstances, and discountenance anything that partook of the character of bribery; if he were alone on the question he would divide the committee. A sense of propriety ought to induce honourable members to -scout the vote, notwithstanding that the Berry Ministry placed it on the Estimates. Then ensued a debate which filled about five columns of the Hansard report, and which could not have occupied more than, say, twenty minutes, when the member for the district rose. Mr Gaunson occupy? Gaunson said on that occasion; and the other speakers were Mr Bayles, Mr James Service, Sir James McCulloch, and Mr but prefer to wait to hear what amendments afterwards Sir Graham, Berry. The whole report of the debate occupies only about four pages of the Victorian Hansard, from which it appears that the member for the district, Mr Jones, then rose, and, in a speech of about a column, concluded by -sayingThe honourable member for Maldon might rest assured that other sums would be necessary for the completion of the works. It must not be supposed that this j£ro,ooo would be a final payment. Under the circumstances-the works having been sanctioned, as he had shown, and the necessity for them being thoroughly manifesthe would move, "" That the question be now put."" The Hansard report proceeds:the honourable member. Major SMITH 1-egislative Assembly. carried by twenty-seven votes to twenty-one. The honourable member for Gippsland, during the discussion on the question before us, pointed out that any honourable member who knew that in the precincts of the House he had a majority in his favour, might, as in the case I have cited, suddenly move that the question be now put. I do not remember how many members there were in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1876, but the voting was as I have stated. been carried by a majority in any caseeven supposing there had ""been a week of debate. can fairly take that view. Some reason must be observed, and I do not think such a course is a proper one to take on any question before a deliberative assembly. I was much impressed when the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out that a standing order of the kind is greatly open to abuse. I ought to mention that this standing order in the Victorian Legislative Assembly was passed merely as a tentative rule, to have force for only one session, and that the forty-one members who voted for it, and were afterwards known as the ""forty-one gaggers,"" came back to the House only twenty strong after the general election of 1877. The indignation of the people of Victoria was so great that no tertained in the Parliament of that State. I do not submit any scheme of my own, may be moved. I cannot vote for fhe proposal as it stands at present. I particularly regret the tendency in this House to rush proposals at periods of excitement. The honourable member for Perth, in his able speech not long ago on the question of elective Ministries, quoted an article by Sir Martin Conway in the Nineteenth Century, on ""Is Parliament a Mere Crowd?"" That question Sir Martin Conway answered pretty well in the affirmative, holding that while individual men might calmly, considerately, and honestly debate questions, a legislative body which degenerated into a rabble or a crowd had neither brain, conscience, nor heart.

78,Mr Skene,"I do not think that welast change of Government we have an instance of rushing matters, resulting in what I heard one of the supporters of the Government the other day describe as a Comedy of Errors. In about four hours we had a complete overturning of affairs. We have a second instance in the introduction of these proposals, hastily decided upon in the middle of a discussion of a measure specially obnoxious to tlie Opposition; and no one can fail to recognise that if we do general motion. not find better ways of conducting business we shall be placed in great danger and risk. We may have to go a long way further, and alter our system altogether, in order to arrive at some definite understandbe a general discussion 011 the motion; and ing. I should have liked the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to discuss this question from a broad point of view, instead of proposing the closure at a time when everybody is excited over a highly contentious measure. Had such an opportunity been afforded, we might have arrived at some satisfactory conclusion as to how to shape our course in the future. As it is, I view with great apprehension the proposal before us; I cancumstances, I shall not do so. but will take not see what the outcome may be, and certainly the results of a similar method were most disastrous in the Parliament of Victoria. I rose more particularly to acquaint honourable members with the effects of a similar standing order in the Parliament of the State in which we now are, being of opinion that an ounce of experience is worth a hundredweight of predictions, and prophesies. We are assured that the standing order now proposed will' scarcely ever be used, ancl then only with moderation. But I do not believe that will prove to be the case; because whatever party is in power, when the temper of the House rises the standing order will be applied with. I fear, clisastrous results. I hope the proposed standing order will he amended. We are practically subject to the closure now, seeing that the debate has toi terminate within a certain time: and, therefore, I suppose we must look forward' to some rule of the kind. I hope, however, that the good feeling and good sense of Government supporters will come to our rescue, ancl that the proposal will be amended in 1 such a way as to make it less dangerous than it now appears to me. I should like now. if it is convenient; to this motion at the present time, instead of submit the amendment of which I have given notice. ing that we shall discuss the general motion. discuss the general motion, I shall yield at once. My only desire is to place an amended proposal before honourable members. standing arrived at yesterday by all sections of the House, was that there should with that object in view, the Prime Minister asked honourable members to negative the amendments already before the Chair. After that general discussion there will be an opportunity to submit amendments. We must remember that, virtually, we are under a compact, by which, in any event, the debate on this motion shall conclude on Thursday night. I had intended to propose an amendment; but, uncler tbe cirthe opportunity afforded to myself and other honourable members to discuss the main motion. Personally, I have always thought there should be some reasonable limit to debate, where it is evident that a large number of honourable members desire to take part in it . In ordinary cases, in which discussion is confined to a section of the House, or to a small number of members, I do not think there is any necessity for limitation, except, of course, the ordinary limitation, under the Standing Orders, that honourable members are to speak only once on anv question before the Chair. In exceptional cases, when partyfeeling runs high, and there may be a disposition to speak at great length, probably with tlie intention of obstructing business, the House is. in my opinion, justified in adopting reasonable means, whereby not the right to speak wil'l be taken away, but the duration of speeches will be limited. That, however, is not the aim of the proposal before us. The proposed new standing order is not directed! to limiting to a certain period an individual member/s right to speak, but to preventing discussion altogether. That is the inherent evil of the proposal. We have to consider the circumdiscussing another measure. This motion was introduced during the discussion of a",22,Papers Warrant And Officers

84,Mr Johnson (Lang),"The underhighly contentious Bill; and, consequently, may be taken to be specifically intended to check debate on that measure, and must ever be ineradicably associated with that B ill I refer to the Trade Marks Bill and the union labei.. was most unfortunate; and, notwithstanding that after a reasonable interval, we have commenced a new sitting, and that we have resumed the discussion after calm and cool reflection, it is still to be regretted that the proposed standing order was interposed at this juncture, instead of being submitted in the ordinaryway on the business-paper along with other proposed standing orders. The great underlying evil of the proposed standing order is that its effect will be, not only to curtail sit still in our places, without offering any the speech of an honourable member who may unduly take up the time of the House with the obvious intention of obstructing business, but to prevent any other honourable member, who may be guilty of no offence, from exercising his undoubted right, as a representative of the people, to voice his opinions either for or against -any proposed measure. That, I submit, is an unwarrantable interference with the liberty and privileges of honourable members, and also an unwarrantable interference with the right of the electors to have, not only their opinion voted for. but voiced on the floor of this House. The Prime Minister, when introducing the motion, said that Parliament is not a debating society, but that it exists to conduct and supervise legislation. No one will find fault with the statement that Parliament exists for conducting and supervising legislation, but I certainly take great exception to the statement that Par, liament is not a debating body, and I say, further, that the contention is absolutely untenable. As a matter of fact, the very origin of the word "" Parliament "" is found in the old French word ""parler,"" which, adopted hi England after the Norman invasion!, and contracted into "" parle,"" meant to speak, debate, or discourse,_ as shown by the word "" parlement,"" which is the origin of the word spelt as it is to-daya gathering of persons to parley, discourse, debate, or discuss. essence of the word ""Parliament"" shows -that we are a debating bod;--that the primary purpose of the institution is debate. Therefore, I cannot for the life of me understand how so erudite a gentleman as the Prime Minister should have put forward so astounding a proposition as that Parliament is not a debating body. As to the assertion that it exists to supervise legislation, how, may I ask, would it be possible for Parliament to f u l f i l that function unless the inherent power existed to discuss the propositions submitted to it? Can That, in my opinion, it be supposed for a moment that a body of men who are called together for the purpose of making laws for the government of the country wili sit down like dumb brutes or automatons, and merely record their votes without attempting to argue the principles and propositions laid before them ? Cani t be suggested that that was the intention of the people in electing the Parliament? If that were so, we might as well be wooden images as reasoning beings. All we should have to do would be simply to reasons for or against the measures of the Government. We might as well have voting machines in the House. They could do the work just as effectively. The occupant of the Chair would only have to press a button, and the votes would be recorded. How, under those circumstances, they would be recorded for or against, I cannot pretend to explain; but, since the Prime Minister has himself advanced this astounding theory, no doubt he will be able to tell us how it could be done. I regard this motion as a very dangerous one. It will, if carried into effect, amount to the humiliation of Parliament and the degradation-of our free institutions. The Prime Minister has himself admitted that it goes further than any other closure rule existing in any deliberative assembly in the world. At any rate, ihe acknowledges that it differs from them; although he has said that, in his opinion, the differences are not consequential. does the Queensland closure rule. to quote the Queensland rule to show that it is far less stringent than the one now proposed. If must be remembered that the closure rules in existence in any Parliament in amy part of the world are safeguarded in certain directions, whereby the rights The very and privileges of members are conserved. But this proposed form of closure has no such qualification. If it is carried in its present form, it wili only be necessary for any one member of the House to rise in his place and move, not that the speaker be no longer heard, not that the offending member shall have his mouth closed, but that the question shall be forthwith put.",23,Papers Warrant And Officers
85,Mr Poynton,It does not go as far as,24,Papers Warrant And Officers
86,Mr Johnson,"It does. I proposeexistence in South Australia for a number of years. been in existence for centuries, it cannot commend itself to a reasoning man as a precedent to be followed, if it be a bad rule. This ought not to be made in any sense a party question. It should be viewed in the light of the rights of members all round, always bearing in mind that, even though some may be inclined to be tyrannical, the time may come when the obnoxious rule may be applied by those to whom we. have previously applied it. quite right it is well to consider that the Opposition of to-day may be the Government of to-morrow, when the Government of to-day will be the Opposition of tomorrow. It must be remembered that a deliberative assembly of this character could not exist without a division of opinion. Where there is a desire on the part of some to have certain measures carried, there is likely to be^an equal desire on the part of others) that sucb measures shall .not be enacted. There is a natural inclination on the part of those who are in a majority to get their proposals passed, and to attach very little weight to the arguments of their opponents. That is not peculiar to those who are sitting behind the present Ministry. It isi a very natural wish. But it fursome such proposal as that which has been nishes a reason why we should not put a power into the hands of any party that will enable it to crush out an expression of opinion on the part of its opponents. There should not be a power to force measures through by a tyrannical and autocratic suppression of the right of free speecha method which hitherto we, as Britishers, or descendants of the British race, have been taught to regard with feelings of the utmost repugnance and as being peculiar to institutions of a Continental or Eastern character, and utterly foreign to those of British origin. I take it that those of us who, though born in Australia, belong to the British race, have within us the inherent instinct to love liberty and the free expression of opinion. We distrust all expedients designed to prevent the infringement of that principle. It is better to tear with actual evils, in the way of the abuse of that privilege, to the utmost strainthat particular. As a matter of fact, theing point, rather than attempt by coercive means to introduce measures designed to suppress those rights of freedom and free speech which have teen handed down to us by our forefathers, and which have been so dearly cherished by the present generation. I am surprised to find that a proposal of this character originated from and is supported by a party which, above all other parties in this House, claims to represent the democratic feeling of the community, and to be the champion of the liberties of the people.. I am surprised to find that this same party is that which always in this House advocates and supports measures of a restrictive character, aiming at the curtailment of the liberty of the people. The action of itsmembers in this direction, and their words outside, are of a totally different character; so that we have the voice speaking in one direction and the act operating in the opposite direction. This is a peculiar and deplorable trait of democratic development. I trust that some day, when wiser counsels prevail, there will be a truer appreciation of the real basis of democracy. In speaking last week, the honourable member for Hindmarsh quoted from a speech delivered by the right honourable member for East Sydney at Adelaide some time ago. The honourable member represented the leader of the Opposition as having described the proceedings of the Labour Party last session as constituting an outrageous abuse of parliamentary privilege, which should be checked by just submitted by the Prime Minister. I have carefully read the reported speech of the right honourable meniber for East Svdney onthat occasion, but I see no indication of any such suggestion. He certainly did complain of the outrageous abuse of parliamentary , privilege indulged in by members of the then Opposition ; but I can find no record of any statement of his which would bear the interpretation placed upon it by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who is a member of a party which on several occasions during the last session certainly occupied in speeches a much greater length of time than has been occupied at any period' during the present debate by any member of the Opposition. He asserted that the longspeeches to which the right honourable member for East Sydney referred were madeonly upon a motion of censure. The honourable member's memory is not reliable in longest speeches made in this House on the occasion referred to were not made on a motion of censure, but in Committee 'during-",24,Papers Warrant And Officers

One honourable member went to such extremes that the Chairman of Committees thought it his, duty to interpose to order him to discontinue his speech. action was thought necessary by Mr lence, so that they could not record their the proceedings which concluded yesterday. But, notwithstanding the action to which I refer, no indecent haste was shown by the Prime Minister of the day, such as was shown last week by the present Prime Minister-in rushing forward with a proposal for the adoption of the "" gag."" the right honourable member for East Sydney desired to do was to bring forward standing orders after the recess had given an opportunity for party heat to cool, so that honourable members could take up their consideration calmly and deliberately. Those standing orders would have included one for effectually dealing with abuse of the right of speech; but it was not proposed that the consideration of such a standing order s.hould be interposed during the heated discussion of a measure of vital importance. Similarly, the late Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone convened a special session to enable the British House of Commons to consider proposed standing orders for the limitation of debate, and, although that body is now governed by a standing order similar to that which is being proposed by the Prime Minister, it was brought forward under circumstances which allowed its calm and f u l l discussion. under circumstances similar to the present, when there was. practically a dead-lock. Besides, fhe British Parliament has seven years, in which to show the electors what it can do, whereas this Parliament has only three years. standing order providing for* the closure was, dealt with by the British House of Commons in a special session, whereas, in this instance, it has been proposed in the midst of the discussion of a measure of vital importance, affecting the rights, liberties, and, indeed, the very lives of a large majority of the industrial population. serious objection to it than the objection to the terms in which it is framed. would have been no objection of that kind had a special session been convened to consider the proposed new standing order, or had the Prime Minister brought it forward on the conclusion of the business in hand. The fundamental reason for bringing it forward, however, was to enable the union label clauses! of the Trade 'MarksB ill to be rushed through without' discussion, No such by sand-bagging the Opposition into siprotests against it, or explain their reaspns for opposing it. The idea was to suppress, all newspaper reports of our proceedings, which would give expression to the views of honourable members opposed to those infamous clauses of the Bill, and to prevent anything from going into Hansard What which would enable the people to understand the real nature of the proposals. It was that more than anything else which led' up to what will be known henceforth as the ""great s,tone-wall."" Had the Attorney General listened to reason, the proposed new standing order would probably not have been thought of. The speeches to which I have referred, as occupying four or five hours in delivery, were made with the avowed purpose of obstructing business. absolutely wrong in saying that. collection that one honourable member said, "" We will speak here if we have to obstruct business all night,"" and that I interjected: "" Then the honourable member admits that his purpose is obstruction."" cannot find those words in Hansard. not have been replied to, and therefore may It was brought forward not have gone into the record; but I have a distinct recollection of the words having been said, and of having drawn attention to them at the time, and of having referred .to them on a later occasion. The discussion of the Trade MarksB ill , however, was reasonable and legitimate. The Opposition pointed out the drastic nature of certain provisions in the Bill, but offered, in order* to secure an adjournment of the debate at the usual hour, to voluntarily forego their right of speaking, and allow the Government to pass no fewer than fifty-seven clauses. That offer shows that their desire was not to obstruct, but to facilitate, public business.

I should like to contrast the attitude of certain honourable members of the Labour Party in regard to the present motion, with their attitude in regard to a similar motion, when they were members of another Legislature. member for Kennedy, in 1900, when a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly spoke against a proposed closure motion intends to vote against this motion, so why read his speech on that occasion? that; but I will read his remarks, because 1 they contain arguments which have not yet been put to the House, and which I commend heartily to other honourable members of the Labour Party, on account of their soundness of principle.

House we have had members in it who are merely voting machines-that is to say, members who never take any active part in the debates, but simply come in, as occasion requires, at call of the division bell, and record their votes. That is what the present motion means. He says furtherThe introduction of this proposal into our standing orders will mean that for the future we shall have no rights in this Assembly at all^ that the w K l e of the rights that we are supposed to have had handed down to us for hundreds of years, through the House of Commons, and adopted by us, will practically be wiped out. It is no use the honourable gentleman saying that it is not the intention of the Government to use this power; but they told us that when they introduced the first closure motion, and yet they took the first opportunity of putting the gag on. May not exactly the same thing happen here-nay , is it not certain to happen? way? Is not the proposed new standing order inmatters by reason but by force, brutal or othertended to be brought into operation at the wise, whatever you like to term it-by a majority, earliest possible moment? The honourable by member proceededThat was done repeatedly, and when honourable way. The honourable gentleman must know that gentlemen on the Treasury benches took that when he decides to apply this standing orderj the action with regard to the closure, I think they result will be.that there will be no discussion at will be likely to commit any political crime in order to get these private syndicate railways through. In this conThe experience of the Queensland Parliament in this connection will probably be repeated here. The proposed new standing order may be' used for the purpose of rushing through private syndicate railThe honourable ways, or a Bill for the construction of the proposed transcontinental railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. In such' an event, the Opposition would be not only powerless to prevent the passing of such measures, butwould be unable to communicate their views to the country. That is not a desirable or creditable state of affairs to contemplate. As the honourable member for Kennedy said, it would put an end. to the authority of Parliament, and even the reason for its existence. He went on to sayAgain, we have been told that the introduction of the motion is not going to restrict the rights and privileges of. honourable members in this Chamber. Have we not been told exactly the same thing by the Prime Minister? We haye been told through the press that this motion will not have that effect; but I can only that this motion will not have the effect of depriving honourable members of this Chamber of their rights and privileges are only hypocrites and liars. For a considerable time in this I do not propose to apply these expressions to the present Government, or its mastersthe Labour Party. If there is no meaning in this motion, why introduce it? Might not that question be pertinently asked in regard to the motion before us? I do not say that if. it rested entirely with the Prime Minister he would not seriously deliberate before putting into operation a standing order such as that now proposed. Unfortunately, however, the matter rests not with him. but with honourable members of the. Labour Party. At a later stage, the honourable member for KennedysaidI think it is far better to settle all those differences by intellectual foTce than by brute force. But is this motion going to settle them in that I take the opposite view of it. I take this view of it, that it is not an attempt to settle the mere force of numbers. Right or wrong, reason does not enter into it at all. Nor is it an attempt to settle difficulties in an intellectual",26,Papers Warrant And Officers
98,Mr Storrer,He has stated that he,27,Papers Warrant And Officers
99,Mr Johnson,"I was. not aware ofall. AndI refuse to admit that the honourable gentleman who now leads the House is the one man in this Chamber who has the special capacity and sufficient of the commodity to be able to say whether a matter has been sufficiently dealt with or not. . . A discussion may be initiated on the first clause, containing the short title. The supporters of the Government, knowing there are a number of obnoxious clauses in the Bill which will not stand intelligent argument, or bear the light on them, will go on discussing the short title clause, in which no principle is involved, right up to the time the Chairman of Committees gets up and proceeds to put the Bill tliTOugh in globo. I am pleased to hear that the honourable member still holds these views, but I am sorry that they are not shared by other members of the party to which he belongs. land Parliament when that matter was under discussion, and I have since changed my opinion. hear that the honourable member has changed his opinion for the worse. I now desire to auole. some remarks made by the late Mr W. H. Groom, which I would commend to his worthy son, the Minister of Home Affairsa worthy son of a worthy father. He saidAgain, take the ""stone-wall"" over the 000,000 for unspecified railways. W ill the honourable gentleman say that that "" stone-wall,"" in which he joined, was not justifiable, when we never budged from this Chamber for ninety-six hours, and objected to placing J£I ,000,000 in the hands of the Ministry for a number of railways to God knows where? . . . this to show that there are occasions when it is perfectly justifiable to "" stone-wall."" Now, with regard to the question of this standing order. I pay great deference to the opinion of the Attornev-General, and I am sure he would not venture a strong legal opinion unless he felt satisfied that he was on very firm ground, but, on the other hand, it must be borne in mind that in 1892, when the standing orders were passed, the honourable gentleman was not in this House. . But there is a possibility that a tyrannical majority may usurp functions which it ought not to do., and crush the spirit of the minority, although the minority may possibly represent a majority outside. That is exactly what is happening in the present instance. In, this House we have a minority which represents the majority of the electors, who would certainly make their voice heard if they were afforded an opportunity to express a.n orinion with' regard to this' proposal, and others, which it is intended to assist in passing through this House. The proposed new standing order has been instigated by the members of the Labour Party. pressure was brought to bear upon the Prime Minister, an interjection made by the leader of the Labour Party influenced him to take the present action. I previously pointed out that pressure may be either passive or active, and that in one case a mere wink might exercise greater influence than a direct, positive mandate in another instance. In the present case, the pressure was an interjection suggesting the, closure from the honourable member for Bland, the leader of the Labour Party : so much the Prime Minister has virtually admitted. With regard to placing a time limit upon speeches, the late Mr Groom saidI believe that the present proposal is absolutely an infringement of the freedom of debate, and is dangerous to the rights of the minority in this Chamber, and, believing that, I feel it to be my duty to move the following amendment. The amendment he proposed provided"" No member shall speak for more than half an hour at a time in any debate in the House, except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or on the financial statement, or in a debate on a motion of -' no confidence,' or in moving the second reading of a B ill, or on the debate on the Appropriation B ill, when a member shall be at liberty 10 speak for one hour. in Committee of the House no member shall speak for more than ten minutes at any one time, or more than four times upon any one question before the Committee. "" Provided that this rule shall not apply in Committee to a member in charge of a B ill , or to a Minister when delivering the financial stateI only mention ment in Committee of Supply or of Wavs and Means."" I .would commend that proposal to the earnest attention of the Minister of Home Affairs, as being far preferable' in character and principle to the proposal now before us. I trust that some modification will be made in the proposed new standing order. I have drafted an amendment which I think might be adopted with advantage. Unfortunately, if 1 were to submit it at this stage, it would have the effect of curtailing the area of discussion. It was generally understood that a general debate should take place upon the motion before any amendment was moved. The amendment which I haye framed, whilst imposing a limit upon debate, would not arbitrarily interfere with the rights of honourable members as does the motion which is under consideration. Mv suggestion is that all the words after ""by,"" down to the word ""motion,"" in paragraph a, shall be left out, with a view to inserting the following words in lieu thereof: "" The Prime",27,Papers Warrant And Officers

Upon Thursday afternoon, the motion was moved, and after a very long sitting, the House roseas the result of an arrangement which was arrived at with members of the Opposition -a t noon yesterday. The interval thus gained has been utilized by the Government to frame some fresh proposals for the stifling of debate. I say that such a proceeding is a breach of the spirit, if not of the letter of the honourable understanding which was arrived at yesterday. and learned member's statement is absolutely incorrect. opinion. The terms of the arrangement were publicly announced by the Prime Minister. sent time there is no question relating to an provocative interjections do not justify loud arrangement before the Chair, nor can any arrangement dealing with past business be referred to.

I was merely endeavouring to show the circumstances under which this motion is before the House. I now come to my next point, which relates to the object courtesy on the part of the debtor, espefor which the motion is introduced. In dealing with that matter, I must again refer-thoug h only briefly and incidentallyto the fact that this motion was introduced during a debate upon a very important measure, which leads, me to the conclusion honourable and learned member refers was not a discussion upon the measure under consideration at all. of opinion. I am inevitably led to the conclusion that the present proposal was introduced for a specific purpose-for the purpose of insuring that one measure, at least, of those upon the business-paper should be passed into law by the exercise of force during the current session. That measure, I regret to say, I cannot do more than incidentally refer to. I would merely remind honourable members that a number of amendments have been outlined in the Trade Marks Bill, and in view of the discussion which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday last, it is abundantly clear that the proposal' now under consideration was not introduced bond fide for the purpose of exercising a general control over debate, and of insuring that, in general matters, the rights of the majority-whateve r that ill-defined term may mean-shoul d be preserved, but for the express purpose of forcing that measure through the House. In making my protest against the proposal under consideration, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I object not only to its form, but. to the circumstances under which it has been introduced, and to the reasons which have prompted its introduction. to pay their debts. learned member pay his? of honour, nor of law-it is a debt of dishonour. kind is particularly objectionable, but even conversations across the Chamber in reply to them. wholesome rule to pay one's debts, and it is a noble thing to discharge one's debts of honour. But to discharge one's duty to one's creditor, and to express the humble wish that one's, payment will be regarded as satisfactory, is an unnecessary exercise of cially when a debt is being paid by the Government to its friends in the Labour corner. This proposal is intended to closure through the .House the special provisions of the Trade Marks Bill, which are known in popular parlance, as the union label clauses. The Government have felt impelled to introduce the motion for that purpose, because, irrespective of whether or not it has been so expressed, they rest under the uneasy consciousness that they must do so. and learned member think that that is a fair argument, in view of what has taken place ? and I would not make a similar charge if I were in the honourable and learned member's place.

I , for one, know that when the House adjourned yesterday, it was expressly understood that members of the Opposition should have the fullest right to express their objections to this proposal and to state the reasons why they entertained those objections. Believing, as I do, that these proposals were introduced and pressed for the reason I have stated, I think that I should be failing in my duty to my constituents if I did not express that opinion.

I admit that that in itself will not be an unmixed evil. WfTen the country realizes, as well as does this House, the relations existing between the two component parts of the majority on your right, Mr Speaker, something, will have been achieved. When, during the days, or weeks to come, the prognostications of what will happen in regard to the measure to which I have referred, are actually fulfilled, he will be a bold man who will ' suggest that the direct Opposition, or those -sitting in the Opposition corner, were under n misapprehension in coming to the conclusion that the closure standing order was introduced for a particular purpose, and <ane That could not be justified. I feel I do not think that honthat the proposal is one to enable the dominant minority to control the proceedings of this House. In my opinion, it has nut been introduced to secure the will of the majority. It will have the effect of securing the control of the proceedings of the House in accordance with the will of a minority; it will have the effect of enabling a minority, consisting of about one^third of the House, which happens to be in a peculiarly favorable position for obtaining the passing of legislation members in the party to which I refer, and I should think that that, roughly speaking, is one-third of the House. The proposed standing order, if carried, will enable that third to control the proceedings"" of the House twenty-four will control its action. thirteen, and so on. I say, almost unhesitatMrM c CAY It must also be remembered, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Parramatta, that thirteen wfll be able to control the action of the twenty-four. The result is that thirteen members of the Labour Party assembled in caucus will be able to determine what the legislation of Australia shall be. That being so, can this be said to be a proposal to secure the exercise of the will of the majority? W ill it secure majority rule, or make Parliament secure against the assault of an obstructive or determined minority? Nothing of the kind. It is ja proposal to secure the parliamentary machine for the efforts of a determined minority. Such a state of affairs would be more regrettable than words could describe. I should also like to point out the further peculiarity that the Standing Orders Committee of the House, instead of being, consulted, ' was totally disregarded in this matter. Had this been a bona fide proposal, made as the result of obvious obstruction and delay of business on the part of the Opposition, the Govevnment would first have taken the opinion of the Committee specially appointed at the beginning bf this Parliament, to consider all questions of procedure'. In such circumstances, no Government would think of doing otherwise. But I shall not dwell upon that point. It is a matter for governmental consideration.

I cast aside as a flimsy pretext the allegation that it is being introduced for the purpose of preventing obstruction, and in order to insure and protect the rights of the majority. I point to the object I have already mentioned as the real object which the Government and their friends propose to achieve, the real object which the country will Tecognise, and which, I trust, the country will punish as it deserves, as soon asan opportunity is afforded to get the torture, and it was consequently permitted verdict of the electors. Mr G. P. EDWARD S (South Sydney). -We are discussing a matter which, apart from the immediate circumstances which have given rise to the introduction of this proposal, must have cropped up sooner or later in this Parliament. On whichever side of the House we sit, and to whatever party we belong, most of us admit that some restriction of the privileges which enable honourable members under the Standing Orders to indulge in orations occupying three, four, or five hours, would sooner or later have become necessary. Consequently I should have been in accord with the present or with anv other Government in any attempt that might be made to introduce new Standing Orders to deal with a difficulty which has been experienced in the past, and which must be felt more and more as time goes on. I have felt that the practical work of Parliament has been retarded to a very large extent by the facilities afforded under our existing temporary Standing Orders for opposing business by inordinate discussion. I am perfectly prepared to consider anv reasonable means to remedy what must be admitted to be a growing evil in this Parliament. But when I come to consider the precise terms of the proposal placed before us by the Government, and the circumstances in which il: has been introduced, I say that there is ample room for division of opinion as to the wisdom underlying it. Some proposal which, was not framed in a panic would have better met the circumstances, no matter from which party it proceeded. This particular motion for adding certain Standing Orders to those which govern our debates has been brought forward under special circumstances, and it seems to me that it is most unwise to deal with general laws because of special circumstances. I have previously referred in this House to I dean historical occasion peculiarly applicable to this particular case. When William of Orange came to England, the settlement of the relations between the people and that monarch was made under a statutory enactment, which laid down the powers of the Crown and the privileges of the people. Under that law, all punishment in the shape of torture was absolutely abolished. In Scotland an endeavour was made to pass a similar enactment; but, owing to the fact that some crime of great enormity was committed at the time, the Scottish arrangement with the Crown failed to abolish in Scotland for some years after it had been abolished in England. When the Government bring forward "" certain Standing Orders with the direct object of dealing with a specific enactment, the course adopted is evil in every sense. Such matters should be dealt with from a general stand-paint, and not because of any specific legislation which the majority may have in view. In this respect I think the Government have done wrong. In dealing with any alteration of our Standing Orders it was their bounden duty to have proceeded through the ordinary Committee of this House appointed to deal with such matters. They should have brought their proposals before that Committee, which was representative of different parties in this House, and on which you, Mr Speaker, in whom all sides of the House place equal confidence, had a seat. We might then have had a standing order submitted to us, after imvestigation and inquiry by that special Committee, which would have had a far better chance of securing the general approval of the House. A proposal submitted by the Standing Orders Committee would have been free from any party view, and would have been a carefullv considered regulation for the purpose of governing discussion in this Chamber. The Government adopted a course of action which they might very well have anticipated would give rise to friction in this Chamber when they passed over that Committee and proceeded, without reference to it. to formulate a standing order to deal with what is am admitted evil. Their action has already of heated party conflict, to protect the reled to the incident whicb took place here cognised right of the minority to be heard. the other day, when several honourable memBut this standing order, in eliminating bers felt that they were bound in honour the Speaker from any influence as to its and conscience to enter their protest against application has departed, as I say, not only the conduct of the Government by from English precedents, but from the resigning from this very important principles which should underlie the apCommittee. that, in bringing forward this parthere is a confusion of terms in the moticular standing order, they have been actution.

I have read 'many pages of Mayi n order to refresh my memory, and I contend that the second word, "" motion,"" in the first paragraph of the proposed standing order, should be ""question,"" in order to make the meaning clear, and in accordance with our Standing Orders, and also those of the British House of Commons. But that is not all. When we come to paragraph b of the motion, it seems to me that there is the most woeful confusion of termsthat honourable members are likely to be confused as to what is precisely meant by the standing order. After referring to what I may call the second stage of the proceeding, 'tine latter portion of the standing order deals with a matter that should be dealt with in the first part. Paragraph b saysWhen the motion "" That the question be now p u t "" has been carried, and the question consequent thereon has been decided, any further motion may be at once made which may be requisite to bring to a decision any question already proposed from the Chair; [185] Honourable members will see that this part of paragraph b, so far as I have read it , is thoroughly consistent with the standing order of the House of Commons, and with the'practice under that standing order. But the -motion goes on to declareI think the proposed and also if a clause be then under consideration, a motion may be made, "" That the question, 'ThatI shall try certain words of the clause defined in the motion I sav that a prostand part of the clause,' or 'That the clause stand part of or be added to the B ill ' be now put.""

If the Government had ""not been in such a panic as to so hastily rush these proposals before us. that paragraph would have been divided, and the latter part would have been attached to paragraph a, while paragraph b would have ended with ""Chair."" When it has been decided that the question shall be "" now put,"" and it has been put, the next stage, which is very necessary, is to i's the word ""motion"" to which I give complete effect to what has already been clone; otherwise the question might be left, like Mahomet's coffin, hanging between heaven and earth. This proposed standing order, like the standing order of the British House of Commons, gives power to carry the decision of the House or Committee to its logical conclusion by completing the business before it is interrupted by an adjournment or by a transfer from the consideration of one piece of business to the consideration of another. I feel quite clear that this particular proposal of the Government requires further consideration, in order that it may be expressed in language consistent and logical, and easily understood. Then again, in paragraph b, we have repeated the phraseSuch motion shall be put forthwith, and decided without amendment or debate. I contend it never is a ""motion,"" but always a ""question,"" that is put from the Chair.

The effect will be that one or two honourable members, who are fortunate enough, in the scramble that will ensue, to catch the eye of the Speaker, will be able to voice their opinions, and the opinions of their constituents-becaus e that is the main point-befor e the closure is applied, while less strenuous, members will be debarred A t any rate it will require some from exercising their rights on behalf of Strongly as I have made up those who sent them here. I would go as far as any man in reason to abolish evilswhich are admitted on all hands; but we must te actuated by some sense of justice. All through my career, I have been opposed to the recognition in this or any other Legislature pf any particular right of individuals to hold the floor of the House on any and If the proposal every occasion. Once in the heat of debate I had to remind the late honourable member for Hunter, Sir Edmund Barton, that, however much he might consider himI f this self to be beyond me in his right to express his opinions outside, I , as the representative of SouthSydney, had as much right as he, or any other honourable member, to address the Speaker. If honourable members of the The effect of a standing order such as that placed before us by the Government, would be that certain leading men in the Ministry, and possibly the leader or deputy leader of the Opposition, would te allowed to address the House, and then the Government, anxious to get its business through, would apply the closure; so that constituencies that might te very much more important in I know of respect of their numbers or their standing in the community, would be quite unrepresented in the debate. encies which might be particularly interested in the subject. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes; the representatives of these constituencies would be completely shut, out from expressing their opinions. That is why we have the right to say that this is an institution of the "" gag."" business of the House conducted in a business-like way, without friction. wished to do that with fairness to the whole of the constituencies, which are equal in the eyes of Mr Speaker, I am sure, we should adopt a method that would permit of dealing out even-handed justice all round. If any important measure were before the House, and the Government, in view of the exigencies of business, decided that it was impossible to grant more than 50, 60. or 100 hours to its consideration, that time ought to be divided amongst the various members who desired to address themselves tp it , and each member should-be permitted to have his allowance of time. Every honourable member does not always desire to avail himself of the opportunity to address the House. An honourable member may not be personally interested in a question; or his constituents may not be interested in it ; or he may not be well versed in the. subject. Buti f fhe constituency be interested in a question, it is the bounden duty of its representative as one who has accepted the responsibility to see that legislation is framed an equitable, just, and wise lines, to express his opinions freely if he desires to do so. But under the proposition of the Government, it would be possible to shut out nineteen-twentieths of the House from a debate. Minister who introduced the proposal, and some prominent member of the Opposition to answer him, would be permitted to speak. The House would then proceed simply to register its decree. I say that that is a position which I , as the representative of an important constituency, have no wish to occupy, and one that I will not consent to occupy so long as I can successfully resist it. But, on the other hand, I have intimated freely my willingness to give this Government, or any other Government, a standing order which will enable us to get on with the business. It must not be forgotten that any proposition of this kind is a two-edged sword, that will serve the purposes of this Government to-day in getting its business through as speedily as As well as constitupossible, but which may equally well serve the purposes of some other Government to-morrow. Those who today are supporting this Draconian proposal may find it put into force against them when they desire to exercise their legitimate function of criticising proposals put before them. We have reason It is not an attempt to get the fo regret most deeply that a proposition of thi's character was not If we passed through the proper channel, the Standing Orders Committee, before being submitted to the House. If that course had been fpl lowed, the representative men forming the Committee-wh o were selected from various parts of the House, presided over by Mr Speaker, in whom all parties have confidence-coul d have been trusted to formulate a standing order to regulate what is an admitted evil. Minister is a member of the Standing Orders Committee. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I do not attach very much importance to that fact. My point is that, as the Committee represents all sides, and is presided over by Mr Speaker, it ought to have had an opportunity to consider the standing order before it was proposed to the House. In that case, when the matter was brought before us we should have had the assurance that the proposal had received that careful and complete consideration which we might expect to be given to it. We might have expected that the question had been approached irrespective of anv particular object in view, and without reference to any particular party in this House. If that course had been Probably only the particular pursued it seems quite clear to my mind that the proposal brought before us would have been consented to by the House much more readily than the one that is now before us, which has been proposed by a Government actuated by panic-absolutel y by panic. The Government were brought face to face with a difficulty that they did not know how to deal with. They therefore set to work and drafted this Draconian proposal. They did so in order to get through a measure which this House is determined to fully discuss, I do not blame any Government for desiring to get its measures through. It is the duty of everv Government to endeavour to do so.

Of course, that affirmative vote necessarily has to be a majority of the House. I think that, in the circumstances of this Chamber, and in view of its size, twenty-four is altogether too small a number to which to entrust that power. The Prime Minister io submitting the> motion pointed to the fact that in the House of Commons ioo members were required tq carry the closure motion, whilst the number of members in the exalted mother of Parliaments was 670. He seemed to argue that if 100 out of 670 is a fair proportion there, twenty-four memberg out of seventy-five is a fair proportion here. If that was the Prime reasoning-and gether fallacious. stitution lays it down definitely that the quorum necessary for transacting business in this Chamber shall be twenty-five._ But in the House of Commons the quorum for 670 members is only forty. iri the House of Commons the number necessary to carry the closure is two ancl a half times the quorum. were to Say that the minimum number to carry the closure should be two and a half times the quorum, it would practically require the whole House to vote for it.

I do not think that any Government having the slightest warrant for remaining in occupation of the Treasury benches should refuse to accept such an amendment, because if a Government had It is for not thirty members at its back it would have a very small chance of remaining on Buti f , on the the Treasury benches at all. First of all, as a working body of at least twenty-five members has to be retained in the House in more power to order to keep a quorumi, it seems to me to be inconceivable that any Government with a individual members fromscintilla of justification for remaining in four or five hours in adoffice would not have at least thirty memsome bers behind it prepared to vote for putting they the closure in force. There is no doubt with that the Government has a majority in favour of the motion; therefore we must expect it to be passed. But we may at least make an appeal to them to raise the number from twenty-four to thirty, which will afford a better guarantee that the There is another point to minority will not be stifled at the dictation of so small a number as is at present proposed. Let me point out that, in the existing circumstances of parties in this House, the whole of the twenty-four might be constituted of one particular section of the House. Thirteen members sitting behind the Government could thrust the closure on the House, though the remainder of the twenty-four might be disinclined to support it. In other words, a simple majority of a minority could force the Government, 'so long as they were their supporters,, to apply the closure. Another objection which I have to the proposed new standing order is that under it any private member would be permitted to move the application of the closure. . In my opinion, so long as we maintain the Minister's system of party government-thoug h I hold I th'Jnk it was-it was altoit to be a bad system-w e should adhere For instance, our Conto the principle that the Ministry in power for the time being should be held responsible for the proper conduct of the business of Parliament, and the extraordinary step of summarily putting an end to a deConsequently, bate should be safeguarded by permitting it to be taken only on a proposal emanating from the Treasury bench. That limitaIf in.'this House we tion has 'been adopted by many other Legislatures. To allow any private member to move the application of the closure might be to give that power to a member of a section exerting,, as under present circumstances, complete control over the Ministry; but if we are fo pass the proposed new standing order at all, we should allow the closure to be moved only by a Minister of the Crown. I think that unnecessarily long discussions would be better provided against by an expedient quite different from those which have been proposed. The charges of obstructing business, or occupying time unnecessarily, which have been made, or could be made, arise out of the party system of Government, and the expedients which have been proposed or adopted in other Legislatures for preventing the consequent waste of time are inefficient compared with what might be achieved by the abolition of party government. The obstruction wihich takes place from time to time-and I am not now ' referring to the mere immediate incidents of last weekdoes not proceed from a real difference of principle amongst honourable members, but is due to the claims of party allegiance and the operation of party conflict. If there were a real disposition on the part of the Government to cope with the admitted evils which have grown up, under which Legislatures are, as it were, paralyzed, they ward. He may give' reasons why a prowould seek to alter the constitution of the Executive in such a way that honourable members would not be called upon every now and again to obstruct business in obedience to the dictates of party leaders. Last session, when another party occupied the Opposition benches, they obstructed at the dictates of their party leaders, or from a feeling of party loyalty, and the same thing will happen over and over again. The restrictions proposed to be imposed will be inefficient to deal with this evil. To my mind, it proceeds from our present system of constituting the Executive. I ask those who have given attention to the subject to consider if the Swiss Legislature is often called upon to deal with unnecessarily long speeches or unduly prolonged debates. In that Legislature, where the Executive, when elected, has the general confidence of the Chamber, there is no reason for such opposition as takes place here. It ds true that party divisions exist and will always, exist, so long as there are honest differences of opinion; but under our system they are marshalled and organized. Party government lends itself to the adoption of expedients for the obstruction of legislation which lead to fruitless waste of time, a:nd the obtaining of inadequate and often evil results. sometimes unfitted by the long sittings for isters who had not merited dismissal being legislative work. . Mr G. B. EDWARDS -If we wish to kill, and not merely to scotch, the snakeif we desire to honestly attempt to get the best results out of this Legislature, we shall not be content with lopping the branch of the tree, but will go to the root, and, by altering the system of constituting the Executive, remove incentives to obstruction. In ordinary social intercourse outside the Chamber, the best of feeling prevails between honourable members, the heated differences which occur here being simply the result of partu organization and conflict. To get rid of this, we have only to alter' the manner in which we choose the Ministdrs who are intrusted with the initiation of legislation, and ""to let those whom we select know that whatever their proposals may be, they are to obey the wishes and dictates of this Chamber. If we do this our difficulties must disappear. There would be no individual desire on the part of any honourable member to op2X>se any reasonable proposal that may be brought forposal should not be adopted, and may vote against it, but? he will not organise a useless opposition merely for party purposes. If we honestly wish to cure the present evil, we must do more than pass standing orders for limiting speeches, or applying the closure. We must take away the incentives to party organization which require one set of men to defend their position, while another set tries to drag them out of it, and to supplant them. This state of affairs exists: in every Legislature similarly constituted to our own, and until we get rid 'of it, we shall have to face such difficulties as have been experienced recently, as well as in times gone by. I do not think the House could better occupy itself, if it wishes to formulate a system under which better results could be obtained from its work, than in considering such an amendment of our practice as I have suggested. It is not an amendment of the Constitution that I propose. If this system were adopted, Ministers could be dealt with separately and independently, according to their qualifications for any particular offioe. Any Minister in whom the House* had confidence would be certain of re-election, so long as he was returned to the Legislature, while, if any change were made in the -personnel of the Ministry, it would be",40,Papers Warrant And Officers

ThatI cannot permit, and I ask him, therefore, not to anticipate discussion on that Order of the Day. Mr G. B. EDWARDS be admitted by you, Mr Speaker, and by honourable members generally, that I am as desirous as is any man in the Chamber to keep within the rules of debate, and to obey your rulings. Therefore, I shall not go into details on this subject. But, although I cannot embody my suggestion in an amendment on the motion now before the House, I urge, as a reason why the proposal of Ministers is inefficient for the purpose contemplated, the fact that a much more drastic and widereaching reform is required to meet the conditions. for East Sydney has admitted over and over again that it is absolutely necessary to devise means whereby this Legislature may be permitted to .give effect to the will of the. people in a more practical manner than has hitherto been possible. Honourable members of the Labour Party, I am sure, sympathize with that desire, and the motion before us shows that the Government are prepared to go as far as any one in the matter. But all the laws and standing orders which have been adopted for this purpose by other Legislatures are totally inefficient compared with the more drastic and far-reaching reform which will be obtained by altering the constitution of the Executive, thus destroying the reason for party organization and opposition. I shall not proceed further with this argument, but shall content myself with urging it as an additional reason why we should carefully consider the effect of what is proposed. The proposed standing order will, in my opinion, do more' to create evil 1 than would be done by an alteration of. the constitution of the Executive. By the application of the closure, large numbers of honourable members would from time to time be prevented from expressing 'their views, many of whom might never have been guilty of obstruction, or of making long speeches. I have made rather long speeches on one or two occasions, but I think it will be admitted that I have done so only when speaking on subjects to which I have given special attention, and that I do not speak very frequently. By the application of the closure members, like myself would from time to time be prevented from expressing the views of our constituents. Therefore, it is fraught witb evil to a greater extent than any other proposal that has been made for remedying the difficulI think it will ties with which we are now face to face. A paper has been preparedI do not know upon what authority-containin g extractsfrom various Constitutions, relating to the measures which have been taken in other Legislatures for limiting debate. These extracts are not so well arranged as they might be, but the compilation will relieve honourable members of the necessity of looking through a large number of works of reference. An examination of this document shows that, apart from Great Britain, where a closure provision similar to that now proposed by the Government has been The right honourable member adopted, subject to certain limitations, with regard to the assent of the Speaker, no rule similar to that now submitted for our approval has been brought into operation. There are,' however, many practical proposals,, which might well engage our attention. I find that in the New Zealand Legislature the Standing Orders provideNo Member s'hall speak for more than half an hour at a time in any debate in the House, except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or on the Financial Statement, or in a debate on a motionof "" No Confidence,"" or in moving the second reading of a B ill , and on the debate on the Appropriation B ill , when a Member shall be at liberty to speak for one hour. In Committee of the House no Member shall) speak for more than ten minutes at any one time,, or more than four times on any one question before the Committee.",42,Papers Warrant And Officers
220,Mr Speaker,"There is on theThis rule does not apply in Committee to a Member in charge of a Bill or a Minister when delivering a Financial Statement in Committee of Supply. Under this standing order reasonable, and I should think adequate, means are provided for meeting the necessities of the case. We might very well adopt the same principle, and give it a trial before proceeding to the lengths that the Government piopose. is made as follows:No Member to occupy more than one hour in debate on any question in the House or in Committee, except the Member reporting a measure under consideration from Committee, who, if the debate has extended beyond one day, shall be entitled to one hour at the close notwithstanding that he may have used an hour in opening. When general debate is closed by order of the isters ample time in which to lay their meaHouse, any Member is aUowed five minutes to explain any amendment he might offer, after which the Member who first obtained the floor is allowed to speak for five minutes in opposition to among honourable members, so that the dei t ; but no other debate is allowed tnereon. The same privilege is allowed in favour of and against any amendment to an amendment. Both the Legislatures, referred to, to whom liberty of speech is, no doubt, as dear ' as it is to us, have adopted the system which I have joined with other honourable members on this side of the House in advocating. have no right to indiscriminately and blindly shut off debate, but we are perfectly entitled! to decide what time shall be allowed for the discussion of a * measure at its various stages. We should take care, however, that the time fixed for debate is equitably and justly divided amongst honourable members,. equal constituencies, and any blind, haphazard system, by which the guillotine could be applied after half a dozen honourable members had expressed their opinion to the exclusion of sixty or seventy others does not commend itself to my mind, and I cannot conceive of its. being approved by honourable members, who have any sense of justice. to adequate time is given for the expression of tbe opinions of honourable members. It is possible and probable that if speeches were limited in, the manner provided for in New Zealand,'honourable members would express their views more tersely and effectively. If we were compelled to recast our ideas in such a way as to enable us to expres.s them within a limited time, the results would -be much better than those achieved under the present conditions, f n the United States of America, certain concessions are made to members who report Bills. In that Legislature a measure upon being referred to a Committee receives semi-private consideration, and is afterwards intrusted to a certain member for the purpose of being reported to the House, and commended to its favorable consideration. We can understand that such a member would require special facilities for putIn the United States provision ting his case before the House. We have to recognise that under our system of responsible government, which differs from that of the United States, Ministers occupy an even more important position than do members of the United States Congress, who are intrusted with the duty of reporting Bills. Therefore, we ought to afford Minsures before the House. The rest of the time available should be equally divided bate may be automatically closed. If the New Zealand system, which I favour, were adopted, and every honourable member, except Ministers in charge of measures, were allowed to speak for half-an-hour,, not more than eighteen hours, at the outside, would be devoted to the discussion of a measure. That period is not too great to allow for We the expression of the matured views of honourable members upon a measure of first class importance, and it would be much safer for us to adopt such a system than to place it in the power of any section of honourable members to close a debate by the application of the closure or guillotine. I understand that in the United States of We are supposed to represent America the speeches in Committee are cut down to five minutes each. They have adopted the somewhat ingenious plan of allowing a member who does not desire to speak to yield his time allowance to some other member. I find by reference to an official work published under the authority of the United States Congress thatUnder both the systems referred When a member yields of his time, but retains control of the floor, an amendment may not be offered in the yielded time without his consent. A member who receives time from another may yield of it to a third only with the consent of the first. From that it appears that they have adopted a system in which a party, such as the Opposition in this House, having a number of members each entitled to five minutes, may grant their allowance to some specially informed man on their own side, to enable him to place their case effectively before honourable members. rate. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am inclined to very severely cut down the time for discussion in Committee. Buti f we reduce the allowance in Committee to five minutes three times over in regard to the same subject, it would not be reasonable or desirable to restrict honourable members from yielding their time to others who might be in a position to make better use of it. member fix the same time limit for all clauses, regardless of their importance? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes, I would; because I think it is impossible to draw a distinction. come that difficulty if we afforded facilities for the transfer of time from one meniber to another. Whilst five minutes three times over would be ample to permit of the expression of the views of an honourable member with regard to an unimportant clause, it might be desirable upon a matter of importance to allow a leading debater a longer period within which to give adequate expressioni to not only his own views, but those of other honourable members with whom he was acting dm co-operation. ordinary occasions it seems to me that after having fully debated a Bill upon the motion for the second reading, we occupy much too long a period in discussing details in Committee. We might very well cut down these debates by allowing each member only three periods of five' minutes upon each clause. I think the Government proposals are fraught with evil. It is proposed to give too much power to the members of one section of the House. At the same time, I do not wish it to be supposed that I am opposed to any measure for putting an end to the obstructive talk that takes place in this and every other Legislature. AlthoughI do not desire to prevent honourable members addressing themselves to the ques-tion now before the House, which can come on again after my amendment is negatived, I move That all the words after "" namely "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" No Member shall speak for more than halfan-hour at a time in any debate in the House, except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or on the Financial Statement, or in a debate on a motion of No Confidence,' or in moving 1 the second reading of a B ill , and on the debate on the Appropriation B ill , when a Member shall be at liberty to speak for one hour. "" In Committee of the House no Member shall speak for more than five minutes at any one time, or more than three times on any one question before the Committee. 11 This rule does not apply in Committee to a Member in charge of a B ill , or a Minister when delivering a Financial Statement in Committee of Supply."" The New Zealand standing order provides that a member shall be entitled to speak four times on any one question, but I think that three times is sufficient. Honourable members, who profess to be democrats, can hardly refuse to accept my amendment. I shall have extreme doubts as to the democracy of any honourable member who prefers to adopt the Government proposal. Und'er my proposal, every honourable memWe should, however, overber would be placed upon the same footing, and every one would be afforded an opportunity to exercise his right to freely express his views. Its effect would be to materially limit our discussions, and debates would be automatically closed when all those who desired to address the House had exercised their privilege. Uncler the Government proposal, however, a gross injustice might be perpetrated by a section of the members of the House. WhatI propose as an alternative will mete Upon all out even-handed justice all round, will limit debate, and will remove those abuses which have cropped up, although I am of opinion that a more drastic reform is requireda reform in the constitution of our Executive. seconded. The system advocated by the honourable member for South Sydney would no doubt constitute a great improvement upon the system which obtains in this House. But I was not prepared to support his proposal, because I have framed an amendment which I conceive to be very much better. I regret that I had not the opportunity of adding a few words to the discussion which took place upon this motion last week, when public attention was being directed to the extraordinary position taken up by the Government. They submitted this proposal for a specific purpose, and their action in so doing was absolutely indefensible.

I have, however, seen the error of my ways, and have made up my mind to refrain in future from making long speeches, because 1 find that I can say as much in twenty minutes as most honourable members say in five hours. I think I have made it clear that the Government were not justified in submitting these proposal's, because they were led to do so only because of a desire to force through the House legislation forming no part of their own policy, but dictated by the Labour Party. Their desire is to rush through the House legislation introduced by a private'member in another place, and which, so far as I am aware, has been approved only by the labour caucus, and the labour organizations outside. Such legislation may embody the views of a large and respectable portion of the community, but it certainly does not represent the opinion of the people. The Prime Minister was not justified in submitting the motion now before us, for the specific purpose of passing those proposals into law without adequate discussion. A measure cannot be said to have been adequately discussed unless it has been put before the people. Why did they hare the hustings in the olden days? Was it not to enlighten the people as to measures likely to come before the Parliament? All proposed legislation should be discussed on the public platform.

I should favour the amendment of the proposed standing order so as to provide that it shall not come into operation unless not less than twenty-four members vote in favour of its application, nor less than twenty-three members against it. The suggestion whicli I make is not an original one; it was first made, in a somewhat different form, in the House of Commons. If it were carried into effect, it would mean that the closure could not be applied unless not less than forty-eight honourable members were in attendance. In that way some representation would be given to the views of the minoritv. Another point is that the Opposition would be compelled to assist in keeping a House. That in itself would be a material advantage to the Government, and I think that the amendment I have foreshadowed should command the support of the Labour Party.

The Minister of Trade and Customs may laugh, but he has only to examine the character of the legislation which they favour to realize that my statement is correct. If we go back to the time of Henry VIII . , Henry VII . , or Edward VL , we shall find on the English statute-book precedents for the legislation which is now proposed for Australia by the Labour Party. For centuries the Liberals of Great Britain have been fighting for the liberties of the people, and undoing what was donein those times. The Labour Party seek to place upon the statute-book of Australia ' their liberties. very hardly indeed, so far as they were concerned. Therefore, I should like it to be made as effective as possible, so that f u l l justice may be done to the people; for, while I do not claim to be a member of the caucus party, I claim to be a representative of all classes in the community; indeed, I yield to no one in the extent to which I would go in passing domestic legislation for the benefit of the working people, as well as every other section of the community. I have only to refer to my record in the House to justify my claim to represent the working classes, equally with every other section. My desire is that the minority of the people shall be represented here, as well as the majority, and they will be represented, and receive f u l l justice, if this proposal be modified in such a way that ino harsh and unjust treatment could be meted out to their representatives. not approach the discussion of the merits urgency for introducing the closure at theof this proposal without casting one's mind present time. It will be recollected that back to the events of the preceding week; on Tuesday last we commenced to debate a to the reason, for the introduction of the cloquestion on which public interest has been sure, and the manner in which the debate excited to a very considerable degree, and' which was initiated some days ago was met to which all sections in the community, by honourable members on the Government except that compact section which occupies [REPRESENTATIVES.] Limitation of Debate. In the side. I was one of 'those who endeavoured last week to exercise a pacific influence. It was my desire to try to secure a settlement which would be just to all sections of the House and honourable to the parties concerned in the contest. It is my intention to vote on the proposal in the manner I indicated at an early stage of this debate. I think, however, that I should be perfectly free to depart from the attitude I then took The Liberals up, because the action of the Prime Minister, in giving notice of a certain motion, this afternoon, was a distinct breach of the understanding which was implied in the settlement arrived at yesterday. It ought to make it clear to us that, in any agreement for a settlement to which the Opposition may come with the Government, it will be necessary to get something far more binding than such, an ordinary understanding as would and ought to be accepted by honourable men. I have no objection to' a reasonable method of limiting debate, although I think that this particular proposal goes a great deal too far. But when not only one kind of closure is pitchforked into the middle of a discussion on a most controversial question, but on top of legislation which would rob the people of that anofher kind of closure for the purThe closure would work pose of gagging individual members isgiven notice of, we can see that a very serious attempt is being made to curtail our right of free speech.

253,Mr Robinson,"It was not my intenthe Ministerial corner-benches, are hostile. After a general discussion on the union label provisions of the Trade MarksB ill , this closure proposal was brought forward for our consideration. By the exercise of ordinary tact, it would have been possible for the Minister in charge of the House at the time to secure a reasonable form of closure on Thursday last. A reference to the Hansard report of the proceedings on that occasion will show distinctly that it was the arrogant, browbeating attitude of the Attorney-General which contributed more than any single cause to the terrible experiences which we all had to undergo. I find that, on page 5333, the honourable member for Kooyong saidI appeal to the Attorney-General to agree to an adjournment. The request from so pacific and moderate a man as the honourable member for Kooyong met with this responseWe must go straight on, and finish this debate. On page 5335, the honourable member for Kooyong renewed his requestI again ask the Attorney-General to agree to an adjournment of the debate. The honourable and learned gentleman, in reply, saidWe must finish the business before the House. That particular attitude, I submit to rise again to a point of order. I submit that the honourable and' learned member is out of order in reading extracts from speeches made in another debate of this session. able and learned member not to refer to a previous debate of this session. tions prove conclusively that it was the attitude of the Attorney-General which, more than any single cause, contributed to the fierce scenes which took place last week. No one regrets them more than I do-n o one is more sorry-that we had to put up with such a fierce debate. But I contend that, in the special circumstances of the case, 'it was the duty of the Opposition to take up a strong attitude, in order that the public conscience might be awakened, not only to the union label proposals, but to the undoubted fact that a closure proposal of a more drastic nature than any closure which has ever existed in the Parliament of Victoria, and I think in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, was to be used for the purpose of dragooning certain measures through the House. Members of the Opposition succeeded in awakening the public conscience, and whatever expressions of public opinion, by means of meetings and so forth, have taken place since Tuesday last, they have resulted, I think, in attracting, attention to the union label provisions, and strengthening the hand of the Opposition in reference thereto. I am of opinion that, although a rule for limiting debate is in some Parliaments very necessary, in other Parliaments it. is not so necessary. I think that this Parliament belongs to the latter class. Reference has been made to the closure rule in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, but it must be recollected that that Parliament guides,, not only the affairs of the United Kingdom, with a population of 45,000,000, but also the destinies of the British Empire, and that the consideration of foreign and colonial policies must absorb a very large portion of its time. When it is recollected that the population of the British Empire ranges from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000, it will be re> cognised that drastic steps must be taken in the British Parliament to limit debate; otherwise important proposals) eould not possibly be discussed or decided. In a similar manner there may be more .reason for having the closure in the States ParI am very sorry to have liaments than in this Parliament, which possesses only limited powers of legislation. There can be, no doubt in the mind of any one who has ever looked at the Constitution for a moment that the legislative authority of the Commonwealth is but a I must ask the honorfraction of that of the States Parliaments. Therefore, while in some instances the adoption of the closure j n States Parliaments may be justified, the necessity for its adoption by this House does not exist to anything like the same extent. troduction here would not have arisen had not the Opposition started to ""stone-wall."" collection of the Labour Party, including, I think, the honourable member, doing their . share of what is called ""stone-walling "" in the previous session.

""dissolution"" has an unpleasant sound to the honourable member, because he believes in perpetual membership of the House, at ten times his present salary. stituencies are not likely to agree with the honourable meniber. I hold in my hand a list of the proposals which have been decided by the House. the opportunities for obstruction afforded to the Opposition by the proposals put before them have not been availed of, though it would be foolish to attempt to deny that there are members of every party who do at times endeavour to prevent business going through too rapidly. In the first place there was a want of confidence motion in the late. Government, and the debate upon that occupied but a very short time. Then there was a debate on the policy of the Deakin Government, which also occupied a very short time. When it is recollected that the debate upon the policy of the Reid Government and on the want of confidence motion moved in the Reid Government occupied five weeks, it will be admitted that honourable members on this side of the House were extremely moderate in dealing with those questions. in Committee a message from the Governor General on the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railwav Survey Bill. opportunity for the greatest obstruction, because as this was a new session, it would have been competent for honourable members to have debated the whole of the pros and cons of that proposal. many honourable members would, in my opinion, have been justified in attacking that proposal with the utmost vehemence, because of what they considered the very extraordinary change of attitude on the part of a particular individual, very much interested in it. However, honourable members of the Opposition did not do so. They allowed the proposal to go through practically without debate, though some, like myself, had they been urged to do so, would have been prepared to make a very emphatic AnOpposition which and lengthy protest against that measure. We might have devoted weeks to the consideration of it without being open to any charge of obstruction, and with the knowledge that the Age newspaper, which is now O'MALLEY -An Opposition attacking the Opposition, would have supported us. Then we dealt with certain amendments in the Papua Bill in CommitI know that the word tee. Some small Bills were put through, such as the EvidenceB i ll and the Secret Commissions Bill, and a large B i ll in the shape of the CommerceB ill . I refer to that measure as a large B ill, because it affects oversea trade to the value of from ,£60,000,000 to £80,000,000, and it affects, not only importers and manufacturers in Victoria, but people who, in my opinion, are worthy of more consideration than either, and they are I quote these to show that the farmers and producers of Australia. The discussion of that Bill necessarily occupied a long time, because of the extraordinary way. in which it was drafted. Then we had a Service and Execution of ProcessB ill , and we also debated a motion to appropriate ,£25,000 for a memorial to Queen Victoria. Nearly two days were occupied in debating that question, and honourable members of the Labour Party will admit that they occupied the bulk of that time. If there was "" stonewalling "" in connection with that proposal, the charge cannot be made against the members of the Opposition. Then we discussed the Public Service Classification, and I do not think that it can be said that the Opposition took up the bulk of the time in debating that question. We dealt, also, with some small Bills, such as the Census Then we considered and Statistics B ill , and the Wireless Telegiaphy B ill . We considered, also, iwo important mail contracts, one dealing with That afforded an the service between Australia and the United Kingdom, and the other with the service to Canada.

We, in Victoria, have had an. experience of the closure. It is to my mind a very striking fact that the Victorian Parliament which, witb all deference to the Parliaments of the other States, I think I can say is least notorious for prolonged debates and stormy scenes, is a Parliament absolutely without closure proposals of this kind. when similar proposals were submitted, and carried in that Parliament. then known as the "" I r o n Hand"" proposals, because they gave the Government of the day what this Government desires -a n "" iron hand"" debate. two ' to one proposals-forty-on e to twenty. were introduced by the Premier of the day, Sir James McCulloch, in February, 1876, and the Age of that day, which I have been looking up, referred to those who carried them as "" Sir James McCulloch and his forty gaggers."" At the ensuing, election, the Age appealed to the electors-and by the way, to the Liberals of that day-by means of placards, asking them to vote against "" Sir James McCulloch and his forty gaggers."" against them. against them. The man who introduced the iron hand and his forty gaggers were slaughtered at the ensuing election. Of the forty gaggers, only twenty got back to Parliament. and see whether we shall come back? to go to tha constituencies now. The gagging proposals were again brought up in the. Victorian State Parliament in 1889, and were withdrawn after the fullest exI refer to all these pression of opinion from all parties in the Legislative Assembly. The Government that brought them forward was a Government of which the present Prime Minister was a member, and therefore the honourable and learned gentleman cannot now be charged with inconsistency in this endeavour to "" gag "" his opponents. All I need say is that the State Parliament of Victoria thought it better to do without such Standing Orders. By adopting proposals which I should have agreed to willinglv in place of those now submitted in this Pari liament, they reduced the opportunities for obstruction enormously. The Victorian Parliament provided that the motions, "" T h a t progress be reported,"" and ""That the Chairman leave the chair"" should be put without debate. In other circumstances I should have been prepared to accept such proposals willingly,, .in place of those now submitted. It is an astonishing fact that without these gagging closure There was a time, in 1876, proposals, and-without the "" I r o n H a n d , "" the Victorian Parliament to-day does its They were work as rapidly and as well as does anv State Parliament, whilst it is as free from obstruction and from "" scenes "" as is any Parliament we know of.

272,Two Other Small Bills That Mr Robinson,"I am quite preparedproper time. The proper time at which to deal with such an honourable member is, in my judgment, not in the middle of a debate upon a controversial, novel, and important question, but at the elections. Another objection I have, not only to this, but to all closure proposals, is that they have an undoubted tendency to belittle and degrade Parliament. Parliament ought to be a place for the free expression of the views of the chosen of the people. It is becoming a place to which men are sent to register the decrees of the Government of the day. All these proposals, it seems to me,, tend to belittle and degrade Parliament. Wellknown writers, contributing to such periodicals as the Spectator, have pointed out the growing tendency to belittle Parliament in the attempts continually made by a certain section of . the press and by certain persons inside Parliament. I feel convinced that the effect of these particular proposals will be to lessenthe prestige and influence of this Parliament throughout the Commonwealth. They will not increase the prestige of the Government, nor will they in the slightest degree improve the position which the Federation now occupies in the opinion of the people. The lederation does not occupy a very high place in their esteem, ancl I do not believe that by the introduc-. tion of gagging of this kind for a specific purpose we are likely to raise the general opinion of the Federal Parliament. the Opposition last week do so. the "" gag,"" even though it should be applied by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, is a measure which is likely to improve the condition of fhis Parliament, or to increase its prestige. I had not the pleasure of hearing the speech, but I can well remember a speech which was delivered some years ago by the present Prime Minister at Bendigo. It sent an electric thrill through every Australian native in Victoria, and through many persons who were not natives of this State. I can remember the brilliant peroration with which the honourable and learned gentleman concluded that speech. The memory of it even now must speak to one's heart in the tones of an organ trumpet. gentleman concluded a most impassioned deliverance with the linesOh! let us rise united, penitent, And be one people, mighty, serving God. Is this the way in which the Prime Minister ther or not there is an infringement of fair fulfils that prediction? Does he serve his debate for the rights of the minority. I Creator by bringing in these dragooning proposals for the purpose of bludgeoning through measures which have not been before the electors, and which the newspaper that supports him and every section of the metropolitan press unreservedly denounces? The honourable and learned gentleman brings in these proposals because he must -becaus e they are part of the political price he has to pay for office. every Legislature. exist in Victoria. It is not my intention to occupy much more time with general considerations. There are a few amendments which I desire to move on the motion. I endeavoured last week, and in an entirely informal way, without any authority or justification from the party to which X belong, and solely in the interests of peace and harmony between honourable members, to induce honourable members on both sides to agree to them. ThoughI consider that the action of the Prime Minister in giving the notice of motion he gave this afternoon would justify me in departing from the course I have proposed, I shall not do so. If there are to be breaches of faith, I hope that honourable members on the Opposition side will see that they are all allowed to come from the Government side. I presume that I shall be in order in commenting upon the amendments I propose to move. I move That in paragraph a, line 4, the word "" member "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Minister with the consent of the Speaker or Chairman of Committees as the case may require""; in paragraph b, after the word ""Chair,"" the words ""and also if a clause be then under consideration, a motion may be made "" That the question, * That certain words of the clause defined in the motion stand part of the clause,' or 'That the clause stand part of or be added to the B ill , ' be now put."" In paragraph c that the word "" twenty-four"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" thirty."" I ask the House to insist that it shall be the authority of a Minister of the Crown which "" gags "" honourable members-that a Minister shalltake the responsibility of stifling debate, so that if the retribution of the electors follows, it shall be visited on The honourable and learned the Government, and not 'on individual members.

276,Mr Robinson,"It does notcannot conceive that any honourable member can raise any serious objection to the amendments proposed. As to the amendment in paragraph b, I would point out that with the paragraph, as it stands, debate might be stifled in the most extraordinary fashion, and, perhaps, I may be permitted to give one example. Last year we had under discussion the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and one of the clauses, which is now section 38 of the Act, contained twenty-three or twenty four sub-clauses, a number of which inAolved highly controversial questions. On the first sub-clause there was keen debate on a number of important questions, including that of maximum and minimum penalty for a breach of the might claim penalties; what was known as the common rule; applying the decision of the Arbitration Court all over the Commonwealth ; and the employment of legal gentlemen in the Arbitration Court. TJnder the precious proposed standing order, it would be possible in such a case for a debate to take place on the first of the sub-clauses, and for that clause to be carried through by means of the "" gag,"" entailing the passing of the whole remaining sub-clauses without discussion or amendment. That illustration should be sufficient to show that House of Commons, is at all a proper pronot only the words to which I have drawn attention should be omitted, but that other words should be insertedl to provide that a clausernaiybe put sub-clause by sub-clause, or paragraph by paragraph. Without such a safeguard, it would be possible for even a whole Tariff to be bludgeoned through, instead of, as usual, being dealt with item by item. South Wales. ns the fact, but if that was done in New South Wales, it was most improper. To bludgeon through any proposal, involving the taking of money out of the pockets of the people without allowing any opportun ity for debate or division, on the various items, is to reduce parliamentary government to a mere travesty. ber will recollect that it was contended that I hope that when we go before the electors protection is not taxation. orable member for Melbourne Ports making that assertion; and the only person who could adequately express my feelings on that point is the honourable member for Robertson. As to paragraph c of the proposed standing order, it is rather a ridiculous proposal that an Opposition, which may comprise any number up to twentythree, shall be dragooned by twenty-four members of the dominant party. I do not object to a reasonable form of closure, if the Government insist on a standing order of the kind; but to provide that it may be applied by a number less than a quorum of the House, is to place undue power in fhe hands of the Ministry for the time being. It has been said that the number required in the . House of Commons to enforce a similar rule, is smaller in proportion than that now proposed for this House; but we must recollect that the enormous number of members of the House of Comprovision; the persons Who mons renders it impossible for more than half of them to be seated in the Chamber at the same time. That necessitates at least one-third of the members of the House of Commons being continually absent; and only on very rare occasions is there an attendance of over two-thirds. is a quorum in the House of Commons. that fact, I do not think that the proportion which might be useful and necessary in the portion for this House. The proportion I name in the amendment makes it imperative that the consent of more than a mere quorum shall be necessary to apply the closure. Then even a minority can rely on the probability that, in the fiercest party fight, there will be some members on the Government side who, while desirous to push a particular measure through, will decline to go the length of suppressing free speech. The minimum number which I name will conserve to some extent the opportunity to the minority to make themselves heard, and prevent any undue suppression of debate or of opinion. I enter my emphatic protest against the introduction of this standing order and against the manner and the time of its introduction. It is, I believe, absolutely without precedent to introduce a proposal of the kind in the middle of a fierce debate on a controversial question; even if there be a precedent it must be a bad one. the new Parliament will deal with the question of the Standing Orders as a whole, and, while removing any "" gagging "" proposals that may now be introduced, will at the same time strike out any obsolete forms",53,Papers Warrant And Officers

308,Mr Glynn (Angas),"I thank the5516 New Standing Order: of matter. I can conceive of circumstances, in the case of a deliberative assembly, necessitating, after a long experience, the imposition of some limitation upon the absolute freedom of speech of its members. I can conceive, for instance, of the case of a Parliament that has had the experience of centuries, like the Imperial Parliamentthat has grown practically out of all capacity to deal with the' details of everything that is brought before it-details not only of a multitudinous character concerning the people of the United Kingdom, but complex matters relating to an Empire comprising various systems of Government, some unitary, some federal, and with various races, and with interests that touch almost all other countries of the world being driven from sheer necessity to put some limitation upon the absolute and unfettered ( right of its members to discuss every matter submitted to it. But I cannot conceive that in the second session of a Parliament, under a Constitution conceived in very high hopes that we should be animated by mutual temperance and by a very high sense of patriotic duty, any necessity has arisen for members to impose a limitation upon freedom of discussion. I am unaware that anything has occurred during the four years when the first and second Parliaments of this Commonwealth have been in existencethat anything has occurred in the general debates-that necessitate the introduction of this closure proposal. AndI do hold that such a restriction must not be introduced to meet the supposed necessities of any particular occasion. Standing Orders should be introduced on the assumption that there always will be a minority of this House prepared to render it impossible for the Government t.o carry on the business of the country. Certainly such a state of affairs does mot exist at the present time. justification for assuming that it does exist. placed on the statute-book. But we know But, even if the assumption of the Government were justified, before they introduced such a standing order as this they should tell the House that, in their opinion, minorities of this House always will so obstruct public business as to necessitate these limipass-frig of Acts of Parliament, the nature tations being placed upon -debate. That is tbe only justification for the introduction of these measures. I sav that the Government has, in the very fifth year of the existence of Federal government in Australia, impugned the very Parliament which was created in such high hopes that we should Mr Glynn. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Limitation of Debate. be animated by temperance in debate and by the purest motives of patriotic duty. I do admit that there have been occasions upon which all. of us may have been too discursive-^-that we have, perhaps, as the poet says, "" drawn out the thread of our verbosity thiiraner than the staple of our argument;"" or, as theVicar of Wakefield said of the ladies, we have ' continued the 1 conversation, while not the argument."" But, at the same time, I must say this: that there has been no wanton or wilful obstruction of public business. There has been -no extended criticism that was not directed to specific and distinctly justifiable ends. learned member was not here last week. going on. Surely honourable members do not think that a rule is to be framed for a few exceptions. There is not a deliberative assembly in the world that would not have a code of rules limiting debate if the excesses of members were to be the limit of our duty in that respect. Lombroso says in one of his works, that among statesmen-whom , by the way, he classifies with criminals-ther e are what are known as loues-that the sanity of a deliberative assembly is less than the average among those who compose it. Andi f that be so, there must be occasional excesses on both sides; there must be occasional dispositions to long-windedness. But that does not justifv such a strong and drastic amendment of our Standing Orders as has been proposed by the present Government. Honourable No amendment of our members must acknowledge that it is the duty of an Opposition to criticise. That duty must be discharged. It is all very well for the Government to introduce measures which they wish' to put through as quickly as possible. It is the natural desire of .Governments to see that the meaThere is not the remotest sures which they father are successfully from the history of legislation, that if they were permitted to do that without criticism, the legislative mistakes vvhich are now so numerous, would be much greater in number. As it is, from the mistakes which have been made in the of the amendments that have to be introduced, and the unforeseen effects that muchof our so-called beneficent legislation entails, there is an obligation upon us to exercise the grealest care in relation to the measures introduced by any Govern-",56,Papers Warrant And Officers
309,Mr Thomas,The honourable and,57,Papers Warrant And Officers
310,Mr Glynn,"But I know what wasment, and to criticise them with the utmost vigilance and pertinacity. If that be so, there must be times when the Government will complain of the criticism being a little more extensive than they thought was applicable to all the circumstances. But I ask honourable members to recollect that by passing this standing order we are placing a very great power, and one liable to be abused, ito the hands of a majority. It has been said, in the course of this debate, that majorities must rule. We all admit that. But at the same time we must acknowledge the right of the minority to be heard. Most of the opinions that have been accepted by the country were originally held and advocated by minorities. My honourable friends of the Labour Party were themselves at one time in a minority. They should remember, in the words of Carlyle, that ""The truth that was yesterday a, restless problem, is to-day become a belief burning to be uttered."" A minority is often the exponent of opinions which eventually will become the thoughts of majorities, and the prevailing policy of the country. But by introducing extreme proposals for the closure, you really, in a moment of temporary excitement, put it in the power of some majority absolutely to destroy the possibility of shedding additional light upon questions that will prove ultimately beneficial to the country. While we must check excessive debate when the clear necessity for doing so has arisen, we must not be precipitate in our action, nor guided by the so-called exigencies of a parwas wrong in excluding strangers, and that ticular measure. The Committee was asked by the Government to pass about seventy out of, perhaps, one hundred clauses, which the Trade Marks Bill contains, but it will be found that there are scarcely two of those clauses which do not require the closest scrutiny. founded upon a Bill which was introduced into the Imperial Parliament, and, after careful consideration, abandoned. draftsman of the Bill before this House took for his guidance the Bill introduced ton in 1904; but that measure was objected to by the Chambers of Commerce in London, and by various expert associations, and was withdrawn, and a new B ill substituted, which has now been placed on the statute-book, and will become operative on the 1st April, 1906. This measure is, in its essence, distinct from the Bill of 1904, which was abandoned, and upon which it is proposed to model the legislation of the Commonwealth. Is there any justification for introducing the closure to put a stop to debate on clauses which are objectionable when compared with the legislation recently, and practically unanimously, adopted by the Imperial Parliament? I make this statement with no desire to enter into a discussion of the merits of the Trade Marks Bill, but to show the need for recognising the strong sense of duty which may operate with an Opposition in protracting debate to lengths which may seem objectionable to a Government, though they may not go beyond the necessity of the occasion. If the power of applying the closure is placed in the hands of a majority, it will be liable to very great abuse, and we must remember that Parliament is seldom right in what it does. Honourable members seem to have forgotten that, right through the historv of parliamentary government, the blunders committed have been far more numerous than the acts of which we can be proud. Parliament was wrong, for instance, in issuing general warrants. The House of Commons was wrong in claiming the right to judge its own privileges and ignoring the judgments of the Courts of Justice, which put some check on those privileges. It was wrong in imprisoning men who had petitioned in favour' of certain public principles. This very deliberative House of Commons was wrong in imposing a censorship on the press, and in enjoining the secrecy of debates. It was recognised by the refusal to enforce its standing order, which remained for manv years "" like a rusty mail in monumental mockery."" The House of Commons has been wrong in manv other matters within the memory of honourable members. Lecky.

Upon my arrival here last Wednesday morning I found the House in a great state of excitement over the Trade Marks Bill. I learned that the Prime Minister proposed to submit this motion at 2.30 p.m. that day, for the purpose of preventing honourable members from speaking at undue length upon the measure to which I have referred. I was given to understand that the Opposition intended to fight that proposal. Consequently, I had to determine the position that I would take up. As a result of inquiries, I found that the great bone of contention between the two parties was the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill. My investigations led me to believe that those provisions practically amounted to the extension of a preference to unionists. I was then led to consider what would be their effect upon the primary industries of Australia. I found that under their operation it would be possible to legally boycott the produce of non-unionists. member discover that? sion at which I honestly arrived. come to that conclusion before he had read the Bill or afterwards ?

Naturally, 1 would not join obstructionists, without first weighing what would be the result of the legislation proposed. union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill unionists would be able to block exportation-in other words, they would be able to compel all those who did not belong to unions to join those organizations-and that, in fact, the object of the Bill was neither more nor less than that which was sought to be attained in the proposal to extend a preference to unionists in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. wrong. sible. It appeared to me that a deliberate attempt was being made in another measure to grant a preference to unionists. I am perfectly aware that last session a similar jDfoposal in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was very considerably amended. But I also recollect that that proposal was introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide, and at a later stage was submitted by the present Prime Minister. I admit that subsequently the latter assisted to block the extension of a preference to unionists. member connect his argument with the question before the Chair? up to the reasons which prompted me to cast in my lot with the Opposition. to the question before the Chair. planation, surely I am entitled to give mv reasons for following a certain course. member has been misrepresented or misunderstood, he is perfectly entitled to do so. misrepresented, but honourable members upon this side have been similarly treated. It is for that reason, and because I reside in a distant State, that I feel it incumbent upon me to'defend my action. The newspapers in the remote States take very little notice of what is being done ini this Parliament, until the election day comes round. UnlessI am enabled to make my defence now, through Hansard, I shall be denied an opportunity to do so.

Certainly it shall have my earnest support. whether that will settle the proposal or not, but I certainly think it is deserving of the utmost consideration from any fair-minded and"" intelligent man. that by means of the closure the Prime Minister of England put through the existing Education Act.

368,Motion (By Mr Joseph Cook) Pro,"rise to oppose the discharge of these three honourable members from attendance on the Standing Orders Committee. They were elected officers of the House until the end of this Parliament, and have no right to retire because they are piqued, unless they are discharged by the whole House. that. going to be discharged with my help. listen to opposition to the motion, but the common course is, as a matter of courtesy, to give leave to any honourable member to withdraw from a Select Committee. Of course, the House has a right to do as it pleases in the matter. that the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable and learned member for Corinella desire tq be discharged from the Standing Orders Committee, because they have both taken a keen interest in its proceedings. During a period of five years, the right honourable member for East Sydney has attended only one meeting, and. I do not regret his resignation.. Question resolved in the affirmative. That the House do now adjourn. draw the attention of the Government to what I consider the brutal treatment of honourable members by servants of the New South Wales Commissioners for Railways. It i's well known that the members of the House are expected to be here whenever the call of duty demands their presence, no matter what part of Australia they may happen to be in. When I was away in my constituency last week on public business, by prior arrangement, I endeavoured to respond to a call of duty at the House on Monday last. I had to travel a distance of 1,100 miles without a break practically, being on the train forty-seven and a half out of fifty-three and a half hours. When I arrived in Sydney on Sunday, I was not quite certain as to whether it was imperative for me to be here on Monday, but upon reaching my home I found that I ought to be here on that day, and therefore I determined to make the through journey. On my arrival at Redfern station a quarter of an hour before it was time for the train to start, I , not having booked a sleeping berth, applied to the stationmaster for some accommodation, in order to enable me to travel to the Seat of Government, with the result that I learned that there was a full berthing list. As there was another gentleman as well as myself seeking a sleeping-berth, I asked the stationmaster to set aside a compartment, so that we could travel as we are expected to travel, but he refused to do that. We then asked if he would give up a second-class compartment, so that we could sleep during the journey, being quite prepared to put up with the inconvenience, but that also was refused. Just as the train was about to leave the station, I and this gentleman from Ceylon, who will return with a bad impression of our travelling facilities, were thrust into a single compartment, without lavatorv or other convenience. As this gentleman had come from a hot climate, I let him have the seat while I lay upon the floor, just as if I were a beast shipped in a truck to arrive at my destination. member a rug? nor anything else. Singular to say, owing to the weather being warm, it was the first time. I had come from home without rug or top-coat. I had to lie on the floor of the carriage to mv physical injury. I am now suffering from pains which I had never previously experienced. I am suffering from rheumatic pains and stiffening of the muscles. This is, I think, a legitimate complaint, because the discourtesy which is shown to the members of the Commonwealth Parliament by the Railways Commissioners and their servants is not meted out to anv other section of the community. I can say without hesitation that the Federal members are not treated fairly, either by the Railways Commis' sioners of New South Wales or of the other States through which they have to travel, l t is about time that due ""respect should be demanded for them. Further, I should like to sav fhat, so far as I know, every member of this House should be regarded as the eoual of every other member, and should, without having to demand them, be accorded the same privileges, no matter",63,Standing Orders Committee

I say without hesitation that there is favorthan that of doing what is right to indiviitism of the most pronounced type shown by the Railways Commissioners and some of their servants. do not carry with them some official authority are not treated as are those who are in authority, or as the public generally. As we must traivel to get here we should be at least able to do so under such conditions as will enable us to arrive at this House physically, as well as mentally, able to perform our duties. the Prime Minister to let the States Governments know, once andi for all, that so long as the Commonwealth pays for the passages of the members of this House, they have a right to expect courtesy, respect, and attention; and that, if they canupon him to give me something on which I not claim privileges equal to those granted by the Railways Departments of the States to the members of States Parliaments, the Commonwealth pays handsomely for the services rendered by those Departments. I understand that the amount paid for each member of the Federal Parliament is about. £ 6 0 a year. by week, and month by month, to attend our duties in this House, we are not.likely to do very much other travelling, and in this respect we obtain nothing like value for the money paid on. our account to the Railways Departments of the States. Further, I believe that 110 less than twenty members of this House hold life passes, and there is an obligation on the Railways Departments of the States to which they belong to carry them without charge to the Commonwealth. Minister of Home Affairs will recognise the justice of the appeal I make. The least we can expect is to be given a compartment when the sleeping carriages are full. If not. it is about time the Commonwealth came to some understanding with the States Governments to provide the conveniences which Federal members are entitled to expect. I cannot believe that the Railways Commissioners of the different States can be aware of what takes place, or they would not tolerate the treatment accorded to Federal members by their officers. ment supply the honourable member with a rug? Moss Vale to the gentleman in charge of the sleeping car. that their attention to travellers is unfortunately measured by other considerations duals. It is every day becoming more evident on our railways and elsewhere that the Honourable members who man who is unable to put his hand into his pocket for tips is not treated in the same way as wealthier persons, who are better able to tip. I pleaded for a rug and a pillow. The porter found me a rug, and said that he had no pillow. The rug was very much worn, and there was not very much, warmth in it. I asked the honourable I appeal to member for Robertson, who was in a sleeping car, to appeal to this gentleman to find me a pillow. By sitting up until we arrived at Goulburn, I found that, although he had said he had! not a pillow, the honourable member for Robertson prevailed could rest mv head. By appealing and by remaining awake for half the night, I was able to get something on which to lay my head other than the bare boards. I have stated the facts of the case, and, in my opinion, they disclose scandalous and brutal treatment when one considers that I As we have to travel week had made a journey of 1,100 miles, occupying 47J hours, to attend my duties here. to the statements made by the honourable member for Gwydir, I should like to say. as a frequent traveller, that I have never observed any' discourtesy on the part of the railways officials. On the contrary, I think that everything we can reasonably expect is done for us. It is most unfortunate that the honourable member should have had I am. satisfied that the a very long journey before, but the railways officials could have known nothing of that. Again, dt would appear thafc the honourable member relied upon the chance of obtaining a sleeping berth. If he had been able to say that: the use of a sleeping berth was not granted to him when one was vacant, a very different condition of affairs would have been disclosed. It appears that the honourable member turned! up at the station a quarter of an hour before the express started, when, unfortunately, the sleeping carriages seem to have been full. I am afraid that that experience has befallen myself. It must be remembered that the sleeping cars provide accommodation only for so many passengers. It is most unfortunate that the honourable member for Gwydir should not have been able to obtain a night's rest, but I do not think that 1 must say of these men his experience in this case should have been brought forward as a complaint against those",64,Adjotjrnment Travelling Accommodation

380,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"In answeremployed in the railway service. I know that on Monday and Friday nights, the nights on which honourable members usually travel to and from Melbourne, a car is set apart for their use. This is done largely with a view to convenience the general public, in order that they shall not be disturbed by having the ordinary number of berths, which are generally left vacant, appropriated by a rush of honourable members. In the circumstances, after reflection, and when he has recovered from the nervous irritation due to some fortyseven or forty-eight hours travelling, the honourable member must see that the fault hardly lies with those who had control of the train arrangements. So .far as the Commissioners are concerned, they could not have been aware of the facts related by the honourable member. honourable member's late arrival gave those in charge of the train no opportunity^ to make arrangements to meet an overplus of passengers demanding sleeping accommodation. I understand that plenty of good seats could be found on the train, but there was no room in the sleepers. The fact that he could not obtain a sleeping berth seems to be the only ground of complaint which the honourable member has, and, in view of his late arrival at the station, that difficulty was one which could hardly have been overcome. honourable member for Gwydir is not the only member of this House who has reason to complain of the accommodation provided for Federal members. On Tuesday last one of the House .attendants booked passages for my wife and myself by the express to Adelaide on Friday. One would think that that gave the Department fair notice. We were told that the cars were f u l l , but that the officials would see what could ' be done. When we went down on the Friday, however, we found that no provision had been made for us. I may say that, only a few minutes before, the attendant had endeavoured to ascertain whether a berth could be obtained for my wife, because, under the circumstances, I myself did -not intend to travel. I asked the booking clerk, who, of course, I did not blame in the matter, whether a compartment could be provided, and, while he declared that that could not be done, he promised to arrange so that, my wife could travel. I may further say that some time ago, when the honourable member for Boothby and mvself desired to go to Adelaide to attend a meeting, we found the sleeping car f u l l , and only after the greatest difficulty did we get a compartment, in which we had to travel without even a pillow on which to lay our heads. Surely better provision ought to be made. All I can say is that if the arrangements are not altered in this respect, I shall not undertake to travel all those hundreds of males in order to keep a House. This travelling is most trying with the best of accommodation, and I refuse to risk injury to my health by travelling with the worse. On the occasion to whioh I have referred I caught a severe cold, which, a fortnight later, laid me up, and compelled me to call in medical advice. During the whole of last session members of the Labour-Partyhad nearly always to travel with strangers The fiom Adelaide, while certain other members of this Parliament had two-berth compartments to themselves. The same sort of thing has occurred this year; the utmost favouritism has been shown. We are informed that we cannot apply for berths except week by week; and when we do obtain them we are, as I say, distributed amongst strangers. Not very long ago the honourable member for Grey and myself, when travelling to Adelaide, were given the smoking compartment, and Ave were quite satisfied. The same thing occurred on the return journey, though, before we started, we sti> pulated that if another car were put on we were to have berths in it . But, although another car was put on, and certain members of this Parliament were given twoberth compartments, the honourable member for Grey and myself were placed among strangers. If I am fairly treated, I am easily satisfied. If tliere is anv special traffic, I am quite content with a berth in a compartment, instead of in the sleeping car. I am always ready, if I happen to have a lower berth, to hand it over to any elderly gentleman or other person who seems to require it more than myself. I clo not think we ought to be put in the position of having to make complaints either to the railway officials or in this House. I may say that the arrangements are a little better at the Adelaide end just, now, but at the Melbourne end they are as bad as ever. at the Adelaide end since there has been a Labour Premier. plied to the Premier of South Australia in connection with this matter, though I am",65,Adjotjrnment Travelling Accommodation

383,Mr Hutchison,"I have never apsure that, if I did, he would see justice done. I do not think it desirable to go beyond the officials or the Railway Commissioners, though, as I said before, it ought not to be necessary to make any complaint. Proper provision ought to be made by the Government to enable members to travel in ' reasonable comfort. If a member complains on behalf of his fellow-members, he is not treated with very much respect by the railway officials. I must say that the car conductors display the utmost courtesy, and never make the slightest difference between Labour members and others. no favouritism, and I desire the Government to impress on the railway officials that all members of this Parliament 'are on an equality. I forgot to mention that last Friday Senator Guthrie, who had booked a return berth to Adelaide, did not travel, but, in spite of the fact that a berth was thus left vacant, I was unable to obtain one. If I am not properly and courteously treated in the future I propose to take a step the example of which I hope honourable members will follow. I shall book a berth every day of the week, whether I intend to travel or not, and thus apply the only remedy within my power. I have always expressed my willingness to travel with , strangers if a compartment is provided for some of the Labour Party. As you know, Mr Speaker, members of Parliament do a good deal of their work when travelling, and the party of which I am a member have often to deal with business which they do not care to discuss in the presence of strangers. We cannot expect the same accommodation to be given on the Adelaide line as on the New South Wales line, considering the larger number of New South Wales members who travel. I trust that the Government will see that better accommodation is provided for members in the future. always experienced good treatment when travelling between New South Wales and Melbourne, but not so when travelling between Melbourne and Adelaide. The last time. I went to Adelaide, on my way to Western Australia, I got a berth only by the courtesy of the President of the Senate, who gave me one which he had at his disposal j and on a return trip from AdelaideI had no berth at all. It is quite time members of this Parliament knew whether their railway passes are intended to command a berth whenever travelling from one State to another. no personal complaint to make, but, in view of what has been said to-night, I should like to draw attention to a remark which I heard made by the station-master of Redfern station, who appears to have been one of the chief offenders in the case of the honourable member for Gwydir. A number of riflemen were travelling through Sydney to the Williamstown meeting, and the honourable member for Cowper, another W h y should they? honourable member whorri I forget, and myself went to the station-master to see if better accommodation could not be provided for the men. The station-master convinced us that no better accommodation could be given, and with his explanation we were quite satisfied. He, in the presence of a number of people, said that Commonwealth orders had no cash value. This remark would naturally, lead the people standing around to understand that Commonwealth members or Commonwealth servants were travelling at the charge of the State. If it can be proved that the Commonwealth is not paying the Railways Departments a sufficient sum, we should, in my opinion, ascertain what oughfj to be paid, and pay. it. Of course, it will have to come out of the pockets of the taxpayers in the long run. But Tet the impression be removed from the minds of the officials that the. Commonwealth owes the Railways Departments anything for services performed. It is most humiliating for a member of the Commonwealth Parliament to have to stand on a crowded platform and hear such a remark made as that which I have quoted. Personally, I do not often travel between my constituency and the Seat of Government. I came to Melbourne at the opening of Parliament, and have not been back home since, nor shall I return till the session closes. I do not think that either I or any other Queensland member is getting anything like value for the amount paid by the Commonwealth for my railway pass. It is no pleasure to travel long distances. It takes me fifty-one hours to come from my Home to Melbourne. It is only proper that a man who is forced to travel such long distances should get all the comfort that can be afforded. For my own part, I mav say that I have had such comforts; but I wish it to be understood by the railways officials, as well as",66,Adjotjrnment Travelling Accommodation

I should think it would be better to withdraw the passes altogether, and to pay honourable members an allowance of £ 5 0 or £ 1 0 0 a year each, out of Which they could pay their own travelling expenses. I am quite sure that I have not had £ 1 0 worth of travelling out of my railway pass in any year. I travel very little; only when it is necessary for me to do so. ButT object to being looked upon as a ""dead-head,"" seeing that the Commonwealth pays £ 6 0 a year for my pass. Either we, as Federal members, are entitled to passes or we are not. If there is any trouble ahout them, let the Government call in the passes, and grant us an allowance, out of which we can pay our travelling expenses like ordinary passengers. all probability what has been said will be .sent on to the Railways Departments concerned. I wish to confirm the statement of the honourable member for Gwydir. I saw him come upon the platform at Sydney, and I know that there was time to make up a berth for him, because one of the attendants had offered to make one up for me. I , however, said that there was no need to do so, as I was otherwise provided for. Personally, I have no complaint to make with regard to -the travelling on, my line. I can also support what has been said by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I consider that the accommodation on the Adelaide side is abominable. When I was last in AdelaideI was told that there was no sleeping berth for me. I made it my business to go to the officials, and told them that I should refuse to travel unless a sleeping berth were provided. Then they found one for me. There must be something wrong when such a state of things can .occur, 1 I )was also informed on a former occasion that fhe President of the Senate has. two berths reserved for him, and that other passengers have had/ to go without berths in consequence. I think that it is very selfish, unbecoming, and unmanly of the President of the Senate to do so.' I dare sav that after what has been said, there will be some improvement in the arrangements for honourable members. If the payment made is not sufficient, a larger giant should be made. Honourable members cannot be expected to travel long distances unless they are made fairly comfortable. of Home Affairs);I can assure honourable members that I sympathize with them in their desire that they shall obtain comfortable travelling accommodation. As the honourable member for Gwydir has said, it frequently happens that honourable members are called upon almost at a moment's notice to go on journeys, and it is impossible for them under such circumstances to notify the officials some days beforehand that they will require sleeping accommodation. I ""shall certainly make representations to the Railways Commissioners, asking them to see if proper accommodation can, under such circumstances,, be made for the members of this Parliament. of time, and was told that there was no accommodation to spare, quires an explanation. that the honourable member for Robertson indicates that a berth was offered to him about the time when I appealed for one. ter in which.some particular officer is concerned. But I hope, as I believe, that the Railways Commissioners will see that every facility is given to .honourable* members to secure comfortable travelling accommodation. I will take immediate steps to communicate with them. Question resolved in the affirmative.' House adjourned at 10.48 p.m.",67,Adjotjrnment Travelling Accommodation
