ACTS INTERPRETATION BILL: That the B ill be now read a third time. is the stage at which the Bill should be recommitted for any further amendments which require to be made.

I believe that upon this particular clause there will probably be a considerable amount of discussion and great diversity of opinion, not only as to the form of its drafting, but also as to the persons to whom the Bill should be made applicable, and as to its restrictive character in this connection. I desire to briefly define my attitude upon this provision. When the measure was before the House last year, I expressed the view-whic h I still entertain-that in a Bill of tin's sort, Parliament ought not to insert anything in the nature of an ex varte statement regarding its constitutional powers. These, I take it, can be determined only by a tribunal which has been duly established by the Commonwealth for that express purpose. For this reason I have always contended that upon a broad matter of this kind we ought-not to attempt to restrict our powers under the Constitution. At no time has the Prime Minister or any of the legal authorities in this House, definitely declared that the proposal which I have submitted is absolutely unconstitutional. I confess freely that those honourable members who are possessed of high legal knowledge, and whose opinions are entitled to all respect, have affirmed that its constitutionality admits of very grave doubt. But the strongest contention that has been urged against it, is that it would be inexpedient to give legal effect to it. I maintain that the question"" of expediency is one of which this Parliament has no right to take serious cognizance, if the principle involved be a good one. Indeed, that question can arise only when honourable members are in doubt as to the wisdom of adopting a certain line of action. I hold that in this case the argument as to expediency is all in favour of my contention. If a Conciliation and Arbitration Act is desirable, I claim that its provisions should be applicable to the whole of the workers, irrespective of whether they are.in the employ of private individuals, of the States, ot of the difference between an employee* in the risk his own money and his own business.

21,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay),"I movepeople themselves have to find the money that is necessary to insure the just treatment of their public servants. Parliament is not a competent Court to deal with any of our public servants. We have reached different times from those to which the precedents that have been quoted by the other side in this connection were applicable. The functions of the States are no longer restricted to the performance of police duties, and to the maintenance of law and order. Both the States and the Commonwealth have entered upon almost every class of undertaking. carry out works which were never dreamed of in older countries. Unquestionably the State has entered into competition with private enterprise in manv respects, and there is scarcely an influential section in Australia which condemns it for so doing. Its operations have by no means been limited to our railways and our postal service. connection I wish to instance another form of State industrial enterprise which some honourable members undoubtedly favour. has reference to the establishment either byone of the States or the Commonwealth of the iron industry. the Commonwealth undertaking, does any one suggest that it would be fair to exclude from the operation of a Bill of this character the public employees whilst insisting ployer should conform to its provisions? It is unnecessary to enlarge upon, that point because, as will have been gathered from the series of interviews recently published in a Melbourne newspaper, there is a large number of honourable members who believe that the Commonwealth should take over and work any and every industry that has become a monopoly. additional reason why we should endeavour to extend the operation of this Bill to all public servants. some force, and, perhaps with some truth, that even if the scope of the Bill, were so extended very few public servants would take advantage of it. some of them have no desire to take advantage of such legislation, but that is entirely beside the question. enough to deal with that phase of the question when it actually arises. public servants the right to participate in such legislation? body of public servants the right to come under a measure which is to embrace all servants in private employment? Mr Fisher. that it would be undesirable to do so. The legal aspect of the question of interference I contend that with States rights is one which must be left to the lawyers of this House to determine. The contest will rage round the point whether we have the constitutional power to extend the Bill in the direction I propose. If we have that power, then undoubtedly the sole question to be determined is that of expediency. On the other hand, if the Parliament exceeds its rights by extending the operation of the Bill to the public servants of the States the corrective They .have attempted to will be administered by the competent Judges of the High Court-by men who are an honour to the Australian Judiciary. I have heard it said that we should be exceedingly careful not to exceed our powers. I am not one of those who entertain that opinion, nor do I believe that it would be well if it were open In this to us before taking action to submit any doubtful question as to our legislative powers to the High Court. That, in my It opinion, is undesirable, because under the Constitution a referendum may be taken in certain circumstances to enable the people If one of the States or to confer on the Parliament the authority embarked upon that to carry out any proposal to which effect cannot otherwise be given. I hold that, as a general principle, we must extend to the utmost our powers under the -Constituengaged in that industry, tion, provided, of course, that the majority that the private emof honourable members are prepared to accept the risk. I shall not attempt to enlarge upon this aspect of the matter further than to say that the argument that the extension of this Bill to the public servants of the States might interfere with, the States Treasurers' Budgets is not a sound one. We have appointed a High Court, whose decisions extend to every State, and in some That is surely an cases must, more or less, affect the Budgets of the various States Treasurers. It is, at best, only a quesIt has been argued with tion of degree; but it is a matter of the highest importance. The assumption is that even if our action led to an alteration in a State Treasurer's Budget, that reIt is urged that sult would have been brought about only by a decision of a Court. Some people contend that the Court would be in a sense a foreign It will be quite time Court. That may or may not be so; but if , under the Constitution, we have the power Why deny to take the action proposed by us the Court will not be a foreign one. It must be Why deny a particular an Australian Court, duly appointed under an Act passed by an Australian Parliament. ' I have yet to learn that there is a I hold Government or a Parliament of a State which would refuse to endorse the decision of the very highest Court in Australiaa Court which, I venture to say, is one of the most competent to be found in any part of the world. that a State Government or Parliament would refuse to honour a decision which would have the effect of altering the State Budget, or that the Court would be unjust to any State? My contention that this Bill should be framed on the broadest basis is due to my belief that it is our duty to extend the authority of the Commonwealth ramification in which it can operate to the benefit of the people generally. extension should be made, believing that it would be good for Australia, and for the people generally. Holding these views, as I do, it is my duty, as well as my pleasure 'and privilege, to put them before the Committee. We should endeavour to place the Public Service upon such a footing that they will have no cause to fear vindictive or unfair treatment. Their rate of pay and conditions of labour should be determined, not by Parliaments, which may be called upon to act at a time of political panic, but by a judicial body, capable and competent to determine what is just. I have heard it said that the Commonwealth and States employees have been well treated by the various Governments and Parliaments, and while I am not going to deny that assertion, I wish to place before the Committee my own experience in this regard-a n experience which I venture to say has been that of honourable members from other States. As the result of a Government remaining in power for a considerable length of time, I have known the most eminent members of the Public Service of Queensland to be afraid to express their opinions on public questions. Is that a desirable state of affairs ? The condition of affairs to which I have referred prevailed in Queensland, notwithstanding the existence of a Public Service Act and a Public Service, Commission. They were mere putty in the hands of the Ministry which had reigned for so many years. It is my desire that such littlenesses of Parliaments or Ministries-and I say this advisedly-shoul d not continue, because, I hold, Parliaments are the least competent Courts to adjust the disputes and differences of employees. The last change of Government made in Queensland led to at least half of the members of the Public Service, and perhaps five-sixths of the railway employees feeling that once more they had absolute freedom'; that they were once more free to express their opinions in favour of or against the Government Surely it is not contended of the day. That, no doubt, is a compliment to the stand taken up by the new Ministry. Why should it have been necessary for the public servants of that State to refrain for six or seven years from giving expression to their views on public questions? What must be the effect of the suppression of honestly held opinions ? The continuance of such a position would mean the and the States to every destruction of manhood. Do honourable of trade and industry members think that the Public Service of I desire that such an Queensland would have remained in that state if they had had a proper Court to which to appeal? I think not, and I feel that there are honourable members who could speak of a like position of affairs in regard to the Public Service of other States.. Mr O'MALLEY -The public servants of Victoria are slaves. what I know. I appeal to honourable members to say whether it would not be more dignified from a parliamentary point of view, and better for the Commonwealth and the States, if the public servants were brought within the scope of this Bill? I have to express my extreme regret that the Prime Minister, for,whom I venture to say we all have the greatest respect, has found himself unable to go as far in this direction as some of us desire. It is no pleasure to me to find myself at variance with the honourable and learned gentleman in this respect; but those who hold views such as I have expressed are bound to come forward and seek to give effect to them, whatever the consequences may be. In such cases it is our duty to submit a proposal to give effect to our views, and undoubtedly a newly elected Parliament should be able to declare its opinion in these matters. External Affairs) -The amendment submitted by the honourable member has been proposed by him in a manner that is absolutely unexceptionable. He has stated his case with his customary fairness and consideration for the views of others who differ from h i m ; but I have to submit, in the first instance, that the honourable member approaches the consideration of this amendment and its effects from a stand-point which is not open to him or to any of us.

That may be the first article of his political creed. He is perfectly justified in adopting any means which come to his haTid in order to give effect to it; but I contend that he has no such means to his hand as a member of the Federal Parliament, -and that the people of Australia, when they created this Commonwealth, not only refrained from endowing the Parliament with that power, but distinctly determined that they would not do so. From the very first time that this question was launched on the political platform, I have striven to avoid taking a merely iegal, or what might be termed a strict constitutional position,"" and under those circumstances have realized the force of an argument which was put before the House last week very forcibly by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne. In the course of his address he used words of warning with reference to any possible curtailment of our powers that might follow from the refusal to include this amendment, on the ground that it was unconstitutional. I do not know that that is an argument which ought to appeal much to honourable members on the whole, but I have always 1 thought that it is one which ought to appeal to the Attorney-General of the day who may be called upon, in discharging one or other of his duties, to advise on such issues in a fashion which might prove very decisive. came into my custody, under circumstances which we all still regret, it was as Attorney-General that I spoke, and it was in response to an interjection, I think by the honourable member for West Sydney in the course of the debate, that I replied that I would not willingly give utterance to an opinion which might have the effect, directly or indirectly, of curtailing, or seeming to curtail, the powers of the Federal Parliament. torney-General, under the special obligations which attach to that office j but now, exercising a somewhat greater freedom, I have still refrained, as far as possible, from appealing to considerations of that character, for the reasons given a few days ago, and I propose to-day to continue to oppose to those arguments only those legal and constitutional statements which seem likely to. affect the minds of honourable members. Mr Deakin. will tie my hands, but the mode has its compensations. I am not addressing the High Court, a Court of Appeal, or a Court of first instance. I am addressing a House of Parliament, which, though it contains a number of professional men, approaches these questions on grounds which 1 include the legal and the constitutional, but which also embrace political considerations. Consequently I have no complaint to offer because the honourable member who moved this amendment thought fit to avoid what really will be the crux of this questionthe strictly legal and constitutional issuewhich must certainly be raised. I regard that issue as of immense importance; I regard the principle embodied in this amendment as lying at the very foundation of our Federal form of government; if that be destroyed, in my opinion it will bring to inevitable wreck and ruin, the whole superstructure, so far as it is Federal. 'But while I take that ground on the question of principle, I am free to admit, as the honourable member has candidly admitted, and as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne most frankly admitted last week, that, looked at from the practical stand-point, it might be difficult for a bystander to discover precisely what was the vital issue on which we are divided. The amendment proposes to substitute a positive for a negative. The Bill contains an express provision that it shall not include the servants of the States, and the Bill as proposed to be amended will contain a positive provision that it shall. We When this measure first are faced by two propositions: First, that we have power to bring the servants of the States under the control of the Commonwealth; and, next, that, having the power, this is the proper time and place to exercise it. The amendment moved by the honourable member is similar to the one which was moved in the last Parliament by the honourable member for Kennedy. That proposal was negatived, and it was negatived probably because a number of those honI spoke as Atorable members who ag*eed with him, thought with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that the word ""industrial,"" in the particular grant of power with reference to arbitration and conciliation excludes public servants, as well as private employees, who are not engaged in an industry, and that, therefore, this was obviously an extension of authority to which we could lay no sound claim. Assuming that the opinion in the House will This has tied and follow something of the same trend, as the amendment includes all public servants, I shall not be unfairly taking an advantage of the honourable member in replying, if I deal only with the strongest case to be submitted-that on behalf of the railway servants, which will be laid before the Chamber very shortly. when it comes up? be to duplicate the debate. If I am to apply myself merely to the question whether public servants, other than railway servants, can be dealt with in this amendment, I can conclude my remarks in a very short time; but, by doing so, I cannot confine the debate to that branch of the question. A l though I admit that there is a difference, and a broad difference, between them on the grounds mentioned, yet, so far as the principle is concerned, it is the same in either case, whether we take a clerk in the Chief Secretary's or the Attorney-General's office, and say that his employment is not industrial, and that, therefore, he is excluded, or, whether we add him to the railway employees. vants. I do not think that honourable members who differ from me can complain that I am not meeting them fairly if I deal with what is avowedly very much the strongest part of their case. The honourable member for Wide Bay was perfectly justified when he said that one of the elements to be taken into account is the change in the conditions of industrial employment which has been brought about by the entrance of political bodies, whether State or Commonwealth into the field as employers. That marks a very considerable development on different lines from those upon which our race was accustomed to proceed a hundred years ago under forms of government such as we now enjoy. I do not dispute that this implies a difference in the application of the principles by which we are to be swayed. But, nevertheless, that argument of the honourable member's does not appear to me to be final in this matter, because, when the Constitution was drafted, these forms of State action were ' familiar to every one of its framers, and when it was voted upon they were within the knowledge and before the eyes of every citizen of Australia. When it was shaped, as I believed it was, with no view to include public servants of any class, no distinction was made, or intended to be made, .between those who could be, and those who were not engaged in what might be strictly termed industrial disputes. The strong ground on which the argument I propose to maintain is based is that, nowhere in the Constitution can honourable members discover an indication that it was the intention of its framers, or the intention of those who adopted it on the exposition of its framers, to include State servants of any class. I put that on the broadest ground. But I do not for that reason abandon 'the contention to which the honourable member referred-and veryfairly referred-that , so far as any practical result is likely to follow from this amendment, we shall seek far before we find it, and probably shall never find it, under any condition of circumstances. On this subject. I am happy to be supported by no less ardent an advocate of the amendment than the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. He said in his speech last weekI agree with the Prime Minister that it is difficult to see how a railway dispute could extend beyond the limits of a State. And in almost the next sentence the honourable and learned member saidBoth are State serI t is hard to conceive of a case. If so staunch an advocate of this amendment as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne felt compelled at the outset of his. remarks to make that admission, we may be perfectly certain that we are safe in going that length, if not a good deal further. We must recognise that, although the ostensible-and , indeed, the real-objec t of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay is to allow the railway servants to be dealt with by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, that object is rendered in effect impossible by the terms of the Constitution. The requirement that a dispute within the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court should be one extending beyond the limits of any one t State is a requirement with which, in this instance, it. is practically impossible to comply. I have given-that as the employees of a State are controlled by the State's laws, and work under its conditions, a dispute occurring in one State would not be a dispute that could extend to another State where the laws and conditions were different. As the honourable member for Angas put it, there would be no unity of interests on the part of the employers, and no unity of interests on the part of employees.",16,Conciliation And Arbitration

Commissioners in all the States agreed to make a 10 hours' day instead of an 8 hours' day ? there would still be insuperable difficulties in the way of making a dispute on such a question extend beyond the limits of a State. such an event the Railway Commissioners would take every care to adopt no such course as would bring them jointly under the control of the Arbitration Court. say that it is legally impossible or practically impossible? Â» sible; and I have the authority of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in support of my contention. That being the case, it may be said-"".Well, if the amendment? cannotafford to the railway employees the protection intended-if that is admitted even by some of the strongest supporters of the amendment-for what reason is the amendmentbeing pressed to this issue?"" It is being pressed to this issue in order to determine, as I have said, two questions. The first question is whether the Commonwealth has power to include the servants of a State at all and especially the railway vants. confessedly, we are beating the air-con fessedly, we are taking a step which can It can never be brought have no result, and can bring no relief. That question, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said, can only be finally 'determined by the Courtthe High Court in the first instance, and possibly the Privy Council in the second instance. The question therefore, is one of power or no power, at the very outset; yet that is a question which, although we are engaged upon it , we cannot determine. interpretation of the Constitution, would not the High Court be the Court of Appeal? I do not know the facts, High Court an appeal could be taken to the Privy Council. On that point-althoug h it must be due to a misunderstanding-the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne disagreed with me; but I fancy that if any question could be raised, which involves the rights inter se of the Commonwealth and the States, this is one of those questions; and, on further consideration, I think that the honourable and learned member will -possibly agree with me. But I do not desire to dwell upon that point, and only mention it in order to elucidate, this question as clearly as I can, and to separate from it the theoretical and abstract considerations. It is extremely doubtful Buti f there were a possibility ofi if we can touch the railway servants at all. What, then, are we contending for ? For this: A number of honourable members say that we should assert the power on the chance that we have it, because if we have the power it is one that oughi to be exercised here and now, and in relation to this particular measure. To which argument I make reply: That on the broad question whether the power should be exercised here or now, in my opinion, it should be exercised neither in this measure, nor at this time. I have given reasons, which I need not repeat, for taking up that ground. It appears to me that if the Commonwealth possesses this power, and can bring the railway servants within the scope of the Arbitration Court, it should at least stay its hand for a sufficient time to enable the States individually to follow the course which two of them have already taken, of establishing their own Arbitration Courts, and of remitting the consideration of the circumstances affecting their emserployes to those Courts.

39,Mr Deakin,"W it h the consent of thefailed, and until in the meantime the Arbitration Court has been established for a sufficient period to allow its procedure to become settled, and to allow the principles upon which it acts to become known to the public generally, there is littleor nothing to be gained by including the public servants of the States, if we could include them in this measure; and certainly nothing to be gained by imposing upon the Arbitration Court, in the first hours of its creation, problems among the most complicated that it is possible to conceive, so far as they are of an industrial nature. These are problems which, I am sure, if honourable members themselves were about to become members of .the Court, they would ask to be postponed until they had had an opportunity as a court of dealing with a sufficient number of cases between private employers and private employees, to enable them to come in touch with the con""ditions of industry obtaining in Australia, and to master the relationship between employers and employees, so that they might approach the immensely intricate questions involved in the consideration of the great State services with the advantage of the experience gained in dealing with less extensive and less complicated questions, free from all political associations. I do not desire to dwell on these points, and have indicated them merely in passing. Let me now say that I listened with_ surprise to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in the one line of argument which he addressed to this portion of the case; that is, to the question of expediency. member saidI f we once concede that it is not in the power of this Parliament to provide for disputes in which State servants are concerned, and which extend beyond any one State, we shall lay down a precedent which will be a guide hereafter, and it will be taken for granted that we have not the power. Parliamentary precedents are valuable; so far as they relate to the same Parliament they are usually binding. But it is perfectly possible, as my honourable and learned friend knows, for a new Parliament, if it think fit, to sweep away all the precedents which surround it, and create new precedents. obligation which rests on courts of lawmore an obligation of convenience in many cases, than of principle-to follow the of this Bill to the public servants of the States precedents laid down for them in similar cases. We are absolutely free, as a Parliament, to deal with every case that presents itself, although there may be a presumption-ver y often a weak presumption only-that future Parliaments will follow the precedents established by their predecessors. When the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne saysWe are the repositories of a most important trust for the people of Australia, both present and future, and we ought not, unless there is good ground, to surrender any of the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, I agree with him. But I deny that it is possible for this Parliament, even by an Act which received the Royal assent, to limit its own powers under the Constitution. These constitutional powers, whatever they are, stand above and quite independent of any of our acts. They stand there, not to be sacrificed by any Parliament; they stand there, the gift of the people of Australia, to be taken away by no less an authority than the people, when they think fit to do so, under the Constitution. When, therefore, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne employed language of that kind, I asked myself with much astonishment, what could possibly be the sense in which he used it? The honourable and learned member went on to sayIt will be found practically impossible in future Parliaments to exercise the power if we fail to assert it now. I ""can only say that I have never known a State Parliament pay that amount of consideration to the acts or formulas of its predecessors. On the contrary, I have The honourable and learned sometimes found it a most difficult task to persuade one Parliament to adopt and obey the precedents of its predecessor. In fact, the argument which I am maintaining now is very largely a difficult argument; and why ? BecauseI am asking this Parliament to follow an American precedent-to adopt a. precedent established by another Parliament, but_ under a very similar Constitution. It is a difficult contention, because the members of this Parliament feel in that respect that if they please they can create precedents for themselves. Therefore, it appears to me that this argument Of my honourable and learned friend, who is usually so powerful in his logic, is not justified by the circumstances of the situation. The honourable and learned member at page 1037 of Hansard is reportedWe are asked to refuse to extend the operation",19,Conciliation And Arbitration

41,Mr Deakin,"We have not even theupon the ground that we do not possess the constitutional power to take such action. With me that consideration overweighs any question of expediency. If we believe that we have the necessary constitutional power, by all means let us exert it. It will be remembered that the honourable ' and learned member was then considering the question of expediency, and his answer is"" If we have the power, let us exert it."" The honourable and learned member went onNow is the only time for us to exercise it. We must speak now, or be for ever silent. I wonder under what circumstances it could be said that a Parliament "" must speak now, or be for ever silent."" That Parliament remains to be created. The honourable and learned member proceededWhen we are told by the Government that we do not possess this power, we must insist upon testing the question. As a mere matter of expediency, as honourable members will see. 1035 the honourable and learned member is reportedThe mere fact of that ground, that we have not the power, being put before us, makes it expedient to test the question, whether we have it or not. That is the most unusual view of expediency, and of consideration of expediency, to which it has been my privilege to listen. I could understand the honourable and learned member basing his argument on such a ground in a matter of principle; but when confessedly weighing arguments for and against expediency, he argues that we must exercise every power we have on the first occasion, and to the utmost possible extent, I ask, where does expediency, or its possibility, begin? Howeverj these remarks were prepared in the hope that my honourable and learned friend would have had an opportunity of listening, and, perhaps,, replying to them, if he thought necessary. * I do not propose to take honourable members once more through the constitutional considerations submitted to them a few weeks ago. These have not yet been challenged, except by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne; and I shall wait until they me to point out that the honourable and learned member and one or two other honourable members-the honourable member for South Sydney parti>cularly-who, looking at the Constitution, find that in a number of places, where Mr Deakin. it is intended to restrict the power of the Commonwealth with reference to the States, there is in these cases specific mention of the States, appear to proceed on an assumption, justified when dealing with -most Acts of Parliament, that it is a fair inference, when they find States specifically mentioned in one part of the Constitution, that they are not deemed to be dealt with, unless they are also specifically included, in other parts of the Constitution. I must submit with great deference to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne any citation from American authorities, after the wholesale fashion in which he dismissed them. But the honourable and learned member must be aware that under the United States Constitution, which after all is the nearest to our own-whic h was framed under circumstances in many respects most similar-it is an accepted doctrine that so far as the Constitution is concerned the specific gift of a power does At page not limit any other grant of that power which may be contained within the Constitution. And if, as we have every reason to anticipate, our Court will largelybe swayed by American principles and American practice, when dealing with provisions taken from the American Constitution and based on American practice, and will, when dealing with them, attach some importance to the leading principle of the interpretation of the Constitution of the United States-if that principle be adopted, the whole series of arguments already addressed to us on the matter disappear from our view. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was unbridled in the contempt which he expressed for American decisions in relation to the interpretation of the Australian Constitution. The honourable and learned member said, as reported on page 1036 of HansardConcerning American decisions, I have long Aeld the opinion that they represent what the Judges thought the Constitution ought to contain rather than what it does contain. cases. argument is entirely irrelevant just now. We are not asking that the Judges' decisions are further traversed. Allow shall be employed when interpreting our Constitution, simply because that would be advisable. Our stand-point is not legal in the ordinary sense of the term, but is the broad, common-sense recognition of the facts and circumstances under which this Constitution was shaped. How",20,Conciliation And Arbitration
42,Mr Watson,That is admitted in some,21,Conciliation And Arbitration
43,Mr Deakin,"Very possibly; but thewas the Constitution shaped? With the exception of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, every member of the Convention had his mind full and his mouth full, as the debates were full, of citations of American practice, American principles, the American Constitution, and American judgments. If these had no value before-if they had no meaning or significance before-w e then made them our own. We dealt with them in this very Chamber, and in Adelaide and in Sydney; we breathed an atmosphere of precedents, chiefly American. The American Constitution, American authorities, and American inferences were on every hp. Sections were put into the Constitution, one, as it happens, by myself, based on nothing but a chain of American decisions. Some sections of the Constitution, which perhaps at present most embarrass those who are contending for a simple interpretation of it, arise from the fact that, instead of resting simply upon the broad powers conferred by the American Constitution, as, for instance, in the trade and commerce sections, we went on out of caution to provide against possible danger, to embody in special sections of our Constitution developments which in America are judicial decisions. There is only, one man who was a member of the Convention who has a right to follow the line of argument to which I refer, and that is the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. He is perfectly consistent in the position which' he takes up, but there were forty-nine other members of the Convention, not a single one of whom at any time adopted the honourable and learned member's View in that respect. The honourable and learned member says, speaking of American decisionsI do not think these cases have anything to do with this matter. I say, with all respect, that every member of the Convention will admit that American cases and the difficulties which they raised were in our minds at every turn. intention of the Convention in the slightest degree. matter ? intention. My honourable and learned friend is perfectly aware; as we all are, that in cases of difficulty, particularly in the interpretation of a Constitution, we are justified in looking at the circumstances under which that Constitution arose. We are justified in looking at the laws and conditions which were before the members of the Convention that drafted it. We. are justified, whenever in interpretation we are confronted by a doubt or an ambiguity, in looking at the materials out of which the Constitution is built. Let honourable members look at that Constitution with the most cursory eye, and they will be compelled to grant that four-fifths at least has been built out of materials quarried from American legislation andAmerican decisions, and requires to be interpreted upon American principles, if at all. to it. ' able member for New England has almost the same right to object as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, because he fought the Constitution upon the ground that it was too American. lian. ported too much of the United States Constitution. That was used by them as an argument against the Commonwealth Bill, but the argument is inverted now, because what is proposed does not suit their interpretation of a particular section. If that were a sound argument before the Convention as used by my honourable and learned friend the member for Northern Melbourne it is a sound argument now if used by him, and by those who agree with him. They argued that this Constitution should be refused because it was too Federal and too American, and I ask them why they should now assert that it is neither Federal nor American? The two positions are inconsistent. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is otherwise perfectly consistent. He never has been a federalist, and has never pretended to be one. In and out of the Convention he fought for the unitary principle, giving this Parliament,so far as possible, the ample powers of the British House of Commmons.

The Convention adopted a different course: framed a Federal Constitution, and. it is common knowledge to every honourable member present that the Constitution was designed to preserve the Federal principle by a limitation of the powers of this Parliament in the interests of the States. What we had to meet on the other side was an argument against these limitations, against these restraints of the power of this Parliament, and in favour of rendering the ""States Parliaments merely subordinate bodies. That was the whole fight of the Federal campaign, and it is that fight that is being renewed upon this occasion. learned gentleman should not say that. newed.

The honourable and learned member said, referring still to American de-. cisionsThe only judgments which have been given by Australian Courts are to the effect that these American decisions do not apply here. W h e n my honourable With all respect, I take leave to differ from the honourable and learned member. American decisions have been quoted in quite a number of cases in the Courts, and have always been listened to with great respect. In two cases, when asked directly to adopt such a decision, one the Wollaston case in Victoria,, and the other the import duty case in New South Wales, the Court did not follow the American decisions, not .because they differed from them, but because they adopted in the first another view of later American decisions which were put before them in the Victorian Court.

The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne went on to saySimilarly, the only judgment given by the Privy Council is one which tends to show that they do not apply even in Canada. He was no doubt referring to the case of Lambe v. Bank of Toronto. There, again, the Privy Council held nothing like the view attributed. What they decided was that, under the express terms of a special Canadian statute, they were called upon to give a certain decision, and they gave it.

Mr O'MALLEY -Perhaps the debate had better be suspended until the decision of the-High Court has been given. of another character, short, sharp, and decisive. I wish now to address myself to another comment of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. He saidThe Prime Minister has attempted to apply to our circumstanbes the United States decisions as to taxing Federal and State incomes, and has given us the benefit of an elaborate argument, which, I understand, has led him to the conclusion that we should violate some mystic FedeThe ral principle if we were able to include State public servants within the operation of the B ill . I confess that I do not see what the principle adopted in America with regard to taxing Federal incomes by the State, or State incomes by the Federal power, has to do with the interpretation of our Constitution so far as it relates to our power of legislation in regard to conciliation and arbitration. But for that statement, I should not have wearied the House-and I hope I shall not do so now-by even a reference to the argument. I quoted the decisions of a number of the leading judges of the United States, because they, in the clearest and briefest fashion, indicate to us the principles of interpretation pursued, whenever the State and central Governments of the country came into conflict. I thought that .they made perfectly plain that the decisions were based, not on any mystic principle, but upon the plainest and most common sense business principle. These decisions appear to me to lay it down clearly that Federation consists in a central Government and a number of other Governments working within that Federation, and that the very essence of the Federal principle is that each Government shall be guarded against intrusion and invasion by the other in reThen there gard to the means and instrumentalities by which each carries on its special work.

I venture to submit that the principle I have enunciated was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution and in the mouths of those who advocated the Constitution from the public platform when it was submitted to the people, and that it is uppermost in the minds of its defenders to-day.

If the High Court holds, as I believe it will, that the provision is ultra vires, no harm will be done. But suppose that the opinion of honourable members who are supporting the amendment proves to be right, the Bill will include within its scope the public servants of the States, and in regard to those servants will at once become operative.

The honourable member for Wide Bay pursued a similat line of argument this afternoon, when he said that to contend that the passing of this measure involves the taxation of the States is to say nothing, because any Court to which the States have chosen, or/may choose, to submit themselves, or the High Court to which, under the Constitution, they must submit themselves, may at times by its decisions cast them in damages, declare their existing obligations, and require them to f u l f i l them.

It was necessary to confer that power upon this Parliament to enable us to exercise it over the States. tution has conferred upon us the power to legislate for arbitration affecting States servants. The say that because the Constitution confers the power to interfere in regard to railway rates, through the Inter-State Commission, therefore States servants are included in the clause relating to conciliation and arbitration. The right to create the InterState Commission is expressly given in the Constitution, and the powers of that body are defined there. The last quotation I shall make from the speech of my honourable and learned friend is one of which I do not understand the purport. He is reported, on page 1032, to have saidI see on the face of the Bill evidence that it was meant to apply to the public servants of the States, but for the insertion on page 3 of certain words. My honourable and learned friend is in error there. As I have often said,the B ill , .without the words proposed to be amended, would not apply to the public servants or to the railway employees of the States, because we cannot deal with them. The Convention could have placed such a power in the ConI n this case it is not stitution, which, having been approved by the people, we could have exercised, but nothing short of an amendment of the Constitution in that direction will now enable 'us to apply this legislation to the servants of the States. The words were placed in the Bill, as was explained to the House, when the right honourable member for Adelaide made his regretted departure from the Government. He is held with the.honourable and learned member If the measure created for Northern Melbourne, that, without those words in the Bill, the servants of the States would be included. I held, just as positively, that, without them, they would not be included. Were we, as a Government, to come down to the House, one Minister telling honourable members that' the public servants of the States were included, alWhen honourable members refer though the provisions of the B ill did not expressly apply to them, while another Minister said that they were not included?

Would it have been fair to ask the House to vote for a B ill in regard to which there was an open conflict of opinion as to whether the public servants of the States were, or were not, included? This is why these words appear on the face of the measure. They are unnecessary words in a legal sense; indeed they are unnecessary in every sense, except that of rendering the political position perfectly plain, explicit, and straightforward upon <the face of the Bill. point, my friends opposite are quite right <not to content themselves with striking out <these words, relying upon the public servants being necessarily brought under the operation of the Bill. That would have been a devious step for them to take, and one which was not worthy of them. They have adopted the straightforward course. They say what they mean, and mean what they say. They hold that even if , in the absence of these words, the provisions of the Bill really extend to the public servants of the States and the Commonwealth, the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wide Bay cannot possibly work any harm. I have already defined exactly the Government attitude. We think that the public servants of. the States and the Commonwealth should not be brought under the operation of this B ill, for the reason that we have not the power to make it' applicable to them. Consequently we put on the face of the measure words which we think are unnecessary, except for the sake of placing our intention beyond the possibility of dispute. These words permit of no doubt as ""to the attitude of the Ministry upon, this question. It is the Federal attitude. seek to shear away from the States the buttresses upon which they are relying. Such aggressions must, even more than the financial provisions of the Constitution, bring them into absolute subordination to this Parliament. as the finances are concerned, the people of Australia accepted our Constitution with the powers plainly contained in it, after in every State, and with the clear knowledge that there was a great deal involved in them. Bill without a hint from any platform of which I have heard, without a word in any newspaper which I have read, without a whisper at any meeting of which I can find any trace, that legislation in the direction of conciliation and arbitration should extend beyond private industrial disputes. These the man in the street would naturally interpret to mean disputes in . ordinary employment when they extended beyond any. one State. We are not taking advantage of any legal quibble, of something which was overlooked at the timeI do not suggest that my friends upon the other side of the House are-bu t we take up precisely the position which was adopted by the Convention, that we cannot From their standhave a Federation unless the States, in the discharge of their immediate duties, in the control of their own Departments, are self governing. If they are not self-governing, they merely cumber the ground. They had better be swept away openly than undermined by surprise. It is because we recognise the might and majesty of the Federal principle at stake that we oppose the amendment which has been submitted. Minister, in a speech upon which we mav all congratulate him, has sought a broad line of demarcation between the supporters and opponents of this amendment, upon the ground that upon one side are ranged the advocates of unification, and upon the other the Federalists. To me it does not seem to be of any value to seek to whip that particular horse outside; but when the people investigate it, they will see that the answer to it is that even if we desired unification it is beyond our power to obtain it. The custodians of the Constitution the High Court-hav e already been apOur opponents pointed, and it rests with them to determine whether or not the amendment proposed is an infraction of State rights.

102,Mr Watson,"It may be a good crythe Prime Minister a few days ago, that the wording of sub-section xxxv. of section 51 was capable of quite a variety of constructions. It seems singular, when we reflect, that notwithstanding that the Convention contained such a large proportion of the ablest lawyers of Australia, that they were surrounded with the atmosphere of the American Constitution, and that they had all the decisions of the United States to guide them, from those of the great Chief Justice Marshall downwards, they have succeeded in importing into the sub-section to which I am referring as much ambiguity as it was possible to import into so few words. Only the other evening the Prime Minister told us that the last seven words of that provision divided into seven parts, and for.brevity I called them seven words. understood the honourable gentleman to say, was capable of a different interpretation. ThoughI am not a lawyer, and consequently not able to argue the matter to the same advantage as is the Prime Minister, it seems to me that there is no doubt as to the interpretation which it is intended shall be placed upon the sub-section, having regard to the constitutional position. It contains no limitations of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament beyond those relating to matters which are not affected by the contention of the honourable gentleman. The sub-section declares that we may legislate upon matters ofConciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. I admit that there is considerable doubt in my mind as to the application of the word ""prevention"" in relation to the words which follow. construction which should be placed upon the word "" industrial,"" there may be some disputation. There may also be some difference of opinion as to what constitutes a "" dispute."" But the question which is immediately at issue, that of whether we have power to extend the provisions of this . Bill to the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth, admits of no doubt whatever, because the limitations and exemptions which appear in other sub-sections of section 51 of the Constitution are absent, and I say significantly absent from this particular provision. Consequent!v. I endorse the opinion which was expressed by the honourable and learned member lor Northern Melbourne, who drew attention to the fact that the very sub-sections quoted by the Prime Minister in his second-reading speech upon the Bill bore evidence of having received different treatment at the hands of the Convention from that which was accorded to sub-section xxxv. In sub-section XIII., for example, the qualification was inserted, that whilst the Commonwealth has power to legislate upon the question of banking, it must be ""other than State banking."" Similarly, in the following subsection, whilst we have power to deal with the matter of insurance, it must be "" other than State insurance,"" unless these two forms of enterprise extended ""beyond the limits of any one State."" Then, again, subsection xxxiv. provides that the Commonwealth can undertake railway construction and extension in any State only with the consent of that State. In each of yhese subjections the Convention deemed it necessary to clearly express that. State enterprises were exempted from their operation. But sub-section xxxv. contains no qualification other than that which comes within the definition of a "" dispute,"" or the limits to which a dispute must extend. There is another phase of this constitutional question to which the Prime Minister has alluded. I refer to what constitutes a -"" dispute."" He argued that it was impossible to conceive of a "" dispute"" as between^ the Government and its employees ""coming within the purview of this sub-section. That is to say, it could not be a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. As I interjected at the time, it appears to me that, if that contention be correct, it vitiates the whole Bill as introduced by the Government. The whole of subsection xxxv. Again, as regards the of section 51 of the Constitution must be rendered nugatory and valueless, if the contention of the Prime Minister is-correct; because, practically, it never occurs that there is any necessary unity, amongst employers concerned in what we generally term a strike. If there is, there is no attempt to fine down the dispute, as the Prime Minister has attempted to fine down a dispute among railway employee's which would be held to have extended beyond any one State. In interpreting the word "" dispute"" we must accept its generally understood meaning. We must interpret the words "" industrial dispute"" as meaning that which is a strike, or likely to result in a strike. The extension of nearly",28,Honourable Members No No
103,Mr Deakin,I treated it as if it were,29,Honourable Members No No
104,Mr Watson,"Each of those parts, Ievery large strike, or of the dispute which has led up to it, has almost invariably been by wayof sympathetic action on the part of individuals other than those first affected by it, and, so far as my knowledge goes, these continued extensions have been the cause of all the serious' strikes or industrial disputes from which this and other civilized countries have suffered. If , therefore, -the contention put forward by the Prime Minister is correct-and I cannot assert dogmatically that it is not-it renders the Bill as a whole valueless, and we are simply wasting our time in attempting to place any such measure on the statute-book. Except, perhaps, in the case of the employees of a ship-owner whose ships trade beyond the boundaries of any one State, and whose industry is spread over several States, there would be a difficulty in applying the provisions of this Bill. I do not see how it would be possible to apply the provisions of this measure to any dispute, even amongst private employees, whSch extended beyond one State, if it were necessary, as the Prime Minister contends, to prove that it was a dispute with the same employer and in respect to the same matter. Minister's argument further than he intended to go, in saying that it must be a dispute with the same employer. from his assertion that a sympathetic strike of public servants in one State could not be held to be an extension of a dispute between another particular State and its employed. same matter were at issue it must be a real dispute, and not a sympathetic one, on both sides of the border. If the men on' the other side of the border were suffering from the same disabilities, the dispute in both States might be the same; but if the men on the other side of the border, in spite of being paid at the higher rate claimed by those on this side, took action, how could it be said that it was an extension of the dispute. Thev would be already in receipt of all for which those on this side were asking. tion. the worse of the class of disputes, to which this Bill is specially designed to relate, would be outside the purview of the measure, even if the suggestion just made by the Prime Minister as to the meaning of the word were correct. reason why the matter should receive further attention. I reiterate that my own ' experience is that the most dangerous strikes from the stand-point of the general community' are those in which there is a sympathetic extension of the original trouble. One is able to very materially localize disputes in which there is no active sympathy shown by bodies which are directly affected. But it seems to me that if this measure is to achieve all that some of us desire, it will be necessary to make it so far-reaching as to prevent the possibility of the whole railway systems of the Commonwealth being idle because of a sympathetic strike. Another matter with which the honourable and learned gentleman dealt was the question of taxation. He replied at some length to the considerations advanced in that regard by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. There was a refreshing lucidity associated with that honourable and learned I may have carried the Prime member's arguments. They appeared to me to be so clear that they must affect many in whose minds there might previously ha%'e been some doubt. the Prime Minister has realized how far his argument in regard to the question of taxation is likely to carry him. If , as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne argued', the contention was sound that there could be no justification for imposing conditions which might involve the rights and wages of railway employees, and consequently affect detrimentally the finances of the State, should we be justified in incurring any expenditure whatever which might detrimentally affect the finances of a State? specific power given in that regard than there is in this.

The Prime Minister knows as well as every other honourable member that it was impossible to expect an answer from the people in regard to every detail of a Constitution so comprehensive as this one is, and so I am not at all alarmed by that argument. learned gentleman says that we who at the time of the referendum objected to the Constitution on the ground that it was fashioned too closely on the American, model, should now accept the corollary of that-of agreeing to the use of American decisions in its interpretation. It does not seem to me that there is any particular force in that argument, because in the first place our Constitution departs very widely in many respects from the American model. Although it follows primarily the American model in regard to the constitution of the Senate, still m its later provisions it differs very materially. For instance, with regard to the provisions for a joint sitting of the Houses and other matters of that -sort it differs essentially from the American Constitution.

It is made by men who are largely prejudiced against that side of the question. representation. has done in that regard is no guide to this Parliament in the interpretation of a provision that finds no place in the American Constitution, and which affects a matter which has so far elicited no response from its legislative bodies.

MrO ' MALLEY But these decisions are old. that the old decisions referred to were conThe honourable and nected with this particular matter, except so far as they appeared to affect the question of taxation. I do not think that even the question of taxation can be held to be really germane to the interpretation of this provision. I do not wish to do more at this stage than to say a few words with regard to the expediency of this amendment. Of course, I make no appeal to honourable members who, like the honourable member for Wannon, are opposed lock, stock, and barrel to the Bill.

136,Mr Willis,"I s it not impossible forcessary at this stage to answer a question of that description; but the honourable member's interjection reminds me of a contention put forward by the Prime Minister ,about which I think.it necessary to say a word. He stated that it was beyond the bounds of possibility to contemplate another railway strike. Well, I have had a good deal of experience of industrial matters * amongst the unions responsible for strikes, and, as a long-time trades unionist myself, I say that I would not be too ready to accept a single defeat as an indication that there would not be another strike. My experience has rather been the contrary; and while I regret as much as any one can do the strike on the Victorian railwaysthough I fully admit that the men had ample justification for making a strong protest against the. manner in which they were treated-still , while I take that view, I should not like to assert that among any body of British workmen, at any rate, a single defeat would do more than accentuate their desire to get justice. would be a pitiful thing for the race if it were not so. their own people and their own Parliament ? strates that they could not trust them, even as far as they could see them. When they trusted them, or were prepared to do so, they were not only deprived of their rights but insulted into the bargain. I do not say for a moment that that set of conditions will be repeated in other States. I do not think that it is likely, in view of our experience, that it will be hurriedly repeated even in Victoria. have to contemplate the possibility at any period of the whole industrial and productive machinery of this Commonwealth being made idle by a cessation of work on the railways, and in connection with other institutions. If this be so, is it ment had jurisdiction only in those quesnot as well to insure against even the . remote risk of such a disaster? A business mana merchant-ma y put up a big warehouse which is as fire-proof as it is possible to make it. He may introduce all the latest fire-quenching appliances which he can obtain. But he does not dispense with his insurances. of a fire may be remote, but he makes "" assurance doubly sure"" by going to a good office and taking out a policy on his stock and buildings. So in this case I say that, so long as there is a possibility of a strike, it is our duty to guard against it ; and I certainly think that those who believe in the principle that it is the duty of the State to prevent these disasters, should be willing to interfere just as quickly-in the interest not only of the men concerned, but of the whole community -wheneve r a trouble of that description threatens amongst State servants. the present amendment as raising the most serious question that has yet emanated from any section of the Federal Parliament. I believe that it strikes at the very root of Our Federal system; and I have no hesitation in saying that if the supporters of the amendment succeed.in placing it upon the statute-book, and it is found to be operative in practice, it will do more harm in the Commonwealth than the Federal Parliament can condone for during many years to come. I speak not as an enemy to compulsory arbitration and conciliation, as honourable members know, but as one who supAnd it ports the principle wherever its operation is required. It is not for me to say whether this amendment is within the letter of the Constitution or not. But I do say, most emphatically, that it is utterly opposed to the spirit of the Constitution. It is opposed to the Constitution as explained to the people of Australia by its framers. All the leading lawyers who occupied seats in the Convention, when advising the people of Australia to accept the Constitution, probably laid more stress on this aspect of it than on any other, viz., on the rights of the States as distinct from the powers that it was proposed to hand over to the Federal Parliament. It was explained to the people But we most emphatically on every platform,. arid in the press of Australia, that the Federal Parliament could not interfere in any way with the Departments that were left under the control of the .States Governments. It was pointed out that the Federal Parliations that were expressly handed over to it by the Constitution. Assuming that it may be found that the framers of the Constitution were wrong-if there has crept into the Constitution power for the Federal Parliament to exercise control over the States Departments-the n we should look The risk a little further and see what is likely to follow.

160,Mr Mclean,"The honourable memberAustralia. What can a State Government or State Parliament do if it has not control of a single Department? How can' a State Government or Parliament carry on under such conditions? What residuum of power will be left to the States? The proposed interference strikes at the very root of Federation, so far as I understand the position. As to the question of expediency, I may say that I sat in the Victorian Parliament for nearly a quarter of a century, and during that time. I think I demonstrated that I am a friend of the working classes. I do not think that I ever recorded a vote against the interests of those classes, and the best proof is that I have always received their support at elections. I am still as much in sympathy with that section of the community as I ever was. I did as much as any one in the Victorian Parliament to secure them equal power as against those who contended for what I considered undue power; for the propertied classes. I opposed plural voting from the very commencement, doing my best to give one vote, and one vote only, to every man and woman in the community. Buti f I see that that section of the community contemplate a step which, in my opinion, will be detrimental to their own interests, and injure them, perhaps, as. much as it will injure any section, I should not be worthy of the trust they have reposed in me if I did not act upon my honest convictions. I believe no section of the community will suffer more if this proposal be given effect to than will the public service of the different States. I ought to limit my remarks to the railway servants, and, perhaps, the employees of the Postal Department, who may possibly come within the definition of "" industrial."" Sir GEORGE Printing Departments. MrM c LEAN may come within the definition, but it is utterly impossible to carry on successfully a large industrial department, such as that of the railways of the States, under dual control-unde r control divided between the States and the Commonwealth.' The public debt of Australia is largelyinvested in the railways, and there is no question in which the Commonwealth is more deeply interested than that of the future welfare of the railway servants. slightest doubt that it would be fatal to the successful working of the railways to place them under dual control. Moreover, the State, as an employer, is in a very different position from that of a private employer, private firm, or private company. Private employers are personally interested in driving the hardest bargain with their employees, and in getting all they possibly can out of them. The Governments of the various States, on the other hand, reflect the will of the people, and have always been generous employers; at any rate, they have always been fair employers. sweating by 'some State Governments. MrM c LEAN It is possible there may have been errors in individual cases. Does the honourable member say that this tribunal of three men will be endowed with such omniscient powers as will enable them to do justice to every industry throughout the Commonwealth? Does the honourable member think that this Court will not be liable to error? Has the honourable, member lost all confidence in the people, whom he, I believe, did his best to endow with supreme political power? all pur Law Courts. M i . M c LEAN I believe that the people are more generous than the Law Courts. The Courts do only bare justice, whereas the people may deal, and I contend, have dealt, generously with the public service. I have administered a good many Departments in my time, and, so far as mv experience has gone, I have found States employees extremely contented. I know that when a man gets into the employment of a State it takes a great deal to induce him to leave his position. Further, I know that tens of thousands of people outside the public service are continually clamouring to get in ; and that is the best proof we can have that the States have ever been I am speaking of all who State is more certain. MrM c LEA N -No doubt employment by the State is more certain. Buti f they did not approve of their pay and conditions of labour they would surely not be so anxious to remain in their employment, and there would not be much difficulty in inducing them to leave it.

New South Wales can appeal to an Arbitration Court there. that. matter. My honourable and learned friend must see that that is an appeal to a Court which is a creation of the State Parliament. What is proposed in this Bill will be a Court, the creation of the Commonwealth Parliament, and over the heads of the States Governments. with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. arguing all the time that this Arbitration Court will do something wrong. Court will be composed of only three men, and that two of them will necessarily be men of ordinary capacity, and of no very great business experience, if they will accept a salary of Â£700 a year, because no man of extensive business knowledge need accept such a salary. I do not consider that the robes of office will give to these men any knowledge which they previously did not possess. I assume they will do their work honestly according to their lights, but I do not for a moment place them on a par with Railway Commissioners paid Â£3,500 a year, men who have had extensive experience in other parts of the world. If ever there were a time when people might crave to be saved from their friends, I think it is on the present occasion. there never was a time when the best interests of the public servants were more endangered than they will be from the movements of those who with every desire to do the best they can are proceeding upon erroneous lines. So far as the interests of the Commonwealth are concerned, do honourable members think that those interests can be properly conserved if all the services of the various States are to be conducted under a dual control ? posed to reason and experience. ment apply to dual control in private enterprise ? does the honourable member refer ?

I claim that I brought more trades under the operation of the Victorian Factories Act than did all-the other Victorian Ministers combined, but I did not bring a single trade under the operation of that Act until I satisfied myself that there were a few in the trade-and the number was very few in every instance-wh o would not do justice to their employees. The great majority of the employers were entirely with me in the action I took, and signed petitions to be brought under the Act in order that they might be saved from the competition of men who would not act fairly by their employees. instances that the Arbitration Court will be brought into operation. we find that the great majority of employers act fairly by their employees; but there are some who will not act fairly by them, and a tribunal of this kind is very useful to prevent strikes, and to prevent the waste, expense, and heart-burnings involved in the settlement of an industrial dispute by brute force. In such cases I have no doubt that intervention under a Conciliation and Arbitration Act may do a great deal of good; but it is only in cases in which such intervention is absolutely necessary that the provisions of such an Act should be applied. I have heard my honourable friend contend that if this is a good thing it should be extended to every case, to the public serI feel sure vants as well as to private employees; but I do not regard this in the way in which we regard our daily food.

There are 12,000 railway employees in Victoria, besides many hundreds of other public servants, and the honourable and learned member's statement, instead of strengthening his case, seems to me to weaken it. My main objection to the amendment is that it strikes at the root of the Federal principle. It would be utterly impossible to carry on Federation successfully if the amendment proved to be operative. I do not for a moment believe that it will, because I am confident the High Court will pronounce it to be ultra vires. If , however, the contrary should prove to be the case, a deathblow will be dealt at the Federation. That would lead to the abolition of the Federation, or to unification, and I am not an advocate of either. taken a deep interest in this question, because I feel that I shall be called upon to part company with some of those for whose opinions I have the greatest admiration and respect. I shall have to part company with the Prime Minister, than whom, I consider no man in this Parliament more truly represents national ideas and aspirations, not only in politics, but generally in regard to the Constitution. ' The matter to me, however, is one of conscience. I feel that it is necessary that I should satisfy myself as to our powers and duties as a Federation, and that having done this, I should have no hesitation in following the course which I deem to be right. to ourselves the position which we take up in regard to the question now before us, and I think that I can do this to the fullest extent. against the amendment in the form in which it has been presented by the honourable member for Wide Bay. It purports to embrace the whole of the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth. I fail to see how it is possible for us, under the terms of the Constitution, to pass a Bill of this kind which would embrace the public servants connected with, say, the Audit Department of the State of Queensland, or the Treasury Department of New South Wales. I attach great importance to the definition of the word "" industrial."" We are bound by the wording of the Constitution, according to which we can legislate only with regard to "" industrial"" disputes ; and I cannot see how Departments such as those I have mentioned could be deemed to be "" industrial."" be an industrial Department ? press an opinion upon that matter. The Patent Department is not under the control of the States. Upon the question which the Prime Minister treats as vital, namely, whether we should bring any State servants within the scope of the Bill, I part company with him, and intend to support an extension of the provisions of the measure to the States railway servants. I shall do this upon two grounds. First, because I believe that it may be held to be constitutional; and, secondly, because I regard it as highly expedient. The Prime Minister, in dealing with the question of constitutionality, has laid too much emphasis upon sub-section xxxv. of section 51. He says that there is no reference whatever to the Statesin the sub-section, and that therefore the States are not included within the scope of the powers to be exercised by the Federal authority in regard to conciliation and arbitration. He lays it down as a general rule for the interpretation of the Constitution that wherever a grant of power to the Federal Parliament contains no mention of the States they are not included within the scope of the powers conferred. With all deference to the Minister, I take a different view. I think that he overlooks the fact that the really vital sub-section bearing upon the matter with which we are now dealing is sub-section 1, relating to our power, to make laws with respect to ""trade We have to justifyand commerce with other countries, and amongst the States."" This is amplified by section 98, which provides thatIn the first place, I shall vote The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State. The Prime Minister was eloquent when he pointed with great admiration to the American Constitution, and told us that our Federal Conventions had been largely influenced by American precedents. He informed us that these were followed in delegating to the Federal Parliament",37,Turner Ther E Are The Generous Employers

The Prime Minister has told us how a provision, placed in a Constitution with the intention of meeting certain ends, may, after the lapse of years, when new conditions have arisen, be dealt with in the light of the developments which have occurred, with the result that new meanings are imported into it, and wider applications given to it than were anticipated by the original framers. could not have given-a better illustration than the trade and commerce provision in the Constitution of the United States. During the first sixty years of the history of the Union that provision did not come under notice more than twenty times. But since then there have been at least 200 decisions in regard to it by the Supreme Court of the United States. One text-writer has saidThis is a remarkable instance of a national power, which was comparatively unimportant for eighty years, and which, in the last thirty years, portance. The United States Congress in has been so developed that it lis now in its nationalizing tendency peihaps the most important and conspicuous power possessed by the Federal Government. How has that come to be applied ? It is under that section of the American Constitution the words of which read as follow :The Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes. Underlying those simple words is a printhe chairman of the Inter-State Commerce ciple which has received the widest appliCommissipn and the Commissioner of Lacation.

This was the intention of that Act, as formulated in one sectionThat is the That whenever differences or controversies arise between railroad or other transportation companies engaged in the transportation of property or passengers between two or more States of the from the Imperial statutes. United States, between a Territory and a State, within the territories of the United States, or within the district of Columbia, and the employees of the said railroad companies, which differences or controversies may hinder, impede, obstruct, interrupt, or affect such transportation of property or passengerscertain action shall follow. Therefore, our power to regulate trade and commerce, which the Convention adopted from the Constitution of the United States, is a power to deal with railways generally. Let me first establish that proposition. Two sections of our Constitution deal with the reguHe lation of railways; we have been dealing with one of them only. I wish to direct particular attention to this vital provision, because the control of the commerce of Australia is a national power which we must preserve to the Commonwealth. Anything which hinders or impedes the free carriage of passengers or of produce from one part of the Commonwealth to another is to be prevented, and this power to regulate trade and commerce is one which we as a national Parliament must regard as of national im1898 repealed the statute to which I have just referred, and passed another, an Act"" concerning carriers engaged in Inter-State commerce and their employees,"" section 2 of which provides thatWhenever a controversy concerning wages, hours of labour, or conditions of employment shall arise between a carrier, subject to this Act, and the employees of such carrierconciliation or amelioration there is power is that when the arbitrators have given a upon the parties.

So far as the United States are concerned, it has been held that there is clearly invested in Congress power to legislate with respect to railway disputes extending beyond the area of one State. What is the provision in our Constitution? Apparently the members of the Convention wished to give to the Commonwealth all the powers which the section of the American Constitution to which I have referred gives to the Congress of the United States. They wished to give to this Parliament all the powers' conveyed by the words they used. In the United States, Congress relies upon those words for its power to pass anti-trust laws, and I am sure that that is a power which this Parliament wishes to have. Our authority for it is the provision in the Constitution which confers upon us the power to regulate trade and commerce American Constitution, which is our great The Prime Minister, in reply to the honourable and learned member for Corio, stated that this particular provision would not bind the States unless express mention was made of that intention.

The power to deal with trade and commerce includes the railways of the States, and we know that the provision in the Constitution of the United States has given Congress power to pass an Act of Conciliation and Arbitration applying to the railways. In my opinion the proper course to adopt in construing section 51' is to add to the power under sub-section 1. the power which is contained in paragraph xxxv. of section 51 of our Constitution we shall see that it confers upon Congress power to deal only with trade and commerce. There, the Parliament can adopt measures to prevent any obstacle being placed in the way of the free transit of goods, but our Constitution goes much further, and gives us power to legislate for all sorts of industrial disputes that may occur throughout the Commonwealth. It really amplifies instead of cutting down the power which is contained in sub-section 1. I submit, therefore, that, following the exemplar, we clearly possess the power to deal with the States railways. trade. position. Under our power to deal with trade and commerce, we have ' power to regulate the railways of the States. Consequently, if a railway dispute arises which extends beyond the limits of any one State the Commonwealth has power to deal with it.

In the first place, he holds that the proposed amendment is contrary-h e did not say to'the "" spirit"" of the Constitution, as the honourable member for Gippsland suggests-bu t to the general principle underlying' the Federation. In other words, it is contrary to the distribution provided for in the Constitution, of the powers vested in the central and the States Governments. His second proposition, is that the States public servants are excluded from the operation of this Bill, because they are not specifically mentioned. His third objection is that there may be some sort of prerogative attaching to the servants of the Crown. This prerogative is an undefined one, which the Prime Minister will not touch. His fourth proposition is that the proposal is tantamount to",39,Turner Ther E Are The Generous Employers

226,Mr Groom,"It is a power which isout an Arbitration. Bill? quote a decision on the point. In re Debs the learned Judge saidI f the emergency arises, the army of the nation and all its militia are at the service of the nation to compel obedience to its laws. Prentice and Egan, in The Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, state thatMost cases in which this power has been considered have involved the constitutionality of State statutes. The Federal power is not limited, however, to a control of the State, but extends to . the removal of any obstruction in the way of the freedom of Inter-State commerce and the execution of Federal laws. In the judgment the learned Judge himself referred to the fact that the Federation had the power to control the States, and to prevent them from obstructing .commerce. Andi f they have that right over the States a fortiori, they have the same right over a voluntary association, such as a body of men on strike, and interfering with trade and commerce as a whole. The point which I wish to emphasize is that, in certain conditions which might arise in the Commonwealth, the States, in the interest of the nation as a whole, would have to be subordinated, and the Commonwealth would have to exercise its powers on behalf of the nation. The principle, therefore, is that there are two sovereignties, but that in many ways there is Federal restraint over State action. There is, for instance, a restraint placed upon State action, both from a legislative and executive point of view in regard to coinage, interference with trade and commerce, and other different matters. There is this restraint, not only upon the State in its legislative powers, but upon the corporate powers of a State in the exercise of its own particular laws. The Prime Minister's proposition, therefore, is not one which is applicable to the present position. What is his second point? It relates purely to the rules for the construction of a statute. ster says that because the word "" State"" is not used in the sub-section in question, the State is not bound. have been provided for in express words if it had been intended. tion, which, I submit, is the correct one, has been clearly defined by the learned annotators Quick and Garran. In dealing with the meaning of the words "" other than State banking,"" which occur in sub-section x i i i . of section 51, they lay down the rule of interpretation, and quote as an authority the case of Rhode Island v. Massachusetts. The principle laid down is that according to the rule of interpretation in the United States, wherever there is a general grant of power without any exemptions in the Constitution of the United States, it is deemed to have conferred upon Congress the right to exercise to the full extent the powers conferred upon it. Where no exception is made in terms, none will be made by mere implication or construction. The annotators mention that the words "" other than State banking"" were inserted in sub-section XIII . , so as to exclude the general rule of interpretation; that had it ' not been for the insertion of those words the general rule would have operated. That, I submit, is the correct rule of interpretation, and if we apply the Prime Minister's argument to other sub-sections, it will be found that it is not a good one. Let us refer to sub-section xxxn. of section 51, which provides that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall have power to make laws for the control of railways with respect to transport for the naval and military purposes of the Commonwealth.

If the whole of the farmers and other residents in the interior are to be placed at the mercy of a strike executive. or of a Minister, who may cause trouble at a moment's notice, they will be in a precarious situation. They are justified in saying"" If you are going to introduce a measure which purports to deal with the peace, welfare, and good government of the community as a whole, we demand that you should preserveto us the highways."" For after all, what are the highways of the Commonwealth? It is) along these that the life-blood of the nation flows A citizen's right to go over the whole of the Commonwealth dependis upon his ability to travel on the highways. It is absolutely of vital importance to every citizen of the Commonwealth that he shall have the right of travelling freely along these highways of commerce, and be able to send the product of his industry along them. The railways are the only means by which the people in the interior can get their produce to the various centres; and I say that as a matter of vital importance to them, and as a matter of expediency, the railway servants should be included in the provisions of this B ill , so as to prevent obstructions to commerce. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I am sorry that I have the misfortune to differ from my honourable and learned friend, the member for Darling Downs, in the main d r if t of his argument on this important question. It will be very unpleasant for us to have to part company in the coming critical division.

I never suspected that such a power was to be found in the sections of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and I venture to sav that on a careful analysis, examination, and scrutiny, it will be found that no such power does exist.

293,Mr Groom,"If it extended beyond asection i of section 5r, has been cut down in our Constitution to much smaller dimensions than exist in the trade and commerce section of the United States Constitution. Because, in our Constitution, there are a large number of special sections which have been inserted especially, to deal with special matters; and every special section which has been put in, to the extent -pro rata that that section goes, tends to cut down the trade and commerce power. For instance, we have certain sections dealing with the railways. No railway can be constructed in a State without the consent of the State. Under the unlimited and unqualified trade and commerce power of the United States Constitution, it has been held that the Federal Parliament there can construct Inter-State railways, or authorize their construction, without the consent of the States affected. So that these special sections tend rather to cut down the delimitation of the trade and commerce power. In the same way also, the section which my honourable and learned friend has referred to, whilst it apparently extends the trade and commerce power to railways, ispractically a limitation, whan comDared with this special sub-section xxxv. of section 51, relating to conciliation and arbitration. Therefore, the inference is, that the trade and comunder this sub-section to extend the jurismerce power vested in the Federal Parliament by the Constitution relates purely to the interchange of Inter-State goods, and also to trade and commerce beyond the Commonwealth. Therefore, also, it cannot possibly be construed to mean and to include the power to deal with industrial matters which are covered by another section. I apprehend, consequently, that section 98 should be construed to mean that power is given to the Federal Parliament to promote InterState commerce, and to abolish obstructions, or to minimize possible restrictions; but, certion to extend to State institutions or State tainly, it cannot be extended to the wide sense of interference with State institutions, such as State railways. That section was inserted on the motion of the leader of the Convention, upon a doubt which was previously expressed, and which was entertained by the drafting committee, that the trade and commerce power contemplated by sub-section 1, was not wide enough to extend to State railways. It was put in solely and exclusively for the purpose of enabling the Federal Parliament to facilitate Inter-State trade and commerce, and to remove obstructions, or rather to strengthen the power to prohibit discriminations and preferences, which tended to in2 N 2 terfere with the free flow of trade and commerce between the States. It is a startling proposition to hear it suggested that the trade and commerce power is to be utilized to deal with industrial disputes for which other provision is made in special sections of the Act. I think it will be found on consideration that we shall have to rely solely and exclusively on the special sub-section for dealing with industrial disputes. Andi f the power contended for is not to be found there, I venture to predict that it will not be found in any other part of the Constitution. I should like to say this: that I view this Bill from a sympathetic attitude. I do not view it from the point of view of any desire to defeat it, or any desire to prevent the free operation of the power granted by the Constitution. I was a party to the granting of the power in the Constitution, and I should be very sorry indeed to cast any reflection upon the grant, or to impede its free, fair, and fullest operation. Therefore, I approach this question not so much from the standpoint of expediency, or the desirability of bringing it into operation, but from the standpoint of whether we have the power diction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to disputes in which public servantsare involved. For my part, I strongly believe-and I do not entertain any reasonable doubt upon the point-that thissub-section does not extend, and was never intended to extend, to publicservants and others employedin StatesDepartments, railways or otherwise. I believe that it was intended tooperate solely and exclusively upon private individuals and private corporations,, and that it was not intended by the Convenagencies or instrumentalities. I believe that if any such idea had been suggested in the Convention it would have been scouted. The sub-section was passed by a Convention where the States rights party was strongly represented. It was supported by a large number of the representatives of smaller States solely on the ground that it would be advisable to put in the four corners of the Constitution some provision to prevent any such industrial disputes, or such calamitous troubles, as had previously taken place, and were then within the mind and contemplation of the Conventionsuch as the maritime strike, or the shearers' strike, and other disputes between employers and employed, which it was deargument could, and ought to be sirable to prevent and suppress if possible. applied in the wider sense, that where we But it was never suspected, and certainly find the Crown or King in possession of not intended, that this power should extend either common law powers or statutory to State agencies.

This was an action by the Attorney-General of New South Wales to recover from the Federal Government certain Customs duties, amounting to Â£6oo or Â£700, which had been paid in respect of importations of railway material, the property of the State of New South Wales. The Government of New South Wales sued to recover this money on the ground that it had been improperly levied. The plaintiff's case rested on two grounds; first, on the ground of the prerogative, that this material being Crown property, was therefore exempt from taxation; and, secondly, on the ground that it was specially exempt by section 114 of the Constitution. While the Acting Chief Justice held that this material, as railway material, was liable to taxation and was not exempt by section 114, he went on to take the ground that inasmuch' as the Crown was not mentioned in the Customs Tariff Act as intended to be bound and made liable for taxation of its property, therefore this property was exempt -it . was exempt because the Crown was not named in the Federal Customs Act. was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. the Court, however, went further, and dealt with the case on a much wider basis. Mr Justice Owen and Mr Justice Pring both decided that in their opinion these -were State imports, and, being the property of the Crown, were exempt from taxation, firstly by section i r 4 of the Constitution, and secondly on the common law ground that there was nothing in the Constitution to show that it was intended by the Imperial Parliament, when it passed the Constitution, to abate or surrender the prerogative rights of the Crown. going to appeal against that judgment. made by Mr Justice Owen and Mr Justice Pring are very interesting, and I think they will help us. said :The case for the plaintiff was presented from two points of view-first , the Crown's prerogative; second, the construction ' of sec. 114 of the Constitution Act. . . . The King is the head of the Commonwealth and of each State, and the revenues of the Commonwealth and of each State are raised by Parliament as a grant to the King at-the King's request, and are appropriated by Parliament to the several services of the King in the Commonwealth and in the .States respectively. . . . The prerogative of the King, when it has not been expressly limited by local law or statute, is as extensive in His Majesty's colonial possessions as in Great Britain. Mr Justice Pring in his judgment draws a very interesting comparison, remarkably accurate and vivid, between the position of the Colonies as self-governing communities before the passing of the Federal Constitution, and the position of those Colonies when they became States under the Constitution. I hope honourable members will bear with me while I read Mr Justice Pring's remarksI think it may be useful to consider the position of the Australian Colonies before the advent of Federation. Before that event, each one of the Colonies was autonomous. Each had its Constitution granted by the Sovereign of England, and was entitled under that Constitution to regulate its own domestic concerns, and to pass its own laws, subject only to the veto of the Imperial Government. Each was a dependency of the British Crown. And the Government in each case was the Government of the British Sovereign. . . . Such being the state of things until the passing of the Commonwealth Constitution Act, I proceed next to inquire how far that Act affected the status of the Colonies, or States, as they became after Federation. Now, I find nothing in the Act which reduces the Government of the States from their former position as branches of the Queen's Government. That is a most significant pronouncement of opinion by one of the Judges of the Full Court in New South Wales-that there is nothing in the Act which in any way impairs, prejudices, or diminishes the position of the Governments of the States as branches of the King's Government. It must be plain that, if this amendment is carried, the position of the States Governments' as branches of the King's Government will be seriously impaired; because, if the argument be correct, their financial and administrative control of their public departments will be seriously invaded, if not entirely taken away. Quoting Lord Watson, in a Privy Council case, the learned Judge saidThe object of the Act was neither to weld the provinces into one, nor to subordinate provincial Governments to a central authority. Mr Justice Owen He said, further, thatThe Commonwealth Act did not destroy the autonomy of the Colonies, nor did it affect the Queen's Government as carried on in those Colonies. ' It merely provided a new branch of the Queen's Government for the purpose of administering certain matters of common interest to all the Colonies.

297,Sir John Quick,"The observationsNew South Wales, on another branch of the Constitution, it is true, but laying down the general principle that the King's Go-* vernment in-the States was not intended to be prejudiced or in any way impaired by any of the grants of power within the four corners of the Constitution. Accordingly he held that, even though the contention of the Federal Government were correct, viz., that goods imported by a State were not "" property"" exempted from Federal taxation by section 114 of the Constitution; yet according to the argument based on prerogative alone, apart from section 114 of the Constitution, State goods were exempt from Federal interference, and from Federal taxation. I contend that, if that be so, much more, therefore, are the States Departments of States Governments free from Federal interference and Federal regulation. The same principle will apply to them with irresistible force. It has been contended by the leader of the Labour Party, in several of his arguments, and with an ability and ingenuity one cannot help admiring, that, in one or two sections of the Constitution, such as "" banking, other than State banking,"" ""insurance, other than State insurance,"" the States are specially excepted, and the honourable member wishes us to believe that, wherever there is no express exception of the State, the 'State is bound. Probably, without an acquaintance with the principles of statutory interpretation, according to British methods, one would think there was some force in that contention. My honourable arid learned friend, the member for Darling Downs, has this evening given great prominence to that argument, and has sanctioned it. But surely the honourable and learned member must see that he has ignored the decisions of the English Courts, and also the decision of the Full Court of New South Wales in the import duty case, where it was held that, even although State imports, goods, wares, and merchandise imported by the State were not property within the exemption of the Constitution^ they would otherwise be exempt, unless specially named as liable to taxation. learned member agree with that decision? learned member must see that in the New South Wales case, counsel quoted, and their Honours in their judgment quoted, the well-known case of Weymouth v. Nugent, 34 L.J.M.C. 81, which, by the way, is quoted also in the Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, from which the honourable and learned member did Mr Garran and myself the honour to quote. This is mentioned for the purpose of showing that in all the statutory enactments the Crown is never bound in respect of its property, power, or prerogative, unless specially mentioned. One or two exceptions or exemptions in. an Act of Parliament ought not to lead to the inference that things which are not exempted or excepted are withdrawn from the domain of the rights of the Crown. The rule is that the exemption or exception of the Crown in one section of an Act, or in one part of a section, does not imply that the Crown is bound by other sections of the Act, or by other parts of the section, where it is not named. In one case-the Weymouth case I mentionedan Imperial Act imposed wharfage dues on certain articles, including stones. It did not bind the Crown to pay such dues, but it exempted it from liability in respect of coals imported for the use of the Royal packets. There is a special exemption."" In the same way as under our Constitution, State banking and State insurance is excepted, coals were excepted. The harbour authorities desired to levy dues upon other articles. imported by the Crown, and they said"" Seeing that you are only exempted from paying dues upon coals, you are therefore liable to pay dues on everything else you import."" The Court refused to infer from the specific exemption an intention to charge the Crown in respect of any other goods. That decision was adopted without question by the Full Court of New South Wales, in the case of The Attorney-General of that State v. The Collector of Customs, and it affords an obvious reply to the contentions regarding special exemptions of the Crown, because it shows that any special exemption, or several exemptions, are not sufficient to support the argument that in other matters -the Crown is bound. Therefore, I contend that the fact that the Crown is not. mentioned in sub-section xxxv. leads us to the obvious inference that the Crown Departments in the States are not intended to be bound. I submit that that was the intention of the framers of the Constitution,and that that was the plan on which the Constitution was built, namely, that the King's Government, in the various States at the time of the passing of the Federal Constitution, was not to be prejudiced or hampered or in any way interfered with except to the' extent that is expressly indicated on the face'",48,Xxxii Of Section 51 Of The Constitution Was

I shall later on direct attention to States Constitutions, and show that their control over their Departments remains unaltered and unimpaired. I wish to refer to an appropriate illustration of the Federal rule of construction given by the Prime Minister. He quoted from the decision in the case of Collector v.

The other Departments remain intact, unaltered, and unimpaired. True, some of the powers of the States are gone, but the power of organizing and working these Departments remains intact.

May aand I invite the attention of honourable members fore, to the report of the debates which took power to deal directly with individuals, will be place in the Convention during the Melframed, and the resource thus be rendered unbourne session, when clause 98 of the draft necessary. Constitution was introduced? Sir Edmund In another passage, which is reported on Barton is reported on page 2390, vol. 2, of page 15, Mason argued that the official record to have saidThis clause is simply for the purpose of removing a doubt as to whether the powers of the Parliament extend to State-owned railways. And, again, in the same speech he saidThe object of my present proposal is to remove a doubt as to whether the Commonwealth would have power to regulate trade and commerce on State-owned railways. The Convention inserted that provision to remove all doubt, and I ask why, if it were intended to give Parliament power to deal with industrial disputes affecting State railways, it was not expressly so stated in paragraph xxxv. of clause 51 of the Constitution? It has not been so stated, and the absence of words setting out specifically that the intention was to embrace State railways or State Departments of any kind, negatives all reasonable presumption that power over State Departments is implied. I should like to refer to, and to confirm, the argument used by the honourable and learned member for Angas in his very interesting and able speech, wherein he submitted that the laws of the Federal Parliament were intended to operate on individuals and not on the States. In support of that contention I quote the words of the Supreme Court of the United States in Hylton versus the United States, 3 Dallas, 171. That case was decided in 1796, and the following words occurred in the judgment:The present Constitution was particularly intended to affect individuals and not States, except in particular cases specified, and this is the leading distinction between the Articles of Confederation and the present Constitution In support of my contention I should like also to refer to the debates in the American Federal Convention which drafted the United States Constitution, and in which reference is made to the same question. They are reported in Bancroft's History of the Constitution of the United States, vol. 2, page 19. There it is.statedLastly, the Virginia plan authorized the exercise of the force of the whole nation against a delinquent State. ment of Mason, expressed a doubt of the prac-. ticability, the justice, and the equity, of applying force to a collective people. against a State,"" he said, "" is more like a declarawould be considered by the party attacked dissolution of all previous contracts."" I , therehope that a national system, with f u l l In the nature of things punishment cannot be executed on the States collectively. Therefore, such a Federal Government is necessary as can operate directly on individuals. I contend, therefore, that all the laws of this Parliament can only operate directly on individuals. It is true that the States are bound by the Constitution, and only by the Constitution. States Governments refused to carry the Commonwealth mails ? special power is given to this Parliament to pass Federal laws dealing with the question. That power appears expressly on the face of the instrument. I refer to the power to deal with railway rates for the purpose of regulating Inter-State trade and commerce, of which postal communication forms a part. The Constitution confers on the Commonwealth express power, by the exercise of which, in the direction of special legislation, it can deal with all obstacles to Inter-State trade and intercourse power to coerce the States to the extent of carrying out the Constitution ? conferred on the Commonwealth, this Parliament can exercise it. that the power to make this Bill applicable to the public servants of the States is not conferred by the Constitution, because in it the States are not named in this connection. In other parts' of the Constitution, where it is intended to bind the States by prohibition or injunction, that intention appears in express terms. For instance, it is specifically enacted that they shall not interfere with freedom of trade. The High Court could enforce' these mandates by injunction against any State officer or against any private individual acting under the orders of a State.

308,Sir John Quick,"My contention isact against a State Government, except by declaring the nullification of its laws as contrary to the Constitution. I know of only one provision in the Commonwealth Constitution which contains anything in the nature of a command to the States to do a certain thing. It is to be found in section 120. There it is stated that the States shall make provision for the imprisonment and detention in its prisons of persons convicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and the Parliament may make laws to give effect to that provision. Therefore, where it is intended that the States shall perform a positive act, it is clear upon the face of the instrument; and if the Constitution makes default it allows Parliament to step in and work out the problem presented as best it can. I do not know how the Commonwealth Parliament could make the Government of a State responsible for the imprisonment and detention of transgressors against Federal law. Nevertheless, it is an express mandate to the States, though there does not appear to -be any particular means of enforcing it. Much more then is the argument applicable to this case, in which the States are not named. Yet we are asked to pass a law to bind the States. I wish now to invite the attention of the Committee to another question, namely, the extent to which the States Governments and Parliaments under their respective Constitutions retain control over their State-governing agencies. It is said that the bare general words of this clause practically withdraw from the States their control over their own Departments. Let us examine the Constitutions of the different States. like to say that, although these Constitutions do not appear as annexes to the Commonwealth Constitution, they are in essence chapters of that instrument of government. They must be read as part of the Federal' Constitution. What is the power of the Parliament and Government of New South Wales over its Departments? Bv the Constitution Act of that State-and I take it as a typical one, because it was the earliest charter of government granted to these States, and all the subsequent Constitutions are founded upon the same modelHer Majesty shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the said Council and Assembly, to make laws for the peace, welfare, stitution. and good government of the said Colony in all cases whatsoever. I admit that there has since been withdrawn from the Parliament of New South Sir John Quick. Wales and other State Parliaments a certain amount of authority which they were previously capable of exercising in reference to industrial disputes. The present Federal power over disputes which extend beyond the limits of any one State is a new and compound power. It is made up of a power which was previously enjoyed by the States and of a supplementary power. From this drag-net grant of powers in the States Constitutions which I have just quoted, some of the power which the States Parliaments previously possessed over industrial disputes has been withdrawn. But the authority so withdrawn relates exclusively to the power to deal with industrial disputes in which individuals or subjects of the King are concerned, and not the King himself or the King's departments-no t the State itself, or the State Departments. I also wish to direct attention to several other very important provisions in the Constitution which are relative and material to this discussion. Section 47 of the Constitution of New South Wales declares thatA l l taxes, imposts, rates, and duties, and all territorial, casual, and other revenues of the Crown (including royalties), from whatever source arising within this Colony, and over which the present or future Legislature has or may have power of appropriation, shall form one consolidated revenue fund, to be appropriated for the Public Service of this Colony, in the manner and subject to the charges hereinafter mentioned. From a perusal of that section it will be seen that all revenues of the Crown from all sources arising are intended to form one 1 Consolidated Revenue Fund, which can be HereI would dealt with only in a specific manner. That manner is set out in section 53, which provides thatAfter and subject to the payments to be made under the provisions hereinbefore contained, a l l the consolidated revenue fund hereinbefore mentioned shall be subject to be appropriated to such specific purposes as by any Act of the Legislature of the Colony shall be prescribed in that behalf. In the first place the money goes into the consolidated revenue fund, and then it can be appropriated or taken out of that fund only by an Act of the Legislature. by the accompanying provision of the Conis not.

That is my argument, and I think that it is absolutely unanswerable. those who entertain doubts in regard to this question. I go straight to the point, and I feel absolutely convinced that my view is the correct one.

There is no distinction practically or in law between a Railway Department and any other Department, of a State Government. It is true that there may be a distinction in name. fact.' distinction, unless it exists at law, and I contend that there is no distinction either in fact or at law. The section of the Constitution of New South Wales, to which I have referred, provides that all the revenues of the Crown shall go into the consolidated fund, and shall only be taken out by an Act of the State Parliament. We find that, although the management of the railways of the States of Victoria and New South Wales have been transferred to Commissioners, they have been so transferred merely in trust for the States Governments -in trust for the Crown. The Commissioners have certain powers of organization and management vested in them as the representatives of the people. . All their powers are conferred upon them on behalf of the Crown.

There is no surrender in that section of the parliamentary control over the revenue of the Department. Then in secBut we cannot imply the surtion 59 it is provided that the Commissioners shall prepare estimates of receipts and expenditure in such form as the Governor in Council may direct for each period of twelve months ending 30th .June in each year. Then the Treasury regulations under the Audit Act provide that the full amount of all collections of revenue of all the Departments of the Government, including the Railway Department, shall be handed to the Treasurer, accompanied by a statement of the collections, and no money is to be held in suspense by the Commissioners, or any other State authority. The Audit Act provides that no sum of money appropriated shall be used for any service other than that for which it has been appropriated in the same year. Treasury, has to be certified by the Commissioner of Audit as "" legally available"" for the purpose to which it was devoted by Parliament. In face of these constitutional provisions, in face of the Audit Acts of the States, in face of the absence of any express grant of power over States Departments, to the effect contended for, I submit that it would be futile to press these arguments too far, and if any attempt be made to enforce them it will amount practically to an invasion of the constitutional rights of the States. I do not suppose that any honourable members desire to bring about a conflict of that kind; but it undoubtedly will mean that. In the Victorian Act there is also power given to the Railways Commissioners to pass regulations for determining the relative rank, position, or grade, the duties and conduct of the employees in each branch, and such regulations, when confirmed by the Governor in Council, have the fuli force of law. So that there is a delegation of the power of appointment contemplated by the Constitution from the Executive Government to the Railway Commissioners; but it will be observed that the Executive Council still retains its grip over the annual expenditure. Any scheme of annual expenditure has to be submitted to the Executive, and any regulations made by the Railways Commissioners have to be approved by the Governor in Council.

326,Sir John Quick,"There can be nober, 1896, and in which there is what purports to be a scheme for the classification of ail railway servants. The first regulation isThe amounts set forth in the schedules hereto shall, on the future appointment, promotion, or classification of any person, be the rates of salary or wages payable to persons holding any of the positions therein specified. The second regulation saysNothing in these regulations shall apply or be construed so as to diminish or prejudicially affect the pay which any employee is receiving at the time of these regulations. The regulations contain a scheme for the classification of officers in the traffic branch from lad porters, messengers, carriage cleaners, and labourers down to watchmen, messengers, and gatekeepers, and the whole of the pay for these various classes of men of different ages and engaged in different occupations and different grades of work, is specified. That has been approved by the Governor in Council. I ask honourable members to consider what is proposed in this amendment. It purports to confer on the Federal tribunal authority to deal with, first, the right of appointment. Honourable members may ask why I make the statement. Because the Bill enables the Federal tribunal to provide that none but union men shall be employed, or that preference may be given to union men. It may pass an award saying that the Railways Commissioners are to employ none but union men. ject if they had the power; who could object ? Under the Constitution the power of appointment to the railways is vested in the State Government, and that power has been delegated by the State Parliament to Railways Commissioners, subject"" to the approval of the Governor in Council. Do honourable members contemplate what is really possible, or what would be attempted to"" be done in order to give effect to this Arbitration scheme ? Suppose that a dispute did occur, that the Railways Commissioners were summoned before the arbitration tribunal -it may be that they would appear under protest-and that they were asked to enforce an award. They would say"" However much we might like to enforce this award, we cannot increase our votes, because our Estimates are passed from year to year by the State Parliament, and here are'our regulations passed by the Governor in Council."" It is true that the State Parliament could override the regulations, could increase the gradation and classification, could increase the remuneration attached to each grade; but how can honourable membersask the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales or Victoria to carry out an award for which no provision has been made b f the State Parliament? They would say-""G o to the State Treasurer"" Suppose that they went to the State Treasurer he might say-"" I have no objection, but the State Parliament will not recommend it."" What would become of the award ? I submit that the test of a power is the capacity to enforce it, and if there is attached to sub-section xxxv. no provision for enforcing an award against a State Government then such a grant of this power is not intended. There is very strong power to enforce an award against private individuals-workme n and masters -by attachment, imprisonment, fine, and so forth, because without that power the provision would be a nullity and sham. But where is the power of enforcing an award against a State Government? From the absence of that power I draw the conclusion that the provision was never intended to apply to State governing institutions and State governing instrumentalities, but to only private individuals and private institutions, and those not subject to the States Constitutions. I am convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that this contention alone affords a fatal and an overwhelming objection to the constitutionality, as well as the practicability, of the amendment. a State Arbitration Act? cause the State Parliament created that tribunal. In the New Zealand Act the power of the State tribunal is limited within certain conditions by the Appropriation Act for the year; it can only alter by increasing or decreasing within the limits of the classification defined in that Act; it cannot increase the grant. it goes to the very root of the whole scheme.

We could not give a right of action against a State at large, unless it was within the limits of the grant of power contemplated by the Constitution. I admit that if any case arose under a Federal law, justified 'by the Constitution, then it could be enforced, but the whole thing turns on the question whether the establishment of a Federal Arbitration tribunal is justified by the Constitution. Even in our Judiciary Act there is only provibuilt upon it for the future happiness and prossion for bringing an action against a State in respect of contracts and torts, so that that Apply that prophesy to this situation. We would not help us in the slightest degree. The reply to that argument is that in those cases the States have submitted to the jurisdiction of this Parliament in matters arising under the Constitution. My contention is that such a case as this would not arise under the Constitution. My right honourable friend, the Minister for Home Affairs, has drawn my attention to section 68 of the Act, which provides that all expenses incurred and moneys payable by the Commissioner of Railways in any proceedings under this Act shall be payable out of moneys to be appropriated. The money is not actually appropriated by the Act itself. So that this Western Australian Act creating a State Arbitration tribunal does not provide for a special appropriation, but leaves it to Parliament to vote the money to meet any awards. NowI wish to conclude. I believe that the expectations and the hopes which are being held out and indulged in as to what is to flow to the public servants from the adoption Of this amendment, are doomed to disappointment. But in addition to that I am afraid that if the amendment be carried it will lead to the beginning of an"" agitation or a movement which may, in the end, result in the break-up of this Constitution as a Federal Constitution, and in a reform that will conduce to unification and the government of Australia by one central authority. Sir, the framers of this Constitution, while endeavouring to create a national government for the determination of all national questions,were most anxious to preserve State autonomy and home rule in matters of local concern. On this point of the tendency to centralization, which the amendment marks, I should like to draw attention to the following passage by John Fiske in his very interesting work on The Critical Period of American History. On page 238 he writesI f the day should ever arrive (which God forbid !) when the people of the different parts of our^country shall allow their local affairs to be administered by prefects sent from Washington, and when the self-government of the States shall have been so far lost as that of the departments of France, or even so far as that of the counties of England-on that day the progressive political career of the American people will have come to an end, and the hopes that have been perity of mankind will be wrecked for ever. can only look forward with apprehension to any policy which is calculated to impair the usefulness of the States Governments, to destroy the free operation of local self governing institutions, and to transfer the local autonomous power to fhe central",56,Xxxii Of Section 51 Of The Constitution Was

It may be that at times they may pass legislation which is distasteful to many of us. It may be that at times they may not deal out that even-handed justice to their employees which many of us would like. But I believe this that in this democratic country our institutions and our franmember, in addition to my honourable and chise are so free and so wide and so liberal that a grievance which is pronounced and generally recognised will not remain long unrectified and unredressed. I believe, therechosen to reply to the honourable and fore, that the troubles in Victoria upon which this amendment has been practically based, and from which it has been evolved, will before long be rectified in the ordinary course of local self-government. I believe that they are capable of rectification without the intervention of this great national Parliament. wider Australian issues. with Inter-State matters, with external matters and with Imperial matters. We should allow the States to work out their own salvation, and to solve their own problems as best they can. Surely we cannot doubt the democratic power and force of the Victorian people any more than we doubt the democracy of the people of New South Wales. grievances. Public opinion comes to the side of justice and rectitude. that this grievance, about which so much has been made, and which many of us regret so much, can and will be remedied, without any attack on the autonomy of the States, and without any stretching or straining of the Federal. Constitution, which we should all regard as the palladium and bulwark of our national life and liberties, and which we should all unite in protecting and defending against unnecessary invasion. Prime Minister, in speaking to the amendment moved by my honourable friend, the member for Wide Bay, disclaimed any intention of repeating any of the legal and constitutional arguments against the acceptance of the amendment. able and learned friend, the member for Bendigo, has himself the duty of. very ablyand thoroughly presenting that aspect of the case once more. I am sure that the Committee is under a distinct debt to him for his clear and comprehensive presentation of the issue. I take it that the case has now been stated sufficiently from that stand-point. We have neard two legal representatives on the one side, and we have heard m y honourable friend, the member for Gippsland, who has dealt with the matter in his own clear and characteristic fashion. So that any man who may have wished for argument and explanation has had them to the f u l l . I should have been very glad had some other honourable learned friend, the member for Darling Downs, and my honourable and learned friend, the member for Northern Melbourne, learned member who has just sat down. But I should like to be permitted very briefly to say a word or two as to why we still regard it as an essential of this measure that railway and other public servants should be included. The Prime Minister said that the Convention did not contemWe have to deal with plate the inclusion of public servants.

The Convention contemplated the recurrence of perhaps one of the direst Time rectifies all these calamities that ever overtook Australia, and felt itself bound-the most conservative AndI am sure member of the Convention felt himself bound-to prevent any such catastrophe. After considerable discussion, therefore, and with great effort, and by a not very wide majority, this sub-section' was in -, serted .in the Constitution. But what have we to do with the intentions of the Convention? No one knows better than the Prime Minister and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo-and , indeed, they have admitted so much-that the intentions of the framers of this Constitution have absolutely nothing to do with the matter. And yet, having admitted so much, they refer again and again to the fact that the Convention did not contemplate the extension of this sub-section to the public servants of the States. ' It is My honora well-known and admitted fact that in this connection debates in a Parliament or a Contaken upon vention are not to be considered for one moment; and when I interjected to that effect the Prime Minister said that, while that was perfectly true, the Court would have a right, if a sub-section were ambiguous, either in words or intention, to consider the whole of the circumstances.",57,Honourable Members Hear Hear

351,Mr Hughes,"What the ConventionThatI do not deny; but while the Court is to consider the whole of . the circumstances, i i is not to consider those circumstances as deduced from the statements of men in the Convention. I defy any honourable member to tell me of one case or one judgment where in the interpretation of an ambiguous section or statute, it is permissible to have regard to the statements of members in debate. did not contemplate the inclusion of public servants is not to the point, in any case. Had the railway strike, which lately occurred in A ictoria, or had the other strike 7 which occurred a little less, recently in Western Australia, taken place at the time when the Convention was sitting, does any one here say that the Convention would not then have contemplated the possibility of a recurrence, and have inserted such a sub-section to meet the occasion? I tice Clark, in his Australian Constitutional Law, sets forth, and to quote in support thereof, the statement of one who is, I suppose, the greatest jurist America has brought forth-Chief Justice Marshall. On page 19 of Mr Justice Clark's work we readIt li:is been repeatedly stated that the fundamental rule for the interpretation of a written law is to follow the intention of the makers of it, ns they have disclosed it in the language in which they have declared the law. In cases in which the intention of the law makers was clearly limited to"" a specific purpose by the use of explicit and direct language, which is not capable of application to any other purpose, there cannot be any difficulty in applying the rule. The writer goes on to say that, where there is any ambiguity, we are to interpret the language, of the law by the process of construction, and proceedsA pertinent example of the application of this principle of interpretation to the language of the Constitution of the United States is found in the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United Stales of America in the famous case of Dartmouth College v. Woodward (a), in which Marshall, C. J-, said "" It is not enough to say that this particular case was not in the mind of the Convention when the article (b) was framed, nor of the American people when it was adopted. necessary to go further, and to say that had this particular case been suggested, the language would have been so varied as to exclude it, or it would have been made a special exception. The case being within the words of the rule must be within its operation likewise, unless there be something in the literal construction so obviously absurd, or mischievous, or repugnant to the general spirit of the instrument as to justify those who expound the Constitution in making it an exception."" I take it that here we have a clear, definite statement of the principle that must guide any Court, and which must guide the High Court of Australia, when it comes to inter' pret this particular sub-section. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has endeavoured to show-bu t I doubt whether it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Court-that it was the direct intention of the Convention to exclude the public servants of the States. If it is said that the Convention did not contemplate the matter at all, then obviously the Convention could not have had the intention of excluding public servants from the operation of the sub-section. If there is one feature about American decisions and the American Constitution that is worthy of attention, it is that to which I propose now to allude. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo and the Prime Minister declared that they had never heard, on any platform in the Commonwealth, nor read in any newspaper, one word to lead any one to believe that it was the intention to apply this sub-section so as to include public servants. I ask the Prime Minister, or any other man, whether the American citizens who adopted the American Constitution, ever for a moment contemplated some of those amazing decisions of the American Supreme Court, in which it was declared that such and such a thing was within the Constitution, not in such a measure as this, which on the face of it is arguable, and which might have been contemplated, but in regard to matters that, under no conceivable circumstances, could ever have been contemplated by any set of men who'lived at the time the Constitution was framed.

There has lately been a railway strike in Victoria; and it is because of that strike, and for no other reason, that the amendment is moved. ment, because at this particular time the extension of the functions of the State in various directions is one of the cardinal principles in which' the party to whom I and the honourable member who submitted the amendment are attached, believe. If it be declared that the Constitution does not permit of a law to adjust disputes which may, and in time must, occur between a State and its employees, all I have to say is that it will not be very long before the public servants of Australia will be such an appreciable number of the whole population that to allow them to remain outside the operation of a tribunal of this sort would be neither more nor less than an outrage, and would be, I believe, a fitting subject for indignant protest by those private employers who would be compelled to abide by the decisions of such a tribunal. Quoting the words of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, my honourable friend said that a strike in a railway service which would bring it within the scope of this B ill was inconceivable. have nothing to say upon that, but that possibilities are not supposed to be bounded by the imagination. I have already pointed out that there have been numerous decisions given by the Supreme Court of America which would have transcended the possibilities of any imagination at the time the American Constitution was framed. Any man who can say calmly and assuredly that there is no possibility of another railway strike may be gifted with some greater degree of prescience than I can lay claim to, but I am rather of the ooinion expressed by the honourable member for Bland, and I say, as the right honourable member for Adelaide said during the last Parliament, that one of the results of a strike is that whichever side is beaten goes back with a sullen determination to abide its time, and when its time does come, it unsheathes its sword with added vigour, and it thrusts with the venom that comes of subdued passions and denied rights. wrong and injustice. so, while men in the' world have to struggle against injustice. we need to introduce such a measure as this for the purpose of preventing that which must inevitably occur in the long run. As to whether we have the power to do what We support the amendis proposed, I am rather inclined to adopt the attitude of the honourable member for. Bland, and say that that is a matter entirely within the province of the High Court. We have heard from the honourable and learned member for Bendigo a long and learned disquisition about the law on this point. We have had some excellent reasons put forward to show why it could not apply; but nevertheless one thing is abundantly clear: The gentleman, methinks, doth protest too much. If it was as clear as we have been asked to believe, why these long disquisitions, why these references to authorities, and why not, relying entirely upon the weakness of the other side, put the provision in the B ill, resting calmly on the assurance that the High Court will throw it out with contempt? But my friend, the honourable and learned gentleman at the head of the Government, knows f u l l well, and indeed admitted it this afternoon, that the danger is not that the High Court will throw it out, but that they will keep it in. TheI honourable and learned gentleman said ""Supposing they keep it in?"" Does any honourable member mean to contend that any action of ours can coerce the High Court? W ill any man say that we can dictate to the High Court the law on this point? Obviously not. But while we cannot, by any action of ours, extend the powers of the Constitution, we may easily restrict them. We cannot go one step beyond that allotted to us by the Constitution under which we live, move, and have our being; but we may easily, from pusillanimity, or through dread of some of the bogies raised, be terrified from not going far enough. Let us then bring within the fold all those who we believe have the right to come within it, and leave to the High Court the business of saying whether it is constitutional or not that they should all be so included. monwealth rights. the Crown is not bound by this section of the Constitution, and it has been said that consequently nothing we do will alter the matter.

361,Mr Hughes,"It has been argued thatGenerally speaking, unless the Crown is named, the Crown is not bound. But in the case ex parte Postmaster-General, In re Bonham (1875), 10 ch., D. 595, at pp. 600, 601; 48 L. J. Bank, 84, at p. 87, decided by Jessel, Master of the Rolls, this judgment was givenThe question we have to decide appears to me to be a very simple one. The first point to be considered is what is the general law on the subject of the prerogative of the Crown. that I think there is no dispute whatever. general rule, as expressed in Bacon's Abridgement, 7th ed., p. 4621, is-"" That where an Act of Parliament is made for the public good, the advancement of religion and justice, and to prevent injury and wrong, the King shall be bound by such Act, though not particularly therein; but where a statute is general, and thereby any prerogative, right, title, or interest is divested or taken from the King, in such case the King shall not be bound unless the statute is made by express terms to extend to him,"" and the point came before.the Court of Exchequer in Attorney-General v. Donaldson. In some circumstances, therefore, the Crown is bound without being specifically named, and I take it that in such a case as this the onus is upon those who say the Crown is not bound, because not named. The honourable member for Bland quoted sub-section xiii. and xiv. of section 51 of the Constitution, ""and the reference to banking, "" other than State banking,"" and to insurance, "" other than State insurance,"" to show that the Crown was bound, and I think his point a good one. We have powers over' these things, and the honourable member pointed out that, because, under sub-section xxxv., State servants were not specifically exempted, they were therefore included. Under sub-section xv. of section 51 we have power to make laws in reference to weights and measures, and I ask whether, supposing a State starts a store, or adopts the Gothenburg system and runs an hotel, as the State of Western Australia has alreadv done, it can be said that that State is not amenable to the law relating to weights and measures, though the State be not named in the Weights and Measures Act? Take the navigation law; will any man say that the King's ships are not included in that law if they be not specially exempted? If that be the law, I ask why, in the Navigation Bill now before the Senate, the King's ships are specially exempted ? empt under the Constitution. apply to all ships ""other than the King's ships."" But, in any case, will any man say that we have not a general power to deal with the Crown, and that the Crown may not, by assenting, assent thereto, and thereby divfest itself of its prerogative? Any one would imagine that, supposing this paragraph did not read, as my honourable friend wishes that it should read, and that the prerogative of the States vested in the Crown had not been taken away, we should not have the general power to legislate as we please, subject to the Constitution, and Now on The that this legislation would not take effect and bind the Crown, even if the Crown itself afterwards assented to it. Upon this point, the case, which has already been referred to by the honourable named and learned member for Darling Downs, namely, that of the Queen v. Byramjee, appears conclusive. "" It was held that, though there was a reservation of the right of the Crown, yet, as the Act in Canada was made in pursuance of an Act of Parliament of Great Britain, the powers contained in that Act did take away the prerogative of the Crown."" Thus it would seem that, in their Lordships' view, a Colonial Act assented to by the Crown, through its authorized representative could interfere with and regulate the exercise of the prerogatives of the Crown as the fountain of justice, so far as the rights of those under its jurisdiction were concerned. If so, there must be a similar power as to other Royal prerogatives of the same character, subject, of course, to the Crown's right of veto. And certainly it would seem that there is such power, if Gwynne, J., is correct in what he says in Lenoir v. Ritchie : "" An Act of Parliament passed by the old Legislatures of the respective Provinces which now constitute the Federated Provinces of the Dominion of Canada, under the Constitutions which they had before Confederation, of which Legislatures Her Majesty was an integral part, as she is of the Imperial Parliament, upon being assented to by the Crown, was competent -to divest Her Majesty of the. right to exercise within the Province any portion of her Royai prerogative."" . I say, then, that it is clear that even if it be held that under sub-section xxxv. of section 51 the Crown is not bound because it is not named, yet, if we inserted a provision naming the Crown, and the Crown assented to the Bill, it would be bound thereby. Therefore, all the arguments of my honourable friend, with reference to the Crown not being bound, fall to the ground. If this be a Bill for the redress of a public wrong, or one which is intended to secure good government and justice, the Crown, even if it be not named, may be bound, or if this be held to be not such a measure, and that the Crown needs to be specifically named to be not bound, yet if it be not so bound under the Constitution, it may by its assent divest itself of its prerogative, and so render the legislation operative.

363,Mr Hughes,"That Bill is made to honorable friend says that the High Court will be governed to a large extent by the decisions of the United States Courts. That may be. I do not deny it ; but that is a matter regarding which we must await the decisions of the High Court. All I know is that the Americandecisions, whilst they are listened to, do not decide the law, and must be considered as entirely distinct from English or Australian cases. I now come to the statement of the Prime Minister that a case could not arise under the amendment. I have already pointed out that it is conceivable that there might be a dozen cases. The possibility of there being one such case should in itself be sufficient to induce all reasonable men to join in adopting preventive measures, no matter at what cost. ter, uttered when the Bill was introduced into the last Parliament, still ringing in my ears, and with a remembrance of the amazing benefits that we were told would flow from the substitution of arbitration -for the barbarous weapon of the strike, I cannot reconcile the attitude of the Prime Minister towards the amendment with that formerly assumed by him. He admits that the point is arguable; but that he has a doubt. Yet his doubt is not so strong but that he concedes that we may by our decision include within the scope of the measure men who he thinks ought to be excluded from its operation. Here is a Bill which is to bring abundant blessings in its train, and vet the Prime Minister seeks to deny its advantages to a deserving section of the community, a section that, in Victoria particularly, has been treated very far from fairly by the local Legislature. The public servants of Victoria are now practicallv disfranchised, because, although it may be said that technically they have the same proportionate representation as other sections of the community, there is a fundamental difference between their present position and that which they previously occupied. Formerly the public servants could, by voting for this man or that in different electorates, influence the election and the subsequent actions and votes of many representatives. Now they can secure the election of only the two or three representatives which are given to them under the Constitution. These representatives can grievances of their fellows-the y are powerless to remedy them. The whole of the representatives of other sections of the community will feel constrained to take up an attitude of antagonism to the representatives of the public servants, and thus there will be three or four public service representatives on the one side, and all the representatives of their employers-the people-o n the other. These men are denied justice, and yet they are referred by those who oppose the amendment to the State parliamentary tribunal. In New South Wales, where the public servants have certainly not less hope of obtaining justice, the State Parliament has deliberately created an impartial tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes. NowI wish to deal with the argument to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has referred. He said that because there was no method of enforcing a decree of the ArbiWith the words of the Prime Ministration Court against the States, we could not assume that it was intended to bring States servants within the scope of the power conferred by sub-section x x x v . I interjected that his objection would apply also to the State Arbitration Act. In New South Wales there is no method, except such as are open to a Court in any case, of compelling the State Government to obey any of the decrees of the Arbitration Court. For instance, if the Commonwealth and a State Government went to law, and damages and costs, or even costs alone, were awarded against one or other of the parties, how could the verdict of the Court be enforced ? Take the case to which the honourable and learned member referred. Suppose the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales were cited to appear before the State Arbitration Court. As a matter of fact, a case is now set down for hearing in which they will be asked to give preference of employment to unionists and to grant certain increments to which the men declare that they are entitled. The Commissioners are bound by Statute and could not comply with an order of the Court requiring them to give preference to unionists or to pay certain increments without the concurrence of the State Parliament. If that authority were obdurate, what could they do? No difficulty, however, is contemplated. The State Parliament at present is in favour of the Arbitration Act ; but the party which is seeking to regain power is notoriously opposed not to the principles, but to the application of the Act. do nothing but voice the It is inimical' to the measure, and would therefore be likely to prevent the State Parliament of New South Wales from doing anything of the sort. Can my honourable and learned friend, by ransacking his brains, discover a case in which a State has refused to do this? If he can, it will be news to us. Buti f he cannot, we may pass his contention to one side, as one of those numerous objections which, in times of stress and difficulty, can be evolved at will by the rences predicted have failed to eventuate ingenious advocate. pel any of .our Parliaments to appropriate money. it to be forgotten that we who sit here tonight have been charged by a majority of the citizens of the Commonwealth to do this very thing which my honourable and learned friend says is a direct violation of the most that Providence has made me out an arrant .sacred rights of the Federation and of the citizenship of Australia? Are not we fresh from the people? Could any Parliament more accurately reflect 'popular opinion than we contemplate a grievous wrong to Austrawe do? We come here having appealed to the people on this particular point. some of the States other points were raised as well; but every one of us had to toe the scratch in regard to this particular matter. I myself was asked definitely. ""Are you, or are you not, in favour of this?"" I think every candidate was asked that question, and many a one who was asked it wishes to-night that _he had given another answer. Those who propose to conciliate their consciences by elaborate argument and by ingenious references to difficulties, constitutional or otherwise, which exist or do not exist, cannot deny that the people were appealed to, and that every candidate was asked by the railway associations of Australia, "" Are you, or are you not, in favour of the railway servants being included in the Arbitration Act?"" plied "" Yes"" or "" No,""' because those who did not answer in the affirmative were understood from the terms of the letter sent to them to answer in the negative. Therefore, every one of us is directly pledged upon this question. A species of referendum has thus been taken. How, we be told that a grievous wrong is to be inflicted upon the citizens of compel the Parliaments of the States to do something of which the people have by an overwhelming majority declared themselves in favour. That is the great wrong which is to be done to Australian citizenship. This is what the honourable and learned member for Bendigo calls the beginning of the end, a violation, and a trap. He told us that if the people of Australia had known that a Bill of this kind could be applied to the State servants they would never have voted for the Constitution. The people of Australia were told many things prior to Federation. That many of the occuronly those who have bad memories' or unblushing effrontery can. deny. But one thing we are practically clear about, and that is that the. voice of the people has made itself heard under Federation. Some of us told the electors that possibly democracy would find itself strangled in the Federal Parliament. I was one of those miserable Jeremiahs. But I am pleased to say liar, and that the voice of democracy is stronger here even than the voice of the prophets of the chosen. Yet it is said that lian democracy by compelling the ParliaIn ments of the States to vote money to do justice to their employees. Any one would imagine that the Federal Arbitration Court is to perpetrate some dire wrong, to inflict upon the States some unprovoked indignity, whereas it is being created to right a wrong. It is to require only that which justice indicates should be done; and ought not that to be approved, and adopted, by every Parliament in Australia? What Parliament will say, the decree having been made that the wages of this man or that man shall be increased, that it will not increase them? None of these honourable gentlemen contemplate a decrease, so that we can see how their thoughts run. Everything points to the fact that there is room -for an appeal to Caesar for an increase, but Every candidate renot for a decrease.' If these honourable gentlemen were so confident of the justice of their cause, and there were already in existence tribunals to which civil servants could apply, would not those tribunals have reduced or increased salaries as the occasion might demand ? Does not every one know that the employer is the least fit to decide under these circumstances, can the merits of his own case? Has it not been a maxim, accepted from time immemorial, that no man should be a Judge Australia because we propose to in his own cause? Should the States then be Judges in their own cause? We who believe in the extension of the functions of the State have set ourselves against the interference of politicians in State management.

We are to assume that whatever it decides will be, characterized by justice and by' good sense. The people of the country will have ample opportunity to watch the working of this measure. In spite of the outcry against the New South Wales Arbitration Act, I venture to say that, if a plebiscite were taken in that State to-morrow, five out of every seven persons would vote for the retention of the Act, despite the powerful influences now arrayed against it.

I believe that the majority of honourable members will vote for the amendment, because the people have lately declared themselves, in the most emphatic way, in favour of its underlying principle. organ arrayed against this principle, the people in all the States have unmistakably declared for it. Under these circumstances I cannot see anything in the argument that we propose to violate the Constitution.

We seek to exercise that power calmly and deliberately whilst we yet may, and whilst we are not inflamed by party passion. We ask honourable members to assist us to make this Bill applicable to every person throughout the Commonwealth who is likely to be affected by industrial disputes.

Upon the question of whether or not the law, if enacted, could be enforced, I would point out that the State Parliaments are not likely to obstruct the decisions of such a tribunal as is contemplated decisions which are given in a right cause, upon a right occasion. Therefore, I hold that the Committee should adopt the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay. dressing myself to the proposal under consideration, I may remark that during the last three and a half months I have passed through an experience to which I hope no other honourable member will ever have to submit. At the recent general election this question was certainly put before the people, so far as the district of Melbourne is concerned. In the second contest for that constituency it was made absolutely the dominant question. At every meeting which I addressed it was brought prominently forward, and only at one of those thirty gatherings was a single hand held up against this proposal. The gentleman who voted against it subsequently informed me that he did so under a misapprehension. Mr O'MALLEY -He was deaf and dumb. awake when I explained the position to him. When I mention that no less than four meetings were held in positively the most conservative portion of VictoriaI refer to Joiimont-and not a hand was held up against the proposal, I think I may fairly claim that the question was thoroughly threshed out.

I had a flutter before that Court for about two and a-half days, with the result that I involved in costs amounting to Â£ 2 0 0 . Did honourable members imagine when they voted for the creation of that Court that it would be so expensive a tribunal? Was it not thought when it was resolved that the Court should deal with petitions against the return of members that a deposit of Â£ 5 0 would be enough to cover all the costs of the inquiry ? I was assured by my legal adviser, whose every contention was unanimously accepted by the three Judges, that if I carried the proceedings to their final issue costs amounting to Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 would be incurred. during the consideration of the High Court Bill that the cost of taking petitions before the High Court would be very heavy. ruled by this Parliament, elected as it is by the people, than by a High Court.

I trust that we shall soon go to a division on this question, office which he fills. To my great regret, I for I do not suppose that the vote will be varied as the result of any speech. I was once placed in a peculiar position, and was led, perhaps from motives of curiosity, to ask various celebrated politicians whether they could tell of a vote which had been changed by a single speech. I could not, however, obtain even one satisfactory answer in respect of a parliamentary experience extending over thirteen years; and when I waited on the great people who sway the daily newspapers, I found that even they were unable to, give me any information on the subject. Doubtless, we have all made up our minds as to the way in which we shall vote, and I hope that if the majority vote, if not on this, at all events on the next amendment, for what I believe to be the right principle, there will be no attempt to waive their decision. I know that those who are opposed to my views are as honest as I am in the opinions which they entertain, and if they were in the majority I should accept their decision. thize with the evident desire of honourable members that this should be a very brief debate. That desire is a sensible one, because the subject with which we are about to deal in a decisive way has really been discussed almost as fully as has any subject that has come before the House. I believe we shall all admit that whilst the opinions which prevail in reference to the amendment upon which we are about to vote are strongly divided, we can give one another credit for perfect honesty of conviction, and a desire not to violate any provision of the Constitution. I have often had to criticise the Government, as I suppose every leader of an Opposition has to do, but I think that in the case of this Government. the necessity is unusually pronounced. I have had many justifiable opportunities to speak in no measured language of what appeared to me to be the undue evasion by the Government, on more than one occasion, of the responsibilities which attach to their position. But I think we must all admit that in this matter the Government have pursued a perfectly fearless and straightforward course. Whatever the resultof this division may be to my honourable and learned friend, the Prime Minister, he will have that which will probably be almost more valuable to him.than a victory-the consciousness that he has throughout maintained the highest traditions associated with the distinguished find myself compelled to agree with the view which he has expressed. I do not wish, on the present occasion, to enter into any theoretical discussion as to whether the proposal now before us would work out in a good or bad way. I consider the matter concluded by the view which I take of the Constitution under which we live, and that the words in the Constitution which enable us to pass any measure of this sort mark out very clearly and afresh what was the main principle of the Commonwealth Constitution. We had before us a choice between the system adopted in the United States many years ago, and that adopted not so long ago in Canada. These two Constitutions, in one radical respect, are directly opposed. In the case of America, as we all know, and as was often pointed out, the States surrendered no power which was not expressly conferred by the words of the Constitution, or by necessary implication. On the other hand, in the case of Canada, it was decided to follow a different principle, and to provide in the Constitution that everything not expressly reserved to the States should be deemed to have been conveyed to the Dominion. In the Convention we had these matters before us, and after a thorough discussion amongst the elected representatives of the people of Australia it was deliberately decided that no power should be taken from the States which was not expressly given to the Commonwealth. That is the basis of the Constitution and the words in subsection xxxv. of section 51, which refer to this question"" extending beyond the limits of any one State ""-ar e only a repetition of the principle which is the mainspring of the Constitution.

I view the situation with mixed feelings. I feel that the Government ought to be put out. I have never ceased, to feel that since the Government came in. But if there ever was an occasion in the history of Australia when my views were pronounced I suppose this is that occasion. It is well known that this matter was threshed out in the House before the recent appeal to the people, and a large number of the members of the Opposition asserted their right of voting as they did for the amendment moved by one of the members of the Labour Party, as a number of other members of the Opposition asserted their right in voting with the Government. Since then the Opposition have gone to the country as a party, with the right reserved to every member of it to vote in this matter entirely as he thought fit. I have been censured for not exercising more actively the duties of leadership at this juncture.

I guarded my utterance by telling the Government that I could only assure them of my own support, and that a large number of members of my party took a view different from my own. 1 believe that that will prove to be the case when the division is taken. But the point which surprises me most of all in the position in which we find ourselves is this: that there are some wild ideas gaining currency that the members of this party-which , with this right of giving independent votes, has gone before the people of the country, and has fought under the banner which I raised in that great struggle, and has come back victorious-mus t be considered, if they exercise that right, to have left the Opposition and joined the Labour Party. Well, it would be a great acquisition to the Labour Partyi f it could gain the allegiance of a number of those honourable members whom I have the honour to lead. But I think I may fairly say that, leading as I have always had the honour to do a party of honest and loyal men, when they have .the slightest idea of deserting the banner under which they have fought I feel sure that the announcement will be made to me. I admit the dazzling attractions and the multitude of temptations which are illuminating the political horizon at the present time, and I can quite understand that sudden visions of Ministerial grandeur might cause even a statesman who has been one of the advanced members of My leadership when the Labour Party to announce solemnly and publicly through the press, that of course when the Labour Party comes into office they will have no idea of passing the whole of their programme. Judicious excisions will be made; the demands of diplomacy will be respected, and the full prescription which is to save Australia will be reduced to homeopathic dimensions. Already we hear the language of mature statesmanship from some of the advanced members of the Labour Party. So far as I am concerned, I suppose that in this particular state of public affairs there is no man with a well-balanced mind who can envy the position of the Government. I am sure I do the Prime Minister and many of his colleagues no injustice, when I say that the present position of this Chamber is such as to make the present conditions of leadership a source of no satisfaction, and of no honour.

I only hope that any one who follows him will imitate the high example which he has set. cerned, I believe I have so just a judgment of the serious difficulties which surround, not only this Parliament but this country, that no one could look to the prospect of Ministerial responsibility-that is to say, no one of experience could look to the prospect of assuming responsibility for public affairs -wit h a light heart. So far as I am concerned, as I say, I most unhesitatingly adopt the attitude which the Government have assumed on this question.. I have an absolutely clear view-it may be mistaken, but it is absolutely clear-that any such course as is now proposed would be a breach of the Constitution, and would be a seriousa most serious-assaul t on the integrity of a national compact, in its most vital provisions. wish my position at the present time to be one of absolute clearness-that , if I were in the position of the Prime Minister to-morrow, I should just as fearlessly and resolutely, to the very last, take up the position which he has taken up. honourable gentleman means. matter. I have no sort of objection to the priciple which underlies this measure for conciliation and arbitration. I think, as I have often said, that departures have been introduced into our system of law which are of the most extreme and dangerous type, and which can be justified only by results. I am free to admit, as one who comes from a State where this experiment has been working for some time, that if our experience there during the next two years does not has been during the last two years, there will not be the slightest chance of the law remaining on the statute book of that State. I make that statement because I believe that those who will be found most opposed to the continuance of the law will be the working classes of New South Wales. But I still hope that in the course of the next two or three years the conditions surrounding this attempt to secure a great and noble end will be more promising. We must remember that this was entirely a new departure, and that a multitude of rankling grievances and disputes were almost bound to come to the surface the moment the Act was passed. Therefore, in spite of the unfavorable experience and unfavorable effects of this Act in New South Wales, I hope that, as matters become more settled, the experiment will be a much So far as I am congreater success.' But we must remember that, all through, this has been absolutely an experiment-onl y an experiment. We must remember that some of the grandest representatives of labour in the world, and some of the grandest associations of the most skilled labour in the world, have just as strong views against compulsory arbitration as the leaders of labour in Australia have in favour of the system. I only mention this fact to show that even in the ranks of representative men, who stand highest in the scale of intelligence and in loyalty to the real interests of labour throughout the world, a vast majority at the present time are absolutely opposed to the principle of such legislation. In endeavouring to make Australia as we all, I am sure, are enI feel-and I deavouring to do, the most advanced, the most enlightened, the best governed, and the most fair and generous country in the world in relation to those who have least and who suffer most-in our desire to advance the general welfare and happiness of this Continent by a fearless spirit of In this matter, the right progress and of experiment-w e must occasionally remember that all the political inI am only referring to this telligence and all the political insight in the world is not entirely monopolized even by the Labour Party of Australia. that. ber has not yet made any official utterance to that effect. disclaimer if the-right honourable and learned member likes. become more favorable than it my friend, the honourable member for Bland, has recently, and very rightly, assumed a degree of gravity which is very interesting. One of the pleasures of these political controversies in the Federal House is the feeling of personal esteem which we entertain for one another -leavin g myself entirely out of the question-and which I entertain for the head of the Government and also for the head of the Labour Party. I have never, I hope, concealed the respect and admiration which I entertain for mv friend who leads the Labour Party.

408,Mr Reid,"But the language o fmust be aroused by all political parties to a keener perception of the importance of applying their intelligence and patriotism to problems affecting the common weal. One of the best and greatest advantages which we can reap for""the anxieties and tribulations of a political crisis in this House is that it may tend to quicken the conscience of the Australian masses, and bring the intelligence and patriotism of an ever-increasing number of the people of the country within the sphere of active politics. As a result of the division which is about to take place, I look forward to very great changes. I look forward to the beginning of a struggle which will make history for many years to come. But, in the beginning of this great struggle, it is a source of satisfaction to me that, whilst we are on the brink of a crisis, and whilst the feelings of members are justifiably keen, there is an air of good feeling and of toleration for differences of opinion on the part of all leaders of parties, and all the members of this Parliament, which augurs well for the future of this country, whatever the result of the crisis may be. few words on the amendment before the Chamber. BeforeI address myself closely to the matter in its legal aspect, and then in its aspect of desirability, I should like to point Out distinctly that, in voting for or against this amendment, it ought to be thoroughly understood that we are not mingling two matters which may, on the face of the amendment, be involved. These two matters are the relation of the Commonwealth servants, as well as that of the State servants, to the measure. This amendment touches both; and entirely different considerations will prevail with regard to the Commonwealth servants as distinguished from the State servants; because, if this amendment be lost, the Bill will, exclude both Commonwealth and State servants. But the debate has proceeded, and, as I understand, will continue upon the basis that we are discussing the question of applying the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to the public servants of the various States. We must all recognise, as has just been said by the leader of the Opposition, that the occasion is one of great importance. In the remark that a change of Government is always"" a matter of importance, I agree with' the leader of the Opposition, but with the epitaph he has pronounced on the retiring Administration I do not agree. I shall only say of the Government, as a supporter who, I think, has been at once independent and loyal, that I believe the memory of this Administration, which has been substantially the same throughout, will be for all time associated with measures great in themselves, and especially great in that they mark, in many instances, the initial steps in the building up of this great Commonwealth. There is a matter of greater importance than that of a change of Government involved in this question, and that is the relation, present and future, of the Federation and the States. That is a matter of enormous gravity, and I feel that, while maintaining the attitude I took up in the last session of the previous Parliament, I should say a few words on the legal aspect of the question, to which I did not address myself on the last occasion. I have maintained, as I have said, the same opinions, confirmed by further thought, that I had the honour to address to the Chamber on the point of expediency. With regard, to the legal position, after the best thought I am able to give to the matter, I regret to say that I do not believe any man can pronounce definitely as to whether this proposal is constitutional or not, until the matter has been decided by the tribunal to which the Constitution has intrusted its decision-namely , the High CourtMr O'MALLEY -There a lawyer speaks.. honourable and learned member's advice worth taking. needed for the expression of so guarded an opinion as that it is to be found in the diversity of the opinions expressed by legal members of the House. great weight in the observations of the Prime Minister, who quoted portions of the Constitution indicating that State servants are by implication excluded from the operation of certain sub-sections of section 51. We have' had observations of equal weight from the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, pointing out portions of the Constitution the direct inference from which is that they are included by implication in the provisions of the Constitution. We have had tOrnight most important speeches from the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo.

413,Mr Isaacs,"We find arguments ofvast amount of light upon the subject, and have contributed much erudition to the discussion. I was going to say to the solution of the question, but that is beyond our capacity at'the present time. If we look at section 51, sub-section 11., which confers upon the Commonwealth Parliament the power of dealing with taxation, and if we then note that under section 114 State property is excluded, the natural inference is that, but for that express exclusion, the States would come within the former section. Then, if we turn to the preceding sub-section of section 51, under which the Commonwealth Parliament is given power to deal with trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States, we shall find that, by section 98, State railways are declared to be within the province of the Federal Parliament in regard to trade and commerce, and yet, apparently, without that express mention they would be outside our jurisdiction. We have in the provisions of two consecutive sub-sections of section 51 and other co-relative sections of the Constitution, material for exactly diverse opinions. When we go further, and refer to the banking and insurance sub-sections, great weight is to be given to the argument of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, because it is impossible to say, that we can ignore those words, "" other than State banking,"" and "" other than State insurance,"" and giving the weight which a lawyer would be disposed to give to those words, the Constitution must mean that, if those words were not there, State banking and State insurance would undoubtedly be included in our powers. Then we have sub-section xxxii, referred to by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, dealing with the control of railways for the transport of naval and military forces. Surely it could not be thought, for an instant/that State railways would be excluded in connection with such a matter. It would be idle to put in the Constitution a provision that the Commonwealth Government should have the power of controlling and regulating the transport of troops, naval and military, over the railways of Australia, and to read it as meaning that it should apply only to private railways. That would be futile. Other sections may be referred to in the same way, and therefore we are left, as the Constitution now stands, in a state of indecision. It has been said, notably by the honourable and learned memher for Bendigo, that the well-known maxim of English law, that an Act is not to bind the Crown unless the Crown is expressly mentioned, or unless there is a necessary intendment, clearly shows that the Convention that framed this Bill, and the people of Australia who accepted it, never contemplated the inclusion of the States within the purview of its provisions, unless they were expressly mentioned. learned member think that that maxim about the Crown applies to a Constitution? to say why I do not agree with my honourable and learned friend the member for Bendigo. This Constitution, as it was passed by an Australian Convention and approved by the Australian people, was not the Constitution that Ave have before us noAv. The Constitution that left Australia and reached the Imperial Parliament contained in the second section these AvordsThis Act shall bind the Crown. Therefore, as the Constitution Avas accepted by Australians, and as it left Australian hands, undoubtedly the States Avould have been included, in my opinion.

The Imperial Parliament struck out those Avords. been overlooked. another part of the Constitution ? by the simple elimination of those AvordsI fear and believe that the Constitution will haA-e in many respects a different operation from that Avhich it Avould have had had those Avords been retained. That simple fact will convince us that Ave cannot rely on the argument that it Avas not the intention of the Convention to bind the CroAvn. But, as a matter of laiv, Ave have to look at the Constitution as it stands, and to recollect that the Imperial Parliament, in the exercise of its right, hoAvever it may have grated upon the feelings of Australians Avho framed their own governmental agreement, did materially alter the Bill that Avas sent home to them.
