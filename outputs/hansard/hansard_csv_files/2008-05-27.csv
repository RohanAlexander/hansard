Tuesday, 27 May 2008 ----Regional Partnerships Ms MARINO (Forrest) (4.00 pm)-I rise to challenge the statement by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Anthony Albanese, that he did not realise how many community groups were affected by his government’s decision to cut funding to the Regional Partnerships program. In his words, the community projects are ‘really good’. In fact, they are far better than ‘really good’. They have been and still are critical to grassroots delivery of genuine local and regional projects. Volunteers within community groups have spent many hours compiling funding submissions and designing projects to be eligible to meet the criteria, and their applications have gone through the rigorous process of evaluation and assessment by the relevant area consultative committee boards and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. On budget night the government announced that, unless duly signed contractual arrangements were in place, federal Labor would not fund any project submitted under the Regional Partnerships program. In fact, federal Labor intend to introduce their own Better Regions program, but that will not be delivering to communities until late 2009. Many of these projects are time critical. Minister Albanese was tackled on Channel 7’s Sunrise program about one particular project in Bundaberg-a disabled children’s program-which was a victim of the funding cuts. He acknowledged that it was an outstanding project and said he had personally read the file and was going to look for alternative funding sources for it. So now we have the minister backflipping on the government’s budget announcement and stating to David Koch on the Sunrise morning program on Wednesday, 20 May that some really good applications for community projects have been lodged and he would fast-track the examination of all applications. The minister should have examined all of the applications prior to making his decision to scrap the Regional Partnerships program. Is the minister giving community organisations such as those in my electorate of Forrest hope that the government will do the right thing and make good on the funding approvals and that all projects will be examined-or was this just a throwaway answer to the media and there will be continued silence from now on? I do not want this to turn out to be false hope. If it is good enough for the minister to personally intervene in the Bundaberg disabled playground project, and to perhaps back down and fund the project, then it should be good enough for the minister to personally intervene in the five approved projects in my electorate, as well as the other 14 community project funding applications submitted in my electorate of Forrest up until November last year. They are outstanding community projects which have all attracted other funding partners, including state Labor, and all are worthy of matching federal funding. The Forrest electorate has been severely affected by the scrapping of the Regional Partnerships program by the Rudd Labor government, and all the funding submissions have gone through a rigorous process of evaluation.

Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: legislate a ban on the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of cluster munition that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. Pass a motion supporting the Oslo Declaration committing Australians to working towards an international treaty that would ban the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians globally. Members of the Scoresby Uniting Church and others came to my office personally to deliver the petition. Over 20 people were crammed into my very small office in Box Hill. They are very passionate about this issue and they are very concerned about Australia’s involvement in the current negotiations in Dublin. They expressed two concerns about the position that Australia is taking and forcefully presented their argument. Their first concern is about the degree to which Australia will seek to weaken the treaty to allow troops of state parties to directly and indirectly assist with the use, transfer and stockpiling of banned cluster munitions by nonstate parties to the treaty. Their second concern is about the Australian government seeking a clause in the treaty to allow state parties to retain an unlimited number of cluster munitions for the purposes of training and research-expressed as ‘the minimum necessary for such purposes’. Numerous people have sent me letters of concern about the current negotiations. I am pleased that the Australian government is heavily involved in the current process in Dublin. The government believes that the time has come for the international community to address the impact of cluster munitions. Australia is pleased to join 120 states at the Dublin conference to negotiate and agree on the text of a legally binding convention to prohibit cluster munitions, which cause unacceptable harm to civilians. These weapons are vile and the harm they cause is unacceptable. We should be doing everything in our power to ban them, to protect human lives and to ensure there are no unintended casualties. It is not just about those who are caught up in the conflict at the time; it is about the ones who are left behind. Australia has committed additional funds to demining, particularly within Afghanistan and also in our own region. I warmly congratulate those who collected signatures for the petition. Ryan Electorate: Australian Defence Medal the parliament today a group of very special individuals. I place on the record my formal thanks for the service to our country of Mr Percival Hanlon, from Toowong; Mr Victor Hood, from the Gap; Mr Robert Mahoney, from Kenmore; Mr Kevin Prior, also from Toowong; Mr Arnold Russell, from Bellbowrie; Mr Mervyn Smolenski, from Kenmore; Mr Ross Thomson, MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Statements By Members
315,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (4.06 Pm),"I would like to formally acknowledge and recognise infrom Chapel Hill; and Mr Graham Tregenza, from Taringa. These very special constituents of mine were recipients of the Australian Defence Medal, which I had the great honour to present to them in a community ceremony in the Ryan electorate on 23 April. The Ryan electorate, which is based around the western suburbs of Brisbane, was very privileged to honour these men because, as we all know, those who wear the uniform of the Australian defence forces do so with great pride, with great courage and with great spirit. It is incumbent on all of us to honour their service. The Australian Defence Medal was established in June 2004 under the Howard government. It is awarded to regular and reserve Defence Force members who have completed either their initial enlistment period or four years of service, whichever is the lesser, since the Second World War. The Australian Defence Medal recognises the service of members, past and present, of the Australian Defence Force who have made a remarkable commitment to our nation’s security, whether by serving our nation in actual operations or remaining in Australia in a supportive role. The eight individuals whom I have mentioned today were honoured at the ceremony that I conducted in April. I was pleased to be able to celebrate with them, their friends and their families. It was a moving ceremony held in the Mount Coot-tha botanical gardens in the Ryan electorate. There were a considerable number of guests. Friends of the recipients also travelled from interstate to be part of this special occasion and to witness them receiving this medal from me as a representative of the Australian parliament. As a member of the parliament I want to also thank all those in the Ryan community who took part in the ANZAC Day service. The community spirit is remarkable throughout Australia and it is especially so in the Ryan electorate. It is incumbent upon all of us to pay tribute to those who make a contribution to our country in a very unique way-one which all of us will not only honour but remember for a very long time to come. Tasmanian Premier events that took place in Tasmania yesterday have overtaken that in importance. Yesterday, the Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, stepped down from leadership and from parliament. He did it now because he believes he has fulfilled his promise to his predecessor, Jim Bacon, who died in June 2004. Jim and Paul were long-time friends and colleagues and it was not an easy task for Paul to fill the charismatic Jim Bacon’s shoes, but he did it. Although his way was different, he was no less effective for the economy and the well-being of Tasmania. Paul has had four long, hard years as Premier. I believe the low polls gave him the reason to make a snap decision in order for Labor to continue to build on his and Jim’s legacies and for Tasmania to continue to have a majority government. It will give his successor a good 22 months to stamp his authority and his policies on government. I would like to pay tribute to Paul for what he has achieved during those four years and thank him for continuing to support the forest industry despite the cost to his popularity. I believe he understood what working people are all about, especially those who work in country areas in traditional pursuits, because these are the industries that have built Tasmania’s economy and provided our livelihood. It is not easy to stand one’s ground in the face of opposition, and he has been doing it for 30 years, representing people in all the areas of work he has MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Statements By Members
316,Mr Adams (Lyons) (4.09 Pm),"I was going to speak about something else, but thebeen in. Being Premier was just another platform in which he has proved his worth as a politician and as a human being. I would also like to thank Paul for his strong and dedicated work for the state. He did not always make popular decisions but he made them for the betterment of the state and not for himself-despite the ridicule and vitriol that have come his way in recent years, which I do not believe are warranted. Although the criticism may have led to his decision to step down, it was not because he heeded it for himself; he noted it for the position he held. I am sure he believed that now was the time to go and that the time had come to hand the banner on for the sake of the party and the government. Paul has always been generous with his time and his support for those things he believed were right, and he will be remembered with affection by those whom he supported and assisted to make the state a better place to live and work. Personally, I thank Paul for his support and assistance over my time in federal parliament, and I hope his successors will come to really understand what he has done for the state. Thank you, Paul. Mr Bill Singleton Mr Ted Brooker OAM his peers by being awarded life membership of Surf Life Saving Australia at the 2008 national surf lifesaving titles held in Western Australia. Life membership of Surf Life Saving Australia is the highest non-bravery accolade available within the organisation. The award recognises Bill’s exceptional contribution of 66 years to surf lifesaving as a successful competitor, official and administrator. He is currently the patron of Surf Life Saving Sydney and until recently was actively involved as a carnival official. He is a well-known, much loved and respected friend to all involved in surf lifesaving throughout Australia and especially in the Sutherland shire. Bill entered lifesaving when he joined Bronte Surf Life Saving Club in 1941. He became a life member in 1957 after long success in both competition and administration. The Bronte club described Bill’s contributions to lifesaving as legendary and said that he epitomises all that is good about surf lifesaving and that many people can attribute their successes in the movement to either words of encouragement from Bill or his efforts in saving lives. His move to the Sutherland shire, in the electorate of Cook, saw him join Elouera Surf Life Saving Club in 1969, where he has held the positions of vice-patron, vice-president, senior vice-president and deputy president, served on various committees, held numerous training roles and been actively involved in patrols and rescues. Bill also joined Garie Surf Life Saving Club, in the electorate of Cook, in 1998, where he has held various administrative roles, including club historian. Bill was president of Surf Life Saving Sydney from 1991 to 1995 and vice-president for the 10 years from 1981 to 1991. He was heavily involved on seven different committees as well as being a gear steward and IRB supervisor. Bill has also been heavily involved in Surf Life Saving New South Wales, where he is also a life member. Elouera Surf Life Saving Club described Bill’s commitment to surf lifesaving as ‘total dedication’ and ‘magnificent lifetime service which is both conspicuous and loyal’. On behalf of all my constituents in Cook and in the shire, I wish to congratulate Bill on his many achievements and decades of selfless service. Unfortunately, Bill was recently diagMAIN COMMITTEE",133,Statements By Members
317,Mr Morrison (Cook) (4.12 Pm),"In April this year, Bill Singleton was recognised bynosed with inoperable cancer. My thoughts and prayers are with Bill and his family at this time. I also wish to acknowledge another Elouera Surf Life Saving Club member, Ted Brooker OAM, who was also recently recognised for his contribution to surf lifesaving with the award of a President’s Medal. Although this is a national award, it was presented to Ted at the recent New South Wales state titles at Blacksmiths Beach in Swansea-Belmont. Ted also has a long term association with surf lifesaving at North Cronulla. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.16 pm to 4.30 pm Comitato Assistenza Italiani Vicki, attended on behalf of the Prime Minister the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Italian-Australian welfare organisation known as Co.As.It. The gala ball, which recognised the Co.As.It volunteers in New South Wales, was held at the Sydney Convention Centre. The occasion was also used to raise funds for the Italian Bilingual School. As part of the event, a publication was produced which documented the resettlement journey of Italians since the arrival of the first Italians to New South Wales. The pictures and the stories told could be the same for the history of migration by Italians to all parts of Australia, including my own home state of South Australia. In fact, they would be very similar to the stories of the many other migrants who came to Australia from all parts of the world. Today some 800,000 Australians are of Italian heritage, and I understand that around 200,000 of them were actually born in Italy. As we approach the national day of Italy on 2 June, when many Australian Italians will celebrate their Italian heritage, it is pertinent we also recognise the significant contribution Australian Italians have made to Australia’s development and to our way of life. Whether it be in food, music, the arts, architecture, building and construction, engineering, the sciences, agriculture, medicine, law or politics-or any other profession, for that matter-Italian migrants have made a notable contribution to our country and to our culture. Of course, many of the first-generation arrivals here have passed away or are now elderly. Where in earlier days they had the strength and resilience to forge a new life for themselves and their future generations in a new land, today they are in need of the aged-care services that all older Australians are in need of. Co.As.It is responding to their needs by providing a range of services to older Australians, regardless of their ancestry, in many parts of Australia. In fact, only last TuesdayI attended another Co.As.It function in Adelaide where local volunteers were also recognised. The Italian Bilingual School has a special role in the provision of those services, because language can often be a major barrier in both the provision of services and maintaining family relationships between older and younger generations. Interestingly, last Thursday the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Steve Georganas, and I met with a delegation from Co.As.It to discuss the needs of older Australians and how services for older Australians of non-English-speaking backgrounds might be improved. An issue raised was that one of the key impediments to the provision of services is language. MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Statements By Members
318,Mr Zappia (Makin) (4.30 Pm),"Last Saturday night, 24 May, I along with my wife,I take this opportunity to thank Co.As.It for their initiatives in responding to the needs of older Australians who today need our support. I also congratulate Lorenzo Fazzini and the New South Wales Co.As.It branch for their bilingual school program and for their 40 years of service to the wider Australian community. Drought Boards of Bourke and Brewarrina became the first areas of south-eastern Australia to be declared to be in exceptional circumstances in the current drought. That was some 5½ years ago. In less than a fortnight Bourke and Brewarrina’s exceptional circumstances standing time frame expires. The new government and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, have to act very quickly to allay the fears of the people of that region and the mental stress that they are currently going through. The major part of New South Wales does not come up until September. It is a very big issue for not just the landholders but the townspeople, the merchants and those in employment in that region. There are some 500 landholdings under the Rural Lands Protection Boards of Bourke and Brewarrina. The National Rural Advisory Council, or NRAC, who advise the government and the minister on the need for exceptional circumstances assistance, have not at this point in time visited Bourke and Brewarrina. With less than two weeks to go, I find that either exhilarating, because it means the minister does not think there is a need and he is just going to roll it over, or very disturbing, because he has no intention of doing so. It is very much time that the minister stopped looking at politics and started looking at policy, because for Bourke and Brewarrina to lose exceptional circumstances assistance at this time, notwithstanding the fact that there is talk about some sort of transitional phase, would be devastating to that region. Yes, there has been some rain in that region but we do not stop areas receiving exceptional circumstances assistance simply because there has been some rain. It goes a lot longer than that and a lot deeper into the community. As I said, people’s mental stress-and I am not talking just about the farmers and the landholders-in that region is huge. Nobody has yet made any money. The financial drought is still 100 per cent in that region, as it is in pretty much the whole of my electorate. I have no pleasure in having the most drought affected electorate in Australia. It is time for an announcement, especially as people cannot stand not knowing what is happening. The government must make an announcement. Minister Burke has to stand up and say what he is going to do to relieve the pressure on the landholders and everybody else involved: the merchants, the workers and the banks, who also have a lot riding on this. Motorcycling Australia’s Rider Safety Campaign with MotoGP star Chris Vermeulen and Motorcycling Australia at the launch of Motorcycling Australia’s Rider Safety Campaign, to help turn the tide when it comes to motorcycling accidents on our roads. This is an important campaign that has the potential to prevent the deaths of and injuries to motorcycle and scooter riders. Being a keen motorcyclist myself and having two sons that ride, this campaign takes on personal relevance. Motorcycle and scooter sales have increased rapidly in recent years. Sales figures show that about 130,000 motorcycles were sold last year, an increase of some 10,000, or around nine per cent, compared with the year before.

320,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (4.36 Pm),"Last month I had the distinct pleasure of joining forcesvictims. Since 2002, the number of deaths has increased by 3.6 per cent per year. Motorcyclists account for almost 15 per cent of all road deaths despite the fact that their vehicles make up only 4.5 per cent of all registered vehicles in Australia. During last year alone 1,611 Australians died on our roads. Of those 240 were motorcyclists. Motorcyclists are 23 times more likely to be killed per kilometre travelled than car occupants and they are 41 times more likely to be involved in serious accidents. These statistics tell only a small part of the story. Quite frankly, every fatality causes untold grief for the family members and friends of the loved one lost. It is no secret that motorcyclists are much more vulnerable than other motorists. The casualty statistics are certainly gloomy, but those of us who are riders also know that riding motorcycles is a wonderful way of life. For me riding is being part of the scenery rather than just viewing it. For many Australians it is becoming a lifestyle choice, but we must take a proactive role and remind everybody that, while the roads are there to be shared, they are dangerous and that when you ride you should ride defensively and never ride beyond the road conditions or your skills. Frustrated by the mounting road toll, Chris Vermeulen actually approached Motorcycling Australia about doing something practical and having a campaign on TV and radio and in the press about motorcycle safety. I would like to congratulate Chris on his passion to initiate this campaign. I would also like to congratulate Ron Kivovitch, the President of Motorcycling Australia, for Motorcycling Australia’s commitment to doing something positive to reduce the number of deaths of and injuries to motorcyclists on our roads. I wish Mr Vermeulen and his team all the best for the remaining MotoGP season and Mr Kivovitch and Motorcycling Australia all the best for the campaign. Once again I congratulate them on their stand to be proactive as to the safety and welfare of motorcyclists on our roads. Indi Electorate: Wodonga Rail Bypass the people of Wodonga, in my electorate: the Wodonga Rail Bypass. It is one project that has been spoken about for too long with no action. The Victorian government, which has carriage of the project, has treated the people of Wodonga with contempt and disdain in its clumsy and late handling of this vital piece of transport infrastructure. It is an overdue and exciting project and is most notably in the all-important freight corridor between Melbourne and Sydney. The former coalition government had a proud record of investment in road and rail infrastructure and ensured that rail continued to play its important role in the burgeoning freight task in Australia, and this focus must continue. As far back as December 2000, the Howard government committed $20 million for the Wodonga Rail Bypass, even though the Victorian government has complete carriage of this project. This money was not used, and the 2004 AusLink white paper continued to recommit funding for this project. The Victorian government has not proceeded with the bypass in isolation from the rail standardisation of the broad gauge track. Following an initial request made to then Minister Truss in 2005, the Victorian government submitted a detailed project proposal on the Wodonga Rail Bypass to then Minister Vaile in October 2006. The proposal was confirmed, and the request from the Victorian government to the Australian government for an extra $25 million was to be taken from the allocation for rail standardisation. That money was to be transferred from the rail standardisation to the Wodonga project. In spite of delays which have blown out the cost of the project, earlier last MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Statements By Members
321,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (4.40 Pm),"I rise to speak on a matter of great importance toyear I was pleased to welcome the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mark Vaile, to Wodonga to announce funding of $45 million, capped for the whole project. We are now asking the Victorian government to get on with the job. The Leader of the Opposition visited Wodonga as part of his listening tour earlier this year and saw for himself how the current track cuts through the heart of the city and strangles the growth of the city’s potential. In 2007, John Brumby said the project would be delayed by a couple of months from its proposed March 2007 start to the finalisation of the purchase of the Victorian rail system by the state from Pacific National. The Minister for Public Transport, Ms Kosky, said that the project will start by April 2007. Still, not one single sleeper has been removed. There is only so much wool you can pull over people’s eyes. I hear that the minister for infrastructure may soon be visiting Wodonga. It will be good for the new Labor minister to get out of Sydney and come to rural and regional Australia, to my area on the border to see what life is like in Wodonga. I would appreciate welcoming him, to highlight how important this project is to Wodonga’s future and how the city is being held back by the Victorian Labor government’s intransigence and incompetence. It is time for the buck-passing and mismanagement to end. It is time for the Spring Street spin to end. Speaking on behalf of the people of Wodonga, I say that we just want the project to get underway. Bennelong Electorate: Giant Steps School for Autistic Children Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (4.43 pm)-I rise today to commend the imaginative initiative and the extraordinary commitment of the parents and staff at Giant Steps in Gladesville, a school for children with autism, which is located in my electorate in Bennelong. Two weeks ago I visited Giant Steps and met Sean, a little boy who is aged 11. He has been at Giant Steps since he was five years of age. Sean was in a classroom with seven other students and with not one but three teachers. This little boy is likely to move to an integrated support unit within a regular high school when he is 12. Students who are not able to make that transition remain at Giant Steps and they continue to study a modified New South Wales high school curriculum. Kerrie Nelson, the principal of Giant Steps, walked me through the classrooms explaining the school’s interdisciplinary approach to teaching, an approach which involves a special education teacher, an occupational therapist, a music therapist and sometimes a teacher’s aideand they are all working together in the classroom at the same time. The regular curriculum is adjusted to provide a very rich and authentic learning experience with autism-friendly teaching strategies. It is this interdisciplinary approach that is so effective when working with children who are as challenged as autistic children are. There are 60 children at Giant Steps. They range in age from preschoolers to 17-year-olds. They come from all over the metropolitan area, some travelling very long distancessometimes two hours-to get there and they are taught by 52 dedicated staff. Just think of that ratio: 60 children to 52 staff. Giant Steps was established in July 1995 by a group of parents who researched the world’s best practice for teaching children with autism, and they continue to strive to create as normal a school life as possible. Understandably, it costs a lot more to provide this kind of quality education for children such as Sean than it does at a normal school. From an annual budget of nearly $4 million, $1.9 million comes from state and federal funding, $750,000 comes from MAIN COMMITTEE corporate and other donations, a staggering $450,000 is donated by the parents of the children who attend the school and a further $800,000 comes from fundraising activities. It is an extraordinary effort. The current challenge facing the parent body from Giant Steps is to provide a post-school life for these children. Barry Irvin, the chairman of the Giant Steps board, explained to me and my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong that the plan is to design a tertiary educational experience approximating that for any 18-year-old so that all students in Australia have the right to participate in a stimulating, quality educational experience in an appropriate environment. At a time when the government is committing $190 million to a range of services that will help families with autism-that is, in addition to six specialist autism centres-I commend Giant Steps. I find it encouraging to see the exceptional effort and imagination of the parents and the teachers who are making Giant Steps the centre of excellence that it is. agreed to in the House previously, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Hale: That the address be agreed to. That further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Crean: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (4.47 pm)-Australia’s trade performance has taken a battering, particularly over the last six years-it was the last six years of the coalition government. The Minister for Trade has said that the coalition government dropped the ball on trade, and they clearly did. They dropped the ball on a few other things too, not just trade, but all go to the heart of our economic policy in trade. They ignored the 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank on inflation. They seemed to ignore the 12 consecutive interest rate rises, and they ignored the fact that we needed an integrated trade policy with our economic policy. The impact of this lack of attention to fundamental trade and economic questions in a time of a prolific resources boom-a boom that made the coalition government fiscally lazy-has left Australia with an economic trade deficit and a deficit in trade policy. I turn to the economic deficit first. The coalition government left us with a trade deficit for five consecutive years-nearly six years. The December 2007 trade deficit figure of $6.9 billion was the worse quarterly trade deficit on record. There were 69 consecutive months of goods and services trade deficit, there is a current account deficit at record levels of around six per cent GDP, there was soaring foreign debt in 2006-07 and net exports have made a conMAIN COMMITTEE",137,Statements By Members
322,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),Order! In accordance with the resolution,139,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
323,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (4.46 Pm),"I move:tribution to Australia’s economic growth in only two of the past 11 years. When Labor were previously in government we made a positive contribution in exports, with growth in 10 of 13 years. The comparison is: coalition government, two out of 11; previous Labor government, 10 out of 13. They certainly did drop the ball. I think the figures speak for themselves. But there is more. Manufacturing export growth collapsed, growing at three per cent in 2007 compared to 13 per cent since 1983. That is 13 per cent growth in 1983 and three per cent in 2007. Total export revenues grew at an annual average rate of only 5.8 per cent compared with 10.7 per cent in the 18 years following the float of the dollar in 1983, another Labor initiative. Goods exports grew at an average annual rate of 6.4 per cent compared with an average growth of 10.3 per cent since 1983. Services exports grew at about a third of their long-term average. I am surprised that no-one from the opposite side, particularly the National Party, raised these appalling and concerning trade performance figures either publicly or within their cabinet or caucus. It is only now that they are in opposition that they have started to bleat about trade. I have listened with interest to the Leader of the National Party talking on the radio about trade. He said it was time the government-we have been in government for six months-put more resources into the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. They actually starved that scheme. When they were in government they changed the criteria yet they did not provide funds for the criteria to be fulfilled, so a lot of exporters were found wanting. It is a bit rich that they did it. Minister Crean, the Minister for Trade, has said that they dudded us, and they did. It shows that the National Party are unable to have an impact either in government or out of government. Even the previous Leader of the Nationals, John Anderson, has publicly said that they were never listened to in Canberra. That is clearly the situation. I will turn now to the approach that Labor is taking to trade. Labor has taken a fresh approach that is premised on the following: making Doha a key plank of advancing the trade agenda. Advancing the agenda and getting the outcomes is not easy. It is a difficult process, but it has to be at the heart of any trade initiative and any trade policy-along with the integration of the economic policy-to make sure that we get somewhere. The Rudd Labor approach is based on the twin pillars framework. The twin pillars framework approach is trade liberalisation at the border complemented by economic and trade reform behind the border. This is to advance sustainable economic growth, the driving force of trade policy. On bilateral and regional agreements, we will continue to work to improve and enhance those that are consistent with our multinational and multilateral objectives. Whilst bilateral and regional agreements are important-and they are very important; I cannot but underscore that-they must be pursued consistent with multilateral or multinational outcomes. The ball was dropped in this area as well under the previous government. I pause here to say that trade policy has always been under the auspices, within the bailiwick, of the National Party. It is one area where they have been found very wanting. Our major initiative in trade is a comprehensive review of trade policies and programs, called the Mortimer review, which will assess how we can improve our productivity and competitiveness to ensure we are ready-and, indeed, ahead of the game-to take up emerging trade opportunities. I recently had the opportunity, along with the parliamentary trade subcommittee, to meet with John Edwards and David Mortimer, who are heading up that review. MAIN COMMITTEE I and everybody else felt quite confident about having them at the helm of that review and helping us with it. I now want to turn to Page, the seat that I represent, where trade is clearly an important issue. Often we do not think about the Export Market Development Grants Scheme in regional and rural seats, but it is immensely important. I will give you some indicative figures that show why it is important and why this scheme will help in Page. There are caveats on these figures. I got some of these figures through research and through the Parliamentary Library, but they have the usual caveats on them. The main exporting industries-manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, wholesale trade and mining-account for 19.7 per cent of employment in Page. That is nearly 20 per cent, which is significant for employment in the area. Other industries export-and, of these dominant export industries, not all employees would work on exports-but this gives you the order of magnitude. In terms of the total employment, two of the main exporting categories are in the top 10 employing industries in Page. The research states that an extrapolation would be that the total employment in Page in 2006 was around 50,279. With total employment in Australia at 10.2 million, that is about 0.5 per cent of the total. Looking at exports from Australia over the last 12 months, that amounts to about $1.09 billion in the Page electorate, which is significant. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme allows a lot more smallto medium-enterprise businesses, which are the backbone across Page, to take advantage of it. There are many businesses I know that want to get into the export market. In fact, quite a few are already in the export market, as those figures indicate. A couple of weeks ago I opened an innovation conference in Ballina, in the electorate of Page, and three of the speakers were local businesspeople who were all exporting. Members may have heard of Byron Bay Cookie Company and Byron Bay muesli. The company is run by a local woman who is based in the Richmond electorate, which is close to my electorate. She was at the conference in Ballina and she exports to the United States. It took them a while to get used to the macadamias. They had to do some work to get people used to the macadamias in the muesli and the cookies and things like that, but that is a really big exporter in our region-a success story. There are many more like that. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 has about eight key purposes. I will recap them here. They are to increase the maximum grant by $50,000, up from $150,000 to $200,000A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.58 pm to 5.33 pm opment Grants Amendment Bill 2008. This bill forms an important part of the Rudd government’s commitment to a whole-of-government approach to supporting Australian companies in the global economy. This commitment stems from deeper values held by the Australian Labor Party and from its view of Australia and what our nation can be. The Labor Party believes in a prosperous, fair Australia supported by an open, outward-looking economy-an economy where Australian companies that want to invest overseas and export their goods and services are not held back but are instead encouraged and supported.

324,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (5.33 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Export Market DevelIt must never be forgotten that it was the Hawke and Keating governments that transformed the Australian economy. It was the Hawke and Keating governments which laid the foundation for the outward-looking, export oriented economy which this nation has developed. The Labor Party has a proud record on economic reform-the floating of the dollar, trade liberalisation, financial sector deregulation, superannuation reform and national competition policy. It is this record on which we continue to build today. This government understands that Australia’s current and future prosperity depend in part on our ability to compete successfully in global markets. That is why we are committed to a world-class education system, to addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, to fostering innovation and to reforming federal-state relations. The new National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools program, with funding of $62.4 million over the next three years, forms part of this approach. It is a whole-ofgovernment approach designed to lock in our future prosperity-a prosperity that will depend on strong and sustained export growth that will continue past the current resources boom. This export growth will be driven by smart and innovative Australian companies delivering superior products to overseas markets. The old-style interventionist policy that was pursued by both sides of politics under the Australian settlement no longer has a place in the modern economy. The industry policies of the 1950s and 1960s were inward looking. They were designed to shelter Australian companies and industries, including poorly managed ones, from the forces of international competition. The result was that Australian economic growth and our living standards fell behind other industrialised nations. The focus of federal government policy must be on enabling and encouraging Australian businesses rather than on sheltering and protecting particular industries. The evolution of the international trading system into a globalised economy provides enormous opportunities for Australian companies and the Australian economy as a whole. Australia requires an active export facilitation strategy that addresses the needs of Australian firms, and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an example of this type of policy at work. The purpose of the act is to encourage smalland medium-sized enterprises to develop export markets through providing grants for export promotion. Under the act, companies can be reimbursed up to 50 per cent of a range of export promotion expenses up to a given cap. Some of the activities for which companies can claim include overseas representatives, marketing consultants, marketing visits, trade fairs, seminars, promotional literature and advertising. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-and I quote from one of their publicationshas recognised these kinds of activities as: ... an integral part of the export promotion strategy of many Australian exporters, especially small to medium sized exporters. For a smallor medium-sized business, the move into exporting is one of the most difficult decisions that they will take. Expansion into any new market brings with it new challenges. When a new market is located overseas, these challenges are compounded through a lack of capital, regulatory differences, cultural barriers and the need to develop new contacts amongst suppliers and purchasers. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has often been critical in determining whether a smallor medium-sized enterprise engages in exporting and the extent of that engagement. The 2005 Austrade review of the scheme found that it ‘plays a key policy role in MAIN COMMITTEE funding additional export promotion, particularly for smaller sized firms’. It also found that the scheme ‘has considerable influence in assisting small firms achieve sustainability’ in exports and that it has ‘a positive impact on export culture’. The scheme was estimated in 2000 to result in returns of $12 of exports for every $1 of outlay. Despite these benefits, the scheme was neglected by the Liberal and National parties when they were in government. This government is determined to revitalise the scheme. We announced this during the campaign last year and we are now acting on that commitment. The government, under existing legislation, is required to commence a review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme before 2010. I commend the minister for bringing forward this review and including it in the review of export policies and programs which is to be chaired by John Mortimer. Through this bill, which overhauls the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, and through the additional $50 million in funding in 2009-10 for the scheme, this government is taking immediate action to help reinvigorate an export culture amongst Australian companies. This bill amends the Export Markets Development Grants Act to expand eligibility for the scheme. It will bring it into line with the needs of Australian businesses. It will bring it into line with what Australian businesses have been calling for and what the previous Liberal and National Party government ignored. The bill will increase the maximum grant by $50,000 to $200,000, lift the maximum turnover limit from $30 million to $50 million and extend the limit on the number of grants from seven to eight annual grants. These changes, which were advocated by the Australian Industry Group in its submission to the 2005 Austrade review, will ensure that companies can continue to access the scheme. The bill will also allow grant money to cover expenses related to patent protection in international markets. The ability to protect intellectual property rights is an increasingly crucial part of product and market development. This change will encourage innovative Australian companies that are seeking to expand markets overseas. At present, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme allows only companies and national peak bodies to apply for grants. These amendments enable state and regional trade promotion bodies, including tourism promotion bodies, to access the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The amendments cut the minimum threshold of expenditure by $5,000 to a $10,000 minimum, again ensuring that small businesses can access the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. It will reinstate a performance test to the act for applicants claiming in their third and later grant years, consistent with Australia’s obligations under World Trade Organisation rules. Finally, these amendments replace the list of internal and external services with a new nontourism services category. Critically, this change will help to ensure that companies in the services sector can properly access the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. On top of these changes, the government has delivered on its commitment to increase funding for the scheme by $50 million. The Rudd government’s commitment to supporting exporters provides a contrast to the failure of the former government. The story of the last decade is indeed a story of a decline in Australia’s trade performance and a neglect of policy on the part of the Howard government. Australia has had ideal conditions for trade success-the most favourable terms of trade in a generation, a strong global economy and a resources boom. A 2005 research paper from the MAIN COMMITTEE Reserve Bank found that Australia’s terms of trade were likely to have increased by around 50 per cent in the period 1987 to 2005. The Reserve Bank’s index of commodity prices has increased by 43 per cent over the last six years. The booming economies of India and China have become vital trade partners for Australia. But, despite all these favourable factors, export growth rates have fallen. Australia has seen its proportion of global trade in goods and services decline such that between 2001 and 2007 growth in total export revenues slowed to almost half the rate of the period from 1983 to 2001. Goods export growth has slowed. Services exports are now growing at only a third of their long-term average. Manufacturing export growth collapsed to an annual rate of 1.2 per cent between 2001 and 2007, compared to an annual rate of 12.3 per cent between 1983 and 2001. The former government announced in 2001 that they would aim to double the number of exporting businesses-and they failed dramatically to achieve the target they set for themselves. The former government left Australia with a trade deficit of $6.9 billion in the December 2007 quarter, the worse quarterly trade deficit on record, and a current account deficit of around six per cent of GDP. The resources boom has been masking the failure of Australia’s trade policy over the last decade, and the previous government must take responsibility for their failure on trade policy. The former government’s neglect of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme was emblematic of their failure on a broader level in the area of trade policy. In 2003, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry declared: The Federal Government’s decision to run-down the Export Market Development Grants Scheme will only serve to undermine the effectiveness of Australian exporters, especially smaller exporters, in vital overseas markets. You would think that that warning in 2003 from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry might have been sufficient to prompt some real action in this area and a revision of what the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry described as the running down of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. But nothing of the kind occurred; the running down continued. We might also recall that on coming to power in 1996 the former Howard government abolished the International Trade Enhancement Scheme and the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program, programs that had been established by then and had contributed to the improvement in Australia’s trade position that occurred during the Hawke and Keating governments. These two programs, abolished by the Howard government on coming to power in 1996, were part of the attention that had been given to the trade area by the Hawke and Keating governments. The Howard government seemingly focused on bilateral trade negotiations exclusively to the detriment of multilateral opportunities through the Doha Round and APEC. Like so many areas of the previous government’s record, the approach was incoherent. It was poorly thought out and lacked any sort of strategic vision. By contrast, the Rudd Labor government is committed to an open economy in which Australian companies can take full advantage of the opportunities provided by global demand. Our support for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme accompanies our commitment to further multilateral trade negotiations. The review of export programs and policies currently being undertaken will provide further opportunity to refine and improve trade policy so that the Commonwealth government is doMAIN COMMITTEE ing all that it can to support Australian business in the global marketplace. I commend the bill to the House. opment Grants legislation represent a significant turning point for Australia’s trade capacity. In particular, the Australian tourism sector is set to benefit from the changes being introduced by the Rudd government. These changes will have far-reaching impacts in the national tourism industry, and they come at a time when this industry requires renewed focus and investment. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 demonstrates that the government is serious about strengthening Australia’s trade capacity as a nation and that it is committed to delivering upon the promises made in the lead-up to the election. We are delivering on all of our promises, and the EMDG amendment bill is just another example of that. The Rudd government went to the election with a commitment to reform and revitalise export policies and programs, and this is exactly what we are now doing with the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Already, federal Labor has committed additional funding for the scheme. A further $50 million will go to our aspiring and current exporters, bringing the total funding available for grants on eligible business expenditure in 2008-09 to more than $200 million. Programs like the EMDG Scheme need continual attention and investment. The previous government failed to act appropriately with regard to the scheme; they dropped it as a priority and did not provide adequate funding. Australia’s exporters have every right to condemn the previous government for this. I know that many businesses in the tropical north, tourism operators in particular, are hurting as a result of the Howard government changing the policy settings for the EMDG Scheme without backing it up with money. Their budgets now, and for the next 12 months or so, have to be reworked, their marketing and other expenditure slashed and investment opportunities foregone. This is the Howard legacy. A number of these businesses have come to see me-hoteliers and reef operators who had put their faith in the EMDG Scheme, made significant investments and found that the Howard government had failed to appropriately fund this scheme. We are reforming and revitalising the scheme. The Rudd government will work to restore the EMDG Scheme. There is renewed confidence over the future of the tourism industry as a result of the legislative changes being introduced into the parliament. My electorate of Leichhardt, in tropical North Queensland, is home to a number of tourism centres-from Cairns, Kuranda and Port Douglas, to the Daintree and Cooktown, to the burgeoning Cape York and Torres Strait regions, which are strengthening tourism hubs in their own right. We have some fantastic tourism experiences and destinations in Leichhardt. It goes without saying that tourism in Cairns and the tropical north region is critical to the strength of the Northern Australian economy. However, it is also a prime factor in the success of the national industry. Many foreigners associate Australia with many of the natural icons in the tropical north. With natural assets such as the Great Barrier Reef and World Heritage listed rainforest, the region has the ability to attract international visitors into Australia, and ultimately these visitors in many cases stay on and visit other parts of the country. Recently, though, as we all know, the Australian tourism industry has been facing some tough times. I know first hand the pressures being faced locally in Cairns and the tropical north and the flow-on impacts being felt in industries such as the hospitality industry. The MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
325,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (5.48 Pm),"The amendments to the Export Market Develtropical north has seen a decline in the past 12 months in one of the region’s most important international markets, Japan, with little growth in other key markets such as Europe. There has also been a decline in international airlines flying into Cairns in recent years, although there has been an ongoing effort and strategy development by local organisations to reverse this. I know that they also welcome the Rudd government’s aviation white paper. They will be working closely with me and the government to make sure that they have strong input into that white paper and to ensure that we have every opportunity in Cairns to attract international carriers back into our airport and strengthen and boost our local tourism industry. Additionally, the industry is trying to cope with the very high Australian dollar, which is the highest it has been for a number of years. These factors make it an uphill battle for exporting businesses and, particularly, for the tourism sector. However, the EMDG bill signals a tremendous boost to this region, and I am looking forward to the benefits of its amendments unfolding within the local tourism industry. The scheme is widely utilised in the region, and the changes that this bill will bring to the industry have been welcomed by local tourism operators. These changes come at a most apt point in time, given what the region and Australia have been experiencing of late. Two measures proposed in the bill are of particular interest and benefit to the tropical north. One of the most significant and positive measures is the ability for regional tourism authorities to access the scheme. Tourism Tropical North Queensland, better known as TTNQ, is the region’s peak tourism industry organisation. It has welcomed the government’s decision to undertake a review of Australia’s export development policies and is particularly keen to take advantage of its eligibility to access the EMDG Scheme upon the passing of this bill. An enormous amount of the tourism promotion work in the tropical north is undertaken by TTNQ, and the government has recognised the critical role that tourism authorities like TTNQ play in regions throughout the country. TTNQ has established itself as a productive and effective organisation, and its proactive approach has placed it in an excellent position to capitalise on this legislative change. I work with TTNQ personally. The Minister for Trade, Mr Crean, visited the region, and we worked directly with TTNQ in the development of the amendments to the legislation. The TTNQ will benefit directly from these changes. TTNQ’s key objective is to build destination awareness in Australia through a targeted program of marketing activities to achieve maximum visitation, length of stay, expenditure and regional dispersal within tropical North Queensland. The ability of TTNQ and its corporate members to fulfil this objective will be greatly enhanced by the EMDG Scheme changes. The second measure that will have a positive impact in the region is the reduction in the minimum threshold of expenditure on eligible export promotion activities by $5,000 to a $10,000 minimum. This too has generated a positive response from the region’s operators since these changes to the bill were publicised. The EMDG Scheme has always sought to encourage small and medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets. However, as the act currently provides for a $15,000 minimum expense threshold, this has often drawn criticism or hesitation from some small business operators. This limit excludes a substantial number of small operators for whom, although they are successful-they are financially stable and offer a quality tourism product-investing in the EMDG Scheme poses too much of a risk and/or commitment to their standard operations. However, changes to the legislation will ensure that these small businesses are not turned away in the future. MAIN COMMITTEE These two measures are both conducive to boosting the tropical north’s tourism capacity. Already research and planning have started in the local industry, with various operators ready to seize the opportunity this legislation will bring. TTNQ has instigated discussions as to how best to maximise the potential to access additional support for the region. A number of joint ventures have been tabled which would not have been considered had the government not revitalised the EMDG Scheme. TTNQ is seeking to pull together export ventures that will allow very small operators to work with major operators to sell unique Australian experiences. For example, Indigenous tourism offers a host of opportunities for the tropical north. There is an extensive and rich cultural heritage in the region. Tropical North Queensland is home to a number of Indigenous communities, which have a tremendous amount of history, culture, art and traditions to share with visitors. This, coupled with the spectacular landscape that covers the peninsula area, represents significant tourism potential for a number of markets overseas. Whether it be fishing charters, nature tours or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands culture and historic experiences, a number of Indigenous operators, many of whom are only small enterprises, have expressed an interest in TTNQ’s strategy to combine forces, venture into international markets and market these unique experiences. Some of these Indigenous operators may not have the business expertise or confidence and/or the financial backing to participate in the EMDG Scheme individually. However, with a reputable organisation like TTNQ providing direction and support, combined with the scheme’s financial threshold being lowered, there is a greater incentive for them to now explore international marketing options. As mentioned previously, this not only will benefit Far North Queensland but has the capacity to boost other regions as travellers continue on throughout the country. The Indigenous tourism market is somewhat untapped, and I believe there is real potential to develop this further. The EMDG Scheme has provided an ideal platform for this to be taken to the next level. There are a number of indirect benefits that may result from increased tourism activity in these Indigenous communities, which should also be realised. Increased employment opportunities for local Indigenous community members are one such key benefit. Indigenous operators can contribute to cultural revitalisation within their own communities. Many will seek to employ local Indigenous people. These locals sharing their knowledge will not only inform tourists about Indigenous culture in a very authentic way but also help to preserve their own culture through awareness and education of many traditions within their own families, tribes and communities. There is a threat that some of the Indigenous languages, for example, may be lost, as younger Indigenous generations may not be engaging in their own culture like their elders did before them. These local employment options represent one way they can reconnect. Aurukun Wetlands Charters and the Mapoon turtle rescue project are just two examples of successfully run Indigenous ventures. There is also tremendous potential in the Torres Strait for the development of further tourism enterprises-in particular, the arts industry in the Cape-and, as a result of these amendments, there will be the ability to market these experiences overseas. Another example of a collaborative project that the EMDG Scheme changes have kickstarted is the Great Tropical Drive. Already an established tourism product, this has signifiMAIN COMMITTEE cant potential to be marketed further, thanks to the expanded EMDG Scheme criteria. The Great Tropical Drive is a self-drive touring route that incorporates over 2,000 kilometres of road, taking those who participate to many sites along the way. A range of driving itineraries have been developed for different audiences, such as wildlife, food and wine, and Indigenous drives. The Great Tropical Drive is marketed effectively in its current state. However, the EMDG Scheme provides a real opportunity for this product to reach an international market. It will give many smaller operators-and there are many scattered throughout the entire region along the Great Tropical Drive route-the opportunity to participate in a collaborative marketing effort that will feature in the international arena, something they would not have thought possible on a sole basis. Similarly to the Indigenous tourism concept, the benefits of this are multifaceted. Individual tourism operators benefit from increased marketing exposure, as they are part of a much larger, widespread product and team. They are able to overcome financial restraints due to the joint effort and the lower expenditure limits. Such collaboration will enhance the strength and quality of the Great Tropical Drive product. The more operators who participate, the stronger the product, which then has an improved chance of receiving international attention and providing a return on their marketing investment. If you drive from Cairns to the Daintree, you are doing one of the world’s great drives. As you come out of Port Douglas and go up through Mareeba, across the tablelands and back down through the Innisfail region, you are in magnificent country. It is spectacular country. I have travelled extensively throughout the world and I reckon I live in one of the most beautiful parts of the world. The Great Tropical Drive is a great experience that the EMDG Scheme amendments will enable us to market much more effectively overseas. They will allow small operators to come together and work with local tourism organisations such as Tourism Tropical North Queensland. Those individual businesses will be effectively marketed together overseas. Tropical North Queensland is pursuing as a result of the EMDG Scheme enhancement announcement concerns climate change. It is seeking to bring together climate-change-sensitive operators to work to show the world that holidays in Australia not only can be carbon neutral but also can reduce carbon footprints. In an era when ‘going green’ is fast becoming an important priority, tourism operators in the region are looking to operate in a more environmentally friendly way and to become not players but leaders in this field. The tropical north contains many coastal communities which are more susceptible to climate change risks. We are lucky enough to have World Heritage listed rainforests and the iconic Great Barrier Reef. Tourism in the region is built upon our amazing natural assets, so it is in our best interests to do everything we can to ensure they are preserved so that future generations are able to witness and experience what we are lucky enough to have surrounding us every day. The world is taking action on climate change, and Australians are passionate about moving with this tide. Unlike the previous government, federal Labor has shown a clear commitment to tackling the threats that climate change poses. The Rudd government’s first budget clearly demonstrated this, as $2.3 billion, over the next four years, will be invested in measures that will help us all combat and adapt to this very real issue and risk.

326,Mr Danby,I’m from the south but I agree with you.,148,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
327,Mr Turnour,"Thank you, and I appreciate that support. Another angle that Tourisming scheme or in the global arena with the Kyoto protocol, the Rudd government is committed to tackling climate change. Out of this funding comes-and this is very pertinent to my electorate, as well as to my neighbours to the south-the $200 million reef rescue package. The Great Barrier Reef Rescue Plan will help to protect and preserve the reef for future generations, largely through improvements to water quality. Tourism operators in the region have the ability to use this green concept to their competitive advantage. People across the world are becoming very conscious of their environmental impacts, their energy use at home, the cars they drive, the groceries they buy and-I am sure we are moving towards this, and we may already be there-the holidays they take. By grouping these like-minded operators together, which I understand they are already doing through the efforts of TTNQ, and collaborating on a green marketing program internationally, there is real potential to capitalise on this trend-a trend that is here to stay. There are many people throughout the world who would be attracted to a low-carbon impact holiday, offered by clean, green operators in one of the most environmentally precious regions on earth. Once again, the EMDG changes have offered a platform for Tourism Tropical North Queensland and some of our greener local tourism operators to explore this further. Another important point that is pertinent to this EMDG bill concerns our long-term future. In delivering the EMDG amendments, the government has recognised that it needs to secure our future. There is no mistaking the resources boom that has occurred over the last decade or so in Australia. There is no denying that the tropical north has benefited significantly from this activity in recent years. However, there are clear signs that some sections of the economy are slowing, and certainly the tourism industry in the tropical north is experiencing this. Inflation is at a 16-year high. Official interest rates have increased eight times since 2004. Petrol and grocery prices are becoming more expensive. At least one in five households in my electorate is in mortgage stress or paying more than 30 per cent of its income in mortgage repayments. Over a quarter of renting households are in the same predicament. These factors are putting family budgets under pressure in tropical North Queensland. It is for reasons such as these that we must support and remain focused on other core industries. In the tropical north we want to ensure that our region is sustainable past any boom. We must not squander the proceeds the mining boom has provided but look to the future and work towards ensuring we are able to recover from the period of economic slowing that we are entering. We want to ensure that tourism is one industry that comes out the other end of such a period in a strong and positive position. I am pleased the Rudd government has acknowledged this need and has committed to ensuring our trading sector continues to be a positive contributor to economic growth. Tourism development needs continual attention in our country. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is now a program with renewed focus and funding, and I am confident it will improve the export productivity and competitiveness long past the economic boom we have experienced and through the economic slowing we are now experiencing in tourism, particularly in the tropical north. Federal Labor have demonstrated their commitment to improving the country’s trade performance. The EMDG amendment bill is a key element to this effort and the tourism industry is a significant benefactor of the work that is being done by the government in this field. The tropical north tourism industry has been receptive to and welcoming of the government’s acMAIN COMMITTEE tions to revitalise the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. TTNQ has been a leader locally in pulling together local businesses to take advantage of this. They are definitely going to benefit from this legislation and these amendments. I strongly support this bill in its progress through the House. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 satisfies an election commitment to improve Australia’s trade performance. Of course, that is central to securing the long term economic future of the country. In the first six months of government, Labor have put a lot of work into recalibrating our approach to trade negotiations to give renewed emphasis to the Doha Round and have commissioned a major review of trade policies and programs by Mr David Mortimer. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme assists small and medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets, reimbursing up to 50 per cent of expenses incurred on eligible export promotion activities. The changes contained in this bill will revitalise the EMDG Scheme and increase funding by $50 million. The most significant measures in the bill will increase the maximum grant available by $50,000 to $200,000, lift the maximum turnover limit from $30 million to $50 million and reimburse the expenses related to patent protection in international markets-all extremely important initiatives to strengthen the scheme. Exports are vital to the long-term prosperity of the nation, and over the past five years world trade has grown at twice the rate of world output. If we want to secure Australia’s economic future beyond the resources boom, we must engage in the fastest-growing areas of international trade opportunity. Austrade research shows that firms that export pay higher wages, provide stronger growth in employment and are more profitable. By diversifying the sources of demand, we reduce our economic risk to downturns in the domestic economy or individual parts of the global economy. It is relevant to note that we have recently been hearing condolence speeches concerning the passing of Australia’s greatest industry minister, John Button, and I think on the speakers list for this evening there are further speakers in that regard. By far the most common triumph attributed to Senator Button was transforming the manufacturing sector into an outward focused and export oriented sector. This secured the long-term future of manufacturing in Australia in many areas, and we are seeking to build on that reform process and that tradition with these amendments to the EMDG Scheme and our wider economic reform agenda-that is, the reform agenda of the Rudd Labor government. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been cut in half in real terms since 1995-96 and that is the fact of the matter. This was at the same time the Howard government promised to double the number of exporters, but they failed woefully at delivering on this promise-and it is no surprise, given the attitude to the EMDG Scheme during the period of the Howard government. The coalition’s attitude to trade policy was not isolated to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme; they also abolished the successful International Trade Enhancement Scheme. One study of the effectiveness of the EMDG Scheme found that it returns an additional $12 of exports for every $1 of outlay. In 1997-98 and 2004-05 the Howard government changed both the eligibility criteria and the thresholds, which made it harder to access the scheme. As a result, in six of the 10 years following 1997-98 the scheme was in fact underspent, notwithstanding the return that is available in aggregate economic terms. MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
328,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (6.08 pm)The attitude of the Howard government during that period pervaded all of the Howard government’s trade policies. Unfortunately, it is the economy and, of course, the Australian population who depend upon the economy who paid the price for that approach. In the last six years of the Howard government, despite the resources boom, total export revenues grew at an average annual rate of only 5.8 per cent, compared to the 10.7 per cent in the previous 18 years following the 1983 float of the dollar. As a result, the Howard government’s legacy is 70 consecutive months of goods and services trade deficits. No government in our history has presided over such a run. In fact, the trade deficit for the December quarter of 2007, the last quarter during which the Howard government presided, was almost $7 billion, the worse on record. That is the export trade performance that the Rudd Labor government inherited after 12 years of the Howard government. Net exports made a positive contribution to economic growth in only two of the 12 years that the Howard government was in office. This compares to Labor’s record between 1983 and 1996, when net exports made a positive contribution to growth in 10 of the 13 years. The lesson from all of this is that a government determined to focus on export growth in international trade can have an effect on the country’s performance. As a consequence of the neglect in the Howard period, we now have a current account deficit at a record level of around six per cent of GDP and soaring foreign debt of $554 billion, measured in the 2006-07 financial year. Even more concerning is the performance of elaborately transformed manufactured exports. In the decade to the mid-1990s, the Labor government focused on diversifying Australia’s export mix from an overreliance on the quarry and farm to a more modern and open economy, with a stronger presence of value-added services and ETMs. We lost this focus under the previous government, which lazily relied on the resources boom. This has exposed the country to serious risks, the greatest of which is our diminished capacity to reap the gains from participating in the high-growth global trade in knowledge and technology intensive goods and services. That is where the growth is and that is where we must focus as well. In the last six years of the last Labor government, elaborately transformed manufactures export growth averaged 17½ per cent per annum. This compares with the last six years of the Howard government, where the average ETM export growth rate was only 4.1 per cent. Unless we reverse this trend the Australian economy will not be on a sustainable footing when the resources boom eventually runs out. The disastrous trade performance under the last government occurred because they failed to invest in the drivers of economic growth and international competitiveness-skills, education, innovation and effective infrastructure. Investment in R&D and other forms of innovation is a key success factor in our international competitiveness. Unfortunately, that investment also stalled under the previous government. In the nine years to 1995-96-Labor years-business investment in R&D grew in real terms by 11.4 per cent per year. In the nine years to 200405-the Howard years-business investment in R&D grew by only 5.1 per cent per annum. That is 11½ per cent versus 5.1 per cent. What is even more appalling is that, over the two periods, the annual real growth rate in manufacturing research and development-which is crucial to being able to participate in the growth of trade and elaborately transformed manufacturing-fell from 10.6 per cent to 1.9 per cent. As a result, again, Australia’s business investment in R&D as a share of GDP is only 62 per cent of the OECD average. That is a very MAIN COMMITTEE important means of measuring the seriousness with which we in Australia are approaching the challenge of R&D. A strong education skills formation and training system is vital to our international competitiveness. Over the last 150 years the measure of a nation’s economic development was the number of tonnes of iron and steel it produced. In this century, it will be the number of graduates, especially in science and engineering, that our nation generates. Investment in education is the linchpin of our future economic potential and trading performance. And what did we see in the last 11 years of the Howard government? We saw the proportion of Australian adults with at least upper-secondary education sitting below the OECD average. We saw Australia ranked near the bottom of the OECD in terms of the annual growth rate of graduates with science and engineering degrees. Our national investment in early childhood education was well below the OECD average. Since 1998 more than 300,000 people have been turned away from TAFE. Since 2001 almost 150,000 eligible applicants were turned away from our universities. That is an appalling record when we are confronting the economic challenges we have. It is not surprising, therefore, that in the decade since 1995 Australia was the only OECD country to effectively cut public investment in tertiary education at precisely the time we needed to be significantly increasing it. The average increase in public investment by other OECD countries and aggregates since 1995 was 48 per cent, whereas our investment fell by seven per cent. The situation was so bad that in 2005, amidst a skills shortage, there was actually a drop in TAFE students overall. There was no growth-in fact, it was negative. In four of the five years between 2000 and 2005, the fact is that TAFE student enrolments actually declined. How can we be expected to compete in global markets for knowledge intensive goods and services when we are training fewer TAFE students and underinvesting in tertiary education generally? This is one of the challenges that the Rudd Labor government faces, and it is great to see that the budget is tackling this problem. Look at some of the key elements-investing $11 billion in the Education Investment Fund, spending $1.2 billion on the digital education revolution, outlaying $2.5 billion on trades training in schools and committing $1.9 billion to deliver up to 630,000 training places. It is important to note that, in contrast to the former government’s Higher Education Endowment Fund, not only is Labor’s Education Investment Fund $6 billion larger but it can also be spent on vocational education and training facilities, not just on university infrastructure. Improving our international competitiveness will be equally dependent upon having a modern, well-resourced vocational education and training sector and a modern university system. Developing additional economic, social and innovation infrastructure is essential to relieving the capacity constraints experienced in the economy. It is also critical to increasing productivity and driving export growth. We are seeing the impact of infrastructure bottlenecks such as clogged ports preventing resource exports. Living in Newcastle, I know this just as well as anyone, with the queue of ships off the coast. This is a direct result of the decade of neglect under the former government and it is great to see that this neglect is beginning to be addressed in the budget. The establishment of Infrastructure Australia and the $20 billion Building Australia Fund will in time help to remove capacity constraints, improve our competitiveness and boost our exports. The government recognises its economic reform agenda must do all it can to restore MAIN COMMITTEE Australia’s trade performance. This will help ensure that our trading sector once again becomes a positive contributor to economic growth in this country and places the economy on a sustainable basis beyond the resources boom. This will complement trade-specific policies such as the subject of this bill, the improvements to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. These improvements will assist small and medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets and help reverse the awful trade performance under the previous government. This is going to be one of the key challenges for the Rudd Labor government-a challenge that has been grasped in the recent budget, in the policy position that has been adopted and in the activities of the Minister for Trade, Mr Simon Crean. It is a position that I am very proud to support through this bill. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (6.22 pm)-Ensuring that Australia has a vibrant export industry, one with strong prospects for future expansion and growth, is fundamental to the long term health of our nation’s economy. For many Australian firms, turning to export markets overseas offers enormous opportunities in revenue growth, job creation and product diversification. Like many in this country, I strongly believe that there is an enormous potential in Australia to see export growth across a range of different industries and sectors. Spend just a day touring some of the businesses in my electorate of Calwell and you will see the level of commitment, drive and talent that underscores the potential that exists in Australia when it comes to creating high-quality, innovative products and cutting-edge technology ready to export to the rest of the world. If we are going to harness this potential, it is crucial that we get the policy setting right. Ongoing government support has an important role to play when it comes to growing Australia’s export industry. This includes providing tangible support to Australian firms looking to enter the export market for the first time, as well as helping Australian exporters continually grow their business by accessing new markets and taking advantage of new export opportunities overseas. Unlike our predecessors, the government understand that we have an important role to play when it comes to supporting Australia’s export industry, just as the government understand the importance of investing in the drivers of Australia’s economic growth-in education and training, in innovation as a key component of industry policy, in new technology and in infrastructure. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 seeks to make a number of important changes to the Export Market Development Grants Act, under which Australia’s Export Market Development Grants Scheme was first established, in 1974. Since then, the scheme has provided grants to help Australian firms get their business exports ready and it has provided much needed support to Australian exporters looking to expand their operations when it comes to taking advantage of new market opportunities overseas. The main benefactors of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme have been small businesses. We know that 75 per cent of all applicants to the scheme employ fewer than 20 people and that 81 per cent have an annual turnover of $5 million or less. We also know that around one-third of all applicants are completely new to export. These statistics give us a clear picture of the sorts of benefits this scheme offers. In particular, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme has served to provide both support and additional incentives to Australian small businesses looking to export their products and technologies overseas, often for the first time, who rarely have the funds or expertise to do so. By providing them with additional funding, it has helped many small businesses become export ready, with the followMAIN COMMITTEE on benefits of revenue growth and job creation never far behind. We also know from recent studies that the scheme has met with considerable success, with one study undertaken in 2000 showing that for every $1 spent under the scheme an additional $12 is generated in export revenue. Despite the importance of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme in helping Australian businesses get export ready and access new market opportunities overseas, the former government showed little commitment to it. Its complacency over the last decade saw the scheme effectively cut in half in real terms. In both 1997-98 and 2004-05, the previous government introduced changes to the eligibility criteria and thresholds contained under the scheme that made it harder for Australian businesses to access it. Not surprisingly, these changes generated considerable opposition from within Australia’s business community. The former Howard government then attempted to mitigate some of the problems these changes had created by, for example, promising to increase the amount companies can claim for overseas travel from $200 to $300. It also removed accountability requirements, which meant that successful applicants to the scheme were no longer under any obligation to justify their performance. But it then failed to adequately fund these changes, leaving behind a large catalogue of underpayments and a net shortfall of $27 million, which has affected some 900 claimants. These claimants have already spent money in the expectation that their costs will be reimbursed under the scheme. As was the case when it came to industry policy, the previous government failed to get Australia’s trade policy right. In particular, it squandered the golden opportunity that was presented to it by Australia’s commodities and resources boom to boost government investment in export and trade. The changes contained in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 start us down the path of reversing some of these failures. In particular, the bill seeks to increase the maximum funding available under the scheme by $50,000. Successful applicants will now be able to receive up to $200,000 to help them implement new export strategies and pursue new export opportunities overseas. The bill also widens the eligibility criteria by increasing the turnover threshold for eligible applicants from $30 million to $50 million, thus allowing more businesses to apply for the scheme. It also seeks to halve the minimum expenditure threshold of applicants, again widening the eligibility criteria to include smaller businesses that may not have an enormous amount of capital outlay at their disposal. Applicants will now be able to receive a maximum of eight grants under the scheme instead of the previous maximum of seven grants, allowing them to access the Export Market Development Grants Scheme for longer periods. In addition, the bill seeks to reinstate a performance measure for applicants who are claiming their third successive grant under the scheme, and this measure will hold for all subsequent grants obtained by these applicants under the scheme. Collectively, these changes will see an increase in the funding that is available to successful applicants under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, a widening in the criteria of eligibility in terms of both maximum turnover and minimum expenditure thresholds and the reinstatement of a performance measurement test to make sure that we get the maximum benefit out of the scheme. These are important changes and they underscore the Rudd government’s commitment to trade and to getting the policy setting right, especially when it comes to turning around the mediocre performances of our export growth over the last decade. MAIN COMMITTEE Whilst world trade has grown at twice the rate of world output over the last five years, Australia’s total export revenues managed an annual average growth rate of only 5.8 per cent over the same period. In Australia, export industry growth has slowed considerably despite the fact that world trade has risen dramatically. Exports in Australian goods grew by only 6.4 per cent. Australian manufacturing fared even worse, managing a growth rate of only three per cent. By way of comparison, the average growth rate in exports of Australian goods has been 10.3 per cent since 1983, whilst for manufacturing exports it was 13 per cent over the same period-a significant difference from the figures we have seen over the last five years of 6.4 and three per cent respectively. Seventy consecutive months of trade deficits under the former Howard government were the net result of those poor figures, with Australia’s current account deficit reaching record levels and our foreign debt levels trebling. It is the same story when you look at productivity in Australia under the former government. In the five years leading up to 1998-99, productivity growth averaged 3.3 per cent a year. In the following five years, to 2003-04, Australia’s productivity growth rate fell to 2.1 per cent a year. In the last years of the Howard government, it took yet another dive, to average out at just 1.1 per cent a year. These falls in Australia’s productivity and export growth rates reveal the extent of the former Howard government’s failure to plan for Australia’s future and to invest in the drivers of economic growth. We live in an age where the competition over resources, skills and technical expertise and access to emerging and established markets has become more and more pronounced. We simply cannot afford to become complacent and we cannot afford to drop the ball. That is why the Rudd government has adopted a coordinated approach to tackling the economic challenges Australia faces, both now and into the future-creating additional places in skills training, boosting government investment in education as part of our commitment to an education revolution, committing $4.7 billion to build Australia’s first national broadband network, introducing new government initiatives aimed at fostering a culture of innovation and encouraging greater emphasis on research and development in Australia’s manufacturing and industry sectors, and establishing Infrastructure Australia, whose principal aim is to provide a strategic blueprint for Australia’s current and future infrastructure needs. Nor can we afford to become complacent when it comes to providing real and tangible support to Australian exporters, as well as those businesses looking to break into the export industry for the first time. I would like to briefly turn to one area of Australian manufacturing-namely, the automotive sector, which is particularly close to my heart as the federal member for Calwell. Recent trends in Australia’s car-manufacturing industry serve to highlight the importance of export and trade to Australian manufacturing. In 2007, sales of Australian made cars accounted for only 19 per cent of total car sales in Australia, down from 30 per cent in 2002. Over the same period of time, the total value of imported cars in Australia increased to $27 billion in 2007, up from $18 billion in 2002. To offset their declining share of Australia’s domestic car market, Australian car manufacturers have increasingly focused on maximizing export opportunities overseas. In 1997, only 16 per cent of the total production of Australian motor vehicles was sold overseas. In 2006, this figure increased to 40 per cent of total production, with the Middle East emerging as Australia’s largest export market for cars. In particular, Saudi Arabia is now Australia’s largest single trading partner in automotive sales. MAIN COMMITTEE Certainly when it comes to the future of manufacturing in Australia, the general consensus is that identifying new export opportunities and successfully opening up new overseas markets to quality Australian made products will play an increasingly important role in shaping the industry’s future and helping consolidate its future growth. The importance of export trade has not been lost on Australia’s component manufacturers either, with a 2.6 per cent increase in component exports since 2002, and this trend looks set to continue. The growth in export sales has been one of the few good news stories to come out of Australia’s automotive manufacturing sector, though the rising dollar continues to blunt that growth. What needs to be made clear is that the Rudd government is committed to helping turn around the fortunes of Australia’s car-manufacturing industry, and I am confident that our green car partnership program will go some way towards achieving this end. The lesson here is that export sales continue to grow in importance for many sectors of the Australian economy, and opportunities to export our products overseas continue to open up new possibilities for economic growth. That is why measures of the type contained in this bill, which seek to channel additional funding and support to Australian exporters and provide additional incentives to Australian firms looking to break into the export market for the first time, are so important, especially in today’s climate of increased competition and expanding world trade. I therefore commend the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 to the House. thank the member for Calwell, who has just concluded the debate on this bill, for her contribution in this debate. Like so many on our side of the chamber, we do understand the importance of creating the environment to grow the export sector, and I am delighted that this bill gives us the opportunity to talk about one of the ways in which that can happen. I want to thank all those who have contributed to the debate. I also want to thank the opposition for supporting this measure. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008 represents an important step. It is a down payment in delivering on the Rudd government’s commitment to improve Australia’s woeful trade performance under the previous government. In their contributions to this debate yesterday, the shadow minister for trade and his colleague the Leader of the National Party and former trade minister were in denial about Australia’s lacklustre trade performance. They defended the trade policies of the former government that have now delivered 72 consecutive monthly trade deficits despite a resources boom. No government has presided over such an appalling performance in terms of trade. A major shake-up of trade policy is clearly needed to correct the failings and negligence of the Howard government. At the outset, I would also like to say that trade does matter and, if we are going to improve our performance, change is needed. In the past 50 years, world trade has grown on average three times faster than world output. But in the last five years, as we have seen this stalling process in the Doha Round, it has grown only twice as fast. It should have grown much more strongly, had we been able to conclude a Doha Round. Each successful round of trade liberalisation has fuelled world growth in trade. In times of economic uncertainty, like those that we face now, a successful round would be a tremendous boost to the confidence of the world economy. That is why trade matters and why it is important for us to drive issues that continue to liberalise trade and improve market access. We are vigorously using all available channels MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
329,Mr Crean (Hotham,"Minister for Trade) (6.35 pm)-in reply-First of all I want to to work towards a Doha outcome, including through revitalising the Cairns Group, which Australia chairs, a group created when Labor was last in office. Yesterday the Leader of the Nationals demonstrated just how out of touch he is on trade policy by telling this chamber that we have dropped the ball on the Cairns Group and that it has not met since we came to office. I can tell the Leader of the Nationals that we did have a meeting of those Cairns Group members present at Davos in January, within weeks of us gaining office. I met all Cairns Group ambassadors in Geneva after the Davos meeting to brief them on its outcomes. I have also written to all Cairns Group ministers, noting that we will meet as soon as the ministerial process in Geneva is underway. I have been in touch with every one of my ministerial colleagues from the group by phone, in some cases several times. This government did not drop the ball with the Cairns Group. Rather, the former government allowed its influence to decline. We are about revitalising the Cairns Group and Australia’s role at the WTO, unlike the former government, which squandered the opportunity of this unique grouping to be front and centre of the talks in Geneva. We also understand the need for an integrated approach to trade policy. That is why we have developed a twin pillars approach to trade policy. The first pillar is reform at the border, pursuing improved market access for our exporters: the multilateral round, regional initiatives and bilaterals. But there is no point seeking and obtaining improved market access if your economy is not competitive enough or productive enough to take advantage. That is why the second pillar is also so important-reform behind the border, continuing to strengthen the economy and making it more productive and competitive. Improving access is important but on its own will not guarantee an improved trade performance unless Australian companies, as I say, are productive and competitive enough to take advantage of the new opportunities. Within this framework, export facilitation programs can play an important role in securing the future of Australian industries and Australian business through assisting them to access the global marketplace. The Hawke and Keating governments did dismantle the protective barriers but at the same time they encouraged growth through successful export facilitation programs, including the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, the International Trade Enhancement Scheme and the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program. During the last Labor government’s 13 years in office, net exports made a positive contribution to growth in 10 of those 13 years. Compare that with the woeful record of the Howard government where net exports only made a positive contribution to growth in two of their 11 years, despite the longest lasting resources boom in at least 50 years. The coalition government never understood the important role that export facilitation programs can play in encouraging more companies to get into the export market. They, in fact, halved the value of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme in real terms. They abolished the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program and they abolished the International Trade Enhancement Scheme despite the fact that the study of the scheme’s success concluded that it returned $18 in exports for every dollar out laid by the government. The previous government’s neglect of export facilitation programs is one of the reasons that they failed dismally to deliver on the lofty promises they made in 2001 and 2004 to double the number of exporters. There they were, a government that proposed to double the number of exporters, but they halved the value of the scheme that is an instrumental part of promoting that export growth. MAIN COMMITTEE To add insult on top of the neglect and the running down of the scheme, two years ago they changed the guidelines for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme but did not provide any additional funds to support those changes. They have got the gall in this debate, despite the fact that they are not opposing what we are doing, to question whether the funds that we have provided for the improvements to the scheme contained in the bill are adequate. What hypocrisy. Exporters who are getting considerably less in their second tranche grant payments this year, only determined after the election, when they were led to expect by the previous government’s announcements that they could access it more readily, are the people who are now complaining about the underpayment. The blame for that underpayment lies squarely at the feet of the previous government. I have received a number of letters from businesses and members of parliament, including some of those opposite, about the EMDG funding shortfall. Mr Fitzgibbon interjectinghim something of the answer now for the reasons for the reduction. The simple fact is that the previous government’s eligibility conditions, which they changed a couple of years ago, had the effect of increasing grant claims by 27 per cent this year. Here we have a scheme that had already been cut in half, so not only was there no new money-in fact there was significantly less money than we have made provision for-but they went out and announced changed guidelines to make it easier to access, or at least more attractive for a wider group of people to make claims, and indeed there was a 27 per cent increase in claims. But, in their 2007 election promises, they did not provide any additional funding to cover the impact of those eligibility changes. Despite the billions and billions of dollars that they were throwing around in their desperation to get re-elected, they could not find money for this scheme. We heard the Treasurer in the parliament earlier today talking about the fiscal profligacy of the previous government trying to get itself re-elected, but there was no money for this scheme despite the fact that the government was leading people to believe that there would be more opportunity to access the scheme. That is deception of the worse form, but it is what the previous government practised, having over the previous 11 years cut the scheme in half. Nor can the former government plead ignorance in this matter. The shadow minister for trade gave the game away when he told the Financial Review on 19 December last year that he and the members for Lyne and Wide Bay had fought hard to get more money for the program. The Financial Review article quotes the shadow minister for trade: I have to be frank and say that was as a result of just keeping the budget in balance. It was an area where Mark Vaile and I, and Warren Truss and I were in absolute agreement that we needed more money into that area. So here are a group of ministers sitting around the cabinet table who knew the problem but could not carry the day. They could not carry the day in circumstances in which the government of the day, to get itself re-elected, was spending money like drunken sailors. Worse, they decreased the recipients. They increased the ability to apply; they decreased the funds. So it is a bit rich for members of the opposition to criticise us for their own failure to deliver the funds that were needed to provide for a larger second tranche payment this year. MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
330,Mr Crean,"The Minister for Defence tells me that he has got one on its way. I will giveTheir changes to the scheme increased claims by nearly 30 per cent, but they provided no additional money. In this debate the shadow minister for trade also said it was always their intention to put more money in-but the fact is that they tried to get more money and failed. They fought but failed. Labor have not failed, and that is why we have put this bill before the House so early in the term. Not only have we introduced important new changes to eligibility but we have significantly funded those changes with an additional $50 million in the budget to bring the total funds available in 2009-10 to $190 million to provide greater assistance to Australia’s export communities. The changes to the scheme contained in the bill are a down payment on the overall reforms to trade policies and programs that will follow the Mortimer review. We have not just commissioned a review, as important as that is; we have made decisions in this budget. This bill will increase the maximum grant by $50,000 to $200,000 and lift the maximum turnover limit from $30 million to $50 million. It will increase the limit on the number of grants from seven to eight. It will allow expenses related to acquiring patent protection in international activities. It will allow state, territory and regional trade promotion bodies, including tourism promotion bodies, to access the scheme-and I notice the member for Leichhardt had some important things to say in this regard. It will cut the minimum expenditure threshold by $5,000 to $10,000. It will replace the current list of eligible internal and external services with a new non-tourism services category that will provide for all services supplied to foreign residents, whether delivered inside or outside Australia, to be eligible unless specified in the EMDG regulations. It will apply a new ‘net benefit to Australia’ test to applicants claiming their third and later year grants. Business will welcome these changes. Labor has listened. We have responded through this bill, and in the budget the funds were provided. With these changes, more small and mediumsized businesses, particularly in the services sector, will be able to access the scheme. For the first time, regional economic and tourism bodies will be eligible for grants. The new ‘net benefit to Australia’ test will restore accountability to the scheme in a way which is WTO compliant. The funding for these measures was confirmed in the budget, but they were not the only measures in the budget that will contribute to improving Australia’s trade performance. Those years of neglect of the Howard government in the provision of essential infrastructure will be addressed through the new $20 billion Building Australia Fund, which will be used to build critical economic infrastructure such as roads, rail, ports and broadband. The infrastructure development will benefit all exporting sectors, including manufacturers, miners, farmers and the services sector, particularly in increased productivity. The skill base of the Australian workforce will be addressed through the $11 billion Education Investment Fund, and $62.4 million over three years will be provided to give Australian students the language skills they need to engage with our Asian neighbours. A generation of students missed out on the opportunity to study Asian languages when the Howard government abolished a similar program put in place by the previous Labor government-in fact, introduced when I was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. This is a government that understands also that responding to climate change is about more than just the environmental challenge; it represents an economic opportunity for our business community, MAIN COMMITTEE and there are key budget measures that will help Australian business to position themselves to take advantage of these opportunities. This government has also recognised the importance of an integrated, fully coordinated trade policy that reflects the increasing importance of international capital flows and global supply chains. That is why we have announced in the context of the budget that the Global Opportunities and Invest Australia functions will be incorporated into Austrade. The previous coalition government neglected the needs of exporters and always failed to understand the changing nature of trade. It is no longer just about exports; it is just as much about our business and exporting community. The previous government never understood the implications of the fact that the net outward investment is now approximately equal to the net inward investment. Because under them trade policy defaulted to the National Party, they never looked significantly beyond agriculture-and broadacre agriculture at that. For many Australian companies, investment in offshore facilities and businesses is a very important part of their export strategy. Inward investment, which was the responsibility of Invest Australia, is also crucial to our trading performance, particularly in building capacity. Global Opportunities was focused on building the capacity of small and medium-sized businesses to participate in global supply chains. All these activities are integral to Australia’s trade performance, and yet the previous government took key programs associated with investment and support for global supply chains out of the trade portfolio. They located them in the industry portfolio. No doubt the decision had more to do with the rivalry between the Liberal and National parties than to do with sensible trade policy. Only those opposite would know why that decision was made, but from the perspective of a sensible coordinated trade policy it simply does not make sense. So they have been incorporated, and that was an important part of the budget. Finally, the Mortimer review: having announced all of these initiatives of down payments, reinforced in the budget, we are undertaking a review, to be headed by David Mortimer and John Edwards. This is going to give us the road map forward because we, as a government, are committed to lifting the nation’s export performance. We have been badly let down by the previous government. This bill is an important start to the rebuilding process. I commend it to the House and I thank the opposition at least for their support for this very important measure. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Lance Corporal Jason Marks Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Mr Albanese: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 27 April 2008 of Lance Corporal Jason Marks while on combat operations in Afghanistan and place on record its appreciation of his service to the country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. April, Turkish time, I was returning from dinner with the Turkish Defence Minister in Ankara MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2008
331,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Minister for Defence) (6.56 pm)-On the evening of 27when I received one of those phone calls every defence minister dreads. The CDF was calling to inform me that we had lost a special forces soldier in Afghanistan and that a number of his mates had been wounded. The fact that the call came only two days after ANZAC Day added to the sadness and poignancy of the news. Lance Corporal Marks was only 27 years of age and yet had already been a member of the Australian Defence Force for almost a decade. Having enlisted in 1999, he had served the 4th Field Regiment as a gunner and as a medical assistant to the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps. In 2005 he realised a lifelong dream in joining the Sydney based 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment-the commandos. It was as a commando that he came to serve in Afghanistan as part of the Special Operations Task Group. He was a career soldier, and the commandos represented the pinnacle of what he wanted to accomplish. As the Minister for Defence, I come into regular contact with our service men and women and every day I witness their dedication, their skill and their courage. I am consistently amazed by their Achillean approach to their work and their overwhelming pride in what they do. From all that I have seen and heard of Lance Corporal Marks, he represented those qualities exceptionally well, and I know that his family and colleagues are justifiably proud of his service. He was highly respected by his comrades and his peers and was a soldier whose dedication and enthusiasm was an inspiration to all of those around him. He was also a wonderful and caring husband and father. He truly strove to be the best he could in everything he did. Despite their grief, Lance Corporal Marks’s mates are continuing to fight against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan and are making a significant contribution to the stability of the region. Our troops, in conjunction with our coalition partners and of course the government of Afghanistan, are playing a vital role in keeping the Taliban and other violent extremists on the back foot. They are working tirelessly at nurturing the conditions for progress and development. Our special forces are clearing out the insurgents, and our Reconstruction Task Force is constructing patrol bases, schools, bridges and hospitals and of course training the Afghan National Army. The international community must remain committed to this project and to a brighter future for Afghanistan, providing greater prosperity and continued freedom for every Afghan. We must honour the memory of those who have given their lives for this cause: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley and now Lance Corporal Jason Marks. I thank the hard working and professional members of the Australian Defence Force. We must never forget that our troops serving across the globe face danger every day from Afghanistan to Timor Leste, from the Solomon Islands to the Sinai, to Iraq and elsewhere. We must never forget that they work tirelessly to secure our safety and to promote our national interests. We must never forget their dedicated service and what their courageous sacrifices impart to the broader Australian community. I felt very fortunate to be in a position to visit Tarin Kowt soon after Lance Corporal Marks’s death, both to pay my respects to him and what he did for his country and to visit in hospital his wounded mates. Both were moving experiences. The wounded, I can report, were in high spirits. They were mourning their lost mate but they were keen to get back out there again. On SaturdayI enjoyed another privilege when I welcomed home around 1,000 soldiers returning from East Timor and Afghanistan. I was there, of course, to thank them for what they MAIN COMMITTEE are doing for their country and its people, for what they are doing for regional security, for what they are doing for global security and for what they have done for the people of Afghanistan and in East Timor. Sadly, one of those from Reconstruction Task Force3 was not there. David ‘Poppy’ Pearce was a member of that group and sadly lost his life in Afghanistan. The loss of Jason Marks, Poppy Pearce, Matty Locke, Luke Worsley and Andrew Russell serves as a sombre reminder of why we pause on ANZAC Day and why we acknowledge all those who have served and those who continue to serve. It reminds us that the Australian Defence Force personnel face danger every day and that every day they deserve our respect and appreciation. Again, I offer my sincerest sympathies to Jason Marks’s family: his wife, Cassie; his two young children, Connor and Ella; and his parents, Paul and Sharon. He was a young husband and father taken from them far too soon, and I cannot begin to imagine their grief. I further express my heartfelt condolences to his friends and fellow soldiers from the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, who have also felt the pain of Jason’s death. In response to an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, can I say that the government of Australia is proud of all the men and women who serve in the Australian Defence Force, no matter whether they belong to the Navy, the Army or the Air Force and regardless of which particular role they might fill in any of those services or in the Department of Defence. When it comes to deploying Australia’s military forces, the government is guided by its principal military adviser, the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston. Let me take this opportunity to express on behalf of the government our complete confidence in the CDF, which is borne out by the fact that we recently reappointed him for another three years in that job. The professional military advice provided to government on troop deployments is always predicated on using those force elements with the best chance of getting the job done as safely as possible-achieving their mission on behalf of the Australian people while minimising the risk of casualties. Our soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor and elsewhere around the globe have been doing all that we ask of them, with the greatest of courage, professionalism and effectiveness. TonightI again thank them for everything that they do for their country. motion of condolence for Lance Corporal Jason Paul Marks, who was tragically killed in Afghanistan on 27 April 2007. Our nation’s gratitude to the men and women in our Defence Force is immense. They willingly commit to putting their own lives in danger, on the line daily, for others. While we have immense gratitude to our service men and women, sadly when we lose a fine soldier like Lance Corporal Marks the pain too is immense. Words can never do justice to the fine soldier that we have lost in Lance Corporal Marks. Beyond the pain we as a nation feel when we lose one of our internationally respected Australian soldiers is the loss of the man that was Jason Paul Marks. The loss of this man-this husband, son, father and friend-is immeasurable. Australia presently has more than 1,000 personnel in Oruzgan province, including the Reconstruction Task Force and the SOTG, comprising members of the 4RAR (Commando) Battalion and Special Air Service Regiment. Lance Corporal Marks was in the lead platoon preparing for a company level assault 25 kilometres to the south-east of Tarin Kowt, in Oruzgan MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Condolences
332,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (7.03 Pm),"I join the Minister for Defence in supporting theprovince, when they were attacked by the Taliban on 27 April 2008. There was a heavy exchange of small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades between the Australian troops and the Taliban. Even though coalition air support involving Apache helicopters and F16 fighter bombers struck back at the Taliban position, four soldiers were wounded by small arms fire in the same action that took the life of Lance Corporal Marks early in the contact with the Taliban. I was indeed humbled to be on the tarmac at Richmond RAAF base for the ramp ceremony on Saturday, 3 May, when this brave soldier’s body was returned to his homeland, to his wife, Cassandra, and to his family. It was an incredibly moving experience to bear witness to soldiers from his regiment, 4th Battalion, RAR (Commando), forming an honour guard as his casket, draped in the Australian flag he so valiantly fought under and decked with flowers, was carried from the C17 military plane. An Army piper played as the solemn procession made its way across the tarmac; a more poignant scene is hard to imagine. The tributes for this young man, this son, husband and father who has made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, flowed in. Defence Force head, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, has described Lance Corporal Marks as one of the country’s finest soldiers. The Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, paid attribute to Lance Corporal Marks on behalf of the Australian Army when he said: He is a true Australian hero, a great bloke ... admired and respected ... He said Lance Corporal Marks had become a part of Australia’s history and the history of the Army and that that would be revered. Major General Tim McOwan, commander of the Australian special forces, said Lance Corporal Marks was a remarkable soldier who was extremely dedicated to his role as a commando and as an Australian soldier. Major General McOwan struck at the core of the feelings that Lance Corporal Marks’s colleagues had for Lance Corporal Marks, when he said: Jason epitomized what every commando strives for: courage, strength and determination. He certainly had a strength of character that set him apart. Jason was an extremely well liked man and his loss will be keenly felt throughout his unit and the wider army. Lance Corporal Marks was also a vital member of a family. He was a much loved husband to Cassandra and a father to two small children-Ella, five months old, and Connor, five years old-who will not know their father in the years to come. Hopefully, they will be comforted in part by the extreme outpouring of emotion and genuine feelings from his colleagues and the Australian public. He was a man who would be nameless to the people of Afghanistan but who gave his life so that they may live in hope of a better life. Born in Broken Hill in New South Wales, Lance Corporal Marks grew up in Yeppoon in Queensland. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 2 March 1999. After recruitment and initial training, he was posted to the 4th Field Regiment as a gunner until 2003, whereupon he transferred to the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps as a medical assistant. In 2005 he undertook special forces entry and commando selection, after which he was transferred to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps and posted to the 4th Battalion (Commando) in the Royal Australian Regiment. After completing his specialist commando training he was posted into a commando assault platoon, where he served as a commando assaulter, signaller and mortar specialist. Lance Corporal Marks was also a combat fitness leader and a Pashto linguist. MAIN COMMITTEE Lance Corporal Marks was a decorated soldier who had seen operational service in East Timor and Afghanistan, and he was employed to both theatres on more than one occasion. Jason had been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, clasp East Timor and clasp International Coalition Against Terror; the Australian Service Medal, clasp Timor Leste; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; and the Australian Active Service Medal. He was also awarded the Unit Citation for Gallantry as part of the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan in 2006. According to his wife, Cassandra, all Jason ever wanted to do was join the army. She said: All Jason ever wanted to do was to join the army … He was the type of of man who knew what he wanted, even from the age of 12. All Jason ever wanted to be was a soldier. Becoming a Commando was a dream of Jason, he was proud of who he was and proud of what he did. Buried in his childhood home town of Yeppoon in Queensland, his name will now forever be recorded in history linked with the ANZACs and other brave men and women before him on the town’s cenotaph. I say to his wife, Cassandra, to his two young children, Ella and Connor, to his mum and dad, Sharon and Paul, to his brother, Lance, and to his brother-in-law, Phillip: our nation shares your loss and grief. I can assure them that at the going down of the sun and in the morning we shall remember Lance Corporal Jason Paul Marks. Lest we forget. press my sorrow at the loss of Lance Corporal Jason Marks of the 4th Battalion (Commando) in the Royal Australian Regiment, who lost his life on 27 April while serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Marks died when his patrol was attacked by about 20 Taliban extremists in Afghanistan’s Oruzgan province. Jason Marks was 27. He was born in Broken Hill and later lived in Yeppoon, near Rockhampton, in Queensland. He enlisted in the Australian Army in 1999, serving in the 4th Field Regiment. Lance Corporal Marks served as a gunner until 2003, then as a medical assistant in the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps. He had served with 4RAR (Commando) since qualifying for special forces in 2005. Australia will remember Jason Marks as a dedicated, superb soldier. At the ceremony marking the return of his body home to Australia, the Special Operations Commander Australia, Major General Tim McOwan, said: Jason epitomized what every Commando strives for: courage, strength and determination. He certainly had a strength of character that set him apart. Jason was an extremely well liked man and his loss will be keenly felt throughout his unit and the wider Army. Lance Corporal Marks leaves behind a young family. His wife, Cassandra, has told the nation of a devoted father and loving husband whose dream was to serve in the Army as a commando, a man who was proud of who he was and what he did. To Mrs Marks and her two children, Connor and Ella, I express my deepest condolences. The loss of any serving member is a tragedy for Australia but it is devastating for the family left behind. Today we honour his memory, and the Australian government, the Department of Defence and my department will be offering all the support available to assist the Marks family. Case officers from my department will be meeting with Mrs Marks this week to ensure that the Marks family receive their full compensation entitlements. MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Condolences

Honourable members having stood in their placesThat further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Hon. John Norman Button Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Mr Albanese: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 8 April 2008 of the Honourable John Norman Button, former Federal Minister and Senator for Victoria, and place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. the Hon. John Norman Button. I do so because I think it is appropriate that someone from Ipswich should do so. Bill Hayden is a life member in a branch in my electorate and a personal friend and I thought it appropriate for someone to say something in parliament to pay tribute to John Button, who was a good friend of Bill and Dallas Hayden for many years. The Hon. John Button was the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce from 1984 to 1993, the only member, as I understand it, of the Hawke-Keating government to serve in the same capacity for that period of time; the Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1983 to 1984; the Minister Assisting the Minister for Communications from 1983 to 1984; Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1983 to 1993; Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1980 to 1983; Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1977 to 1980; and a senator for Victoria from 1974 to 1993. John Button was the son of a Presbyterian minister from Ballarat. Many great Labor politicians have been sons or daughters of ministers of religion; the number in the history of the Labor Party who have made a contribution to this parliament is quite extraordinary. He went to Geelong College and studied law at Melbourne university. It is interesting to note that he campaigned against the Menzies government referendum to ban the Communist Party. He was a great civil libertarian. After a brief sojourn to Europe, he joined the labour law firm of Maurice Blackburn and Co. and was a partner in that firm from 1959 to 1974. He was a great Labor figure, small in stature but large in contribution. I have talked to Bill Hayden about John Button. Words like quixotic, loner, whimsical, intellectual, wit and grace came to Bill’s lips. John Button was a man of honesty and integrity. His long service to this parliament is evidence of his contribution. It must have been lonely as a participant in the Victorian branch of the ALP, but he backed Gough Whitlam’s efforts during the 1960s to reform the dysfunctional Victorian branch, MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Condolences

337,Mr Neumann (Blair) (7.14 Pm),"I rise today to pay my respects and to pay tribute to which had made Labor almost unelectable because of its left-wing extremism. It was very happy and willing to argue over the spoils of defeat rather than the fruits of victory. That was best evident in 1969, when the Whitlam Labor Party won 18 seats to cut the coalition majority to seven, but in Victoria Labor picked up only three seats, leaving it with 11 out of 34. The federal takeover was necessary and acceptable to the party, and John Button should be thanked for the contribution he made which led to the victory of the Whitlam Labor Party in December 1972. The Button car plan was extraordinary. His contribution, his great skill and courage in negotiating with the unions and business, was long and arduous and must be respected. It resulted in the reduction of tariffs, of import quotas and in the number of locally manufactured models, but it provided tremendous assistance to R&D and to retrenched workers. We would not have a car industry without John Button. What he did is amazing, and I mentioned it before. As someone in the Queensland branch of the ALP, in what has often been described as a factional menage a trois-as a member of a minority group-I find it extraordinary that Button survived with a five per cent contribution to the Victorian branch of the ALP. My group, which is often derisively called the ‘old guard’ in Queensland, has about four times that and I know, as one of the leaders of that group, how difficult it is with the colossus of the big Left and Right unions. But Button managed to negotiate great deals. He was often hated by both the Left and Right, but he survived for a generation. The contribution he made is quite extraordinary. Paul Keating talked about this and said of John Button: A lawyer who inhabited the centre ground of Victorian Labor politics, he was material in returning the pendulum of Labor politics from the left, where it had stuck fast for a quarter of a century, to the political centre. … … … In his prime, he was more or less despised by the left and the right. In the swing position, he played corner politics with cunning and elan. It is quite extraordinary. I want to pay tribute because my former role in life was as a partner of a law firm, and I know how much that helped me in coming into this parliament. Bill Hayden was a great friend of John Button, and John is often most remembered for a certain letter he wrote to Bill. He sent this to Bill in March 1983: I have been consistently loyal to you in every major difficulty you have faced. I am still loyal to you as a person ... My ultimate loyalty, however, must be to the ALP. The letter tipped the balance. Bill moved aside six days after that letter, and 4½ weeks later Bob Hawke became Prime Minister of this country. I know, as someone who has lived in Ipswich all my life, how Bill’s failure to become the Prime Minister affected the people locally. I remember a great story that Bill told me once: someone came up to him and said, ‘Bill, the Labor Party did the dirty on you and I’m never going to vote Labor again,’ and Bill said, ‘If you don’t vote Labor, you won’t be voting for me at this election.’ But Bill and John went on to remain friends despite it all and worked together as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Industry and Commerce. Bill has paid tribute to John, the friendship and the contribution he made. It must have been hard to overcome the MAIN COMMITTEE disappointment and it must have been hard for John Button to write that letter, but Bill said years later about that letter and about what John did that day, ‘One cannot seriously quibble about the quality of a good friend who delivers bad personal news with honesty and courage and, I think, added grace.’ On behalf of my seat, Blair, on behalf of Bill and his wife, Dallas, and on behalf of the people of Ipswich, I pay tribute to John and the immense contribution he made. We have no hard feelings, John. We thank you for what you did for the people of Ipswich. We thank you for what you did for the people of Australia and the part that you played in the Whitlam resurgence, in the Hawke ascendancy and in the Keating victory. Thank you, John, on behalf of the people of Ipswich. pm)-I rise to place on the record my views of John Button, a great Labor minister and a great reformer, both in terms of what he did for industry policy in this country and what he did for the Australian Labor Party. I do not have a great deal of time, as I am on duty in the main chamber, but I wanted to express my gratitude to Senator John Button, who provided many of us in the Labor Party with a fantastic role model. It was not because he was in a particular faction, the independent faction, but it was because he was an independent thinker. He was willing to challenge the current construct, whether it was factions or an industry policy that was not assisting Australian workers and Australian business in the longer term. He was able to quite effectively, and like very few others, challenge the way we did things. Because of that inclination, that genius that he had, his mark was left in many areas, especially on the Australian Labor Party and the way in which it operated, particularly in Victoria, and on the way the Hawke-Keating period is now perceived. Firstly, I will turn to the Victorian Labor Party. John Button was someone who we desperately needed. The branch of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria in the period in which he became active was a moribund, incestuous and dysfunctional outfit-and I do not think I am overstating things. He had the capacity to challenge the way people behaved and the strength to challenge people’s undemocratic approaches to preselection and the way policy was formulated. He was one of only a number who in the end contributed to the opening up and the democratisation of that particular branch. I think he was therefore in many ways responsible for the success that the party had in that state subsequent to his assistance in reform. With respect to his role as a parliamentarian, he was of course Leader of the Government in the Senate, a remarkable leader of the Senate. He was the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he was renowned for his role in the area of industry, not just in the car industry but also in the steel industry. There are many thousands of workers and their families in Whyalla who could thank him for ensuring that the industry remained in that town. Many people now work for the car industry, an industry that is beset with constant challenge because of its highly competitive nature. They can thank John Button in his role as industry minister for providing the framework that allowed that industry to remain and to grow in this country. A lot more has to be done, and the industry constantly finds it has new challenges to confront and deal with. I do not think it is going too far to say that, without John Button as minister, that industry may not have survived and we may not have been talking about a car industry in today’s Australia.

338,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton),"Minister for Employment Participation) (7.21He brought a strong intellect to everything he did. I had the great fortune of seeing him relatively recently at a function in my former electorate, in the town of Woodend, which is a fantastic town in central Victoria. I was to introduce him. I remember speaking to someone who was a little antagonistic. I turned quickly, as you do when you feel someone spying on you, and I saw John looking at the way I was handling the situation. He had a writer’s mind; he was an observer of human behaviour and of human nature. He gave an almost imperceptible nod to me as if to say: ‘You’re doing okay, son. Keep it up. You’re a fledging politician but you’re doing okay.’ This was in my first term as the then member for Burke. I got to speak to him about his role in the parliament, what he got out of it and what was important. People like him provide great guidance to new members of parliament. He certainly did that for me. As we now know, he was struck down with cancer, which was diagnosed only shortly before his death. It was quite a sudden and tragic end. I was aware of the fact that last year he had chaired an inquiry into workforce participation for the Victorian government, for the then minister Jacinta Allan. Before he fell ill, I was going to ask him about the inquiry and whether he could provide assistance to the Commonwealth. Of course, if he had been involved, it would have been our gain, because he did everything in public life to his fullest and he brought a great capacity and a great sense of purpose to it. He was not one for wasting time. We could recall many anecdotes and witticisms, because he had such an extraordinarily good sense of humour. He saw that life has its absurd side and, when the moment struck him, he liked to shine a light upon those absurdities. In the end, I think he will be remembered for his bravery, his intellect and his capacity to think and not be swayed from doing the right thing. I therefore want to express for the record my appreciation to him and my condolences to his partner, Joan Grant, his sons, James and Nick, and his grandchildren, Harry, Lola and Otis. Labor politics and indeed on the national stage. It is a mark of John Button’s stature that the tributes to him flowed from leaders and former leaders of all major political parties and from people of all walks of life. All acknowledged his role in reforming the Australian economy. All acknowledged his commitment to the Australian manufacturing industry. Many of the tributes recounted his achievements through his life-and we have heard during the debate on this condolence motion that kind of acknowledgement. Many people also referred to John Button’s personal qualities, like the former Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and minister in the Fraser government, Fred Chaney, who said that John Button brought ‘wit and grace’ to politics. We heard this tribute from the former Premier of Victoria, John Cain: John Button was self-assured, never cocky, always modest and understated. Michael Duffy, a former member of this House and a great friend and ministerial colleague of John Button, said that he had made a threefold contribution to Labor and to the country. He said: Before politics John Button played a major role in reforming the party. During politics he was an outstanding minister whose structural reforms helped put the Australian economy on track. And finally, he was a good bloke. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Condolences
339,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (7.29 Pm),"John Button was a very important figure in VictorianI first met John Button in 1976, when he was a new senator. They were dark days for the Labor Party after the defeat of 1975. John had set up his first electoral office in Cheltenham, where my electorate of Isaacs now is. I was then a second-year law student. I went to him for advice, partly about my career and partly as to what role I might play in political life. Demonstrating the practicality that John Button always brought to advising people-and he had a great role in advising younger people, particularly in the Labor Party, for which he was known-the advice he gave to me was, rather than go into politics or pursue a job in a political office: ‘Finish your law degree.’ I fear that that advice might have delayed my arrival here for quite some time, because I did just that and indeed went on to practise law. John Button’s qualities were qualities that all members of this Australian parliament might aspire to. I will leave it to others to record in detail his ministerial and parliamentary achievements, but his personal qualities, of which I have already spoken-his practicality and good humour, his sense of respect for the democracy and its institutions, the sense that he brought of involving young people in the political process and his humility in the sense that John Button never lost touch with ordinary Australians-were all qualities that all of us in this place would do well to aspire to. John Button wrote very well. It is a great reflection of his ability to think clearly that he did write so well, and he saved much of his observation and writing for the time after he left parliament, when he wrote three books: Flying the Kite: Travels of an Australian Politician in 1994, On the Loose in 1996 and As It Happened in 1998. He wrote for the newspapers; he wrote for journals; he wrote on architecture, on art, on history and on politics. In those writings, after he left politics in 1993, he was able to demonstrate a freedom to express himself that perhaps was not available to him while he was a member of this parliament. I said before that John Button never lost touch. Indeed it is easy to do that in this place, as he commented, very soon after leaving the parliament, while writing in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1993. Perhaps wearily after 19 years in this parliament, he wrote-and it is a passage that appeared later in his book On the Loose: I’ve never been entirely comfortable with the Canberra thing. For newcomers to national politics, the Sunday night flight to the capital is a date with destiny, a ticket to where it all happens. As time passes, things change. You present your ticket to the flight attendant with the heavy heart of an inmate returning to a lunatic asylum after weekend release. That is of course John Button writing after he had left the parliament and he was, as I have suggested, perhaps demonstrating some weariness in the month immediately after he had left the parliament after 19 years. That weariness with the political process, if indeed that is what is reflected in the passage that I have just read, is not something that stayed with him, because John Button continued to participate, continued to write and continued to agitate in the political life of this country with tremendous vigour, continuing to put forward many of the ideas that he had put forward during his time here. I cannot resist recounting at least one of the anecdotes from John Button’s life that have been much repeated in the speeches and tributes over the last month. It concerns his use of the nom de plume ‘Arthur Cartwright’. It is now known that John Button wrote to newspapers, ALP officials and even, on occasion, state and federal ministers using that nom de plume. It appears that, while using that nom de plume and often writing publicly to the same people to whom he himself using his own name had written, John Button had the freedom to say things MAIN COMMITTEE that he might not have been able to say in his own name. In one story about his use of the nom de plume Arthur Cartwright, it is said that he had written to an ALP state president in Victoria with whom he had been publicly arguing and that, at a meeting with this state party president, the state party president apparently said to him-and John Button was very proud of thissomething along these lines: ‘John, I can put up with blokes like you; I know what you’re about. But wait till I get hold of that Arthur Cartwright!’ It is a mark of the type of man that John Button was that he continued to use the nom de plume in that way, providing him with considerable private amusement while also possibly serving a purpose as he conducted his debates and as he participated in discussion on the matters that he wanted to comment on. John Button persisted with an adherence to the idea that politics matters. It was evident in all of the speeches he gave in this parliament that, for him, being a member of parliament was a high calling. He never lost faith. He never lost sight of the idea that through politics great things can be achieved. He was in that sense a true democrat. He never stopped expressing his adherence to the rule of law, to the importance of a free and independent media and to the importance of striving for the civil liberties of all people in Australia. I say with some regret that one of the ideas that John Button spoke very passionately about in his first speech in the Senate in 1974 bears repeating because it is something that is still with us-that is, the difficulty that our nation has experienced in achieving constitutional change and in achieving change to the framework of government. John Button, in 1974, spoke of ‘the Constitution providing the framework of government in Australia’. He went on to say: It is sometimes stated by Opposition spokesmen that in some peculiar way which has never been explained to my satisfaction, the existing federal structure in Australia provides a bulwark for the freedom of the individual. I have never heard any evidence for that assertion, and I look forward to hearing it in this chamber because whatever we do we must be sure that the democratic institutions and the framework of government in Australia reflect the aspirations of the Australian people and allow the members of this chamber and of the other chamber to act in a way which fulfils the aspirations of the Australian people … I go on with a little more of the next passage, because it shows the lightness of touch that John Button was able to bring to weighty issues and, in so doing, make the point that much better. In his first speech, John Button went on to say: I have sometimes heard Opposition senators speaking of the Australian Constitution with the reverence which an antique salesman sometimes displays when he is trying to sell an old chair. The point is always made that because of the age of the chair its value is so much greater. While that may apply to furniture it cannot apply to the framework of government in Australia … John Button, as I have said, continued to write on the issues that concerned him. In particular, he wrote a sparkling essay published in the Quarterly Essay series in 2002. In it, he expressed very eloquently the importance of ideas in politics generally and the importance of ideas for the Australian Labor Party, of which I am proud to be a member. I will read just a couple of passages from this essay that John Button wrote in 2002, about ideas: It’s worth remembering that the ALP has always done best in federal elections when it has set the political agenda, when it has involved its members as agents of change and enthused a wider section of the community with a sense of excitement and vision. A small target strategy does none of these things. It’s contrary to ALP sentiment and tradition, demoralising to the membership and boring for the electorate. And you can hear the vigour with which John Button was writing even in 2002. He further wrote: MAIN COMMITTEE Ideas are crucial to an ALP agenda. Ideas are about all the ALP has going for it and they are something which the coalition has never been good at. Some ideas and examples for the ALP will come from overseas, but history has shown that the best political ideas, the ones which have been successful for Labor, are those developed here in response to Australia’s particular circumstances. These particular circumstances include our position in the Asia-Pacific region, a highly urbanised population, multiculturalism, unique environmental challenges and our history, including the story of Aboriginal Australia. And one can hear in that passage the clear-sightedness which John Button brought to the practice of politics. He never lost his passion for the Australian Labor Party. In that same essay he analysed the major political parties and finished with this: Who among these parties is going to be able to build a better Australia? The Democrats and the Greens can’t do it. The Coalition won’t do it. The ALP remains the sole genuine avenue for political change. Lastly, I would like to read a contribution to politics from John Button’s last major publication and some observations that he made about the importance of our institutions, particularly the Public Service, the judiciary and the media. John Button wrote: A public service committed to the public good is a keeper of a country’s corporate memory. The best public servants know what has happened in the past, what has worked and what hasn’t. This can be a useful guide to the present and sometimes the future. It is an important part of a healthy democracy. So too in different ways are an independent judiciary and institutions like the ABC, the universities and a diverse and critical media. Menzies understood this. Latter-day politicians have understood it less. Politicians should respect the integrity of these institutions. I am in John Button’s debt for showing me that it is possible to achieve good results and real change through parliamentary work. All parliamentarians and all Australians are in his debt for the contributions he made and the example that he set. I extend my condolences to his family. country, has lost one of its greatest figures. John Button was born in Ballarat in 1933. He went to school at Geelong College and from there went to Melbourne university. I followed much later in his footsteps, in a way, being educated in Geelong and also doing law at Melbourne university. John Button was a man who loved Labor governments. He passionately believed in what Labor governments did for our country and can do for our country. In the passages that we have just heard from the member for Isaacs, you get a sense of John Button’s passion and love of Labor governments. He was utterly committed to putting Labor governments into power. But winning government is a very difficult endeavour. It is a hard thing to do and it requires difficult decisions. It is a measure of John Button and his significance that at the commencement of the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments he played a pivotal role in putting in place the architecture of the Labor Party which allowed those governments to ultimately occur. Many would say-indeed, I would say-that Gough Whitlam’s greatest achievement was to modernise the Australian Labor Party and put Labor in a position where it was finally electable after a long period in the wilderness. The coalface of that struggle of making the Australian Labor Party an electable party was occurring in Victoria, which was failing to recover from the split of 1955 and was being run by an authoritarian and very leftwing Victorian central executive. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Condolences
340,Mr Marles (Corio) (7.47 Pm),"In John Button, the Labor movement, and indeed ourJohn Button was a founding member of a group called ‘the Participants’, which was formed in 1965. The group was formed out of frustration at Labor being out of power for a long time and a commitment to try and put Labor back into power once again. The group saw that for that to occur the Victorian branch of the Labor Party needed to be reformed, so they campaigned for federal intervention and for the federal executive to involve itself in the affairs of the Victorian branch. That federal intervention ultimately occurred in 1970, very much at the behest of the then opposition leader, Gough Whitlam. It was a potent combinationGough Whitlam on the one hand and the Participants, a local group of activists, on the other-and together they managed to change the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. In what is a fantastic, unpublished book by Senator-elect David Feeney, which was written in 1996 after extensive interviews with all of the Participants, he came to the conclusion that the Participants themselves credited John Button with the idea of putting together the combination of Gough Whitlam on the one hand and the Participants on the other. It was John Button who led that move, and ultimately Gough Whitlam met with the Participants on numerous occasions and helped to bring about that federal intervention. In the aftermath, John Button was a key figure in reinvigorating the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, sitting on the then advisory council. The 1970 intervention into the Victorian Labor Party was a critical precondition for Labor winning government in 1972. It was very difficult work indeed and at the heart of it was John Button. In 1974 John Button was then elected to the Senate and briefly participated in the Whitlam government. But nine years later, in 1983, John Button famously participated in another event which put in place the architecture that allowed the then Hawke-led opposition to win the 1983 election. It is an often quoted letter, particularly in the last few months, which put Bob Hawke, a very charismatic and popular leader at the time, in a position to contest the 1983 election. It must have been an acutely difficult letter for John Button to write and it has been quoted before but I intend to quote the passage again where he wrote to Bill Hayden, a close friend of his, and said: I have been consistently loyal to you in every major difficulty you have faced. I am still loyal to you. My ultimate loyalty, however, must be to the ALP. That quote says volumes about John Button’s attitude to loyalty but also his loyalty to the Australian Labor Party. I think it is with incredible generosity and grace that Bill Hayden ultimately said at John Button’s funeral that John was absolutely right on all of those points. It is a measure of John Button’s significance, as I said, that he was a critical player at the most important, pivotal moments in the lead-up to both the Whitlam government and the Hawke and Keating governments. He was a player in the background but he was a player who ultimately made the difference and allowed those governments to occur. John Button did have his own time in the sun. As the industry minister of this country-and it has been put on record on numerous occasions in the last month-John Button was the longest serving minister in a single portfolio during the Hawke-Keating era. He is best remembered perhaps in that sense for the Button car plan, which again tackled a very difficult issue and made hard decisions but did so in an intelligent and sensitive way. Reducing tariffs, he made the car industry much more internationally competitive, but he did so on the basis of providing export focused industry policy. The need for our manufacturing sector to be export focused is as critical now as it was then. Indeed, that is absolutely the case in the car industry MAIN COMMITTEE and it is absolutely the case in the car industry in my electorate of Corio, where last year we saw 600 employees lose their jobs in the Geelong engine stamping plant of Ford. That ultimately was a decision which flowed from a much earlier decision by Ford in Detroit not to export Australian made vehicles into the Middle East, but that stood as an example of how important export industries are to our manufacturing sector and, in particular, to our car industry. I first met John Button in 1990. I enjoyed hearing the account from the member for Isaacs; it sounded very similar to my first meeting with John Button. I was writing a number of letters, not of any particular note, as a university student to a number of ministers in the then Hawke government. I wrote off a number of letters but one person replied and that was John Button. I ended up having a wonderful interview with him where I think I asked similar questions to the member for Isaacs about what my future might hold and how I ought best go about it. It was the kind of interview that I suspect he would not have remembered for long after it occurred, but of course it was an interview that I will never forget. ThatI am obviously not the only person to have had that experience says a lot about the generosity of the man and his generosity with his time. I have another association with the Button family, through John’s son James. James Button and I had briefly overlapping careers at Melbourne university and I came to know him in that time through student politics. But I also knew James and, vicariously through James, John through a shared love that we all had of the Geelong Football Club. WhatI really rememberand it is a lesson that I have certainly carried on in my life-was a ritual that the two of them had. It may have involved Nick as well, I am not sure, but I came to know of it through James and so here I refer to James and John. Their ritual involved frequently going to watch the Geelong Football Club play throughout the winter months. They loved the club a lot, but the event also played a very significant role in their own relationship. They got to spend the day together-father and son-and whilst the principle focus was on watching the ‘Hoops’ run around the ground, no doubt they also shared stories about their week. It was a very important interaction in their lives, as John’s commitment of time to this place made family life difficult. John expressed that on numerous occasions since he left this place. Emerging from that period and having my own children-an 11-year-old son, a three-year-old daughter and an 11-monthold son-I am very keen that football and Geelong should be a part of the relationship that I have with them. Whilst Sam is very much on the road to being a Geelong supporter and understands it all, my daughter, Isabella, and my younger son, Harvey, will get there as well. In 1995, while at the grand final that Geelong contested against Carlton, I read a fantastic piece in the Age written by James Button. I had got to the ground early, as you do on grand final day so that you can get a good seat. There was a lot of time to kill, but there was this fantastic feature piece in the Age written by James which described the trials and tribulations of barracking for what until recently has been a heartbreak team. He went through in detail the particular pain that Geelong Football Club supporters have suffered over the years. It was difficult to read that piece and not start crying, which indeed I did on that day after my anticipation of what I had expected to be a fantastic achievement. Aficionados of AFL history will know that I was to be very disappointed later in the day as Geelong got absolutely pumped. I have since learnt that there was a ritual that James and John used to go through after each grand final where they would take a sheet of paper, write down on it each player on the list, MAIN COMMITTEE imagine them in peak form and injury free, and then fantasize about what that would mean for the following year and how Geelong might go. A very intelligent mind applying itself to the trials and tribulations of the Geelong Football Club needed venting and some form of expression, and John Button did that by writing to the coaches of Geelong as industry minister to suggest players who should be picked, others who should be delisted and where particular players should play. He tells a story, and there are a couple of versions of it. In 1989 a new coach came to Geelong, Malcolm Blight, who replied to John by talking about the new policies he was going to put in place at the club and then gently suggesting to John Button that he did not need his advice as industry minister because he would be able to coach the team on his own. The first version of that story involved John being confident about that assertion by the coach and his sense that this was a man who knew how to coach. So with some confidence he put his pen away and stopped offering that advice. Last year was an incredible year for the Geelong Football Club. There was an enormous amount of emotion leading up to the grand final and it turned out to be an utterly extraordinary event. It is difficult to convey to people who do not support this team exactly what it meant. It bears some similarity to Collingwood’s 1990 victory, but Geelong’s particular geography and the whole town’s commitment made it even more emotional and even more special. On the Friday before the grand final, there appeared in the Age again a wonderful piece of writing by a Button about what it meant to barrack for Geelong. On this occasion it was John Button himself who was writing in the Age. He told the story again of sending those letters to the coaches of the Geelong Football Club and Malcolm Blight’s rebuff of those suggestions of his. He said-and this is a slightly different version to the first version that I heard of this; I suspect that John gave both versions: He then gave me a cold stare. As coach, he said, he wouldn’t need any letters of advice from me. I thought this was churlish. I gave up writing letters in disgust. Disgruntled, I went underground and became caught up in a loose and semi-secret network, not unlike the People’s Liberation Front of Judea in Monty Python’s Life of Brian. It involved meetings in pubs and coffee bars and restaurants to discuss “the situation” of the club. Like the Liberation Front, our deliberations were mostly irrelevant to anything that actually happened. Perhaps it was a good thing. In May last year, for example, I met with a co-evil in a Collins Street coffee shop. He turned up with a black notebook containing a list of Geelong players’ names. We reached agreement on those who should be delisted. Six of them are playing in tomorrow’s grand final. They are a strange lot, the Cats Liberation Front, not beyond the fringe, but on it. There’s an actor who can keep a lunch table laughing for hours and becomes as serious as Hamlet when the football is discussed. Only last week another fringe dweller said he wanted to meet and discuss tactics before the final. This man, I thought, is deranged. But it’s catching, and I met him. I can’t help wondering if other teams have people like this. Or is it all a result of long suffering in the wilderness? Geelong now is, of course, a strong club with healthy finances, a professional football department and a good player list. It’s the best Geelong team I can remember. It should win. There’ll be a bunch of cheering fringe dwellers there to watch it, unless someone locks us out. That piece says everything about John Button’s wit, about his love of the Geelong Football Club, about his intelligence and about his wonderful ability to write. I last saw John Button-and indeed the last time. I saw James-at the grand final. John and James were sitting next to each other, father and son, participating in a ritual that they had done over decades and I was quite near them. On this occasion I was sitting with my son Sam. MAIN COMMITTEE It was an incredibly special day for me. It was an incredibly special day for the Buttons. I spoke with James afterwards and I spoke with John. His eyes were failing during the grand final-he did not see it all-but he absolutely understood what was going on. My greatest joy on that day, amongst all the joys of Geelong winning that grand final, was experiencing it with my 11-year-old son. Without a doubt, James Button’s greatest joy, amongst all the emotions of Geelong winning a flag after 44 years, was being there with his father. Now looking back at it and seeing what has happened since, how significant and how wonderful it was that John Button got to see that event. But of course it ultimately was a prelude to a far more significant event that John Button got to see which occurred in November last year-Labor being elected to power once more. With all his passion for Labor governments it would have meant everything to John to see that, much more in fact even than to see Geelong winning the flag. My thoughts very much go to John’s family-to Joan, to Nick and in particular to James, as I know James. There is unquestionably grief and sadness with John’s passing, but there must also be comfort that John left this earth with Labor back in government, with Geelong as the reigning premiers and with the knowledge that everything was right with the world. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places. Honourable members having stood in their placesThat further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLES OF FIRE SUPPORT BASES CORAL AND Debate resumed from 13 May. this matter, I do so in the sense that we have had a very successful reception given for those who fought in the battles of Coral and Balmoral. We have also had a very important commemorative service at the Vietnam Memorial for 3RAR as well as for Coral and Balmoral. There has been a general awakening of thought and the need to remember and put into context the fine service given by Australian soldiers fighting in the battles of Vietnam. We have heard how badly our men were treated when they came back from fighting in Vietnam and yet the intensity, malice and vitriol of those people who denigrated them and their families during the Vietnam WarI think also need to be revisited to understand exactly what it was that those men and women went through. It is also important to put in context the battles of Coral and Balmoral as fire support bases and perhaps to revisit the Tet offensive of 1968 and Operation Thoan Thang (Complete Victory) from April to June of 1968, of which Coral and Balmoral were a part. The Tet offensive was the aspiration of the North Vietnamese to, in their terms, ‘liberate South Vietnam’ with uprisings all over South Vietnam, with the intention of winning the war.

344,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (8.04 Pm),"On indulgence: in rising to speak onPart of that Tet offensive was the battle of Hue, where an incredible massacre by the Viet Cong took place of the people who lived in Hue. Hue was a city where intellectuals lived and there was a real understanding of what democracy was about. I am most grateful to be one of many people reading Vietnam, the Australian War by Paul Ham, which puts into context and explains so many of the things that happened. Paul Ham wrote of that battle: The massacre of some 6,000 inhabitants of Hue who were the educated citizens who were chosen for death by shooting, clubbing, bayoneting or being buried alive because they were educated and middleclass and they would not capitulate to the North Vietnamese. Paul Ham’s book says: The massacre fulfilled the letter of the Liberation Front directive of 2 December 1965 sent to regional and district commissars, party and political training schools and said in areas temporarily under enemy control, ‘We are to exterminate key and dangerous elements of such parties as the Vietnamese Nationalist Party.’ Sentiments perhaps reminiscent of Pol Pot and his killing fields, but the barbarity of the attack on the people of Hue was not reported in the Western press. They were much more interested in reporting against our troops and against our people. The stories that I have heard since, with people coming together, tell how wives living at Holsworthy would not be served by shopkeepers in Liverpool because their husbands were serving in Vietnam. Children were singled out for bullying in the playground because their father was serving in Vietnam. One story told of a soldier who had died of appalling wounds and whose parents were rung up by an anti-Vietnam demonstrator. Speaking to this person’s parents, they said, ‘He got what he deserved.’ Their home was then daubed with red paint. These are truly shameful incidents that occurred and have been pushed back in memory. But if we are truly to acknowledge the service and sacrifice of the men and women who served in Vietnam then we must revisit the malice and vitriol that was around at that time. The Tet offensive was unsuccessful for the North Vietnamese. Something like 45,000 Vietcong lost their lives. But the TV coverage of the Tet offensive sent a message that preached against the actions of those opposed to North Vietnam and the Vietcong. The result was that President Johnson announced on 31 March 1968 that he would not seek re-election and that he would stop the bombing of North Vietnam and negotiate with Hanoi. General Westmoreland’s departure to the US was announced. He was being kicked upstairs, as the jargon went. Hanoi was buoyed by the failure of nerve, and the People’s Army troops poured into South Vietnam. On 13 May, the communist leaders agreed to begin the so-called peace negotiations in Paris, which coincided with an escalation of the war. Hanoi saw the West’s weakness and they launched a mini Tet offensive. Contemporaneously with the announcement of peace talks was the beginning of Coral and Balmoral. Australia’s General Macdonald agreed to send two Australian battalions, the 1st and 3rd, to support the defence of Saigon. Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Bennett and Lieutenant Colonel Jim Shelton were the respective battalion commanders, two very esteemed gentlemen-soldiers; brave. The Australians were under American command and were tasked to block enemy withdrawals and reinforcements from Saigon. They were to be dropped into country rife with enemy and were meant to lure the enemy into the open. ‘Surfers’ was the codename they gave to the area around Bin Hoa, which they further divided into areas called Bondi, Newport and MAIN COMMITTEE Manly. They had to establish a fire support patrol base, which they called Coral, named after an Australian officer’s girlfriend. The aim was to protect the weapons system and armoured operations in the area of operations. On the night of 12 May, initial contact was made with the North Vietnamese army, who all day had been observing them being dropped in by helicopter. The North Vietnamese struck with full force at 3.30 pm, but the Australians’ training kicked in. I would like to read an extract from Paul Ham’s book. He says: Both sides fought like threshing machines. ‘The enemy withdrew under devastating firepower and was severely mauled,’ said Bennett the next morning. The gunships and fighters, the bravery of the Australian mortar and artillerymen and the effective operation of the 1st Battalion command post, notably the fire support control centre, had saved the base from being completely overrun. The ashen-faced Australian survivors rested amid the shambles, many in a state of shock. The wounded were airlifted to Vung Tau, and Staff Sergeant Terry Loftus packed the personal effects of the dead for dispatch to Australia. Somewhere in the jungle, hundreds of North Vietnamese soldiers dragged their comrades to makeshift field hospitals and the strange mournful utter of the battlefield subdued into birdless silence. On the earth before Coral lay hundreds of pairs of Ho Chi Minh sandals. Fifty-two North Vietnamese army bodies were recovered and buried in a mass grave. Private Dick Nordon, whose action prompted Sir Rodon Cutler VC to remark quietly when decorating him, ‘I do not know what one has to do these days to win a Victoria Cross.’ He was caught in an ambush. Nordon had rushed forward under covering fire to retrieve two Australian wounded. His section commander and forward scout shot 20 metres ahead. As he ran, Nordon himself was wounded. He shot a Vietnamese soldier then, out of ammunition, grabbed the dead man’s rifle and continued firing until he reached his section commander, whom he dragged to safety. Nordon then raced forward again under fire and reached the now dead Australian scout, whose corpse the Vietcong rifleman was using as a shield. Nordon killed this soldier, returned to his section, ran forward a third time with grenades and cleared the area so that the scout’s body could be retrieved. Nordon single-handedly saved his section commander’s life and reversed the enemy’s advantage with complete disregard for his own safety. The men who fought for Australia in Vietnam were proud, courageous and endowed with the ANZAC spirit. Balmoral was the name given to the second fire support base in the Newport area near the village of Bingmei. It was another tethered goat strategy-that is, designed to lure the enemy out into the open. Lieutenant Jim Sheldon of the 3rd Battalion was chosen for this second base. He made two very important decisions: firstly, he welcomed Australian centurion tank support; and, secondly, instead of flying in his battalion for the North Vietnamese Army to observe, he sent them in quietly on foot. He also had an innovation that was called Sheldon’s Mortar Marauders. He had armed personnel carriers mounted with mortars, which did short tours around so they would think that was all they had. The Australian destroyed at least fourteen bunker systems in the first encounter and they thought they had pretty well succeeded, but on the 28th of May the North Vietnamese Army returned to Balmoral. Again, I read from Paul Ham’s book: For fifteen minutes they mortared the base with frightful accuracy thanks to the courage of their nocturnal scouts, who crept up and captured the distance with lengths of string. Then in an exact replica of an early attack, only bigger, at least 800 North Vietnamese threw themselves on the tethered goat. As foolish as they were courageous, the attacks were suicidal, reminiscent of Japanese determined-to-die units. Perhaps the Vietnamese were drugged, some wounded. Those who reached the wire met a hail of canister and rifle fire and fell chiefly at the feet of Major Peter Phillips’ company, who withstood the brunt of both attacks for which Phillips’ leadership earned him a Military Cross. Some corpses hung on the wire until dawn. MAIN COMMITTEE An examination of the North Vietnamese bodies revealed that they were boys aged 15 to 17. The Australians were fighting an army of teenagers and the destruction of so many lives disturbed many Australian soldiers. ‘To waste all that young manpower seemed to be criminal,’ said Major Peter Phillips afterwards. ‘It is a measure I guess of Hanoi’s skill that they were able to indoctrinate these young kids. I never saw the grey eminences who were directing them. We only saw the young kids.’ It was a fearful war. It was a disgraceful reaction when the people of Australia let those men down. When the welcome home parade happened so many decades too late, some of the damage that we had done was rectified. We still owe those men and women a great apology. We owe them thanks for the courage and for wearing the uniform of which they were proud and of which I can say we must all be truly proud. They gave of themselves, as indeed any soldier has ever given in any war that this nation of ours has been involved in. The battles of Coral and Balmoral are important to learn about and to know about, because they again give our young people and the coming generations more information about the sorts of things that they had to endure. But it needs always to be seen in context. It needs to be seen in the context that we, as a people, let them down at that time-as did the politicians of that time. Now we have an opportunity to make some of that up. Now we have the opportunity to do some things right that will help those people ease their pain. The scars that were left have been endured quietly by so many for so long. Perhaps having statements like these will help assuage the pain. We must never forget that they were fine, proud soldiers who served our country well. acknowledge the courage and the service of those who fought and those who fought and died in the battles of fire support bases Coral and Balmoral. I note that the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs and also the Prime Minister went through quite a bit of the detail of what actually occurred in those events of some 40 years ago, so I will not go back over that detail on this occasion. I join with them in acknowledging the fact that these men brought great credit to their units, their mates and their country through their service at that time. As others have said-and it ought to be acknowledged yet again-it was in the very best spirit of the ANZACs over the last century and there is no doubt that they can proudly hold their heads high for the way they performed under fire so many years ago. The shadow minister and others mentioned a bit of the history of the time. There is no doubt that, to an extent, that colours the memory of many of what occurred on the home front back in the sixties and early seventies. It was a turbulent time. It was a time when Australia and America in particular were coping with the first televised war, and there is no doubt about it: neither country did their fighting men proud in the way in which they responded to the circumstances of that time. As I said earlier, these Australian men served their country in the very best spirit of the ANZAC tradition and we owe them our respect and our gratitude. They were prepared to do what needed to be done at that time on the instructions of those whom they represented, the Australian people as represented by the governments of the day. In that they are as every other soldier has been in serving on behalf of our country over the last century. When we bid farewell to troops today, to those going to Afghanistan, Iraq, East Timor or the Solomon Islands, we always honour their service and respect their performance. We know that they will do a great job for their country. As we farewell them they always go with our MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Balmoral
345,Mr Griffin (Bruce,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs) (8.20 pm)-I too stand tonight toblessing-as it should have been at the time of which I speak-and when they return it is with our blessing and our acknowledgement of their service. The reaction at the time of which I speak was unfortunate and disgraceful in many respects. I was 12 years old when the Australian commitment to Vietnam ended. I have seen some of the TV footage, but my memories extend not much further than that. But I know that what happened did cut to the quick many of those who served and that it is still an issue that they deal with even today. Among the things that have been most important to me in my job as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and when previously serving as the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs-and I note the presence in the chamber of a former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Danna Vale, and the current shadow minister-are the personal stories of what people went through and their insights into the circumstances at that time. These stories have been told by people in conflicts from World War II right through to Vietnam and to Iraq and Afghanistan today. Getting an insight into that personal experience has been very significant in gaining some understanding of what they went through. Having dealt with many veterans of CoralBalmoral in the last couple of weeks, I have memories that I will treasure over the yearsunderstanding individual acts of bravery, understanding the terrible loss felt by family members who lost loved ones and by comrades who lost mates, getting a sense of the small things, which in fact mean so much when one is under fire. I have never been in that situation; I do not think I ever will be. But I pay tribute to those who were. Over the last couple of weeks, it has been an immense privilege for me as minister to be a small part of what they have been going through, to share aspects of what they went through so long ago, to have a few beers and to hear them tell a few stories about each other in a very blokey fashion, as is the Australian way, but in a manner which shows their enduring respect for each other in a very diggerlike fashion. I think it has also been clear to many of them that what has occurred over the last week has been part of a healing experience. I have had individuals come to me and say: ‘This has taken 40 years. I haven’t been to a reunion in all that time, and this has been very special to me.’ I have had blokes come to me and say: ‘I wasn’t going to come. Bloody hell, I’m glad that I did.’ I have had people say to me, ‘The acknowledgements that we have received in recent times have’-as I think the shadow minister referred to-‘been part of moving me along a journey towards coming to terms with aspects of what did take place so long ago.’ There was certainly a huge crowd at the reception in the Great Hall. I was talking to the secretary of my department several days beforehand, and he said, ‘I think we are going to need a bigger hall.’ I will not use the exact words I used in response, other than to say that I said: ‘I don’t think we have got one. You’d better open the foyer.’ It was a huge crowd, bigger than the crowd at the commemoration of Long Tan a couple of years ago. There were more people at Coral-Balmoral and there was also a higher acceptance rate. On that night, the diggers did themselves and their families proud in the way they conducted themselves. I got a real sense from the group that although it was, to an extent, a solemn occasion, at the same time it was also a very proud occasion. There were plenty of laughs and quite a few beers, and a good time was had in circumstances which I know for many of them were very tense. The next day at the Vietnam veterans memorial there was a more solemn service. Again, it was done with great dignity and with great respect, with the emphasis on those who had lost their lives so long ago. MAIN COMMITTEE I also had the honour of representing the government at the 102 Field Battery remembrance service at Duntroon. It was very quirky, and I have now learnt that is the way gunners tend to behave. Some excellent words were employed by the speakers, involving things like asking the younger artillerymen to tell the older artillerymen when guns went off, because it is the nature of artillery that you do not tend to know, particularly as years go by and hearing degrades. I then had the honour of going to Townsville, attending the 1RAR dawn service at the barracks and the dinner that they had that night. Again, they were great occasions, quirky in their own way. It was certainly a great honour to share that time with them and to talk to some of the more recent diggers who have been serving our country overseas. It gave a real sense that this was cross-generational in terms of the circumstances of service, and that in itself was also special. I shared some time with the shadow minister last Sunday at the 3RAR memorial service at the Vietnam vets memorial, where the focus was on Balmoral, in particular, and what occurred throughout their tour of duty. They had performed with honour on a number of occasions-in the Tet offensive, as was mentioned earlier, in Operation Pinnaroo, in CoralBalmoral and in other engagements as well. As I mentioned earlier, the sense that I got was of men who had done their country proud but whose country had not recognised that to the extent that it should have in the years gone by. I certainly join with the shadow minister, as I have on previous occasions on these matters, in apologising for the way they were treated-as much as I can apologise in the circumstances for what occurred at a time before I served in this parliament. We have to ensure that this never occurs again to our fighting men and women. I have to say that I do not have much doubt about that. I think that the country took a long time to learn from what occurred back then, but I think it has learnt and I do not think we will ever see that situation again. I would certainly see it with dread. I will end with some of the positive comments that I have been very pleased to receive on behalf of the parliament in a bipartisan fashion about what has occurred with these commemorations. I received an email recently from one of the key organisers, Garry Prendergast. I certainly want to congratulate him, Don Tait and the rest of the committee of veterans who organised what occurred, with the assistance of DVA. I am on the record saying this and I will say it again: organising Vietnam veterans is very much like herding cats. The fact that these guys did it without injuries I found quite amazing and to their credit. But, having spent a bit of time with these blokes, I can understand how they managed to do it. The email from Garry reads as follows: G’day Allan, Let me say again, Your DVA Staff did a magnificent job in assisting our 40th Anniversary Committee and my Townsville team in particular to make the Anniversary week such a memorable event for all the diggers and their partners that attended. The feedback is terrific. I really mean that. Every one of your staff who were involved need to see that their efforts were important and very much appreciated. From the people helping at the entrance to Parliament House and at the Memorial, to the publication editors/producers for the Booklet and the Invites, to the staff on the end of the DVA phone and all the MAIN COMMITTEE principal players like Bill Rolfe, Kerry, Richard, Ian, Susan, Kylie and JimD plus Allison and Glenda in Townsville, they were so co-operative, helpful and diligent. I know they worked long hours at times and it showed in the quality of the results of their work. I was especially pleased that you were able to come to Townsville and see the “1 Bn grunts” do our thing. I hope you enjoyed our unique Dawn Service and the Dinner function ... and I appreciated spending some of the time chatting with you. Last but not least, thank you for the DVA financial support. It was definitely needed. Cheers ... Pepe. Garry Prendergast Co-Chair of the 40th Anniversary Committee. To all those involved: congratulations on a job well done. I mean that with respect to those who organised these events on this occasion, be they veterans or DVA staff, but particularly all those involved in what happened so many years ago and who have been dealing with the issues that they came away with over the last 40 years. You brought credit upon your country then and you certainly brought credit upon your country over the last couple of weeks. It was a great honour and a privilege to spend some time with them at this very special time for them. As I also said in an email recently to a vet, ‘There are times when this job is a complete pain, but there is no doubt that events like this and the opportunity to spend time with veterans who have done our country proud is something that makes it all very much worthwhile.’ Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. tion Amendment (1999 Montreal Convention and Other Measures) Bill 2008 will modernise Australia’s arrangements for air carriers’ liability. It will do this by implementing the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air done at Montreal on 28 May 1999, known as the Montreal convention. The bill also makes some amendments to modernise and update various legislative provisions relating to the scope of carriers’ liability. Under the Warsaw convention, carriers were not liable for the death or injury of a passenger or for damage to air cargo if they could prove that they took all necessary measures to avoid the loss. It also capped carriers’ liability at a rate which is now out of date, unreasonably low and set in a currency which no longer exists. Different parties to the Warsaw convention subsequently adopted a variety of amending instruments, resulting in a complex and confusing array of international arrangements for carrier liability. The Montreal convention is designed to overhaul this system and eventually replace the Warsaw convention. It introduces a two-tier system of liability for death or injury. The first tier, for damages up to approximately A$190,000, is on the basis of no-fault liability and cannot be reduced except in the event of contributory negligence by the passenger. For the second MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Balmoral
346,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (8.34 pm)-The Civil Aviation Legislatier, for damages exceeding this threshold, the carrier is liable unless it can demonstrate that the damage was not due to its negligence or that of its agents. Effectively, the Montreal convention increases the compensation limits for victims of air accidents. It also sets the monetary unit of compensation as the SDR, the special drawing right, of the IMF rather than the long abandoned gold standard and provides for the periodic review of compensation to take account of inflation. It will also enable Australians to bring legal action in Australia rather than in the country where the air accident occurred, and it modernises the list of family members who are entitled to seek compensation in the event of death in an air accident. The Montreal convention will also ease the burden on air shipping companies by removing the need for paper based waybills for air cargo and allowing them to use electronic means to keep track of shipments. The Montreal convention was concluded in May 1999. It combines the various provisions of the previous Warsaw system arrangements into a single package. It entered into force in November 2003. The Department of Transport and Regional Services issued a discussion paper in January 2001 seeking input on whether or not Australia should accede to the Montreal convention. The Montreal Convention Treaty was tabled in the Senate, along with a national interest analysis, on 4 August 2004. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties published a report shortly thereafter which concluded that Australia should accede to the Montreal convention and that it would not have any detriment to Australia. The department of transport also issued a discussion paper in 2005 reviewing the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act in light of the decision by the Australian government to accede to the Montreal convention and proposing amendments to Australian law that would have had the same effect as the legislation currently proposed by the government. Effectively, the previous coalition government had already decided to accede to the Montreal convention and this is the next step in amending the law in such a way as to put that accession into force. This legislation, therefore, is implementing a convention for which there is bipartisan support. It has gone through the proper processes of the parliament, including consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and it is therefore appropriate that it be brought here for the parliament to take this next step in implementation. My office has discussed the content of this particular bill with the Australian aviation industry. Qantas and Virgin, our international carriers, have indicated their support. The domestic carriers are not opposed, but then again this legislation does not affect them as it involves only international carriers. It is clear that this convention enjoys the support not just of the industry but also of aviation customers in Australia. It is not expected that the Australian air carriers would face higher costs, as most carriers operating in Australia voluntarily subject themselves to higher liability limits than those that currently apply under the Warsaw convention. Carriers, particularly the cargo freight industry, are also expected to benefit from the simplification of the documentation procedures which are provided for in this legislation. The opposition is more than happy to support this legislation. As I indicated, it is a carry over from work that had been begun by the previous government. I think it is high time that Australia became a full partner to this convention. Most of our OECD colleagues have alMAIN COMMITTEE ready joined it. Most of the countries to which Australian airlines fly are a party to it. It is therefore appropriate that Australia should also accede to the Montreal convention. Australia) (8.40 pm)-I rise to speak this evening about why we need to pass the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (1999 Montreal Convention and Other Measures) Bill 2008. It is bipartisan, it is long overdue and it is about change. It is about problems with the old system and the solutions that are offered by this legislation. At the moment, international air travel is usually covered by the Warsaw convention and its amending protocols and treaties. There are two major problems with the Warsaw system. These problems highlight why the implementation of the Montreal convention is so important. The first problem goes to the core assumptions behind the Warsaw system: they are old and outdated. The Warsaw convention dates back to 1929, when the aviation industry had yet to take off as a viable alternative to road, rail and shipping. It was an era when the safety and reliability of air travel had yet to be proved. These were the days of great aviators such as Charles Kingsford Smith and Bert Hinkler and aviatrixes such as Amelia Earhart and Lores Bonney. This was a time of adventure, of testing and breaking records, not a time when aviation was a serious and trusted alternative to traditional modes of transport. Just two years before Warsaw was signed, Charles Lindbergh was the first pilot to fly nonstop from New York to Paris in his single seat, single engine monoplane the Spirit of St Louis. The year 1928 saw a number of significant developments in terms of Australian aviation records. Bert Hinkler in February completed the first solo flight from England to Australia, arriving in Darwin after 15 days, two hours and 15 minutes. Charles Kingsford Smith in the Southern Cross flew across the Pacific from America to Australia. And 1928 also saw a modified Qantas aircraft, fitted with two stretchers, conduct the inaugural flight of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The Warsaw convention was even before the days of airline hosts and hostesses. In May 1930, Boeing hired the first-ever airline hostess. These were the days of plywood covered fuselages and fabric covered surfaces. This was a long time before regular international air services reached Australian shores. It was not until the 1930s that Qantas began to move into international passenger services. Back then, the thinking was that in order to encourage the industry to develop and flourish it needed protection from large compensation payouts. The industry could not have grown if airlines were bankrupted every time there was an accident. With this in mind, the drafters of the Warsaw convention put a cap on the amount of compensation that airlines had to pay. The trade-off for passengers has been that, although the amount of compensation is capped under Warsaw, liability is usually strict-that is, fault of the airlines does not have to be proved, making court cases a lot easier for victims. This cap, still in place today, has not been adjusted for inflation and has been set in franc Poincare, a currency that no longer exists. The franc Poincare was a unit of account used in the international regulation of liability and it was defined as 65.5 milligrams of gold, with a millesimal fineness of 0.900. It was identical in value to the French franc, although it has not been so since, and of course the franc has now been replaced by the euro. As I said, this is an old and outdated convention. Australia signed the Warsaw convention on 12 October 1929, only two weeks before Black Thursday and the beginning of the stock market crash. These were times of great economic uncertainty and using a gold standard was a way of ensuring stability for the airline industry. MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment 1999 Montreal Convention And Other Measures Bill 2008
347,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and NorthernThe liability cap under the Warsaw convention is 125,000 francs Poincare. There is legal uncertainty as to how this amount is converted to Australian dollars. However, the cap could be as low as A$16,000 to A$20,000. A number of nation states have also implemented other supplementary arrangements in their domestic laws. As a result, there are significant variations in the law governing air carriers’ liability. This lack of uniformity means that relatives of passengers who are killed in the same aircraft accident may receive vastly different amounts of compensation. In the year ended June 2007, 22,138,000 passengers travelled on international flights to or from Australia. Times have definitely changed from the 1920s, when there were fewer than 100 planes registered in Australia. Aviation now ranks among the safest travel modes. These days, if airlines go bust because they keep having accidents then perhaps that is not such a bad thing. That is not likely to happen in Australia in the light of our stringent safety regime and our system of compulsory non-voidable insurance. Nevertheless, the time has well and truly arrived for our liability arrangements to properly reflect the commercial and safety realities. And this is what the Montreal convention will do by making airlines potentially liable for every last dollar of damage caused to airline passengers. The second problem with the Warsaw system is that it is extraordinarily complicated and confusing. The convention has been amended on a piecemeal basis over the years by a number of protocols and conventions. As well as the original 1929 agreement, there is the Hague protocol, the Guadalajara convention, the Guatemala City protocol, Montreal protocols Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4, plus a host of voluntary airline agreements that operate within the Warsaw framework. Different countries have adopted different instruments, leading to a complex morass of interlocking agreements. All these different instruments bring variations not only to the liability caps but also to the different rules relating to the liability of codeshare partners. In which country may a victim seek a court case? How long does a victim have in which to bring a claim to court? Which defences are available to the airline? Imagine, for a moment, an airline tragedy involving the crash of a wide-body jet, in which 400 people from around the globe perish. Each passenger could have booked through any one of a host of codeshare airlines and each passenger could have been ultimately travelling to a different final destination. Although the voluntary airline agreements may apply so that the liability caps are waived, these agreements do not deal with issues such as who can be sued, where they can be sued and how long people can wait before bringing an action, and they may not deal with which defences are available to the airline. As can be seen, vastly different compensation arrangements may apply to victims of the same accident. Not only is this system exceedingly complicated; it is simply unfair. Korean Air Lines flight 007-also known as KAL-007-was a civilian airliner shot down by Soviet jet interceptors on 1 September 1983, north of Japan. A total of 269 passengers and crew, including US congressman Lawrence McDonald, were aboard KAL-007 when it went down in the Sakhalin Sea. There were no known survivors. A six-person jury decided that the KAL-007 crew was guilty of criminal negligence in deviating from the prescribed flight path. Such a decision, from a practical viewpoint, meant that the victims’ families could sue the South Korean company for any sum the courts agree to award them. MAIN COMMITTEE Pan Am flight 103 was Pan American World Airways’ third daily scheduled transatlantic flight from London’s Heathrow International Airport to New York’s JFK International Airport on Wednesday, 21 December 1988. The aircraft flying this route-a Boeing 747 named Clipper Maid of the Seas-was destroyed by a bomb. The remains landed in and around the town of Lockerbie, in southern Scotland, killing not only those on board but also people on the ground. Following the Pan Am 103 disaster, Pan American Airlines was found liable for wilful misconduct by failing to prevent a bomb from being smuggled aboard flight 103 and thus the victims were allowed to claim above the Warsaw limit. The Warsaw system, with its limited liability, forced the families of the victims to seek compensation through a traumatic and unnecessarily lengthy trial process. Warsaw was about the protection of airlines from the risks inherent in the industry, but it was also a financial deal that allowed limited liability in exchange for a strict set of benefits. In the tragic circumstances of losing a family member in an airline accident, a family could get justice-not a lot of justice, but some. The Montreal convention aims to be a fresh start. Implementation of the convention will make it easier for Australians to seek fair and timely compensation, representing a big step forward in passenger and consumer protection. It will also be good for business by cutting the time consuming paperwork that is currently associated with passenger and cargo transportation, clearing the way for modern electronic billing systems. There is international consensus that the convention represents a positive development. The Warsaw system will still operate in circumstances where countries have not implemented the Montreal convention, but hopefully this will soon become the exception rather than the rule. Our aviation partners are implementing the Montreal convention widely and rapidly. The convention was negotiated in 1999 and came into force on 4 November 2003, and already 86 countries are party to it. There is a clear need to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of international agreements on civil aviation. This point hit home for me after a discussion with a home owner in my constituency, Sam Morton. On9 September 2004, three Australians on a tourist flight in Zambia died in a tragic plane crash-Sam’s daughter, Justine Watters; her husband, Matt; and her mother-in-law, Shirley. The investigation conducted by the Zambian civil aviation authorities found the cause of the accident to be the loss in flight of the propeller due to failings in the maintenance of the plane. For us, as regular travellers over this vast country of ours, this is a scary thing to even contemplate. The plane in question, a Cessna 210, registered in South Africa as ZS-KOX, was maintained by NelAir Engineering. Subsequent investigations by the South African Civil Aviation Authority found probable cause that NelAir Engineering was responsible for the crash. NelAir Engineering carried out a mandatory periodic inspection only 19 days before the accident. Through the South African CAA investigation, it was found that the cause of the accident was the in-flight detachment of the propeller from the aircraft as a result of: improper torque of the propeller studs; failure to wire lock the studs that allowed the studs to back out of the propeller hub assembly, resulting in the separation of the propeller; failure to follow correct propeller installation procedures; and failure to use identifiable manufacturer approved parts. I am advised that NelAir Engineering’s air maintenance operator’s licence was suspended by the South African Civil Aviation Authority in November 2006, with cancellation to occur within 30 days and to remain effective until such time as any court challenge was heard and a MAIN COMMITTEE relevant decision made. I am not aware of any court action but I understand that the AMO licence was reissued to NelAir on or about 27 September 2007. The latest advice I have is that NelAir’s AMO licence has again been suspended with an intention to cancel the licence. The South African Director of Aviation, in the Department of Transport, advised the Australian High Commission that the department was seeking legal advice with a view to referring the crash to the Department of Justice to determine whether criminal charges could be laid. This process has been terribly disappointing to the loved ones of those who died in the accident. They know that nothing will bring them back, but someone should be held accountable and something needs to be done to ensure that an accident of this nature does not occur again. While this is disappointing for the family who have so tragically lost family members, there have been changes made to ensure that our own practices are better in such situations. When the crash occurred, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received notification of the accident and worked with the families involved to repatriate the bodies. What did not happen was communication between DFAT and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. In fact, it was 12 months before ATSB became aware of the accident. ATSB investigators were not given the opportunity to assist the investigation carried out by Zambian and South African authorities. This incident highlighted the need for greater communication between Australian government agencies. DFAT’s consular services have now strengthened their relationship with ATSB and will in future ensure that communication occurs when consular officials become aware of a transport accident involving injuries to Australian citizens abroad. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his department’s new policy of informing the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and in particular the ATSB, of all overseas accidents. The ATSB can then provide the families of victims with any information on the progress of an investigation, explain technical issues that may be confusing for the layperson and obtain a copy of the investigation report for the families at the earliest time after its release. This is not a difficult thing and I find it surprising that such a communication process was not already well established. It is also surprising that it has taken so long to put the Montreal convention into practice in this country. It is essential that Australia implement the convention without further delay. It is also essential for us as a nation of travellers to ensure the rights of travellers are supported by our government and the department of foreign affairs. It is useless signing international treaties if we do not make them work. Australian families have been exposed to inadequate carriers’ liability arrangements for too long. Implementation of the Montreal convention is essential if they are to get a fair go after an airline tragedy. I commend the bill to the House. tion Legislation Amendment (1999 Montreal Convention and Other Measures) Bill 2008 because, like the member for Brand, the constituent and the other family members lived in my electorate. The progress we have made is, I think, very important. Airline travel has become fast and a preferred mode of travel for people across the globe, with thousands of traffic movements every day in diverse parts of the world. Airline partners are a common feature of international travel, introducing complexities that were not foreseen in the past. Airline travel is considered safe, but accidents do happen. In the 1920s the Warsaw convention was established to ensure a secure future for the airline industry. The convention is superseded by the Montreal convention of 1999, which is designed to modernise arrangeMAIN COMMITTEE",183,Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment 1999 Montreal Convention And Other Measures Bill 2008
348,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (8.56 Pm),"It is important for me also to speak on the Civil Aviaments for the liability of international carriers with a uniform code for international air carrier liability. There is no doubt that modern aviation has outgrown the old Warsaw convention, which had at its core the principle that carriers are not liable for the death or injury of a passenger, or for damage to air cargo, if they can prove that they took all necessary steps to avoid loss. In addition, it capped the liability rate, which was set in a currency no longer used in the modern world. Like so many of these conventions and legislative instruments, amendments flowed over the years, making the Warsaw convention clumsy and unworkable, with a confusing array of international arrangements. The Montreal convention will overhaul the system of liability and damages that may flow and will eventually replace the Warsaw convention entirely. The Montreal convention is a two-tiered system of liability for death or injury. The first tier is for damages up to approximately A$190,000 based on no-fault liability and cannot be reduced except in the event of contributory negligence by the passenger. The second tier is for damages exceeding this threshold where the carrier is liable unless it can demonstrate that the damage was not due to its negligence or that of its agents. Effectively, this convention increases the compensation limits for victims of air accidents, sets the monetary unit of compensation as the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund rather than the long-abandoned gold standard and provides for the periodic review of compensation to take account of inflation. It will allow Australians to bring legal action in Australia rather than in the country where the accident occurred. Most of the countries with which Australia shares major international air routes, including New Zealand, the United States, Europe and Japan, have already signed the Montreal convention. Qantas and Virgin airlines have both indicated their support for the legislation. The Howard government conducted appropriate rounds of consultations with relevant parties, and a uniformly positive response was received. It appears that Australian airline carriers will not face higher costs as they already subject themselves to a higher liability limit than those that currently exist under the Warsaw convention. It is anticipated that the cargo and freight industry will benefit, though, from simplified documentation procedures. On that basis, the previous government had proposed that Australia should agree to the Montreal protocol, and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties supported that decision in a report in 2005. In these times of fast global travel it is important that we have strong protocols dealing with adverse events. In the event of a serious air accident resulting in passenger deaths, grieving relatives and friends should not have to be dragged through protracted legal proceedings across a multitude of international boundaries. Of course, that brings me to the issue confronting my constituent. It is very fresh in my mind, although this matter has gone on for several years. I have been assisting my constituent, Mr Sam Morton, who lost three family members in an air crash in Zambia. In the crash, Mr Morton and his wife lost their daughter, Justine; her husband, Matt; and Matt’s mother. The tragedy has had a devastating impact on the families. The trauma has been added to by long, protracted investigations. That process has been arduous indeed for Sam Morton, who, from the time of the crash, not only undertook to retrieve the bodies of his own family members but as well attended the arrangements for British and Canadian families who also had lost their loved ones in the crash. MAIN COMMITTEE Determined to leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of what caused the crash, Mr Morton has pursued the case relentlessly, seeking answers from not only our own authorities but also the Zambian and South African authorities, and has frequently travelled at his own expense to these countries to try to progress those investigations. Mindful of the grief of all the families as well as his own personal grief, as I said, Sam Morton has constantly liaised with the other families and travelled numerous times to the African continent to do all that he can to make sure that others do not have to suffer due to negligence. The member for Brand has clearly detailed the crash investigations, and I do not therefore propose to prolong my contribution by going over the same ground. Needless to say, the report makes for sobering reading. However, I do want to acknowledge the contribution of the Australian high commission staff and the high commissioner to South Africa, Philip Green, who, when Mr Morton encountered many roadblocks, did everything possible to clear the way and assist Mr Morton to take his well-founded concerns to the South African authorities. Travelling to South Africa as leader of the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation in 2006, I had great assistance from the high commissioner, Mr Green, and his staff, as they facilitated meetings with members of the South African parliament for me and other members of our delegation as well as a phone hook-up for me to speak to the adviser to the South African transport minister. This gave me a chance to raise first hand the issues on behalf of Mr Morton. Despite the crash taking place in 2004, Mr Morton and the other families still do not have closure on this matter. Discussions with the South African authorities continue, and we hope that for the families affected by this disaster a satisfactory conclusion is reached sooner rather than later. This case has resulted in some procedural changes between DFAT and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is welcome, and I acknowledge the assistance and responsiveness of staff in both agencies. Through Mr Morton’s representations to me and to the member for Brand, the department has initiated an effective line of communication with the ATSB, and I thank both the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo, and the current Minister for Foreign Affairs for facilitating those changes. This will result in far better communication in future with families faced with these kinds of circumstances. We can thank also Mr Morton for his determination to ensure that other families do not have their grief added to by unnecessary complexities. Given the fast pace of change and the growing global movement of people and freight, I am pleased to be supporting this bill. It is important that parliaments be responsive to the need for change and to ensure that compensation available to injured passengers is equitable. islation Amendment (1999 Montreal Convention and Other Measures) Bill 2008. This bill is important because it is about offering greater protection for Australians travelling abroad. The Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air deals with international air carrier liability for the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo. It spells out an air carrier’s liability for injury or death of a passenger. My next-door neighbour, an in-flight services manager for an airline, says that it does happen, that deaths do occur not infrequently. Often he or she-I do not want to name him or her-has had to counsel flight attendants and it is a very traumatic experience when it does happen. It is easy to talk about it here, but the reality is that deaths do occur. Obviously with an ageing population, MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment 1999 Montreal Convention And Other Measures Bill 2008
349,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (9.05 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Civil Aviation Lega wealthy population, and with baby boomers more of us will be flying. While there are requirements about having medical certificates to fly, obviously every now and then people get it wrong and deaths occur. This is a very timely piece of legislation. As I said, it spells out an air carrier’s liability for the injury or death of a passenger, the loss or damage of luggage and damages caused by arrival delays which occur in the course of international travel. The convention was agreed to on 28 May 1999. I asked one of my youngest staff members if they could remember that date. The years blur a bit for me. I am in my 40s, but a younger member could definitely remember May 1999 because it was Kylie Minogue’s 31st birthday-my staffer was still in school. I think Kylie Minogue will be 40 tomorrow. That gives you an idea of when this convention was first agreed to. Happy birthday to Kylie Minogue from Parliament House here in Canberra and a special thank you from me for those gold hotpants! What else was going on back in 1999? Take your mind back. The average city retail price for unleaded petrol was 80.4c per litre. It is great to be able to mention the word ‘petrol’ and not have a chorus of voices in this House at the moment. The average price for a house was $200,000. The housing interest rate was 6.5 per cent and the size of the average home loan was $136,500. Back in May 1999, Britney Spears had just released her debut album. The title track was ‘Hit me baby one more time.’ At that time she had no babies under her control and it is much the same now, as it turns out. In 1999, The Matrix had just hit the cinemas and there were no sequels to The Matrix movie at the time. Back in 1999, John Howard’s approval rating on 28 May 1999 was at 42 per cent, which is 30 per cent more than that of the current Leader of the Opposition. Back to the more mundane matters to do with flight: the Montreal convention was agreed to on 28 May 1999 and came into effect on 4 November 2003. I point out that there was a fair gap between when it was actually agreed to and when it came into effect. So far, 86 countries have signed and ratified the Montreal convention. To pluck a couple of names out of the air, Bolivia, Tonga, Namibia, Estonia and Botswana-none of these countries, though wonderful in their own way, are OECD countries. Nevertheless, all of them managed to ratify the Montreal convention. You may be wondering why it has taken so long to be enacted by the Australian government. Since 1999, the coalition had nine years to sign and ratify the Montreal convention, yet they failed to do so. 28 May 1999 is a very long time ago. So while other countries moved swiftly to enact the laws, the coalition government sat on their hands. They simply could not be bothered. They did not care about Australian international travellers. Like their stubborn refusal to ratify Kyoto, here we have another example of the former coalition government being slow to act to advance international laws. They were not able to look beyond our shores. In fact, with the passing of this bill, Australia will be the last OECD country to sign and ratify the Montreal convention. On that note, I will just take this moment to thank Minister Albanese for moving so swiftly to bring this bill before the parliament. The Montreal convention replaces rather than amends the complicated and outdated Warsaw system of carriers’ liability. The Warsaw convention became law in 1929, in an era when air travel was just taking off, so to speak. I am sorry, Deputy Speaker; I do apologise for that pun. I do not think it ever got off the ground. In fact, I think that pun might have crashed. Nonetheless, the Warsaw system, with its origins in 1929, MAIN COMMITTEE before jet engines were even invented, is written in archaic language. It measures compensation in the gold franc Poincare, a currency that no longer exists, and offers very low compensation to victims and their families, sometimes as low as $16,000. Obviously this is manifestly inadequate in 2008, in this millennium. Compensation for damaged luggage could be as low as $30. For anyone who has been in an international airport, $30 barely buys you a milkshake and a sandwich in most airports. But it gets worse. In some circumstances, under the Warsaw convention, the amount of compensation is limited to a cap that was set two weeks before the great crash. Of course, I am talking about the Wall Street crash, not a plane crash. It is therefore essential that the Rudd government modernise these arrangements to ensure that equitable compensation is available to injured passengers or passengers that have incurred damage. It is essential work for a government that believes in the future. It is essential work for a government committed to the new millennium. We believe that our world has changed quite a bit since 1929. The Warsaw system has also become unwieldy through many additional instruments such as the Hague protocol from 1955, the Guadalajara convention of 1961, the Guatemala City protocol of 1971, the 1975 additional Montreal protocols Nos1 to 3 and Montreal protocol No. 4. These were introduced in an effort to modernise the laws regarding the international carriage of cargo. Today, international jet travel is booming and we need fair and workable laws in place to protect consumers. The Montreal convention provides this protection for Australians travelling overseas. It does this by removing the cap on carrier liability and introducing a much fairer two-tier system. For damages up to a threshold of 100,000 special drawing rights, which is equivalent-as you well know, Deputy Speaker-to around $170,000 in today’s terms, passengers will not have to prove fault on the part of the airline. That is, it makes it a much easier process for the consumer, for the poor traveller who has suffered at the hands of a carrier. So, instead of adding insult to injury, this new Montreal initiative pours oil on troubled waters. On the other hand, for damages greater than the 100,000 special drawing rights threshold, the onus will be on the airline to prove that they were not at fault. As I am sure you well know, Deputy Speaker, special drawing rights are a unit of currency used by the International Monetary Fund, based on a basket of international currencies. The new compensation thresholds will ensure that victims and their families are now fairly compensated for injury, death or loss. I have heard some argue that this bill will lead to greater travel costs for consumers. However, as many international airlines have already voluntarily begun operating under more generous liability arrangements, this bill is not expected to increase travel or insurance costs. This bill is also good for modern families. The bill expands which relatives are able to claim damages in the event of a passenger death. The list now includes stepsiblings and wards of the passenger. The Montreal convention may also be applied to domestic air travel. However, as our domestic scheme is working so well, as mentioned by the member for Brand, the government has decided to keep the existing arrangement covered under part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act. The legislation is complemented by state government legislation to create a national, uniform liability framework for domestic air travel. Finally, I am pleased that the passing of this bill will strengthen Australia’s standing as a leading aviation nation. Certainly, coming from Queensland, I know that the state of Queensland is particularly committed to aviation and, having an airport in my electorate, I am parMAIN COMMITTEE ticularly interested in it as well. So we will join the 86 other countries as a signatory to the Montreal convention. We will catch up with the protections afforded the good citizens of places like Bolivia, Tonga, Namibia, Estonia and Botswana and, in doing so, we will ensure greater protection for Australia’s international travellers. I commend the bill to the House. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.15 pm)-I am afraid that my speech will be nowhere near as ‘punny’ as the member for Moreton’s. I am pleased to speak in support of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (1999 Montreal Convention and Other Measures) Bill 2008, the intention of which is to modernise and consolidate the raft of inconsistencies and variations which currently prevail under the Warsaw convention-which was negotiated, as the member for Moreton mentioned, in the early years of aviation and came into force in 1929-and other subsequent conventions. My colleague the Hon. Warren Truss MP, the shadow minister for transport, has already underlined the principal reasons why the coalition is supporting the bill. I shall add my observations on this welcome legislation. With this bill the government has put the finishing touches to all the former government’s preparatory work and genuine consultation that preceded it. We on our side of the House have a natural reservation when it comes to conventions and treaties, and we wish to ensure first and foremost that they benefit the Australian people and would have their support. Some international agreements are signed mainly to express support or make a symbolic gesture. On the other hand, this legislation will have a definitive concrete benefit for those Australians flying overseas. I understand that something like two million overseas trips are made each year by Australian air passengers, and this will no doubt continue to increase. Therefore, the number of people this legislation could affect is quite significant. Judging by the information that has been provided on this bill, there appear to be many benefits for Australia and few, if any, negative effects, which should always be the main consideration when deciding whether or not to support such legislation. From my understanding, the situation as it currently stands is not acceptable. There are a patchwork of conventions, rules, protocols and practices which, in many cases, lead to lack of certainty about precisely what the responsibilities and liabilities are for international air carriers. Also, there is the prospect of those injured, killed or in other ways affected by events connected to international air travel, such as lost luggage, having to launch costly and protracted legal action against large companies. This legislation should provide certainty for carriers, passengers and regulators as to precisely what the rules are pertaining to loss and injury and ensure a more simplified, user-friendly system for resolution of such cases. The first problem with the current situation is related to certainty and ease of access to damages on the part of victims of accidents or other unfortunate circumstances. There is a two-tier system of liability proposed for death and injury. Of course, we in Australia are familiar with this sort of system. Many states have had a similar system in workers compensation for years. The first tier is a no-fault area, where no proof of negligence or error need be proved but where there is a legislated cap on the amount which can be awarded. This threshold is most important when assessing whether the ultimate result will be increased costs to the carriers, which would of course be passed on to the travelling public. The threshold must be high enough to provide fair compensation and to limit the number of instances which need resolution in the courts and low enough to ensure that carriers do not face increased insurance premiums. The second tier would only be available when loss or damage was incurred solely MAIN COMMITTEE due to negligence or a wrongful act on behalf of the carrier, its servants, its agents or a third party. I believe that this is an eminently sensible resolution of the thorny problem of liability, damages and legal proof. The second problem was a farrago of regulation combining the remnants of the Warsaw system, which in itself permitted higher limits of liability with other arrangements; therefore, there was no consistency. There was dissatisfaction with the low liability limits set by the Warsaw convention and The Hague protocol and with the inability of the international community to agree on higher ones, which often led to various measures to get around those limits. Another cause of confusion was the reliance on a provision of the Warsaw convention that permits a carrier and passenger to agree by special contract to a higher limit of liability. Many carriers agreed among themselves to apply an increased liability limit or to waive liability limits. To this end, private agreements and voluntary arrangements among air carriers were developed, notably within the International Air Transport Association, IATA. Japanese airlines also abandoned liability limits. Some countries took action in relation to their own airlines. For example, Australia imposed higher liability limits on Australian carriers, although its obligation under the Warsaw system prevented it from opposing the same limits on foreign carriers. Another cause of complication was the fact that different Warsaw parties adopting differing amending instruments resulted in a complex array of international arrangements. For example, Australia is a party to the Warsaw convention as amended by The Hague protocol, the Guadalajara convention and Montreal protocol No. 4. Indonesia is a party to the Warsaw convention as amended by the Guadalajara convention. Having had a tooth taken out last week does not help with pronouncing some of these words, I can tell you. If an accident occurs on a flight for which Australia is the country of departure and Indonesia is the country of destination, the applicable international law is the Warsaw convention as amended by the Guadalajara convention, the liability limits being those in the Warsaw convention. However, if Australia is the country of departure and France is the country of destination, the applicable international law is the Warsaw convention as amended by The Hague protocol and the Guadalajara convention, the liabilities being those of The Hague protocol. These are the instruments to which both France and Australia are parties. In Australia, there was further relevant legislation. In addition to the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act, a voluntary industry code, being the Code for the Preparation of Airline Family Assistance Plans, sets out the minimum standards for airlines operating to and from Australia in giving assistance to victims and the families of victims in the event of a major civil aircraft accident involving loss of life or serious injury. It should be noted that the provisions of the carriers liability act applying to a non-Montreal convention international flightthat is, between Australia and a country that is not a party to the Montreal convention-would remain unchanged. The provisions of the act applying to domestic flights would also remain unchanged. That was an unworkable nightmare which had to be rationalised and put on a firm logical and legal footing. I do not agree that Australia should blindly follow other countries simply because that is what Europe or the United States is doing. However, in this case the policy is MAIN COMMITTEE correct and it would help untangle an almost impenetrable and unworkable maze of regulations and laws. Another complication under the existing system is that of jurisdiction. Under the pre-Montreal convention Warsaw system, claims for damages can be heard in one of four jurisdictions: a court in the state where the carrier is ordinarily resident; a court in the state where the carrier has its principal place of business; a court in the state where the carrier has an establishment by which the ticket was purchased or contract was made; and, finally, a court in the state of the passenger’s destination. Article 33 of the Montreal convention provides for a ‘fifth jurisdiction’. It allows an action for damages for the death or injury of a passenger to be brought in the country where the passenger had his or her principal and permanent residence at the time of the accident, if it is a country to or from which the carrier operates and where it has premises. This would give most Australian citizens access to Australian courts to pursue claims in relation to flights to which the Montreal convention applies. There are other areas which have been modernised and improved to the benefit of the flying public. Under the Warsaw convention the limits of damages were expressed in terms of the somewhat esoteric and arcane Poincare gold franc, which was linked to the gold standard. This standard has now been abandoned and establishing the monetary value of a claim has been somewhat of a raffle, with courts in different countries adopting different approaches to determining the exchange rate. We now have one uniformly agreed unit-the SDR, or special drawing right. One SDR is roughly the equivalent of A$1.72. Put simply, tier 1 claims can be up to 100,000 SDRs, or about A$172,000. Every other member country can translate SDRs into their own currency, but it is clear to everyone what the limit is. Another significant improvement is to widen the definition of family to include, for example, partners, a de facto spouse, wards, grandchildren, grandparents, stepand half-brothers and stepand half-sisters, and guardians. Travellers will by now be familiar with electronic documentation. This is already being widely used by the aviation industry for both passenger ticketing and cargo movement, but it does not meet the requirements of the Warsaw convention. The Montreal convention provides for simplified documentation. It eliminates the need for cargo consignors to complete detailed paper based air waybills and so allows simplified electronic records to be used. As long as the passenger or consignee has adequate evidence of the contract and provided it is in a form that meets the requirements of border control agencies, there is no reason why documentation should not be electronic. Usually the first question asked when changes are proposed is: what will they cost? There are minimal financial implications for the Australian government from the bill. There are no ongoing administrative costs. Where the Commonwealth is the operator of an aircraft, liability, in the event of an accident, for the death or injury of a passenger may be higher under the Montreal convention than it would be under existing international obligations. Adoption of the Montreal convention provisions is not expected to increase insurance premiums for Australian international carriers or foreign international carriers. Apart from the effect of the intercarrier agreements, insurers, in setting premiums for carriers that operate into the USA, already factor in the possibility of US courts deciding that the carrier or its agents have engaged in wilful misconduct and that liability limits therefore do not apply. Carriers and conMAIN COMMITTEE sumers will also benefit from the fact that the Montreal convention expresses liability limits in SDRs. This removes existing uncertainty about the values to be applied resulting from disagreement on the way in which the obsolete gold franc amounts in the Warsaw system instruments are to be converted. The other important question is how the legislation and regulations will operate. As any regulations will be a disallowable instrument, parliament will maintain oversight. Article 24 of the convention provides for five-yearly reviews of liability limits to account for inflation. As regulation changes can be disallowed, this will ensure that parliament retains oversight of such amendments. At the same time, having such a facility will allow the government to bring amendments into force more quickly than through primary legislation, allowing continuing consumer protection in line with international practice. In summary, this is an excellent and much-awaited improvement to the legal framework in which international airlines operate. As of February 2008, Australia will be joining 86 state parties to the convention, including Australia’s key aviation partners, such as the United States, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the European Community and its member countries. I welcome this legislation and encourage members to support it. Debate (on motion by Mr Marles) adjourned.
