If You Have Any Information As To The Whereabouts Of His Majesty's Opposi","tion ? paragraph in' this morning's Argus, it would appear that the officials of the Postmaster-General's Department are opposed to placing in hotels telephones for public usesInquiry at the Central Postal Administration yesterday disclosed the fact that a public telephone with penny-in-the-slot attachment may not be installed in an hotel, although it is permitted in shops. . . . The Postmaster General( Sir John Quick) said that there were two reasons for the regulation. One was that a public telephone in a hotel would remove the incentive to tbe licensee to pay for a telephone for his own business purposes. reason was that it was considered undesirable to make an hotel the place for a public telephone ' for use' by all sections 'of the public. I ask if it is the policy of the Government to restrict the facilities of the public in the matter of telephone communication, and, if so, whether this policy is based .on moral orcommercial grounds? fairly summarizes the objections of the Department to placing in hotels public slot telephones. I see no reason to deviate from the established practice in the matter. great inconvenience if the telephones are removed from various hotels, I wish to know from the Postmaster-General when this action is to be taken. Therevenue does not suffer by the use of penny-in-theslot telephones. to remove any telephone.. Every hotel keeper may become a subscriber to a telephone exchange, and have an instrument installed in his premises, and, where the toll system is in force, may allow the public to use it, upon the payment of a . 10.30 The second",14,Setup

Minister, in replying to a question which the honourable ""member's questions are1 asked as to interest charges, saidSpeaking from memory, the fairness of the cash prices charged for agricultural implements was one of the subjects of inquiry on which a good deal of conflicting evidence was taken; this may lead to a reading of the report upon the extreme and exorbitant rates of interest such as some of those to which the honourable member has referred. Is the honourable gentleman aware that there was no conflict in the evidence taken regarding interest, and that the figures cial which I read yesterday were prepared by a competent officer of the Treasury, on sergeants who receive the 6s. daily, voted by the basis of price-lists and terms submitted Parliament, as stated by the Minister yesterday? by manufacturers and importing houses? pany dence to which I"" alluded was as to the fair cash prices to be charged for these the honourable member's questions areimplements.

I have' decided to increase the allowance for conducting elections to £25 in the case of city and suburban divisions, and to ^30 in the case of country divisions. The general work of the divisional returning officers has been greatly reduced by the adoption of sub-divisional registration and the simplification of methods, and it is not proposed to increase their annual remuneration in addition to increasing the special allowance to be henceforth granted to them for conducting elections.

In France the taxes on the land come to 43 per cent, of the income. there? land into the cities and large towns. The Government have found out that they have over-taxed the land and propose to reduce the taxation in order to encourage persons to go back to the land. In Australia we are always urging persons to go upon the land, but they are not keen to do so. Look at the rush there is for Government appointments. . Recently there were 9,000 applications ""in this State for the position of railway porters. Our best and strongest young men in the country would rather become porters on the railways than work on the land, because the work would be easier and they would have more amusements. reason. They have no enterprise. men off the land we shall have more people in the towns, and the land will be less productive. get revenue from if we do not give them a portion of the revenue from Customs and Excise? that point later. I am now dealing with the taxation of land and income. The Prime Minister interjected that we have an inexhaustible power of taxation with regard to land and income,* but I maintain that there is a limit to the exercise of thaj; power and that the margin which is left to the Federal Parliament is very little. When all the States have imposed an income tax, we cannot put very much more taxation ori to that, and if we should do so what would be the feeling of the people ?. They would say, "" We are over taxed by the Federal Parliament. They are oppressors."" The people would be crying out for the abolition of Federation. They would simply say, "" We have quite enough taxes to pay to the States, and we do not want them duplicated by the Federal Parliament."" I contend that on that ground alone the security of the States is better than that of the Commonwealth. Of course, we might levy revenue duties, but do we really want to increase the burdens of the people? At present the annual receipts of the States and the Commonwealth-that is excluding the revenue from the railways and the Post Office-aggregat e ,£42,000,000.

I consider that the only articles which are left for the Commonwealth to tax are cotton goods,' kerosene, and tea, and unless we take over the debts of the States, we shall have competing parties from the same country in the money market for loans.

If the Commonwealth imposes a land tax, and the States also impose a land tax, all that can be done is to sue or seize the property -if the tax is not paid. We cannot prevent .the States, for instance, from increasing their income tax as much as they like; and .if we make this country one in which the taxation is unbearable, we shall drive every penny of capital out of it. If we have two people squeezing at a lemon, there will be very little left for either in the long run. The Federal Parliament should, therefore, retain its control over the honourable the Customs and Excise revenue, in order to meet the two big items of expenditure represented by defence and invalid and old-age pensions. While we can afford it, let us be as liberal as we may-in.fact , let us err on the side of generosity-bu t do not impose a permanent first charge upon our revenue, because, as surely as we are here, we shall rue the day, and desire to have some of the money back at one time or another. Did anybody ever anticipate that the Commonwealth, in the ninth year of its existence, would be in financial difficulties -that there would be a deficit at the end of. this year, if some arrangement were not come to with the States? According to the Budget statement, we shall be short something like £1,200,000 at the end of the financial year; and it is certainly remarkable that, with all our. powers of taxation, we should find ourselves at the without borrowing money. pended on new works. how it is to be expended. has already been expended upon new works from revenue. amount has been so expended, and now we have not money to meet our engagements.

It is a scheme which everybody commends, and which I do not think has its equal in any part of the Empire; and we ought to be proud of the Government and the Minister who has submitted it.

We may experience droughts in the future as we have done in the past. Do honourable members forget that in one year the number of sheep in New South Wales alone decreased by 20,000,000? It declined from 61,000,000 to 23,000,000. to face similar droughts in the future, and yet it is seriously proposed to base the adjustment of our financial relations with the States upon the most favorable season that we have ever experienceda season in which the largest revenue has been recorded by both the States and the Commonwealth. I think that we ought to consider what will be our position when bad times recur, if we ratify the proposed agreement. Let honourable members reflect upon our position if, in consequence of a drought, our lands became denuded of stock. In such circumstances our revenue from Customs and Excise would probably fall 25 per cent., the amount derived from income tax would necessarily decline, and the land tax-shoul d it press too heavily upon the land-owner-woul d simply drive settlers off -the country. sanction the return to the States of 25s. -per capita, we ought to adopt a sliding scale under which our contribution to them will be regulated by the manner in which our revenue may increase or decrease.

Undoubtedly they will. But as the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes have properly pointed out, we are here to advise the people what they ought to do.

A similar condition of affairs obtains in the other States at the present time. They see only what is at their doors; for example, at Melbourne Cup time, there is a large influx of visitors to this city from the country, and a newspaper exchange is established here at which all the provincial journals may be perused. But visitors to this exchange do not consult the Argus or the Age; they read their own local newspaper. They are not concerned with what is transpiring in Melbourne, but only with what is taking place at Dimboola, or Ararat, or any other place from which they may come. In short, they are interested only in the news concerning their own district. A similar state of affairs will obtain when this Parliament is removed to Rather than the Federal capital. removal of this Parliament to the permanent seat of Government make to Queensland or Western Australia? of those States will merely have regard to the doings of their own Parliaments.

But even if the position be that which is suggested by the honourable member, it is clear that under the proposed agreement Victoria would not be paying her fair share of Commonwealth expenditure. There are not very many articles which it is open to us to tax, and I do not think that we should be able to squeeze more than £2,000,000 out of the taxation of tea, kerosene, and cotton piece-goods. Buti f the Government take all the money that they can wring from the taxpayers, nothing will be left for investment by private enterprises. tralia have been but for the enterprise of the people? mind honourable members of what was done in connection with the Darling country in New South Wales. The Government leased large grazing areas in that district for sheep-farming purposes, and later on an agitation sprang up for the imposition of heavier rentals. Gradually the rentals were increased, until they were at least quadrupled, with the result that the sheep-farmers, having lost heavily by reason of droughts, were starved out. The rabbits then swarmed over the district; it is now practically a desert; and the Government, instead of obtaining from it a large revenue, are receiving scarcely any return. The people have been squeezed out of the district. And so with the Commonwealth. We can overdo taxation. By excessive taxation we should drive ' people off the land, and crush out private enterprise which, to my mind, is far better than is. that of the State. If we allow -the people an opportunity to make savings, and a chance to improve their holdings, I am quite sure that we shall do well.

It was realized that sooner or later the contest would have to be fought out in this community between the two parties to which I have referred. The first serious crisis in the contest between the National interest and the State Rights party in Australia has arrived; and it will depend upon this Parliament whether it is going to be the last fight or not. Becausei f , unfortunately, the Sta.te Rights party should win, there is not the slightest doubt that at some distant date, probably when present politicians have passed away and another generation has sprung up, the National spirit will again be revived, the whole matter will be reopened, and the contest will be renewed, probably in a much more serious form. Ultimately, I have not the slightest doubt, the National cause will win, because, when once the foundation is laid of a National form of government, and the National spirit begins to operate, it can never be long suppressed. It will only be a matter of time when that spirit must triumph and become paramount. It therefore rests with this Parliament, representing the whole of Australia-and in the first instance with this House representing the majority of the people, a House elected on a thoroughly Democratic basis in which the majority rules-to say whether the National interests or State Rights shall be paramount.

The case for the agreement made between the Government and the State Premiers was ably put-as was only to be expected -by the Prime Minister; and I can only congratulate the State Rights party of Defence! The most striking feature on having secured the services of so of the case put by the Prime Minister was eminent a counsel. The speech, when dethis: For the first time, on behalf of livered, however, must have struck honthe Commonwealth, we have the question orable members, as it struck the press, of contribution or annual subsidy sepaas not being up to the level of speeches rated from the question of State debts. which on important occasions the Prime Minister has made in the past.

And that is not to be wondered at. The soul was lacking in that speech. No one can make me believe that the Prime Minister was giving utterance to his own sentiments. He was simply speaking as counsel representing the party that had adopted that agreement. The very fact that-as was not in accordance with the Prime Minister's usual method-the language of the deliverance was so carefully prepared, showed that the amount of preparation spent upon the form of it was so bestowed with the view of preventing the honourable gentleman from getting away from his text and giving vent to his own feelings. We have known the same sort of thing to occur in the case of other public men. Quite recently it was stated that when the late Sir Thomas Bent went to deliver the speech embodying the policy of his Government at Brighton, his deliverance was typewritten for him, and had been previously considered by his Ministry.

In one case represented as a whole by another set of agents, and as we know in business, even when the a sanction in it to any agreement arrived at and Excise revenue requiring that alteration lo hereafter before going into the Constitution, but the effect would be that it could not be altered without another appeal to the people. That means the insertion in the Constitution, so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, of a condition which is not at present there, and so far it is a new proposal Personally, I am not inclined to sav "" n o "" to your proposal, because you are going l o the one party interested, the people of Australia; still, it is a new proposal.

The Treasurer now puts it that to refuse to include the provision in the Constitution is to distrust the people. But at the Brisbane Conference on that occasion, when one of the State representatives said it was distrusting the people to refuse to put the provision in the Constitution, he made a reply which I shall quote, and I wish he were here to listen to his own words. Yesterday he twitted the honourable member for Hume in his absence from the State with having altered his views on the matter, and I should like to show how the right honourable member has altered the views which he held when he was Treasurer before. I have quoted his statement to the Premiers that they were distrusting the Commonwealth, and when they replied that he was distrusting the people, he saidNo, it was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this shall be the Constitution, and it would be a strange idea for the Parlia-ment of Australia to say to the people, "" We are not competent to handle this great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it . "" We, who represent the same people and the same electors; we, the Commonwealth Parliament, say"" Take hack this power; we are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the way you desire."" Yesterday, the tight honourable gentleman, after quoting certain words uttered by the honourable member for Hume, remarked, '' Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen ! The political champion of the States then; the political enemy of the States now."" Similarly I may say of the debts subject to the adoption of other resolutions, right honourable gentleman himself, "" Those and different Federal Governments have all held are the words which he used when he was together. a great Nationalist. What a falling-off is there when he comes forward as a State view. Righter! "" He went on to sayOn reading the Hansard report of the proa Fusion Government would be brought ceedings of this Conference one might into being, and that the Prime Minister fairly come to the conclusion that the attiand the right honourable member for Swan tude assumed by some members of this Conference would seem to show that this Conference would both turn somersaults. Mr Davies was the arbiter of the Commonwealth, and that said furtherthe Commonwealth was asking for something in these proposals that would be injurious to their interests. Now, as a matter of fact, as you all know, under the Constitution . . . . the Commonwealth has all the power it requires for itself already. Throughout these Conferences the present Prime Minister and Treasurer asserted the absolute power of the Federal Parliament to deal with the question, and refused to surrender that power. The right honourable member for Swan in the strongest language possible-stronge r than any uttered so far in this debate-absolutel y scouted the idea of our handing back the power to the people and telling them that we w;ere not worthy to be trusted with it after they had placed it in our hands. Yet, in face of their present attitude, they expect us to follow them ! The two questions of an annual contribution and the transfer of the State debts have always been considered by the Commonwealth representatives up to the present as inseparable. At the Melbourne Conference in 1904 the whole of Sir George Turner's scheme was based on that idea. At the Melbourne Conference in 1906, Mr Evans, who represented Tasmania, said, addressing the present Prime Minister:W ill you not have to take into consideration the question of the transfer of debts in connection with this subject? And the Prime Minister replied :Yes. This is one arm of the subject complete in itsel f, but there is another arm; both are essential. What the Federal Parliament desires, so far as I understand, is, if possible, to clear up all the unsettled financial questions between the States and the Commonwealth. The taking over of the debts of the States is one of the most important provisions in the Constitution. When the matter was being discussed, so emphatic and firm was the present Prime Minister on that point that Mr Davies, who was one of the representatives of Victoria, pointed out to his fellow State representatives that it was absurd to consider the two questions apart. He said:We will surely make our proposal as to State the same view that the two things should be done Even then Mr Kidston had no hope that They considered that they were giving up something with regard to the Braddon clause, or the amended proposal that we have now adopted, and they wanted to get the question of State debts settled at the same time. Seeing that tlie present Commonwealth Government is of the same opinion -and we heard what the Prime Minister said yesterdayI feel that we would be jeopardizing the probabilities of our getting the other proposals agreed to if we refuse to consider the question of State debts.",28,Deakin
128,Mr Kidston,"They will always hold thatBefore the matter was cleared up at that Conference the Prime Minister was called in. Some dispute had arisen as to whether he was firm on the question or not, and Mr Evans addressed him in these wordsAfter debate, I withdrew the resolution I had moved, because I was told that it was imperative, so far as Sir John Forrest and the Commonwealth Government were concerned, that the taking over of the State debts should be part and parcel of the whole scheme. It was promised that I should get a reply from you, Mr Deakin, when you attended the Conference this afternoon, as to this question. The Prime Minister repliedButI can set Captain Evans' mind at rest by saying that he has quite correctly understood the purport of the remarks that have been made by Sir John Forrest and myself. In the view of the Commonwealth, not only the consideration of the debts question, but its final determination, is the essence of the contract. To use Captain Evans' own words, it is an imperative part of the scheme, and I do not think he needs any explanation from me to tell him why. If you look at the proposals altogether as in every other negotiation, it is a question of give and take. Now, so far as you are concerned, the proposals relating to the Braddon clause and your future revenue from Customs are all "" take "" on your part, and "" give "" on the part of the Federal Parliament. It is only when you come to deal with the debts question that you balance it. You have to ask yourselves the question what you will give up on that point, and what the Commonwealth can fairly take in the interests of Australia as a whole. At Brisbane in 1907 the right honourable member for Swan saidNow we have had four previous Conferences, and at all of them the representatives of the people of Australia have said they believed the States debts should be taken over, because they believed, and the framers of the Constitution also believed, that a great saving to the people of Australia would result. liament will not do anything in these great financial matters unless we do it as a whole. They will not do it piece-meal. To deal with one-half of the financial problem, and leave the other half, will not commend itself to them. Later on he saidThe two matters cover the whole of the finanwith, and that the two questions must be cial problems as between the States and the dealt with together. Even as late as this Commonwealth . . . and in the opinion of the Government and the Parliament they should year the Minister of External Affairs, in be dealt with together. ' At the Conference last year the present scheme was abandoned, saidPrime Minister, who was also Prime Minister then, and represented the Commonfinancial wealth, saidThe point I wish to make at the outset, is that, looking back, one is struck by the repeated references made during the course of the Convention debates at which the present Constitution was shaped to two things which were always considered together. One was the revenue derived from Customs in the Commonwealth, and the other was the interest on the debts which had Mr Wise. been incurred by the States of the Commonwealth. . . . Speaking not so much legally, as generally, it appears to me that the clear meaning of the Constitution is that these two matters should be dealt with together. He enlarged upon that aspect of the question in these wordsIt is never a question between the States and the Commonwealth, but always a question of the States in the Commonwealth. When any difference arises between the States and the Commonwealth it means between the State agency and the Commonwealth agency of the Australian people. It is unnecessary to enter into distinctions, but fhe point I wish to make Then come the words I have already quoted, and thenEven before that Convention, if I remember aright, Sir Samuel Griffith had dwelt upon the necessity of considering these two factors together. He goes on in the same strain through a lengthy speech, and finally saysThe first suggestion I wished to make this morning, was that, at this Conference the time has arrived when the question should be approached from the other side-whethe r certain difficulties would not be removed, the intention of the framers of the Constitution better fulfilled, and other useful objects achieved, by considering once more the two questions together, that is the repayment of a portion of the Customs duties to the States and the obligations already incurred by the States in regard to their borrowings. In other words, one side of those questions having been frequently considered, and very f u l l y considered, has"" not the time arrived when some stressa great deal more stress than in the past-shoul d be laid on the debt side, and its connection with the problem ? Singularly enough, he lays very much less stress now on that point than he did before. He then saidI fear that ParPersonally, I have been putting that forward, and so has my honourable colleague, the Treasurer, almost since the commencement of the Commonwealth. His one contention throughout was that this was a matter for the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth alone, to deal the presence of the present Prime Minister, at Toowoomba, before the Deakin-Lyne The first ideal of a settlement of the question must be the complete severance between the Commonwealth and State finances. Their plans ( Sir William Lyne's scheme) had that end in view. The next point to be considered in the settlement of the finances was that it must always be kept in view that taxation and representation must go hand in hand. The Commonwealth members must be responsible to the electors for their taxation, and the State members for theirs The only satisfactory solution is that which will make the Commonwealth and States responsible for the money raised by each. That was what their party wanted. That was the old Deakin partyHe then pointed out that if the Commonwealth determined to take over the State debts and pay the interest thereon, the past national debt would be wiped out in 35 years. . . . His feeling was that the national power must become greater, and the powers of the Constitution be extended. As a member of the present Government the honourable gentleman has now cast all that to the winds. I have shown .the position taken up by every representative of the Commonwealth Government from the beginning of Federation, and taken up over and over again by the present Prime Minister and the present Treasurer. This, as the Prime Minister has said, represents not only the view of the Commonwealth Parliament during the whole of this time, but the view also of the framers of the Constitution. absolutely abandons that' position. Of course, he has told us that he has not done so. Indeed, he boasted that the position had been established. He said that the first resolution wasThat to fulfil the intention of the Constitution by providing for the consolidation and transfer of Stale debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock, a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the question of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue mone; s. By the way, it is very singular that the honourable gentleman never seemed to think that this investigation was necessary when he brought down the scheme of the honourable member for Hume based on the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, and which he put so strongly before the people. After reading that resolution the honourable gentleman went on to sayMy reference is to the undoubted intention of tution, the Braddon section, and the section the Constitution, and to the fact that, for the giving power to the Commonwealth to take first .time in our experience, the Commonwealth over the debts of the States are then quoted and the States are at one in declaring that the consolidation and transfer of the State debts and the memorandum continuesare necessary to f u l f i l the inlention of the Constitution, and that, for the most profitable man' agement of future loans, the establishment of one Australian Stock is essential. admits the whole case for which the Commonwealth has been contending for many years within itself. . . . We, therefore, have, in the frankest fashion, a recognition of the fundamental principle formally accepted by the Convention framers of the Constitution, and now fully, frankly, and unreservedly accepted by our Governments, both Commonwealth and State. We have reached a stage in this regard which many efforts in the past have altogether failed to attain. In the first place that is hardly correct, as honourable members will see if they look at pages 68 and 69 of a paper prepared by. Mr Watson, the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, on the financial problems of the Commonwealth and the States. Conference of 1907 ? 1903. Though the Prime Minister says that this is the first time at which we have arrived at such a stage, it was arrived at as early as 1903. I find that at that Conference Mr W. H . Irvine, then Premier of Victoria, submitted a memorandum which, Now the honourable gentleman after careful consideration extending over several sittings, was agreed to unanimously. I shall make only two quotations from that memorandum. The first isThis Conference submits to the consideration of the Federal Government the following resolution :"" Having regard to the fact that the debts of the various States were incurred upon the security of the revenues of the States, and as the greater part of the revenues has been transferred to the Commonwealth in the Customs and Excise duties, and having regard to the fact that the permanent financial stability of the States must depend upon either (a) the continuance of the application of the principal part of those revenues to payment of the interest of the debts, or (4) the imposition of a very largely increased direct taxation in the various States, it is resolved that, in order to secure to the several S'tate Governments the guarantee contemplated by the Constitution, the provisions of the Constitution with respect to the taking over by the Commonwealth of the debts of the States, or a proportion thereof, should Be brought into operation as soon as possible. Section 87 and section 105 of the ConstiThe Premiers in Conference feel that they would be neglecting their duty if they failed at this stage to impress upon the Parliament and Now this the people of the Commonwealth the urgent necessity of bringing into effect these provisions, and to emphasize the far-reaching importance of the issues involved.",29,Deakin

He brings forward the machine first, and keeps the axis back. He sends them in different Bills to the country for the express purpose, as the Treasurer said yesterday, of enabling the people, if they think fit, to accept one and reject the other. Every member of this House agrees with the Prime Minister that. the taking over and control of the debts of Australia by the Commonwealth is the axis on which all our financial proposals revolve. gentleman's present position is the more surprising, because, as I say, he last year adopted the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. He brought that scheme forward then, and even now he describes it as a bold and statesmanlike proposal. Mr Kidston, speaking at one of the Conferences, said that it was the only scheme under which finality could be reached. Let us come now to the position as it is actually presented to us at the present time. It constitutes a complete change, not merely of the Commonwealth policy maintained by these gentlemen, and by all representatives of the Commonwealth for the last nine years, but a complete change also of the policy of the present Government, even during the short time that they have been in office. As the honourable member for Parkes stated the other night, the scheme now proposed was not a part of the Fusion policy. It was not a part of the terms on which the present Ministerial party was brought together. What was the Fusion policy on this particular question? It wasPending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future financial relation of the Commonwealth and States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall be dealt with. That is all the Fusion party were asked to agree to. They came together on a now proposal for an interim' arrangement. Customs More than that, the present Prime Minsons, require to contemplate some fixed period ister is president of a party called the for which the circumstances can be forecast with Commonwealth Liberal Party, which was considerable launched the night before the Fusion was be arduous. effected at a great meeting held in the Melbourne Town Hall, to which admisTn reply, Mr Wade wrote on the 3rd July sion was by ticket only. One of the platof this yearforms of that party wasThe assumption by the Commonwealth of the public debts of the States, accompanied by an equitable scheme for providing interest and sinking fund. Let us now see what we know in this House apart from that policy. I have read the terms on which the Fusion party came together, and I quote this from the Ministerial statement which the Prime Minister laid on the table of this House as setting forth the policy of the Fusion GovernmentA brief 'statement of the business which Ministers are about to submit to Parliament is due to both Houses, though, since the time at our disposal is limited, the references to its particulars must be condensed"" to the utmost. He condenses them into two pagesThe honourable To simplify the synopsis, proposals are grouped according to subjects, and not to their relative importance. Then under the heading, "" Finance,"" the Ministerial statement continuedAbove all, the approaching termination of the ten-year period for which the Constitution provides a distribution of the Customs revenue, marks the close of a critical era, and suggests thc pressing importance of this great financial problem. A temporary arrangement for a term of years to replace the existing distribution, in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for submission. That is all that was proposed by the Fusion Government. He goes on to sayThe future financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, taken together, with their present and future loan obligations, are being carefully considered in principle and in detail, in order that a satisfactory and permanent settlement may be achieved. On the 30th June he addressed the Premier of New South Wales regarding the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States in these terms-the correspondence has been printed and laid upon the table of the HouseI t is highly desirable that this complex question shall be simplified, so that this Government can frame concise propositions for submission to the electors at our general election.

This should greatly simplify a task which, under any conditions, will Your letter contains a reference to the submission of questions to the electors, which I take to mean a proposal for ingrafting any agreement arrived at permanently in the Constitution.

I do not propose to reply to the attempts of the prenent Treasurer to make certain deductions from the statistics quoted by the honourable member for Flinders. There can be no rloubt that the Customs revenue will decrease as the protective duties become more and more effective. The Prime Minister told us that, having examined the statistics of the world, he was unable to find a law bearing upon the subject, and then took the figures for New Zealand as if they were sufficient to create a general rule. At the Melbourne Conference he said that the future could not be predicted, and he has recently repeated that statement. Yet he proposes now to bind the Commonwealth for all time. by -Ministerial supporters, I am surprised that the statement, that it is proposed to bind the'Commonwealth for all time, should be disputed. are the States to determine what the Tariff should be? compelled to frame a Tariff other than it would frame if it had a free hand? Are we to lessen the protective incidence of duties, or to impose heavy revenue duties, in order to keep up the revenue? If we do not, the returns will fall as the imof tying the hands of the Commonwealth Speaking at the We cannot tie the hands of the Commonwealth We are asked to tie the Commonwealth Treacreased population, so that if it doubles he would still have to give the States 34s. 5d. head. I feel quite satisfied that the Federal Treasurer would never dream of committing himself to such a thing. Now he has not only dreamt of committing himself, but has actually done so. We have been told that to put this agreement into the Constitution is not to make it permanent. Honourable members opposite, who will not trust the Parliament, say that we, on this side, are not prepared to trust The the people. We are prepared to trust the people. But an amendment of the Constitution can be obtained only by means of a federal, not of a national, referendum, pnd the consent of a majority of the States as well as of the people. of the Commonwealth in New South Wales? terests of one State differ from those of another. As has been pointed out in the Age in some powerful articles on this subject, it is proposed to place the immediate personal district wants of the people in opposition to great national wants. One can hardly realize how much money, the Commonwealth will need in order to do its duty by this vast continent. Unless we are to be content 'to occupy only its fringe, abandoning the interior, our expenditure must be enormous.

He would think more of his immediate requirements and the demand of the State Parliament than of the demands of the Federal -developmental work elsewhere. If the agreement is inserted in the Constitution, it will require a revolution to secure its subsequent amendment. what has been said by a gentleman who cannot be referred to as a Nationalist, Sir Hector Carruthers. Speaking at the Brisbane Conference, in 1907, he saidIt is a very serious thing to ask the Commonwealth of Australia to commit itself irrevocably to a scheme of finance between the Commonwealth and the States, the results of .which no man here can forecast. Just look at our revenue for last year. expectations of any man in Australia. The able ; but we know how very few alterations have been made in the equally irrevocable Constitution oi the United States. We know how difficult it would be if anything is put in the Constitution to get it amended under the.complicated process provided by the Constitution. The PRESIDENT -It would be very easy to amend it if it were causing financial dislocation. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS -Tak e this contingency-that it is found that this arrangement works harshly and unjustly to two States, but works favourably to four States. You have then to ask for an amendment of the Constitution against the interests of .the people of four States, and against the interests of the Treasurers of four States, and you have to get that amendment carried by a majority of the people in a majority of the States. You cannot do it. It will be far easier in dealing with a question of this character to get an amendment made by the Federal Parliament than it will be to get an amendment made by the Federal people, .because if you have got four States who are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, and Jhave only to appeal to their -sense of honour to give up something for the benefit of others, it will be very difficult to carry the amendment, especially when some people may think that they would have to give up n certain amount of revenue over and above what they are justly entitled to surrender. It will be very difficult to get people to do that in a young country where expenditure means everythingwhere a settler looks upon expenditure as meaning a road to his land, where expenditure means to another man the keeping up of the rate of wages, or of keeping him in employment. -set personal honour against personal interest, iind that is vvhat will be involved in an amendment of the Constitution. The representatives sitting at this table are men of high motives, with no personal interests to serve, and yet they fight hard for what they think are the rights of their own particular States, and that feeling will permeate the whole community. I would sooner rely upon the process of conference with the Federal Treasurer, and the power of amendment by the Federal Parliament, for an alteration of the terms of the arrangement, than on an amendment of the Constitution. block the proposal. the opinion of a State representative who has been a Minister of the Crown, and has fought the Commonwealth most bitLet me read terly, even as in the wire-netting matter, to the point of force.

It was known that the honourable memberi for Mernda and the honourable member for Flinders would speak, because they had moved the adjournment of the debate; but yet, when these gentlemen took the floor, and also when the honourable member for Parkes addressed the House, it was lamentable to find average attendances of twelve, twenty-three, and twenty respectively.

146,Mr Wise,"The whole circumstanceskeeping down the Commonwealth as much as possible, and elevating the States; and an expression of opinion in the Argus of Monday, 23rd August, is worthy of noteA great Conference, which will be memorable in the history of Australia, has ended in an. agreement which will probably form the financial basis of the Eederation for many years to come. On both sides the momentous nature of the occasion has evidently been f u l ly realized, Western Australia were able to carry out together with the responsibilities resting upon the two great parties to the Federal bondTo these words I drawparticular attention-the Commonwealth with its strictly limited powers, the States with their large charter, comprising all authority not definitely transferred. Then we heard the honourable member for North Sydney say last week that the States needed"" much more money for development purposes than did the , Commonwealth-that the functions allotted to the Commonwealth are not so important as those retained by the States. able member say that that is not true? monwealth are very great; and I should like to quote what the Prime Minister said on the subject when he introduced this motionI take a large view both of the needs and the powers of the Commonwealth; have always done so, and always will. That means when he is ""on his own""I hold that not the mere terms but the plain implications of the Constitution as a whole show that the people of Australia intended, when they adopted .it, and still intend, to make this Parliament their centre of national government. We have not yet exercised all the authority it confers upon us. fulfilled some of its peremptory duties. We studied them (the States) at the expense of the funds of the Commonwealth in a generous and wise spirit, and our electors at subsequent elections distinctly approved. Section 51 of the Constitution shows that there are great powers to be exercised on behalf of all Australia, and sub-section xxxvn. of that section contemplates the exercise of even, greater functions without an amendment of the Constitution. That sub-section gives the Parliament power to make laws with respect toMatters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter, is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law. Under that sub-section there is no limit to the powers that may be exercised by the Commonwealth; indeed, it absolutely con-; templates an extension of our powers, l t is monstrous to assert that our functions are not as important to the development of Australia as are those of the States. Will the Treasurer say that the construction of the raihvay which he desires to Western Australia is not as great a work as any that that State could do for itself? If this work, would the Treasurer press it so earnestly on this House in season and out of season ? work desired? Western Australia cannot, carry out herself, and which she appeals to the Commonwealth to execute. The Treasurer has simply turned a complete somersault on his previous professions. The question whether power shall be given to the States, resolves itself into another question-whe ther or not a Government, commensurate with the exigencies of the Union, shall be established, or, in other words, wbether the Union itself shall be preserved. If we. cripple and place ourselves in shackles, which only a revolution can break, we shall obstruct the progress of Australia for many years ito come; and there is no evading the fact that the responsibility will be ours. We are told that we are merely referring this question to the people, but Ave have no right to refer to them any question in which we do not believe-an y measure that we would not be prepared to pass into law to-morrow. Are we going to say, as has often been said by Legislative Assemblies, "" Thank God there is another place '' ? Are we referring We have not even this question to the people in the hope that they will reject the proposal ? That is not the way to face responsibility. There is no blinking the fact that this matter, which should not be a party matter, is being made one so far as the Government are concerned. bane Labour Conference? the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme; but I may say that nothing has surprised me more than to find this Government, who came into existence for the express purpose of dishing the Labour party, first adopting the caucus method every Thursday, and then coming forward with a financial scheme, the justification for which is that it",35,Deakin

When the honourable member for Riverina made a remark to that effect Last night the Prime Minister interjected, "" Too ridiculous."" I shall show, however, the authority on which the remark was made; and, if the Prime Minister is sincere, I can onlysay, in the words of HamiltonNecessity, especially in politics, often occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a system of measures correspondingly erroneous. Sitting suspended from 1 to 7.45 p.m. House was suspended, I was pointing out that this agreement had been made wholly and solely for party political purposes, and that when the honourable member for Riverina made that statement yesterday, the Prime Minister interjected that it was too ridiculous to need contradiction. Notwithstanding that reply, I repeat that the agreement was made for party purposes. orable member add to the absurdity of the statement by repeating it? the honourable member for Indi as an absurdity, then I must be on safe ground. Let us see what was said by the Argusthe principal press supporter of the present Government and of the agreement made at the Premiers' Conference. Or. the 14th August last, it wroteI f an amendment of the Constitution is required it must be put before the electors or referred at the Federal election in March. The advantage of such a proposition to the Federal Ministry is manifest. assured of the support of the State Premiers in his stern fight with the Labour party. The whole influence of the Premiers in the States will be used in favour of Mr Deakin, as on his continuance in power will depend the permanency of the arrangement. Again, on 19th August, the Argus made this important statementThe Prime Minister thinks the political factor member when he was a candidate for the is even more important' than the financial one. I do not know whether the Argus was in the Prime Minister's confidence, but that was its opinion of what he thought was the most important factor in regard to the but, at the same time, I do not wish an making of the agreement. Does it not erroneous statement to appear in Hansard. justify the statement made by the honorAt the first Federal election, the Argus able' member for Riverina yesterday, and selected me as one of its candidates for repeated by me to-day, that the agreement the Senate as a compliment to the Austrahas been made wholly and solely for party lian Natives' Association, than which no political purposes?

There was only one consideration, and that was the saving of the Fusionand may result in dividing the House of Representatives once more into its three warring and practically helpless parties. This would send the House to the people to fight n threecornered fight, to the great advantage of the Labour-Social ists. There, again, we have the strongest possible reference to party political considerations. As showing that the statement was made not accidentally, but deliberately, I would point out that, on the 20th August, the Argus also wrote* The agreement was drafted and drawn out ready for signature. It provides Mr Deakin with a definite something to fight for at the March elections, and it assures him and the Federal partyIt is little short of impudence to describe the Government party as the Federal partythe support of the State Premiers. There, again, we have the statement that all that was. required to be secured was support for the Fusion Government. The assumption that the whole of the Ministerial party, who had been absolutely ignored in the making of this agreement, would blindly follow whatever the three representatives of the Commonwealth Government chose to agree to at the Conference was certainly very cool. The members of the Ministerial party are not Mr Deakin will be children. There are amongst them men of undoubted independence and ability, but the Argus assumed that they would adopt whatever the representatives of the Commonwealth agreed to. very nice things concerning the honourable Senate.

It is unfortunate that I should have to refer to something that occurred years ago, but I do not wish to do an injustice to any one, or to place any newspaper in a false position. I was selected on the occasion in question as a candidate for the Senate without approaching or being approached by any one. The representatives of the Commonwealth Government entered the Conference presumably to carry out the policy which they, as responsible Ministers, had placed before Parliament in their Ministerial statement; and, no doubt, they had a perfect right to expect that if they made an agreement in accordance with that policy it would be supported by their party. The Argus went so far as to say at the time that it would be the first occasion on which Commonwealth Ministers had attended a Conference of State Premiers knowing that they had behind them a majority which would carry out the agreement at which they arrived. That newspaper evidently assumed that an agreement would be made in the terms of the.Fusion party's compact and the Ministerial programme. As bearing on that point, let me quote a statement which appeared in the Argus on 17th August lastThere is no reason why this Conference should not agree to a division of the Customs and able member's opinion. Excise revenue which will provide for the needs of both States and Commonwealth, but which might be regarded as experimental for the three surer's own words, and it is for honoryears following the next general election.

Hansard sions failed Neither honourable member were also published, and representatives of the Commonwealth at those Conferences insisted that the Commonwealth should refuse to part with the powers conferred upon it. At the Brisbane Conference, the Treasurer scorned the suggestion that the proposed agreement should be inserted in the Constitution. He saidNo, it -was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this shall be the Constitution. And it would be a strange idea for the Parliament of Australia to say to the people "" We are not competent to handle the great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it. We also represent the same people and the same electors."" We the Commonwealth Parliament, say, "" Take back this power. We are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the way you desire."" The right honourable gentleman then thought it would be monstrous to hand back this power to the people. List night, he twitted the honourable member for Hume with having been a great State leader at the Convention, and asked, "" Where was he now?"" I interjected, . "" On the National side."" The Treasurer at the Convention was a great Nationalist leader, but where is he to-day? What a fall, my countrymen !

163,Mr Wise,"I have quoted the Treahas told the House why he was induced to accept this agreement, and, as I have said, both must have been led to do so by political considerations. The Argus has declared that the Prime Minister thought that the political factor was of more importance than the financial one, and that was undoubtedly the only reason that could have induced him to do.what he has done. He has thrown over every one. He has thrown over his own party for some reason which has not been disclosed, but we are told that political considerations prevailed with him, and that this agreement is designed to assure the Prime Minister and his party, at the next general election, the support of the State Premiers in their stern fight against the Labour party. Who is making this a party question? Who, for the first time, has dragged it down from being a great issue to a mere party question, in which the ins and outs of this House are to be the primary, and the country a secondary, consideration? This House has not treated it as a party question, and I venture, to say that honourable members do not intend to treat it as such. We have had honourable members on both sides of the House taking different views, and honourable members in direct Opposition have not, in any of their speeches, made the matter a party one. Similarly, neither the honourable member for Mernda nor the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Parkes nor the honourable member for Balaclava, has made it a party question. They have risen above all parties, and so should we. What does the life or death of any political party in this House, or in the country, matter, if the country is to be shackled ? I have been all my life a strong Liberal and a strong Protectionist, but what is the good of the triumph of Liberalism or Protection if, when it gets into power, it finds itself shackled, and can do nothing? What will its victory avail if it is in a Parliament which has practically no powera Parliament which has lost its supremacy, the power of the purse, which, as the Prime Minister said, is the object of the great struggle now in progress a Parliament whose members are net the chief rulers, because they do not possess the money? What will be the good of such a position, whatever Ministry may be in power? matter in dealing with which, on the present occasion, we ought to rise altogether above all the parties in this House? I have been as strong a party man as there is in this Chamber, but I say emphatically that in this great contest of' National interests and State RightsI put all parties aside. I am prepared to work with any man, no matter where he sits, so long as he is a Nationalist. The honourable member for Wide Bay remarked that the agreement had been brought about by a combination, and that it would probably have to be defeated by another combination. I welcome those words, and hope that they are prophetic of the future. It seems to me that if this fight is to take place the present division of parties in the House must be scattered to the winds, and we must go to the country on the great issue of Nationalism versus State Rights. There is no issue upon which I would go more gladly to the country, or more gladly fight upon. I am prepared to work in that fight side by side with the honourable member for Mernda, the honourable member for Parkes, and the honourable member for Flinders, and any others on that side of the House, and also with every member on this side who is of the same way of thinking. would be! fight with them until this great national question had been fought out. It would, indeed, be a noble fusiona fusion founded, not for the sake of office, or for a party advantage, or for the purpose of dishing another party in this House, but for the purpose of establishing once and for all in this Federation the paramountcy of the National Parliament. When it had achieved that purpose, it could cease to exist. Whether it lasted a leng or short time it would last, I hope, until the victory was won, and from that point of view the shorter the time it lasted the better. If I had my way, such a fusion would hold together until the fight was won, and then would break up into its component parts, when each man would be entitled to hold, without any reflection on his colleagues, the individual opinions which he holds now on other subjects. I take up the position that was taken up at the Convention, and* has always been maintained until this year by Commonwealth Governments-that the questions of the transfer of the State debts Is not this a and of a contribution by the Commonwealth to the State revenues are bound inseparably together, and must be settled at one and the same time. I was asked, as a",38,Brown Th E Honourable Reports Of Previous Conferences Of Premiers
164,Mr Palmer,What a Fusion that,39,Brown Th E Honourable Reports Of Previous Conferences Of Premiers
165,Mr Wise,"I should be prepared tosupporter of the last Deakin Government, to accept the scheme that they put forward, founded as it was upon the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. His was a business-like proposal, framed and put forward by a financier as a financier. It was just to the Commonwealth and to the States, and was prepared without any consideration of the interests of either Ministry or Opposition. It. was the effort of a man who knew what he was doing. sound commercial basis, and his scheme could stand any criticism that could be brought to bear upon it. I was expected, and was ready, to accept that scheme as a supporter of the last Deakin Government. I took the trouble, during the last recess and doing justice to Commonwealth and the one before, to explain it and extol it on many platforms. I asked the people to think over'it, and to express their approval of it, but now I am asked by the same Prime Minister, who has thrown that.scheme into the waste-paper basket, to abandon every item in it, and take up this miserable political agreement, which propores to put into the Constitution for all time a per capita arrangement that will operate increasingly to our detriment. Every industry that we build up as the result of our Protective Tariff will reduce importations. Every man we induce to come to this country to enter into those industries, by virtue of our Protective Tariff, will be an extra burden on the Commonwealth to the extent of 25s. per annum, and the result of any successful Protective Tariff will, therefore, be to hit the Commonwealth on both sides, because it will lose its revenue and have its expenditure increased. We can get as great a revenue as we like, if we choose to spoil the protective incidence of the Tariff, or to load it with revenue duties in addition to protective duties. The business-like course for us to adopt is to take up again the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. He showed us haw it would fit into the 25s. per head proposal. He pointed out the difference between his original scheme and that put forward by the honourable member for Hume when Treasurer of the last Deakin Government, the latter extending the number of years in which the contributions should be made by the Commonwealth to the States, and making other variations which did not, however, affect the principle. He showed how the 25s. per head contribution, if continued until the population reached a little Mr Wise. over 7,000,000, would amount to the total interest on the State debts, and proved that, with the present rate of increase of population, that point would be reached at just about the same period as was aimed at in the Lyne-Deakin scheme. That is my scheme. It is the scheme I support, and I am satisfied that every business man in the House will support it also,if he is allowed to have a free hand and to exercise his individual judgment. HonHe started from a orable members must remember that that scheme was not put forward as a party proposal. It was formulated by a financial man of no mean standing, wholly and solely for the purpose of settling the problem for ever on a financial basis, and of States alike. Carry out that scheme, and you have finality, as the Minister of External Affairs said at Toowoomba in the presence of the Prime Minister. That honourable gentleman called it ' the Deakin1 Government's scheme "" at that time, and declared that it would, if adopted, put an end to all the existing friction and troublea consummation which is absolutely necessary in the interests of the progress of Australia and of the proper paramountcy of the National Parliament. It is well to repeat, as the honourable member for Mernda pointed out, that his scheme did no injustice to the States. I have been sorry to hear honourable members say, by way of interjection, even after the honourable member for Mernda spoke the other night, that his scheme would injure the States. I do not know whether those honourable members heard the honourable member for Mernda. I have already referred to their magnificent attendances when that speech, and the speeches of the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes were being made. I might even add to those the speech of the honourable member for Balaclava to-day. He was honoured, when speaking, with the presence of about eight Ministerialists, and for a quarter of an hour there was not even a Minister in the chamber. The honourable member for Mernda pointed out that the States will not be deprived of revenue if their debts are taken over. Mr .JOSEPH COOK -The honourable member is making a great mistake. I do not think that at any time all the Ministers were absent from the chamber when the honourable member for Balaclava was speaking. Minister of Defence can contradict me, seeing that he was not in the chamber at the time. ber during nearly the whole of that speech. deliberately that the Postmaster-General, who was in charge of the Chamber this morning, went out, and was away for at least a quarter of an hour before his place was taken by the Minister of External affairs. I challenge the Minister of Defence, or anybody else, to contradict that statement. little value can be placed on the interjections of the Minister of Defence. I have often paid considerable attention to interjections by him to the effect that certain statements were incorrect, because I assumed that he was speaking with knowledge, but in the future I shall attach no weight to any assertion of that character coming from him. The honourable member for Mernda showed clearly that it is not correct to say that the States require the money it is proposed to give them to carry on their vast and expensive works, because all the money that they have received up to the present from the Commonwealth has not been sufficient to paj the interest on their debts. If we take over the debts, and apply the money towards the interest,the States will be no worse off than they are at present. They will have all the rest of their revenue, as they have now, to carry on their developmental works. The interesting balance-sheet prepared by the honourable member for Mernda, and incorporated in Hansard, shows clearly and emphatically, and beyond dispute, that the States have had no money from the Commonwealth that they could apply to developmental works, because it has all gone to pay the interest on the debts. Not even the Minister of Defence would dare to assert that that balance-sheet is incorrect-and that is saying a great deal. sulting innuendo. be made by the Government to place any of its supporters in a false position in regard to this matter, but that they will be left free to do what they think best in the interests of Australia. seems to assume that the supporters of the Government do not consider themselves free. strong appeals which have been made by Ministerialists have received no recognition from the Prime Minister. He has not even given a nod of his head, though one of them thought that he did on one occasion. It should be realized that the matter in hand is of infinitely greater importance than the interests of parties. What would -be the loss of our seats at the next election compared with the injury which would be done to Australia by shackling this Parliament? Leg-roping is too weak a word. A leg rope may be broken, but it would take a revolution to break these shackles. Why should we store up trouble for those who are to come after us ? I have never known a responsibility so great as that which now rests on honourable members. The proposed arrangement is not to be for a day only. We cannot say, "" It will see us through, and, ' after us, the Deluge.' "" The settlement will affect those who follow us. Few of us who voted for Federation hope to see the full accomplishment of the benefits of that step. We voted for it because we thought that it would result in good to Australia. When we become a population of 20,000,000, in the time spoken of by the honourable member for Mernda, what wil] be the position of the Commonwealth if it has to raise ,£25,000,000 for the Governments of the States to spend without the odium and trouble of taxing their people? How will the Commonwealth develop the Northern Territory, construct its railways, and provide for, not merely the conservation of water for irrigation, but also for its supply to such places as the Tanami gold-fields? been asked to give a water supply to that gold-field ? sary to take notice of a frivolous interjection by one who has not the faintest idea of the seriousness and importance of the question which is being discussed. water supply to Tanami is frivolous enough. those who opposed the Treasurer's action in giving a water supply to Coolgardie.

Once the proposed agreement is put into the Constitution, it will require almost a revolution to take it out again. We have no right, in the interests of party, to create such trouble for the future. I hope that the Prime Minister will respond to the appeals which have been made to him, not by children, but by men who have held high positions in the Parliaments of their States, and who knew the weight of their words. They cannot be told to take back their words or put the Government out of office. No vote on this question would do that. It is necessary to have an Opposition willing to take office in order to dislodge a Ministry. The members of the Opposition have not made this a party question, each of them being free to vote as he thinks proper regarding it. The scheme can be defeated by the Opposition only with the assistance of Ministerialists, and such a combination would not be formed for the purpose of getting office. Ministers should either take back their proposal, or ask the country what it thinks of their action. said that I would approve of the adoption of the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, or, to give it its later name, of the Deakin-Lyne scheme, as a permanent settlement. That scheme should have been put forward by this Ministry, seeing that it has such a strong following. As another scheme has been proposed, I ask the Government to remember the Fusion agreement, its declaration on this subject in its policy statement, the situation outlined in the letters of the Prime Minister to the Premier of New South Wales, and the suggestion of the Argus for an interim agreement for three years. be fixed, because it would force the next Parliament to settle the matter. longer we delay making a permanent settlement, the greater will be the trouble. now opposing a permanent settlement. does not affect the State debts at all, and the financial question cannot be settled without providing for the taking over of the debts. It is significant that there are to be two referenda. When the Treasurer Central Auswas asked last night why this is proposed, he said, "" We wish to give the people greater latitude. They may vote for one really being invited to do that. The Premiers, in the political dark hole of Calcutta in which they conferred with the Prime Minister, promised to support the Fusion party and the agreement which is now being discussed, but they were prepared to allow the proposal relating to the debts to look after itself. Why approach the States in regard to these matters? It would be well to obtain a harmonious settlement, if possible, but the Constitution has imposed upon this Parliament the duty of coming to a determination. The people accepted the Constitution on the advice of the Premiers of the day. As the Treasurer said at one of the Conferences, this Parliament represents the same people as do the State Parliaments, and if our legislation seems to prejudice their interests, they can remedy their grievances at the ballot-box. Therefore, we should accept our constitutional responsibility. As a permanent settlement cannot be made now, let us adopt an interim agreement. As I have said, I should like that interim agreement to be for three I have already years, but, for the sake of peace, I would vote for an agreement for five years. That period, however, would be long enough. Nothing would be gained by adopting a period of fifteen or twenty years.

185,Mr Henry Willis (Robertson),"I feel it my duty to say that this is not the best, wisest, or most equitable scheme which could be propounded by any Government or any Parliament. I say "" by any Parliament "" because 1 think that Parliament"" should be taken into its confidence by a Government in regard to any agreement which is to last for fifty or sixty years. I _ was in favour of the last Conference, although 1 disapproved of all previous ones. My view has been that the. Commonwealth Government should make known its financial policy to the Sitates, and that they should arrange for their financial needs accordingly. ferring with the Premiers of the States on this occasion, had one or two difficulties to face. with a deficit of ,£1,200,000, proposed to be met by the issue of short-dated 'bills, Treasury bonds, or an arrangement with the States. When speaking on the Budget, I said that it was unsound to provide for the payment of old-age pensions with borrowed money, but that I thought that . if the Premiers were approached, they would be willing to make provision for the -expenditure, seeing that three of the States would be relieved of their obligations in this respect, while the other three would obtain pensions for their citizens much sooner , than could otherwise be arranged for. The Minister of Defence scouted the idea, ,but I am happy to say that the timely suggestion was acted on, and the Government have the promise of the States to find ,£600,000 this year for the payment of old-age pensions. The Prime Minister was confronted with the further fact that next year he will be short £1,000,000; and although this was referred-to by the honourable gentleman himself, it has not, so far, been mentioned in this debate. There has to be provided ,£1,600,000 in order to keep faith with the poor old people, who have claims on our resources quite as great % : as those of our public servants. But the Prime Minister, having stated his requirements to the Premiers, said there must be some definite arrangement, so that the Commonwealth should be able to pay what was required from its own resources, and . not be subject to the whims of the States, who might give grudgingly. He told the States that he would require .£3,100,000 for _the future in order to keep .faith in regard to the administration of old-age pensions, lighthouses, and quarantine ; and provision is made under the agreement to that end. No preparation, however, has been made for future payments under the naval agreement; and on this point we have yet to hear a good deal. The Prime Minister, having made these facts clear to the Premiers, practically threw his proposals on the table and said, "" You may divide the balance amongst yourselves."" The Premier of Western Australia said that the condition on which that State would find a proportion of the £1,600,000 was the payment to it of ,£3,250,000-the capitalized sum of £250,000 per annum, to be liquidated at the rate of ,£10,000 a year. Those The Prime Minister, in conStates which had not Old-age PensionsActs declined to contribute as much as those States which have, although it was felt inHis Government was confronted cumbent on all the States to make provision for the aged poor. Here we see the States grabbing as much as possible; and the State of New Sotuh. Wales has been called upon to pay all the money demanded by the other States. I do not regard this -as a fiscal question, but as a financial question pure and simple. The Prime Minister put the matter very fairly; and, therefore, I cannot understand honourable members devoting so much attention to statistics relating to the raising of revenue tnrough the Customs. The honourable gentleman said that we have the Tariff in our own hands, subject to no conditions and no deductions'-that it is for us, when need arises, to make the Tariff more Protective or more revenue-producing. tion now, but if we adopt the agreement we shall not have the same liberty. just as much liberty whatever agreement may be adopted; and there is no doubt we shall have to alter the Tariff before very long. The Prime Minister said that, as duties that are Protective become effective, the returns from them will decline, and that the Tariff will be adapted and readapted to the needs of the industries of the country. That is the Protectionists' contention, and it is sound from their point of view. If it is necessary to raise more money, says the honourable gentleman, we may do so, and in this connection we have only to consult history and to see what was done in New South Wales. In that State the wage earners were relieved of taxation amounting to ,£800,000 a year, while the burden was placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear if. If we desire a Protectionist Tariff we can have one, and in the same",42,Brown Th E Honourable Reports Of Previous Conferences Of Premiers

187,Mr Henry Willis,"We shall haveTariff enormous sums of money may be raised on manufactures which do not receive Protection. That position the Prime Minister put very clearly and tersely before the House; but when the honourable gentleman told the States that they could do what they liked with the balance, so long as the Commonwealth received £3,100,000,' I think he acted most unfairly to the State of New South Wales, which was at the mercy of the ""majority. The Premier of New South Wales, when he returned from the Conference, said that his State would lose .£[660,000 a year under the scheme, according to which Western Australia is to be paid the capitalized sum of £[3,250,000-that , as a matter of fact, New South Wales will have to pay £40,000 a year of this sum which, according to the Premier, will increase her loss to ,£700,000 a year, although, according to . the Minister, that State will lose .£1,066,519 a year. A remarkable feature is that Victoria will lose but £[370,053 a year, although the difference between thc population of the two States is not great. When we entered Federation, the price arranged upon was the retention by the Commonwealth Government of one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue. only. price of Federation-the cost of starting and lubricating the machinery-to say nothing of the services taken over. The Commonwealth really gets nothing excessive; and what we do is to pay for the services which otherwise would have to be conducted by the. States themselves. The States suffer no loss collectively by our takvided. It has landed us in a deficit of ing over the services; some of them may lose more than their proportion, but one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue is the price of Federation, and it is the balance of the three-fourths with which we have to deal and not with the one-fourth. The operation of the Braddon section will terminate shortly; and, with that in view, bookkeeping statistics have been in preparation at the borders for a number of years. It is most unsatisfactory that bookkeeping should be necessary for a longer period than that provided in the Constitution; but the collection of statistics, made at enormous expense, should not go for nothing; the available data should be utilized in the interests of the States rather than thrown aside, as was done when the Conference took place. Whilst the Prime Minister will £ ^3> 7°>945 under, what is called the et 1 Melbourne agreement, that will not carry him far, because next year he will require ,£1,000,000, which will have to be'debited to the year following, seeing that it is anticipatory. That money will have to be deducted in the second year from now, when the balance available to the Prime Minister will be £2,100,000-indeed , rather less than £[2,000,000, considering that he has to pay the State of Western Australia a large sum annually for twenty-five years. If an accident happens at the elections, the new Parliament will be confronted with the possibility of having to pay invalid pensions. able member regard as an ""accident""? Prime where the accident may be. I refer to the defeat of the Government. If t'he payment of those pensions be decided upon by a mere stroke of the pen, the Prime Minister, or his successor, will have lost all the advantages he sought from the Premiers at the Conference, and his balance will have gone. As to the interjection by the honourable member for Grey, I may say that the stroke of the pen is not an accident, but the deliberate act of the Governor General on the advice of his Ministers.

I , personally, am in favour of bringing that part of the Act into operation as soon as we have the money. If it is said that we have not at our disposal the necessary funds and cannot obtain them the 'Act should be repealed. We should not pass a measure unless we intend to give effect to it.

193,Mr Henry Willis,"The late Gorouted, as in all probability they will be thought. There will be a lot of Labour men in this House after the honourable member has ceased to be a member of it. here for all time. I desire to deal fairly with this question. Some of the greatest parties in Great Britain have been from time to time routed at the polls. That has been the experience both of the Liberal party and the Conservative party in England, and the Labour party here may be routed at the next general election. If they are, more good will have been done for Australia than would be effected by the people in returning them in a majority. Tf they are returned in a minority a reaction in Labour and Socialist circles will at once take place, and the moderates of the Labour party will probably seek an alliance with the advanced Liberals on this side of the House. No more advanced Liberal than the Prime Minister could be found. In that respect he is far ahead of most of his colleagues, and I think that the moderate section of the Labour party I exclude, of course, the Socialists who would nationalize the sources of production, distribution, and exchange-coul d form an alliance with him. When the Labour Ministry was defeated the London Times stated that such an alliance as I have indicated should be brought about, and I am not quite certain that any great harm would follow from it. The extremists would certainly be curbed. In' passing, I may say that it is well to have extremists on both sides. The Prime Minister himself is an extremist, and will keep his Ministry well up to the mark. There are advanced Liberals on this side of the House just as' there are among the Opposition honourable members who, although unconscious of the fact, are Conservatives. Some of the State Premiers who met in Conference and drew up this agreement had not the confidence of their respective Parliaments nor of the electors. The Queensland Premier, for instance, had a majority of one, and immediately after endorsing an agreement which would tie up the Commonwealth for all time he returned to Brisbane and asked the Governor to grant him a dissolution. Having learned from an influential source that he could obtain a dissolution he asked for it, the request was granted, and he has gone to the country in the hope of securing a majority that will enable his Government to carry on. Then, again, the Government of South Australia has a majority of only one, which may disappear at any moment. Surely Ministers so situated are not competent to make an agreement such as that now before us. The Federal Parliament represents the people, and to it belongs the duty of drawing up financial proposals for submission to the electors. The question is not one upon which a Government should be brought into existence or turned out of office. It should be our duty to frame a fair proposition for submission to the people, and, having done so, we should call upon them to support it. We certainly ought not to ask them to support an unjust scheme which has in it the elements of robbery. Tasmania is most anxious that this agreement shall remain in force for all time. The people of that State have gained more from Federation than have the people of any other State of the Union. is mistaken. will be said that, as the result of Federation, New South Wales and Victoria have gained a largely increased trade with Tasmania, but the question should not be viewed from that stand-point alone. What we have to consider is the way in which the masses of the people have been affected. 1 have the authority of the honourable member for Denison, whom we all respect and revere, for the statement that the masses of the people of Tasmania who do not use intoxicants or narcotics are not called upon to contribute, to the cost of government, more than 135. per head by way of Customs duties. That is something over which we may well rejoice. To provide more for the cost of government, Tasmania has resorted to direct taxation, and has placed the burden upon those who are able to bear it. Those who have gained wealth by reason of the progress of Australia and industry of the masses are called upon by means of a land tax and an income tax to contribute to the cost of government a proportion which they were not formerly called upon to bear. come tax starts at £100. There is not much wealth about that. member for Franklin last night made an appeal to the House on behalf of the "" fat men "" of Tasmania.

When Federation was being advocated some of the principal leaders in the movement declared that if it were brought about one State would not be called upon to pay the debts of another. Each State, it was said, would have to provide for the expenditure within its boundaries. Are we going now to pauperize Tasmania by handing to her money taken f 10m the larger States? Are we, by means of taxation, to take money out of the pockets of the poor of the larger States so that the rich of Tasmania may not be called upon to pay that which they ought to do? is quite mistaken. we take out of the pockets of the poor of the larger States money to make good a deficiency in the nnances of Tasmania? The receipt of such assistance would be unworthy of Tasmania, and would mean breaking faith with the people of Australia, who were told that they would get for all time that which they, subscribed. asked for anything. disgusting to hear honourable members first on one side of the House, and then on the other, clamouring for Tasmanian wants, and yet unprepared to agree to the expenditure of a shilling if it will have to be borne by that State. In the immediate past it contributed largely to the starvation of postal necessities and telephone proposals. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Tasmani a has the highest rate of direct taxation. Several honourable members' interjecting, members not to interrupt the honourable member for Robertson by suggestions or comments. They may be made at a later stage. vide honourable members with an argument; I cannot provide them with an understanding. ber would provide the House with a few facts we should be satisfied. ported my statement as to Tasmania having benefited by Federation by quoting the statement of the honourable member for Denison that the masses in that State who do not use intoxicants or narcotics contribute only 13s. per head to the Customs and Excise revenue. the contribution paid by the masses in Australia who did not use intoxicants or narcotics. standing may have arisen as to the actual figures, but the position I take up is a sound one. Tasmania has a shortage and proposes to make it good by taxing the rich. If there was in operation there a Tariff as high as that which prevailed in Tasmania prior to Federation the rich would not be contributing to the cost of government as much as they do now, and the poor would be paying more. That being so, the poor people of Tasmania are better off under Federation than, they were before. That State has reached the position which New South Wales occupied when the right honourable member for East Sydney, as Premier, reduced the Customs burden on the people to the extent of .£800,000 per annum and called upon the rich to contribute more by way of direct taxation. The rich naturally groaned and were very disagreeable ; but that is always the position when direct taxation is resorted to. No Government worthy of the name would tax the poor. The most commendable form of legislation is that which taxes those who have instead of those who have not honourable member will find that I have paraphrazed a Scriptural quotation. Possibly he means Henry George, who was a Single Taxer. He would not tax the poor, but he pointed out that the poor did not realize that they were being taxed by this form of indirect taxation. He likened it to plucking the goose without making it cry. He said that the poor were paying taxes on many things on their breakfast tables, although they did not know it, but the rich man knows when he is paying, and he cries. He uses his influence in such a way that few are able to withstand it. That is why the members representing Tasmania are always clamouring against expenditure. They know from the past that in their State the influence of the moneyed class is against expenditure, because it will lessen the amount of Customs duties returned to them.

When the latter wrote to the public press, the former replied that he would make an answer shortly, but he has not yet done so. press at all on the subject. honourable gentleman to the Hansard report for last year for Senator Pulsford's criticism of his scheme. Senator Pulsford knocked the bottom out of the honourable member's scheme, showing that it was that of a novice who did not know what he was about, and was past the thinking out of a problem such as this. It was pathetic to see the honourable member for Mernda recently sitting at the table to assist the Prime Minister in the elucidation of his proposals. member for Robertson been so long in bringing forward his scheme? able member consults Hansard of some years back he will find that I suggested a scheme for the consolidation of the States debts vastly superior, perhaps, in the minds of some people, to that which is so highly thought of by him. The proposal I now submit is an equitable one, based on the actual capitalized value of the sums paid to the States'in 1907-8, which are the starting point of the Melbourne agreement now under consideration. Under my scheme, the smaller States would not be pauperised, but would have the revenue from the debts assets, which represent hundreds of borrowed millions. The interest and the principal would be liquidated in something like, sixty years by a sinking fund; and the -Commonwealth would gain by the consolidation of the loans. What would the Commonwealth do with the money? Would the people sanction the dropping of the balance into the Yarra? The States would suffer nothing at the hands of the Commonwealth, because when we had money for whicli we had no use it would be our duty to pass it on to the States, who have the means of spending it? of what the Commonwealth will do in the future r refer honourable members to the past. £6,000,000 to the States, without being called upon to do so, and we have paid it willingly, as I am sure we would again. The contribution of 14s. 3d. would be statutory; and I point out to the Prime Minister, who is now present, that, while he talks of giving the States 25s. per head, he, in the same breath, speaks of taking from them the former sum. Instead of conjuring with figures and mystifying the people, why not say at once that the States write to the shall pay the Commonwealth 14s. 3d. per capita? It is not necessary to provide for the contribution in the Constitution, seeing that we represent the same people; and the arrangement would be re-adjustable, because, as soon as less than 14s. 3d. was necessary, so much less would be paid by the States. The Prime Minister said, on the authority of the Treasurer, that, covering a period of years, there would be a 'saving of .£26,000,000 by the consolidation of the public debts; and, if that be so, what would be done with those millions? They would, no doubt, be put to some legitimate purpose for the benefit of the States of the Union -There would be, under the consolidation gains, money enough and to spare for expanding requirements, so that more than 14s. 3d. would not be necessary. Under the Prime Minister's proposals we see that, in three years from the present date, if invalid pensions be brought into operation, he will be in the same position that he is in today-o n bedrock. The proposal to pay 25s. per head is unsound and unjust, inasmuch as it has no basis, and actuarially will not work to any just conclusion, start where we may.

244,Mr Mathews,"I beg to draw attentionmember for Perth infers that special provision should be made for Western Australia, because the people of that State pay more per head in Customs and Excise. But the reason for the increased sum per head is that the State contains a larger adult male population than does, say, the State of Victoria, and, therefore, more dutiable goods are consumed. gotten that £1,000 a day is sent from Western Australia through the Money Order Office. males from Victoria had taken their wives and babies with them to Western Australia, the rate in Victoria would have been higher per head, and that in Western Australia lower, seeing that every infant would be considerfed in estimating the population. When I visited Western Australia, the party included the Prime Minister, the Treasurer"" The Emperor of the West"""" -and Senator Trenwith, and wherever we went the last-mentioned was greeted by the Victorians there as an old friend; and the interjection of. the honourable member for Fremantle only shows what a great number of the Western Australian wage-earners are from Victoria. people only ask for a part of what they have paid. proposal Western Australia would be given justice; she would be credited with all the revenue paid through the Customs, and no debit made on account of the families left in the eastern Slates. ister urged with much force that we should trust the people, and declared that, on the face of it, his proposal ought to be supported by the House, since it is one which will be decided, not by this Parliament, but by the people themselves. He seemed to think that we should display weakness in refusing to allow the agreement in its present form to be submitted to the people. But the reason why we think that it should not be sent to the people in a form which may subsequently be found to be unjust and unsound is that if it were once embodied in the Constitution, it would not be easy if desired by the majority of the electors, to take it out. from the Constitution only by the will of a majority of the people, in a majority of the States of the Commonwealth. When the larger States reached a stage of development at which the burden cast upon them by this agreement would be far more ""oppressive than it would be at the present time, they would clamour for an amendment of the Constitution, but the smaller States, representing a minority of the people of the Commonwealth, could prevent that amendment being made. South Australia is one of the largest in territory, but from the stand-point of population she is only a small State, and with Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, representing only one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, could prevent effect being given to. the will of the remaining two-thirds in New South Wales and Victoria. It is for that reason that I and others object to the agreement providing for the return to the States for all time of 25s. per head of the population being inserted in the Constitution. The smaller States, like Oliver Twist, ask for more. South Wales is the milch cow of the Commonwealth. honourable member to prove that she is not.

253,Mr Henry Willis,"And even inWales, a scheme that will not allow Tasmania to receive large sums of money, drawn from the masses of the people in the larger States, in order that it may avoid taxing the wealthy members of its community. I hope that no one will be so imposed upon as to be led to believe that the scheme propounded by the honourable member for Mernda is a sound one. The Prime Minister, in speaking well of it, can only be patronizing the honourable member. The Treasury officials will tell honourable members that it is unsound and does not provide for justice being done to the larger States. A concise scheme should be submitted, to the State Premiers for acceptance and the payment made statutory. There should be no tinkering with the Constitution. There should, of course, be a referendum to provide for the taking over of the debts of the States which have accumulated since the establishment of Federation, but an arrangement with the States by which the Commonwealth would be indemnified to the extent of 14s. 3d. per head of the population would be but statutory. That would prevent any shortage in the future. Under the agreement now before us, however, the Commonwealth would be faced with a deficit. Invalid pensions must be paid or the provision repealed. As a member of a previous Government, the Prime Minister favoured the payment of invalid pensions, and I pin my faith to him. I believe that he is both progressive and sincere, and that .part of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, which provides for the payment of invalid pensions, must either be repealed or honoured. If it is honoured, then, even under the scheme now submitted to us by the Government, we shall have a shortage in the finances of the Commonwealth when proposed obligations are assumed. Under the arrangement that I suggest, however, there would not and could not be a deficiency, and justice would be done to the States. Every pound taken from the States would be used by the Commonwealth in liquidating the cost of a service which would otherwise be a charge upon them. We are one people with one destiny. . . Sail on, O ship of State! Sail on, O union strong and great ! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate ' [9-57]-I rise to address myself to the subing districts, it is catching on. It is going ject under discussion with a great deal of diffidence, because, in the first place, I have not yet become properly acclimatised in the atmosphere of the House, and consequently feel a little nervous; while, in the second place, I recognise the far-reaching importance of the question before us. It is undoubtedly greater than any other question that has engaged the attention of the Federal Parliament. The lucid and illuminating exposition of the financial position given by the Prime Minister has, in my opinion, raised Federation immeasurably in the public estimation. It has kindled hope and expectation in the minds of many people who were fearful lest with the cessation of the operation of the Braddon clause, there should be eliminated altogether from the Constitution that protection which it afforded the States, and without which there could have been no Federation. I have listened with very great interest to the analytical . and instructive speeches of the honourable member for Mernda, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Parkes. I readily admit that their criticism demands our most earnest and careful attention, because of the authority with which they speak on financial questions; but I cannot by any means accept their conclusions. I wish particularly to congratulate the honourable member for North Sydney upon his magnificent, practical and forcible address on this question. That speech came from an honourable member who enjoys the confidence of every member on both sides of the House. It was entirely free from party bias or party considerations, and was similar to a statement which he made to the public press of Sydney many months ago before any idea of the combination which resulted in the Fusion on this side of the House was entertained at all. I congratulate my honourable friend all the more, because he voiced exactly my opinions on the matter, and I feel that his splendid speech will be highly appreciated throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. I range myself by his side and intend to follow him in support of the agreement entirely as it stands. We have had a good many policies propounded during the debate^ but there can be only one agreement, and I stand with the honourable member for North Sydney in his support of that submitted by the Government, because it is the best solution yet offered of the difficulty. I believe that throughout the Com-",51,Statement Showing Gain Or Loss To The Several States Under Suggested Scheme On The Amounts Payable
254,"Mr Richard Foster (Wakefield) Monwealth, And Particularly In The Produc","to be an extremely popular policy, because it meets pressing needs and breathes the true spirit of nationhood, in spite of what many professed Nationalists may say to the contrary. A good many of those who use the high sounding title of ""Nationalist"" were at one time, it should be remembered, anti-Federalists liyht up to the hilt, and there is, therefore-, every reason to accept their present dev.l a ration of faith with a considerable amount of suspicion. The Braddon section U pretty well understood by the people from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and is particularly understood by Mio ptnducers, at all events in South Australia, I believe the farmers are more interested in the Braddon section than they are in anything else outside the Bible. If you speak to them about politics, they are bound in nine cases out of ten to introduce the Braddon section and to express their intense anxiety as to what rr.ay happen at the termination of the ten years' period. As has already been pointed out, that section was, in the first instance, intended to permanently continue the return to the States of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and not only 25s. per capita, which is a very different thing. That section is the axis upon which all financial considerations turn. It is the crucial test to which the attention of the. people was invited, and it was the security which it offered to the people of the States that vvon the fight for the Union. The original intention of the framers of the Constitution undoubtedly was that it should be for all time, and the limitation that was put upon it was a compromise adopted in order to secure Federation at that time. The leaders of political thought, when the Constitution was put to the people with that limitation in it, urged the people to trust the National Parliament .to do ample justice to them at the end of the ten years' period when that section became alterable. The prospective Commonwealth elector pledged the future of the country upon that trust. We should be recreant to that trust if we allowed any political or party consideration to prevail against the permanent continuance of that financial security which was paramount in the minds of those who framed the Constitution under which we are now governed. So far as the idea of Nationalism as against State Rights is concerned, the truest path to nationhood is the encouragement of the vigorous growth and development of every State of the Union. If we realize aright our obligations in this Parliament, they should lea3 us not only to defend the rights of the National Parliament, but just as earnestly to give the individual States a fair and honest deal. A national sentiment can be created only by a National Parliament which uses its powers in the direction of a discriminating interpretation of the people's needs, and in the faithful and conscientious discharge of public duties in a way that will win public confidence. I maintain that any such attitude as is altogether too manifest in the National Parliament to-day, instead of tending to promote the supremacy of that Parliament in the good will and affections of the people, will rather continue the friction which is now altogether too apparent from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. After all the stress that was placed -by the framers of the Constitution upon this principle of protection to the States, it is inconceivable that before ten years of the life of the Federal Parliament have passed by there should be such a strong and unreasoning desire on the part of so many in that Parliament to control the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. The expression of that desire by so many members, in spite cf the fact that the Federal Parliament has the whole field of taxation to cover, while the resources of the State Parliaments are exceedingly limited, is a striking comment on the foresight of the late Sir Edward Braddon in suggesting section 87. The experience of the United States-if we want an example from experience-shoul d lead us to affirm the desirability of continuing to the States the protection which was afforded under that section. Throughout the history of that country the trouble of the National Parliament appears to-have been an embarrassment of riches, whilst the States have experienced a corresponding degree of poverty and difficulty. The fear of Federation in the minds of the people of Australia at the beginning was its cost, and that fear is not yet removed. I believe the majority of the people cling as tenaciously to the principle embodied_in the Braddon section as they N did at the beginning. I am sure that the most ardent Nationalist in this Parliament must admit that had it not been for the provision of the Braddon section Federation would have been impossible. The expectation on the part of the people of the States that, following the establishment of Federation, there would be a corresponding reduction in the cost of the Governments of the individual States, has not been realized. remind the honourable member that from his point of view it is not likely to be realized, Parliament to do justice to the States. and it is a good thing for the Commonwealth that it has not been. On the contrary, the field of operations of the States has been extended from time to time, and, through the altered conditions, the present and prospective developments in the States must involve increasing financial provision. That very position constitutes the greatest hope for the future of the Commonwealth and of the National Parliament. and National Parliament and the States, which was recognised as necessary at first, is a principle which ought to be recognised now. For every argument that could be advanced at the inception of Federation in favour of providing this safeguard, as a fair, prudent, and cautious thing to do, at least two arguments can be advanced now. The position of the States to-day shows how greatly they need this assistance from the Commonwealth revenues. Some speakers have urged the readjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States to meet the necessities of the situation, from time to time, and a five-year, and even a three year, period has been mentioned. Such an arrangement would not promote the growth of a national spirit, but would intensify the distrust of this Parliament, if such distrust exists There is every reason for the equitable sharing of the Customs and Excise revenue between the Commonwealth ancl the States. The framers of the Constitution were the leading statesmen and the biggest minds in the political life of Australia at the time. They had had long training in the Parliaments of the States, ancl had had much administrative experience. moment that the Commonwealth Parliament would ever demand the control of the whole of the Customs and Excise .revenue, and were prepared to provide that three-fourths of it should go to the States for all time. That provision was subsequently amended to give it force for ten years only ; but if it is to be contended that a -per capita return of 25s. is unreasonable, and likely to destroy the future supremacy of this Parliament, the position must be thoroughly investigated from every point of view. In this matter I follow implicitly the lead of the honourable member for North Sydney, who has had wide experience, and possesses great practical knowledge. It will be in the interests of the National Those who propose periodical adjustments, and particularly the honourable member who has suggested a readjustment every three years, would place the States in the position of mendicants, making them come as suppliants to the Commonwealth for what properly belongs to them. It will pay the Commonwealth to recognise this right of the States to a share in the revenue. The miserable spirit which has prompted the The sharing of the Customs suggestions to which 1 have referred is Excise revenue between the keeping alive the irritation in the States, whereas the proper settlement of the difficulty will greatly affect, both directly and indirectly, the future prosperity of the Commonwealth. Uncertainty regarding payments is of grave consequence to every State, and especially to the smaller ones. Each State has undertaken large liabilities, and, in the future, will have still greater obligations to face. But a State Government must hesitate to incur expenditure, so long as there is uncertainty as to the financial arrangements with the Commonwealth. The present position of affairs is retarding development. 1 know that that is so in South Australia, and have no doubt that it is so in every other State. It handicaps the settlement of land by the re-purchase of large estates for subdivision into smaller holdings. Do honourable members opposite wish to put any impediment in the wav of land settlement ? The Governments of the States cannot vigorously prosecute this policy while they are uncertain what their returns from the Commonwealth will be. An adjustment for five years would not remove that uncertainty, because there would remain the possibility of a reduction in revenue at the end of that period. At the They did not think for a present time the State Treasurers must exercise great caution, and, no doubt, many undertakings are being postponed indefinitely pending a settlement of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. This is not a party question. It is much bigger than a party question, and goes beyond considerations of the fate of a Government or of individual members. It is a question whose proper solution is vital to the best development of the Commonwealth. Not only is money required by the States for the repurchase of large holdings with a view to subdivision; it is also required to stimulate the occupation of",52,Statement Showing Gain Or Loss To The Several States Under Suggested Scheme On The Amounts Payable

256,Mr Richard Foster,"I wouldCrown lands which are at present unused. This can be done only by railway construction. South Australia has ahead of if a policy of railway construction which should be carried on uninterruptedly for seven or ten years. The Government of to-day, and every country representative in the local Parliament, feels that it is of the highest importance that a definite and continuing policy should be submitted; but how can such an undertaking be entered upon while the State is uncertain as to what its return from the Commonwealth will be. An agreement covering a period of five, or even of ten, years would be no good. Of course, the States would have to bow to the inevitable, but those who have so much to say about the supremacy of this Parliament are striking a bigger blow at Federation than they are aware of. The increase of settlement by the subdivision of large estates, and the occupation and development of the unused Crown land, will ultimately mean an increase in revenue, and great material advantage to the whole of Australia. I should like to give one illustration, as to avenues of wealth-contributing forces, the possibilities of development in this direction. During the last five years South Australia has opened up the Pinnaroo country. Six years ago the whole of that magnificent area was occupied by only three families, and did not return a penny into the Treasury, whereas to-day, as a consequence of the construction of a light line of railway, there is a population of about 2,500. in South Australian history, inasmuch as during its first year's running it paid every penny of working expenses and interest, and, over and above, returned money into the Treasury. their faith to the subdivision of big estates, wealth stronger and more prosperous in and desire to interfere with the State control in order to achieve that end; but the settlement of the Pinnaroo country has provided for as many families as has the expenditure of .£1,000,000 in South Australia in the repurchase of estates. And what has been done at Pinnaroo is proposed in the district represented by the honourable member for Grey, with land of three times the area. Is that not the best possible policy, not only for the States, but for the Commonwealth? All these undertakings enlarge the scope and increase the need of the State Governments. Those needs are as great-indeed , in my opinion, they are greater than they were in preiFederation days; and such development as I have described will add to the national prosperity, and supply the financial, needs of the Commonwealth Treasurer. velopment going on in Western Australia. minded that in the western State the development and prospective development is as great, if not greater, than in South Australia; and what applies to those two States applies with infinitely more force to Queensland. Whereas in South Australia there are left 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 acres in the rainfall radius, there is five or ten times that area in Queensland, and the same may be said relatively of New South Wales, and of Victoria. Which is the more statesmanlike policy-to seek to provide the Treasurer with all the money he now needs by increasing the taxation of an already overburdened people, or to encourage the States, as this agreement will encourage them, to continue to bring large areas under settlement, and increase production again and again? With this increase of production will be opened fresh which will enrich, not only the State Treasurers, but the Federal Treasurer. I remind my honourable friends opposite that, in order to undertake these developmental works, the State Treasurers need all the encouragement which can be extended to them, and, on every ground of reason, deserve the concession proposed. Personally, I do not regard it as a concession, but as That railway was unique a matter of business. We are one people in partnership, and I have no time for a man who, calling himself a Nationalist, does not recognise the needs of every State, and realize that assistance exI know that some pin tended makes both States and 'Commonevery direction.

I am informed, and I make the statement, subject to correction, that 6,000 out of the 9,000 applications are from the country districts. That is a shocking state of affairs, and represents one of the problems that must be solved-the problem of the centralization and congestion of population in the cities and big towns.

It is because the country is less attractive than are the cities to the young men. not be so, because there are better chances of success by far on ihe land than could be found in the city. higher in the city, the savings banks books in any State show larger amounts to the credit of the men working on the land. The prospects offered to-day by reason of the improvement in the conditions of country life, and the greater rewards offered for the cultivation of the soil, ought to reverse the stream. view is presented in the fact that a larger proportion of men who, with practically no capital, are able to go into business on their own account, are to be found in that position on the land. Land settlement throughout Australia, which is giving promise of a new and brighter future than was ever anticipated, ought to be encouraged in every way. This policy is involving the States in larger responsibilities, and it is making infinitely stronger the reasons which were good when the Braddon section was originally introduced into the Constitution. I hope that from that point of view-fro m the point of view of land settlement and development-thi s House will follow the Government, and will not only support the agreement, but will especially uphold its principal virtue so far as the States are concerned, and that is its permanence. I now wish fo direct attention to certain statements made by the honourable member for North Sydney. He said that the Customs revenuewill be after 1910 a financial stream in regard, to which there are no riparian rights, and the Commonwealth has possession of the source. Without a very definite agreement it is extremely doubtful how much and for how long any of the tempting waters will be allowed tc flow to those beyond. That is the position, as affecting the States, which I wish to emphasize. Three or four honourable members have evolved a theory in regard to what should be done with reference to the agreement. NowI have to say that, in my opinion, only one agreement is possible, and that is the agreement submitted by the Government; because, if this Parliament amends that agreement in any material direction, it ceases to be an agreement. say so. If this Parliament amends that agreement without the concurrence of the other parties to it, it is no longer an agreement at all. What do honourable members That .should propose to do if they practically kill the agreement by making material alterations in it? It simply means that fresh proI f the wages be posals would have to be submitted; and the submitting of fresh proposals means another Premiers' Conference and consideration by another Parliament before the question can be permanently settled. Are honourable members prepared to make themselves responsible for that position? On what ground do certain honourable memAnother point of bers appear so timid as to the ability of the National Parliament to carry out the agreement ? Much has been said about the possibility of the Customs and Excise revenue in future being insufficient to pay to the States 25s. per capita. I have indicated, not merely the possibility, but almost the certainty, of a larger development in the way of land settlement than we have known in Australia for the last thirty years. The places that I have enumerated do not exhaust the possibilities. There is also the northern portion of Australia, concerning which I would say that if that territory is not taken over and developed by the National Parliament within twelve or eighteen months of this date, it will be developed by fhe Parliament of South Australia. There is no doubt about that. In saying so, I am talking about what I know. I am expressing the determination of the Government and the majority of the Parliament of South Australia. But I shall have more to say on that subject when the Bill relating to the Northern Territory is under discussion. I simply mention the matter now in order to emphasize the point that extended land settlement will provide additional revenue, and will in future make both the States and the Commonwealth richer. Here is a means of solving the unemployed difficulty, and of creating fresh avenues from which will flow into our coffers wealth in the shape of taxation. The honourable member for Flinders quoted elaborate figures, no doubt very carefully and industriously prepared, in order to institute comparisons between the revenue producing powers of the Tariffs of different nations. In justice to him, I must say that he admitted candidly and honestly that he merely quoted the figures for what they were worth. He did not claim that they were absolutely a reliable guide as to what might happen in regard to the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth in",55,Statement Showing Gain Or Loss To The Several States Under Suggested Scheme On The Amounts Payable
