More broadly, in terms of Victoria's own electorate to see the seriousness of the public hospitals, the state's Auditor-General situation that many public hospitals are facing has said that the collective cash reserves of in this country. In today's Age we have the Victoria's public hospitals have plummeted details of the problems facing the Austin from $80 million to just $5 million in the past Repatriation Medical Centre, which, as it five years.

Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (10.00 a.m.}--The Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 amends various aspects of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. Both these acts are of major concern to us. It is important to be quite clear: Labor is absolutely determined to have universal access to publicly funded health services through Medicare. Labor is committed to maintaining the effective integrity of Medicare as a system of universal health insurance that will finance the delivery of high quality medical and public hospital services to all Australians. This includes a commitment to maintaining affordable access through bulkbilling and opposition to compulsory co-payments. Looking at the bill in to to, the bill allows the Health Insurance Commission, the HIC, to enter into various kinds of hedging contracts without ministerial approval but within ministerial guidelines, as was originally intended. The bill allows for electronic lodgement direct from the doctors' surgeries and the electronic payment of all Medicare claims, not just bulk-billed items. This does not mean thaLdoctors can be electronically paid where they elect not to bulk-bill. That would herald the end of bulkbilling and the introduction of co-payments. We are encouraged that the government acknowledges this is not a backdoor attempt at either doing away with bulk-billing or introducing co-payments. We will continue to monitor this situation. Any continuation in the drop in the bulk-billing rate amongst doctors, as has already occurred under this government, would be regrettable. It also affects fees chargeable by optometrists. Some patients elect to have their eyes tested more than once per 24 months because they wish to change their glasses as a matter of fashion rather than of need. Currently, optometrists can receive only a reduced benefit in these circumstances. The change here allows optometrists to receive the full benefit provided they inform the patient prior to the consultation-that is, the patient will bear the out-of-pocket expenses in these matters. Medicare benefits in respect of services rendered outside Australia have been extended to cover a domestic journey beyond the 12-kilometre territorial limit. This includes, for example, a Melbourne to Hobart flight. It also includes overseas journeys where the patient, through ill health, is required to return to Australia before arrival at the intended overseas destination. Elsewhere, the bill amends section 61 of the Health Insurance Act and will eliminate unnecessary consideration by a Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee of questions relating to the recognition of a specialist or consultant physician where recognition was intended to be short term for the purposes of a locum tenens or where the specialist or consultant physician applies to have the status ended.",141,Adjournment Doubt As Aif Personnel But What Distin
226,Mr Deputy,"SPEAKER ( Mr Nehl) took the chair at 10.00 a.m.1608 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 Amendments to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register will permit the HIC to release de-identified data for research purposes. This provision was inadvertently omitted from the original amending legislation. The provision of pharmaceuticals by private hospitals and residential aged care services is to be amended to allow pharmacists to be reimbursed in certain circumstances by the Commonwealth for the supply in bulk of certain drugs-that is, pain-killers. Currently, individual scripts must be written for each patient. Savings are expected to flow from less wastage of these drugs. We note the error in the second reading speech which states 'private hospital or residential care facility' instead of 'approved supplier'-maybe something can be done about that. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the PBAC, is to be extended by one to include a consumer representative. Hopefully, this may improve the antennae of this particular committee to the individual human effect when it gets decisions wrong, as it did with Neocate at $1,300 per month for older than two-year-olds. Finally, after we expressed concern over a provision that would allow the HIC to extract penalties unilaterally from doctors it had decided had rorted the system, the government has decided to drop this provision. We welcome that decision. While supporting the need for government to be vigilant in detecting and prosecuting fraud, we are pleased the government has stepped back from a system that was going to be so unilateral. The bill makes for a number of changes to the health legislation and we are supportive of it. We are pleased to work with the government to improve our health system. We remind the House that we are committed to maintaining the effective integrity of Medicare as a system of universal health insurance. We will support provisions which maintain that. We will oppose provisions which, in our opinion, are such that they undermine the Medicare system. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.06 a.m.)-I wish to briefly address two areas that the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 touches on. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act and allows for the claiming and payment of Medicare benefits by means of electronic transmissions. One of the problems with the processing of Medicare claims is that, until now, the Medicare claims have only been available for practitioners who directly bill their patients. Items1 to 5 of the bill will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow for the electronic transmission of Medicare claims directly from doctors' surgeries, and payments directly to accounts of patients and also medical practitioners. Under these new amendments, the Health Insurance Commission will be able to issue a cheque to the patients where the bill has already been paid or a cheque to the doctor where the bill has not been paid. That electronic lodgement of Medicare forms will reduce the payment delays from electronic claiming. The Health Insurance Commission informed the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, in its study of telemedicine and other things, that the commission is able to process claims overnight. However, at present, there is a minimum waiting period of 10 days between the Health Insurance Commission receiving the claim and the cheque being sent to the doctor. This is a sensible amendment which should provide an incentive for GPs to computerise. Where it is most significant is in the need for Medicare offices. If general practitioners are able to electronically lodge Medicare forms, the need for a Medicare office does decline. Over the last two years, there have been closures of Medicare offices in various electorates and that has been a difficult decision in the community. But this amendment allows for electronic Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1609 lodgement by the doctor \yhich reduces the need for people to go to a Medicare offi<;:e. For example, when someone is bulk-billed, the patient signs over their right to the Medicare rebate, their doctor electronically lodges the Medicare form and the Medicare rebate cheque can be posted to the doctor or it can be electronically transferred to a bank cheque account or whatever. If the doctor is charging above the schedule fee, what will happen is that, if the patient pays it at that time, the Health Insurance Commission will be able to either issue a cheque or transfer the funds direct to the patient. . Closing Medicare offices is always a delicate decision and we do need to be fair and reasonable in striking a balance across Australia between providing reasonable access to Medicare and the efficient use of taxpayers' funds. The closures of Medicare offices were decided on broad criteria of minimum disruption to the public, claiming patterns, leasing and property issues, proximity to other branch offices and the capacity to redeploy staff. The government aimed to ensure that the Medicare office network was more responsive to the needs of Australians. Changes in claiming patterns have had an impact on the branch office network. There has been a reduction in patient cash claims as the incidence of direct billing has increased. The Health Insurance Commission, which administers Medicare, was able to advise that many of the Medicare offices which have closed had very high direct billing rates which obviated the need for people to visit a Medicare office. As I have mentioned, with electronic data interchange, we will have more efficient ways of claiming. That initiative, which was announced in the 1997 budget, is being developed and will now require claims to be directly lodged in the doctor's surgery. Not all doctors have computerised, so this is not available yet, but we are hoping that more and more doctors will computerise so you can have electronic lodgement. But, if people do not have availability for electronic lodgement, there are alternative ways that they can claim. They can receive payment by cheque or they can receive it directly in their bank account when they lodge their claims by mail, without the need to visit a Medicare office. Alternatively, they can post an unpaid account to Medicare and a benefit cheque in favour of the doctor will then be sent to the patit::nt who adds any outstanding amount before forwarding it on to the doctor. Claiming in that fashion ensures the patients are not out of pocket for the total expense of the medical service. In my own electorate, we have had the closure of one Medicare office in Blackwood. There is another, closer Medicare office within 10 kilometres down at Westfield Marion, but that has been a decision which I have received an amount of correspondence on. The second matter that I would like to briefly touch on is the release of de-identified data for research purposes from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. The initiatives that this government has had in relation to childhood immunisation are. some of the most significant public health measures that we have seen from a Commonwealth government. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) announced the seven-point plan in February 1997 and I understand at present he is just next door announcing an initiative with regard to measles. As some members will be aware, in 1989-90 the ABS survey showed that 53 per cent of children were fully immunised and, while the levels for people at 18 months were much higher, it was still only 70 per cent, which was not full coverage. If you compare it with countries like China or Vietnam, those developing countries actually have levels above 90 per cent. One of the problems has been the great success of the vaccination programs. Most parents 1610 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 today have not seen cases of measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough and so on. I might reflect that it is quite unusual to see a case of rubella. When I was doing my paediatrics attachment at the Adelaide Children's Hospital, I actually caught rubella myself. I do not know where I caught it from but, as some people would be aware, it used to be the habit to immunise 13and 14-year-old women against rubella; of course men were not. Now what happens is that all infants at one year are immunised against measles; mumps and rubella, if we get to them. In 1996 there were 4,000 children who caught whooping cough, 500 children who caught measles and 2,500 who caught german measles. Whooping cough is a very debilitating illness; it can cause convulsions and it can even lead to permanent brain damage. Regarding measles, one in 25 patients with measles can develop pneumonia; they can also get something called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which causes brain damage. While rubella itself is a self-limiting mild condition, if it is contracted by women in the first trimester of pregnancy, it can lead to congenital rubella which involves babies being born with cataracts and mental retardation and so on. That condition, I might remind the House, was actually discovered by an Australian ophthalmologist in 1939. Norman Gregg discovered that the condition of congenital rubella was contracted by pregnant women. They are the two areas I would like to touch on. I do commend the government for its initiatives on childhood immunisation. We still have a long way to go. It looks like only 75 per cent of children of 18 months are immunised. The level overall for children has only increased about three per cent. We would like to see it increase a lot more because, without that, you will continue to see the epidemics that we are starting to see at the moment and which we have not really seen for 20 or 30 years. The electronic lodgement of Medicare claims is a very important initiative because it in some ways means that Medicare offices are now no longer as necessary as they have been in the past. It also enables payments to be made much quicker. Jackie Kelly), I thought I would outline a couple of matters concerning the electronic lodgement of Medicare claims through medical practitioners' surgeries. There has been much speculation in the media, most of it misinformed, which suggests that the government, by closing certain Medicare offices, is determined to reduce the level of service to below that which was previously available. The government, on the other hand, takes the view that one has to look at the closure of Medicare offices in conjunction with the additional opportunities for electronic lodgement through medical practitioners' surgeries. When one looks at the totality of the government's reforms, it is very obvious that the government is indeed providing an increased rather than a reduced service to patients. In the future, right across the nation, doctors will be able to lodge the claims electronically directly from the surgeries. We get away from a situation where people who went to non-bulkbilling doctors had to pay the medical fee initially and then deal with one of the Medicare offices. The Medicare offices will remain in those areas where they are needed, but increasingly more people will access this new provision through medical practitioners' surgeries. I was very pleased that in the electorate of Fisher we were able to retain the Medicare offices at Caloundra and Kingaroy. There was a community campaign which was successful because",143,Representatives Main Committee
227,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (10.16 A.m.),"--As we await the honourable member for Lindsay (MissWednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1611 the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the government were convinced that Medicare offices in these areas were necessary. In other areas where the amount of work being processed by Medicare offices has diminished to a stage where the Medicare office is no longer financially viable, with this change we will still be able to provide good local service to people while obviating the need to have Medicare offices which are no longer financially viable. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be as pleased as I am to see the honourable member for Lindsay in the chamber and I will now defer to her. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (10.19 a.m.)-The Health Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to make private health insurance better value for money, a core plank of our government's reform of the health industry. It is a key issue in my electorate. WheneverI do any surveys of my electorate, health, unemployment and crime are the three major issues that keep recurring. Health is an issue that is very important in my electorate, an electorate which has a large number of women of child-bearing age and many young families. Health is very important for their peace of mind. This bill seeks to stem the flow of people away from private health insurance, something which occurred throughout the period of the previous government. Before the previous government came to power, the percentage of people covered by private health insurance in Australia was 60 per cent. It has now dropped to 31 per cent and indications are that it is continuing to fall. It is very important that we staunch the flow of people away from private health insurance. There are a number of initiatives that this government has put in place to do that. At the recent Premiers Conference, where a number of state premiers sought to deflect their own inadequacies in managing their state budget onto the federal government, it was shown that for every one per cent drop in the numbers of people leaving private health insurance it would cost the public sector an extra $83 million to cover that percentage drop. Also, by the middle of this year we will be seeing the effects of the penalty on high income earners who do not take out private health insurance. By the end of the year we are hoping to see high income earners re-entering the private health insurance market because the tax penalty will make it worth their while. We will see either a levelling out of the rate of decline of people leaving private health insurance, or an increase in the rate for those joining private health insurance. This is absolutely vital because, with 70 per cent of the population totally abdicating their responsibility for their own health care and saying they will take what government has to offer, waiting lists have grown. In New South Wales the waiting list for minor operations such as knee joints and varicose veins has increased. For things that are not urgent, the waiting lists extend for three or four years. We are now up to date with technology in terms of allowing Medicare claims to be electronically lodged. That is a great improvement. It is keeping up with technology. It is important that government departments can collate all this paperwork from a doctor's surgery with Medicare records and so provide better service to the patient. A patient no longer has to travel between the doctor, the Medicare office and the post office in order to make a claim. This bill will enable continuous improvement to occur by using technology to keep the administrative costs of Medicare down. 1612 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 It is important to. note that, of the 7,000 people employed by the federal Department of Health and Family Services, not one of them touches a patient. Keeping administration costs down in the health department is the sort of thing that this government is looking to address. We are also looking at various ways of closing the insurance gap. If you are privately insured you can get treatment in a private hospital but not all your bills are paid by private health insurance. That is one of the major complaints that my constituents make to me; that they have to pay the Medicare levy and then, if they accept that they are responsible for their own health care and pay for private health insurance, they are asked to pay the gap when they seek to make a claim. That is one 'thing that really upsets those who would seek to take responsibility for themselves and give themselves a choice in the timing, style and doctor they choose to use. ' It is a move in the right direction. It h'as been very slow, given the tragic circumstances of the bleed away from private health cover that occurred under the previous government. That has certainly left us with a crisis at the momertt.'Looking at the figures from 1985 for the rough estimates of costs for education;' health and defence, we were spending relatively the same amount, about $10 billion, on those three departments. Today, we spend $20 billion on health and -we are still spending about $10 billion on defence and education. The costs in health are exponential. They are continuing to rise. Recently in my electorate we were trialling telemedicine in a new way whereby, via an Internet line, you can actually operate with robotics on people at a remote site. We are actually looking at where someone in a car accident, or some other condition not of their choosing, needs to be repaired by a specialist. If it is out in the country, a specialist is not readily available. Once the instruments are set up, a Macquarie Street specialist can operate remotely, via telephone lines and Internet providers, to get someone back to full health. Although it is leading edge and worth exploring further, it is expensive. The costs for health will continue to increase as our capabilities and the style and quality of through-life care that we demand increase. Previously when you got sick, if penicillin would not cure it, that was it. Today we have drugs costing enormous amounts of money over considerable periods of time to give people the very best that modern science can offer them. Health care is expensive and it will continue to be so, and I see it as increasing in expense. It is therefore important that the demand or the call on government does not get to such a stage that it is to the detriment of our other departments, such as defence, education and social security. It is incredibly important that we encourage the majority of Australians who can afford to do so to take responsibility for their own health care. To do that, we must convince them that insurance is very real, very helpful and very easy. The bill goes a long way to remedying some' of the disastrous decisions of the previous government, which made an all-out concerted attack on the private health system and quite openly declared that a government hospital system as sole provider was the way to go. It is good to see that this legislation has got to this stage. We are hoping to see some cooperation from the opposition in supporting a number of the measures taken in this bill and to see a return to the levels of health insurance that were enjoyed in my parents' era. I commend the bill to the House. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (10.28 a.m.)-in reply-Before thanking my colleagues for taking part in this debate and before summing up the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, I· will table the Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1613 supplementary explanatory memorandum and also the corrigendum to the explanatory memorandum. The bill is about good government, and the fact we are debating this legislation in the Main Committee of course is a clear signal that the opposition are supporting this legislation. I thank them for their cooperation in this matter, because there are a number of important aspects to it. The bill is about good government. It is about regulating effectively, not regulating where there is no need to do so, and ensuring that government has a sensible, flexible approach to governing. The bill contains provisions allowing for the electronic claiming of Medicare benefits and enabling an institution to more easily use pharmaceutical stock at hand to allow for sensible customer service. The bill contains provisions to correct anomalies in the current secrecy provisions, to extend Medicare coverage to offshore domestic flights and to correct silly bureaucratic rulings that have disadvantaged government customers in the past. The bill contains provisions allowing for consumer protection, providing a penalty for charging public patients for provision of public hospital services in prescribed circumstances, and adding a consumer representative on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committeewhich I think is a good thing. But, of course, that committee must remain independent from government in all the decisions that it makes. We have heard comments here this morning about the issue about Neocate. In defence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, they made a decision based on the information that was provided to them by'the manufacturer of that product. However, I am pleased to say that the government was able to very quickly rectify that situation and I am pleased to have taken a hand in that. I would not want to see any child disadvantaged from a decision made by such a committee. This bill works to assist research through authorising the release of de-identified immunisation data for research purposes. That is very important. Research is always important if we are to look at good health outcomes in the future. All in all, this bill, while minor in nature, contains important reforms to make government more sensible and responsive, and better protect patients. I commend this bill to the House, but before I sit down I would like to speak briefly about the foreshadowed amendments. The amendments the government is moving to the bill continue the theme of sensible government. We are removing one provision from the original bill and adding two new provisions. By removing item 23 from the original bill, a provision allowing the Health Insurance Commission to reclaim payments, we are protecting the clients of the commission. It was thought that item 23 would not achieve the desired result. The first new provision allows for the minister to appoint members to the specialist recognition committees in the absence of the required number of nominations from the groups specified in the act. The second allows for all medical practitioners to provide assistance at operations that attract a Medicare benefit. This will allow newly graduating doctors the ability to assist a principal surgeon and attract a benefit for that service. I know from practical experience that that doctor will gain very valuable experience in doing so. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

This bill basically emanates from consultations with ATSIC-there are some technical amendments being proposed to the ATSIC Act. The opposition totally supports what the government is doing here and will expedite the matter, if asked, in the Senate. We do not see any need for this amendment bill to be delayed in the Senate.",146,Representatives Main Committee
228,Mr Melham (Banks) (10.33 A.m.),"At the outset, I want to say that the opposition will1616 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 In terms of the outline of the bill, it is best if, for the record, I read into the Hansard what is in the explanatory memorandum, which basically gives the detail of the bill. It says: The Bill makes provision for the following amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Commission Act 1989: · The Bill allows the Commission to attach conditions to its consent to the disposal of an interest in · it enables the Commission to delegate to a Regional Council powers incidental to its funding powers under sections 14, 15 and 16; · it allows the Commission to delegate its power to approve the disposal of residential property; · it provides that the section 20 remedy for breaches of grant or loan conditions does not affect the availability to the Commission of other remedies for such breaches; · it makes amendments of a minor drafting nature. What this shows is that ATSIC and the ATSIC board are basically responsible in the way they conduct the act. They can do it in a way which, if it is handled properly and sensitively by this government, does not bring it into partisan politics or does not see ATSIC unduly and unfairly criticised. It is important that I refer to events of the last 24 hours, because they are disturbing. They are disturbing because, for the first time in the history of ATSIC, we have a unanimous resolution of the board passing no confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) and calling on the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) to sack him. The significance of that no confidence motion is this. There are 19 commissioners-17 elected and two appointed. Of the 17 elected commissioners, only four are continuing commissioners. So we have 15 out of 19 new members. We have a distinguished chairman of ATSIC who was appointed by this minister. The minister took great pride in his appointment, and his appointment was welcomed by all political parties and all members of the community. Indeed, the Prime Minister, in a answer to a dorothy dixer in the parliament, had this to say on 12 December 1996: I think the appointment of Mr Djerrkura is one of the more important appointments that has been made by the government. Further on, he also said: I think something like 13 of the 19 are newly elected. Well, as it is, it is 15 of the 19, because two were appointed. He continued: There are under the legislation two appointments made by the government-the chairman and Mr Dillon, who is a well-known and well respected member of the Queensland Police Force and who has risen to a very high rank in that police force. I believe both men will bring very great talents and particular capacities to the work of ATSIC. Mr Djerrkura is extremely well qualified for the job. He is a senior tribal man of the Wangurri people in the north-east of Arnhem Land. He is very aware of the importance of traditional indigenous culture and also the problems facing indigenous people in remote areas of Australia. The Prime Minister said-and this was on 12 December 1996: I pointed out the desire of the government to work in a very constructive fashion with the ATSIC board and that, naturally, when there is a change of government goals are sometimes pursued in different ways Further down, he said: Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1617 I assured Mr Djerrkura and the ATSIC board of the goodwill of the government towards the indigenous people of Australia. He finished by saying: I very warmly welcome Mr Djerrkura to the board of ATSIC. I wish him and the other members of the In reply to a dorothy dixer on 10 December in the Senate, this is what the minister, Senator Herron, said: I consulted widely before making that appointment and found that Mr Djerrkura enjoys enormous respect. He is an outstanding Australian. Further on, he said: Senators may also be interested to learn that there has been a substantial change to the board of ATSIC as a result of the recent ATSIC elections. Only four of the 19 commissioners from that last board have been returned. I have personally spoken to all of the commissioners and I look forward to a productive and constructive relationship over the next three years. And finishing up his dorothy dixer, he repeated: I look forward to working with the board cooperatively as well. Relations between this gov.ernment and the ATSIC board are at an all time low because the continues to play a political game. I think this history is important and it is important that it is said now, because this is not the way the opposition wants to see the debate progress. We believe this area is too important for a political game to be played with it. The opposition supports accountability and benchmarking. These issues can be worked on in a constructive fashion with the current But, from the outset, the first.cabinet decision was to appoint a special auditor. That was an illegal appointment and the Federal Court rejected that appointment three to nil as outside the law, ultra vires the ATSIC Act. So the first decision of cabinet was found to be an illegal decision by the government. A million and a half spent on a special auditor, after some quite sensational allegationsabout is the bill before the parliament; it is a bill that has the support of the opposition; it is aimed at improving the ATSIC Act; it has been done in a cooperative fashion, in consultation with the ATSIC board, and that is the way it should be.

These amendments emanated from the ATSIC board. What they are doing is basically ensuring that they are acting properly; they have done it in full consultation with the government and the opposition supports that. But what we have had in recent times is, in effect, and indeed from day one, that the government has not acted in accordance with the ATSIC Act. The ATSIC board are trying here to make sure that they are acting legally, and that is why they came here. The government, in its first decision, acted outside the ATSIC Act. We get $450 million worth of budget cuts announced on the kerbside before the budget; that is not the way to do it. We get a situation where, three weeks ago, the ATSIC board gave a confidential report to the minister's office-and the government, it is suggested, then leaked that report. That is why the government cannot dismiss what has happened in the last 24 hours. Mr Djerrkura is the government's hand-picked appointment. We say, 'We do not want to play politics with this. Sit up and take notice.' The ATSIC board are responsible. There are 15 out of the 19 commissioners who are new, two of them appointed by this government. Enough is enough. The signals yesterday are not the signals of what is coming forward in this bill. What is coming forward in this bill is a responsible organisation saying, 'There need to be amendments to the act so that we are all acting properly. We do not want to act in a delinquent way. We want to attach conditions to the consent for disposal of property.' What you have is a responsible board, but there is a sense of despair at the moment because what is happening is that confidential briefings with the minister are subsequently leaked by the government for political advantage. That is the problem. We say that the way that we, the opposition, will deal with this bill and with indigenous matters is that we are prepared to give the government support. Where they can justify their actions, we will be out there backing them. We will not play politics with this amendment bill; this improves the ATSIC Act. In terms of the Native Title Act, another example, many of those amendments have cross-party support. They are aimed at improving the act. They are aimed at improving the workings of native title. But what we get is the ATSIC board giving a confidential report to the minister's office and the government then leaking it; that was three weeks ago. government. I do not blame this minister for leaking that report, or his office. something he did not do. He did not say that he did not pass it on to other ministers in the government who have responsibility for the Native Title Act. The thing is that the walls have ears. I do not blame this minister for leaking that particular report, but what I do say is that his office was given that report and it was passed on to another minister and another minister's office, and games were played. A confidential briefing was held earlier this week, and that started to emanate from government. What is happening is incitement. When the ATSIC board responds, government says, 'Oh, they are playing politics.' We do not want to play politics. In the end, this government, this",153,Representatives Main Committee

240,Mr Melham,"That is right, and I accept his word in relation to that. But there isWednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1619 Prime Minister and all of us are not above the law and not above the constitution. This issue is too important. I have enormous respect for Gatjil Djerrkura, the current chairman, and the ATSIC board. I have had only one opportunity since the appointment of the new board to go and talk to them. The protocol generally, prior to the last term of elections, was that the minister was given an opportunity at every board meeting and the invitation was also extended to me as the shadow spokesperson. My invitation to the minister is well known. We think we can sort out these types of issues in a constructive fashion. This matter is relevant to this bill before the House. This is not l! contentious bill. It does not have to be contentious and it should not be contentious. If the government makes out a case, the opposition is prepared to support it. If the government has a case in certain areas, subject the material to scrutiny; do not go out and do it by press release. That is not the way to conduct indigenous affairs. It is good short-term politics but, in the end, the government will be held accountable. Those opposite can run around saying that we had 13 years-and we did, and we made mistakes in those 13 years. We have to learn from the mistakes. The minister is well intentioned but it is a remarkable situation that in the time that this board have been in office-they took office in December 1996-there has been an unprecedented unanimous vote of no confidence in the minister. I do not think that is a political stunt. The government might dismiss it. They can dismiss it. I say take heed of it. Let us pull back a bit. Let us all count to 10 and get on with improving the situation. I want to talk about health, education, employment and training. I am not running around asking for a fistful of dollars for indigenous affairs. It does not need it. We need to properly spend the money. We need to learn from the mistakes, from the comprehensive reports that have said that, if we spend a dollar here, we will save $8 later on. We just had a debate on a health bill and prevention is better than cure. I know there are other speakers from the government. I did not intend to speak for long but I am disturbed as to the events in the last 24 hours. As far as this bill is concerned, it has the total support of the opposition. We will support it in the House of Representatives and expedite its passage in the Senate. This bill puts beyond doubt ATSIC's authority to attach conditions to the disposal of property and other things. That is a good thing. I commend the bill to the parliament and I repeat my private and public call to the government that the opposition stands ready, in a constructive fashion, to work with the government in this portfolio. The time for playing politics with indigenous people is over. It is good short-term politics but it is very dangerous in terms of the nation. By that I do not mean that we are going to defend people who misuse money. People should be accountable, but let us not have a double standard. I was informed the other day that the Department of Defence has had a $700 million overrun in the space of a year. They say, 'Oh, we're sorry' but there is not the outcry in the community for the same level of accountability in the Department of Defence. I think that is a double standard and I use this debate as a signal, once again, to the government. I think there have been signs in some areas in recent times of constructive behind the scenes discussions from the government. I place that on record. There are people of goodwill on both sides of parliament in relation to this issue. 1620 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 The worse portfolio in government and in opposition-history will show this-is to be the Aboriginal affairs minister or the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. In the end, wherever I go, people are talking about it. It is a mainstream issue. People acknowledge that mistakes were made-genuinely made-in the past but they do not want the mistakes to be repeated. They want acceptable solutions. They do not want to see the parliament bickering and fighting. This bill is an example of cooperation. I am not saying we are going to agree on everything or that we are not going to agree to disagree or that the government are not entitled to pursue their priorities. We will not always agree in this area but I think if there is goodwill we have the potential to agree on a lot of things. What is happening at the moment is that even things we agree on are being badly handled and not by this minister. This minister unfortunately is a prisoner of his ministry and his government and his cabinet. I know what ministerial solidarity and cabinet solidarity are all about. Sometimes you have to go out and argue stuff that you do not necessarily agree with. I know that and I respect it. I understand it. But the buck stops at the top. My appeal is to the Prime Minister: enough is enough. Use this bill as an example to show that there can be cross-party support in this area and that is what we should strive for. I commend the bill to the House. Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1997. I also hope that in talking generally to this bill you will give me the same latitude as you gave to the member for Banks( Mr Melham) regarding ATSIC and some of its operations and the wider perception. The content of this bill, as the member for Banks said, is uncontentious and quite narrow. However, there are some matters regarding the operation of ATSIC that I would lIke to speak about as they affect my electorate and my state. I will proceed initially on the matt-s of the bill. The substance of this bill, as we know, is essentially technical amendments td effect the disposal of ATSIC interests in land and over certain other property. The amendments contained in this bill also affect delegation of powers to effect such disposals. Also contained in this bill are amendments addressing grants, loans and guarantees. These are important amendments. Without impugning the integrity of ATSIC or its commissioners, it is important that regulations are reviewed within this body, as. they are elsewhere, to ensure their accountability and also to ensure the public's good perception of powers, disposal of property, et cetera. As the member for Banks has said, this is a non-contentious bill and we appreciate the support of the opposition to expedite the technical amendments of it. But I must say that ATSIC is a body which has grown out of proportion. My information is that it is a huge monolithic bureaucracy somewhere out in Woden here in Canberra that employs well over 400 people just to administer that particular body. The member for Banks talked about Mr Gatjil Djerrkura and I wish to endorse his comments. Mr Djerrkura is a marvellous leader of ATSIC, somebody who represents his people in a very professional manner and somebody who has the authority of his people to speak for them. But to me the anomaly. It is something that eats up a huge· amount of funds when the reality is that the Aboriginal people themselves would like to see moneys placed out into the regions and into their local communities. This great body in Canberra is eating up an enormous amount of those funds which could go out to the communities themselves.",154,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Randall (Swan) (L0.51 A.m.),"I also wish to speak on the Aboriginal and TorresWednesday, 2S March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1621 The term for the administration of the ATSIC body here in Canberra is bottom-up funding rather than top-down funding, which could be achieved in a number of ways through local councils being the administrative bodies. I have spoken to Gatjil Djerrkura myself in a social setting and his words to me, when we mentioned bottom-up funding, were, 'Now you are speaking my language, mate.' I think there is a great deal of cooperation to see this bottom-up funding matter addressed. I believe that some of the recommendations that will come out of the review of the ATSIC Act, which is currently being undertaken, will be towards this bottom-up funding for local communities. As the member for Banks did say, in our first year of this government we did address some cuts towards ATSIC. We know it is a very well-funded body. It has well over a billion dollars a year. This money was not taken away as such but was direCted towards other programs such as Aboriginal housing, education and health. There is more specific tied funding rather than a large grab of funds just being put within this large administration called ATSIC in Canberra. I think that that is probably the preferable way of doing things. The public had been demonstrating for some time, as indeed had a large section of the Aboriginal community, that they wanted to see more results in terms of improving living conditions for a large section of the Aboriginal community than they were while ATSIC was responsible for the great majority of funds. Again, the Aboriginal people themselves want to have a greater determination of their funds, not just the hierarchy which is involved in this bureaucracy here. This bill contains provisions which relate to the commissioners and regional chairs of or regional councillor if they have been removed from office within the previous three years for misbehaviour. That also deals up another perception problem. Commissioners and regional council chairpersons must also seek ministerial consent if they are to engage in outside employment. This, again, is addressing a conflict. This will have the effect of avoiding any improper or incorrect accusations of conflict of interest on the part of those office holders. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1997 will enable is what this bill should focus on. The bill will also give ATSIC more options when handling the disposal of ATSIC funded property and will allow ATSIC to delegate power to ATSIC staff, not only the board of commissioners of ATSIC, to approve the disposal of residential property. This will have the effect of making this aspect of the ATSIC administration more efficient and expeditious. This bill makes provision for amendments relating to the Indigenous Land Corporation and these will be advantageous to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I wish to expand on this point of the Indigenous Land Corporation in the latter part of the time that I have left. Powers will be widened to allow the Indigenous Land Corporation to grant land to trusts, partnerships and individuals as well as corporations. The Indigenous Land Corporation, when performing ILC functions, will be required to take into account the needs of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders suffering most disadvantage in access to land. This bill will also empower the minister, in consultation with the Indigenous Land Council board, to appoint such additional members as he or she considers appropriate from time to time. We know that under the previous government the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, created the billion dollar land fund. The essence of this billion dollar land fund was that those 1622 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 who could not gain any material or monetary gain from the native title process would be able to do so through the land fund. It is an enormous amount of money and we have seen the operation of this land fund already. The process of native title, unfortunately, has been hijacked-and hijacked quite disproportionately. I just wish to relate an account in my electorate, for example. The Perth airport is entirely in my electorate. There are six native title claims on the Perth airport and three are specific claims. One is by Robert Bropho and his Nyungah group. Then there is a competing specific title over the airport by a gentleman called Corrie Bodney. Just recently, another native title claim has been placed over the airport by the Warrall family, who do not live anywhere near the airport. They live outside of my electorate. The three specific claims which border the Perth airport have put three families competing with each other. They really do not like each other very much. They ""have a lot of problemsthe fact that this is a very narrow constraint. I extended a certain amount of latitude to the member for Banks. If the member could try to address his remarks to the bill, that would be helpful. drawing a comparison between this land corporation and the funds being sought by competing Aboriginal interests through the native title process as it competes with the Indigenous Land Corporation. But I will be a bit more specific. I just wanted to make the point that ATSIC administers the Indigenous Land Corporation but that competition from native title claims is confusing the whole issue. That is what I am talking about. This whole matter has to be addressed in relation to that. The ATSICAct was amended in 1995 to provide funding for land to Aborigines who were unsuccessful. There is an enormous number of cases where this unworkability of the Native Title Act is affecting the operation of ATSIC. I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, I should be given the opportunity to make those comparisons. WhatI am also drawing attention to is the fact that this bill has to be attended to. I am hoping that the Labor Party and the minor parties in the Senate will understand this because the Aboriginal people themselves, through their representative body ATSIC, are at each other's throats over these matters. AllI am saying is that for the benefit of the Aboriginal people, this matter has to be determined. It is very nice, in this bill, to be giving powers to ATSIC to tighten up certain provisions in terms of disposal of land, et cetera, but Aboriginals also need to be given the workability of a decent native title regime. We all know, and Aboriginals themselves will tell you, that the native title regime is not working at all. For example, here is an article from the Sunday Times dated 22 February 1998 which points out the number of claims. This is causing contention, that 82 per cent of Western Australia is subject to native title claims. It is just not good. There have been many reports, particularly in Western Australia, of the annoyance of Aborigines over these ambit claims andof order in respect to the honourable member for Swan going way beyond the bill by discussing native title and the Native Title Act.

However, I ask the member for Swan to continue with this debate and contain his remarks to the bill. totally your position, of course, but I would make the point that the member for Banks not only strayed from the bill but also talked about issues that were way outside the bill. He talked about leaking documents and about protest to the minister, and we-and you-allowed him that latitude. When at the beginning of his speech the member for Swan sought similar latitude, the member for Banks, as the opposition's lead spokesman on this matter, indicated very clearly that he thought that was very appropriate. SoI would ask that you give my colleague very generous treatment in that respect. for Swan may continue with his remarks and try and address them to the terms of the bill. here, though, is the wider ramifications of ATSIC, which the bill alludes to. I have pointed out one problem in my electorate, and I am being electorate-specific. It is not that it causes me, in particular, a problem-even though there is a native title claim over my backyard. I live on the edge of the Swan River and there isa native title claim over my backyard, a 15metre setback from the river. They could not put a sewerage line on to my property, because they could not negotiate the native title claim on my backyard; so I am being specifiC. the record. I thank him for that, but I now ask him to return to the bill. for Cal well, to declare my interest-and I do have an interest. They put the sewerage line down the middle of the road, because there was not a claim there. In fact, I would like to draw this to a close. AllI am pointing out is that, in terms of ATSIC and the perception of ATSIC, we would like to see its workability, and the bill helps such workability. The public perception is that ATSIC is not delivering outcomes for Aboriginal people. I believe that the bill, which is supported by the opposition, will help the workability of ATSIC as it now stands. I hope that under the review of ATSIC, as I have said earlier, the delivery of services from ATSIC will come from the administration of bottom-up funding. Myfinal comments are these. I appreciate the support of the opposition on delivering this clarification on a technical amendment to the bilI, as it is a matter that needs to be sorted out as soon as possible. I am pleased to hear from the member for Banks that the opposition will also expedite it through the Senate with their support. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (11.08 a.m.)-I hope I will also be given some leeway in the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment (TSRA) Bill 1997, because we have obviously now gone into a generalised debate on ATSIC, at least, and also on Aboriginal affairs.

250,Mr Randall,"That is right. I am quite happy, in terms of the point from the member1624 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 government. At the time these cuts were made, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) said that these were justified because there was a need to emphasise the importance of programs in education, health, welfare, et cetera. These programs, of course, have been emphasised by the Labor government through its access and equity policies. But I guess a number of people, myself included, thought, 'Okay. The minister wants to have a go at a different approach. We don't like the cuts to ATSIC. We don't like the downgrading of ATSIC and we certainly do not like the smearing of ATSIC that the minister and members of the government carried out.' All we thought was, 'All right, we'll see. Let's have a look; let's see whether in fact diversion of resources to these other programs is going to have some net effect.' So the minister was able to get some credit for himself for wanting to try an alternative approach. As the member for Banks( Mr Melham) has pointed out, the minister's attempts have been a total, complete and utter failure-an absolute and total failure. Of course, you do not have to take our word for it. You have to take the word of ATSIC itself. As is known, yesterday the ATSIC board, including the chairman appointed by the government, unanimously carried a mption of no confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Mr Tony Smith-Absolutely disgraceful. suffering the way the Aboriginal people are suffering, you might be concerned as well. will direct his remarks through the chair and will ignore any interjections. Gatjil Djerrkura' s comments, as chairman of ATSIC, in relation to the actions of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs clearly show that there is, to say the least, a problem in relation to the approach adopted by the minister. It is understating the matter completely to say there is a problem. I was involved, when I was parliamentary secretary, with the access and equity program and the reports of the access and equity program, including the program reports on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. We were concerned about the underachievement of targets in relation to health, education and these other areas. But the minister's so-called new strategy has totally failed. We have got to ask ourselves: why has it failed? Has it failed simply because there was not enough money? Maybe that is part of it. But it has also failed because we as a society are failing in relation to this issue. And we as a society are failing because we have not come to grips with the reasons the problems are there. I have spoken on this matter before in the House. It seems to me that we still have not come to grips with the importance of the cultural aspect in relation to Aboriginal affairs. you. a fair amount of latitude and I now ask that you make your point and return to the bill. is what this bill is about.

ThatWednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1625 indeed, programs that have been taken from ATSIC to be administered in other ways-a very relevant issue, I might say-we need to get something very clear in relation to these programs. That is this: we need to understand the cultural basis of these programs; we need to understand the importance of culture in Aboriginal issues. This is not just a problem for Australia, actually. It is a problem for other countries which have had indigenous cultures and where those cultures are disappearing or have been destroyed through actions of the people coming in. What has happenedMr Deputy Speaker, because I understand the sincerity of the gentleman who is speaking, but it is a narrow bill and I do think the issues that are being canvassed are going way beyond the bill. There are other opportunities to canvass these issues and I ask you to bring the speaker back to the bill. to the member for Calwell and I understand he is trying to develop an analogy. I am listening closely, but I do ask that he bring his analogy back to the content of the bill. of the bill. The bill attempts to ensure that ATSIC more efficiently achieves outcomes in relation to Aboriginal people. I am now talking about what some of the problems have been in this area. I could not imagine anything more relevant than that. This is unlike the previous member, who was allowed to speak for 10 minutes on native title. This matter involves Aboriginal affairs, but it is not a matter concerning the issues that ATSIC and related programs deal with. Nevertheless, I will try to ensure that my comments remain relevant. it is mainly related to the disposal of interest in property and that it has a very narrow constraint. a very broad discussion aboutyou a certain amount of latitude. I now ask that you bring your remarks back tei the bill. that, Mr Deputy Speaker. In talking about ATSIC, it is very important that we support ATSIC in its endeavours not only to put programs into place but also to put them in place in a way which makes sense in a cultural way to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Some people, from what might be termed a Western European perspective, have decided to criticise you cannot replace a body like· ATSIC. It is a body that is determined on the basis of representation from Aboriginal people themselves. There may be some imperfections but the reality is that it is the attempt by Aboriginal people themselves to have a voice in the programs and in the direction of the programs of government so those programs actually achieve results, especially in the key areas of the minister's concern-notably, education and health. It is sad that the minister was criticised by the ATSIC board. It is clear that there needs to be much more communication between the government, including the Prime Minister( Mr",160,Representatives Main Committee

264,Dr Theophanous,"I am speaking about the bill and its importance on the actions of1626 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 Howard), and the board, on the issues which ATSIC deals with. For a process of reconciliation between ourselves and the Aboriginal people, we need to ensure that there is greater communication and understanding by the government of ATSIC's approach and the framework which Aboriginal people bring to their affairs. That is not what has been happening and that is why we have the sorts of problems which the member for Banks referred to at some length in his contribution. I want to suggest a constructive way through this, if that is possible. We need to encourage culture. It seems to me that very often young Aboriginal people grow up in circumstances where so much of their culture has already been lost. Unfortunately, there are often not sufficient details available from the previous generation for that culture to be transmitted. We have a responsibility to use government resources, especially in education, through libraries, through materials that we have collected, through bringing people together, to try to restore lost elements of Aboriginal culture. ATSIC can playa significant role in relation to that. I want to say something about land, since you raised the issue, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Swan talked about the native title bill, claiming that there is a contradiction between ATSIC's work in relation to language use and that of the native title bill. There is no contradiction. What is important here is that, although some people of indigenous background are going to benefit from the native title situation, other people are going to need assistance in another way to get access to land. This is where ATSIC has an important role to play. . . You cannot say that, simply, the rights of those people who have claims under native title are going to be sufficient to meet the land requirements of the Aboriginal people. That is why we have the land fund; that is why we have the corporation. What is needed is some way in which we can help reconnect the Aboriginal people to the land. As I have said in other places, land is of enormous importance to the Aboriginal people. It is not just a question of the Western idea of ownership; the very belief system, the whole culture of the Aboriginal people is tied up with this association with the land. There is virtually what we would call in philosophy a metaphysical connection with the land. It is not a simple physical connection. That is why sacred sites are so dramatically important to Aboriginal people. I believe that what is required here is a much greater understanding of and sensitivity to the cultural needs of the Aboriginal people, their ideas of the land and the general idea that we should restore, or help to restore, the cultural traditions which have been taken away. to say that ATSIC somehow has overstepped the mark and so on. ATSIC is a very important body, and the measures in this bill are going to strengthen ATSIC. That is why we support them. We support the measures in this bill. We feel that the measures here will help achieve a better situation for ATSIC. But, if ATSIC is strengthened in this way, then the government has to take the next step. It has to start talking, especially, to the leadership of ATSIC and make sure that we get a new, more sensitive direction in this area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1997, basically has demonstrated the government's confidence, and anticipation of confidence, in the functioning of ATSIC. In particular, the",161,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (11.24 A.m.),"This measure, the Aboriginal and Torres StraitWednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1627 government, by making these amendments, is going to facilitate the better undertaking and course of business of ATSIC by granting to ATSIC the power to attach conditions to its consent to the disposal of an interest in ATSIC. funded property. Currently, ATSIC may only grant or refuse consent to the disposal of ATSIC funded property. The amendment would give ATSIC more options when handling disposals. It would also allow ATSIC to delegate power to ATSIC staff to approve the disposal of residential property. It is not considered necessary for the board of commissioners to approve each disposal of residential property. It will remove doubt about whether ATSIC may delegate certain ancillary powers concerning grants, loans and guarantees to a regional council. While the government is perhaps living in hope and anticipation that, by demonstrating confidence in ATSIC, ATSIC will show a bit of respect, understanding and confidence in the government, by contrast we get the tantrum that was thrown yesterday by ATSIC when it censured the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. There is also the contrast between the confidence being demonstrated by the government in ATSIC and the politicking of ATSIC in response. That is very disappointing because, at the end of the day, through that little interaction the people of Australia may come to regard the process as very unfortunate and lose more and more of the respect that they may have had for ATSIC. Some, in fact, may not have ever had much respect for it. But it is a great pity that the more this goes on the greater is the contrast between the confidence and hope shown by the government-that ATSIC will get its house in order and will be able to function better-and this sit down stunt, this tantrum, this criticism of Senator Herron, this 'censure' of Senator Herron. It really does make you wonder. I am sure I can speak reasonably authoritatively for my electorate of Dickson when I say that many of my constituents are wondering why we need ATSIC at all. Why do we need a body that is funded in this way turning around and biting the hand which feeds it? Why do we need this body in the first place if it is going to carry on like this? This body was given $70 million extra from 1996-97 to 1997-98, yet because the government is looking at a report on a new deal for Torres Strait Islanders-as I am sure it has done---criticism is directed at the minister because he is trying to give Torres Strait Islanders more autonomy as was recommended in the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are not one people; they are very much separate peoples. When the committee visited North Queensland, Torres Strait Islanders very finnly reminded the committee-and certainly told me in discussions I had with many Torres Strait Islanders-that they were sick of ATSIC. They were prepared to go along with ATSIC, they were prepared to go along with changes thatstraying a fair way from the bill. I have granted you a similar amount of leave to make some general comments, but I ask that the member for Dickson now return to the bilI. I am drawing a contrast between what the government is doing in tenns of demonstrating its confidence in ATSIC and what the ATSIC board is doing to the government in response. That is highly relevant because, in terms of this particular measure, the government is facilitating the operation of the ATSIC board in a greater way than has been done before, and at the same",162,Represent Atnes Main Commiitee

With the greatest respect, that is a relevant point to make-much more relevant, with respect, than some of the claims made by the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and the member for Banks( Mr Melham) which did not touch on the bill at all. This is highly relevant to the bill. I would respectfully say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these matters are relevant in terms of the debate that has been permitted to range over a number of areas. I think it is important, when considering the functioning of ATSIC, to remind oneself that But over time-notwithstanding that this government is trying to work with ATSIC, that it has appointed a distinguished leader of the Aboriginal community to chair ATSIC-we have had ATSIC saying, 'We do not mind what you do to facilitate the better operation of our board; we are going to slap you in the face at every opportunity. We are going to engage in cheap political point scoring, in politicking, in attempting to undermine the relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.' Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, the current inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs into indigenous businesses is yet another example of the government attempting to examine the better functioning of those businesses, and ultimately this will make for the better functioning of ATSIC. It all comes back to a government that is determined to produce outcomes. This bill relates to producing better outcomes. The measures that the government is attempting to adopt are to try to produce better outcomes, but the ATSIC politicians do not want outcomes. They want to preserve their positions forever. That is why we have this unnecessary politicking that is being perpetuated by letters between Father Brennan and the honourable member for Banks, and others, in relation to muzzling Father Brennan. We know about the politicking that has been going on, Daryl. We know about what has been happening, and Alan Ramsey might want to have a chat to you about that later. At the end of the day, we are trying to facilitate the better operation of ATSIC, and that means that we are trying to get a better outcome. That is the end result. We can argue across the table day in and day out about what has happened in the past-$16 billion was spent by the previous government in 13 years-but where are the outcomes? few months. There are double standards. That's the problem. It is a disgrace. table but we are not producing the outcomes. We are not producing the outcomes because there is so much patronisation going on. Instead of allowing Aboriginals-in particular, Torres Strait Islanders-to have a greater level of autonomy, the bureaucrats and the politicians in ATSIC do not want that to happen. They do not want the Torres Strait Islanders to get awayquiet. This debate throughout, started by the member for Banks, has been wide ranging.

I will try not to offend him in case he fires one back at me. Having said that, it is important to note that everybody in this room is trying to strive for outcomes. I know the honourable member for Aston is very committed to Aboriginal affairs and is very sincere about it, as is the honourable member for Banks. I know how committed you are, Mr Deputy Speaker, having sat with you on these committees. I know you are wanting to see a reasoned and responsible approach, an approach that will guarantee improvements for Aboriginal people. This bill is designed to facilitate that. But, in general, in the policy sense, we all are striving for that. Unfortunately, along the way, we can get sidetracked by allegations and political shenanigans which, in my view, derail the process. So let us get on with the process. Let us get on with ensuring that the situation works, because if it does not, there are real questions being asked in the community and in my electorate as to how on earth an organisation like ATSIC can continue to justify the sort of spending that it has-the spending that it takes in relation to itself, the 50 per cent more that it spends than a comparably sized department in relation to travel matters. All of· these things have caused the focus of attention of the Australian community to be on the proper functioning of ATSIC. In fact, they have caused this government to respond with inquiries in relation to that funding, with audits and so forth, but at the same time, looking at various aspects of the bill, showing that sort of confidence that I indicated at the outset and expecting ATSIC to reciprocate and to show good faith and to demonstrate thar it is accountable in this process. At the end of the day, I commend the bill to the House. I would ask that honourable members look at the operation of ATSIC in a justifiable way. Finally, in response to the member for Calwell, I think it is important to remember that the high moral ground is frequently alleged to be on that side of the House. Really, that argument is quite unfortunate. I think from time to time you get references to the fact that if we disagree with ATSIC or if we question the very fundamentals of ATSIC, then somehow or other we are against Aboriginal advancement. That is not the case. Members on this side of the House have a commitment to improving the living standards and the basic things that we all take for granted. I think that members of the opposition should give the members of this House some credit for doing that instead of raising the terrible Or' word whenever anything is done to try to make things more efficient in ATSIC and to try to adopt a process which will ultimately lead to better outcomes. With those few remarks, Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the House. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (11.37 a.m.)-in reply-I have sat here and listened to a number of very wide ranging speeches, some of which really do not require comment. In his opening remarks, the member for Banks( Mr Melham) said that this legislation had the full support of the opposition and for that I thank the opposition.

Instead, we have heard a lot of politics being played. My staff during this debate have brought me everything I have said on Aboriginal affairs in the five years that I have been in this place. It is significant. A number of people in this chamber have also made significant contributions. As I have said at other times, Aboriginal and other Australian reconciliation is far too important to be playing politics about, but that is what we have heard happen today. While the member for Banks and I would have some things to agree about, and have agreed in the past, I cannot support his remarks this morning when he made an attack on a very fine senator, Senator John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who has done so much in the last two years. I attended a seminar within Parliament House only a couple of months ago on reproductive health. There were people here from various parts of the world. There was an Aboriginal woman speaking at that seminar and she spoke about the fact that more had been done for Aboriginal health in recent times than in the preceding very many years. I think it has been poor form to refer to Senator Herron the way he has been referred to today and I staunchly defend him. He has said that there were rumours of this walkout and this resolution from the board of ATSIC in the preceding two weeks, timed impeccably to just precede debate on the Wik legislation. And unfortunately there has been far too much politics about this situation. I say again and again and again-and cannot say more emphatically-that reconciliation is far too important to have politics played. Father Brennan's name has been mentioned this morning. That has been widely talked about in the main chamber. Father Brennan is somebody who cares a great deal -bout reconciliation and working with Aboriginal people but because he took a different view from the National Indigenous Working Group means that politics is once again being played there. I repudiate all of that but, at the same time, do thank those who have supported this legislation today because it certainly is important.

Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Consideration resumed from 5 March .. REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1631 Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to bring forward the commencement of provisions which relate to the proof of an offence where the person accused is intoxicated. The relevant provisions, subsections 4.2(6) and (7), and division 8 of the criminal code, provide that self-induced intoxication cannot be considered in detennining intent or voluntariness in relation to basic offences like assault. Without the amendment those provisions would not commence until March 2000. Currently the common law applies in relation to Commonwealth offences and the accused can raise the argument that he or she was so grossly intoxicated that the offending conduct was not voluntary or intended. While the common law rule is rarely used, and then usually in relation to the state offence of assault, the government wishes to provide a lead to those states which have not enacted the model criminal code provisions on this topic. In 1995 all parties and Independents in the Commonwealth parliament supported the enactment of the criminal code rules in relation to intoxication. The Commonwealth has had these principles on intoxication in its statute since then. At the time, no doubt because the common law rules were not expected to be used in relation to Commonwealth offences, the parliament did not give priority to commencing the criminal code provisions early. The government favours commencing them now because the common law rules are inconsistent with its commitment to stamp out domestic violence. While in practice it is a state and territory issue, I want to encourage those jurisdictions which still have the common law rule to bring their law in line with the model criminal code provisions which were endorsed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in November 1993. I believe the common law rules are unacceptable to most Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]. There is no objection whatsoever to this bill on our side of the House and we support all of the remarks of the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) in his second reading speech. However, for completeness, so that the record is totally accurate, I should point out that this was the view when we were in government. It was not my personal view. I was rolled when we were in government because I am an O'Connor man, as against a Majewski man from England, but I accept that. I just want to put on the record that the former Labor government's view on this bill was the same as this government's view. We are just bringing it forward. My concern back then was a legal argument. We had a very detailed discussion in the caucus committee. Back then I found myself basically one out. I think that a lot of what has been said is exaggerated, as is acknowledged in the second reading speech. The defence has rarely been successful. I do not want to second-guess what the magistrate did in a recent case in the ACT, but I would have thought that the very fact that the person charged was able to recall the number of drinks that that person had would have precluded the defence being successful, yet it was. As I say, I do not seek to second-guess the magistrate but I just thought it appropriate that I put on the record my personal view. I am an O'Connor man and not a Majewski man. I did not have the numbers when we were in government, and I certainly do not have the numbers",165,Representatives Main Committee

I am not; I am comfortable with the government's position. That is the policy position that we adopt. It was the policy position that we adopted back then. We need to continue to have these honest and frank discussions both within government and within our own party rooms. As practitioners we need to be able to come forward in our caucus committees, in our party caucus and in our shadow ministries, and to bring to bear our professional background and our knowledge in the area. We continue to offer the government support in some areas where we think the reform is quite justified. WhatI am worried about, and that is why I will speak a little bit longer than I intended to, is that I do not want us to get to the stage where what we do as a parliament is to react to the exception and to make the exception the rule. I think our criminal justice system works quite well. I believe very strongly in the presumption of innocence. I believe very strongly that the onus is on the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt in terms of each and every element, and that we need to be very careful that as politicians we do not react to the lowest common denominator. I am not saying we are doing that here. I think there is a legitimate argument as to whether we should follow the Majewski approach or the O'Connor approach. O'Connor now has been consigned to the dustbin of history, maybe. We will see how this applies in terms of the directions that judges will give to juries. However, we do commend the government. We think it is appropriate that it be brought forward. It does send a signal. As I say, there has been a gross over-reaction to the ACT case. From a personal point of view, I think the ACT case could have been distinguished. It would have been interesting to see what happened if there was a stated case in relation to that, but that is another matter. We support the bill, but let no-one say that I did not fight the fight until the very end. However, I got rolled comprehensively. And that process is the way it should be. This was one of only two areas where in the end, after wide consultation, there was some difference of opinion around the country on the model criminal code. I think the other one had to do with what constituted a conspiracy to defraud. There has been widespread consultation on this. The view of all the jurisdictions and the attorneys-general is well known. I commend the bill to the House. Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 that I am not a lawyer. Perhaps that could account for my generally clear eyes and straightforward logic on many matters. I do, however, declare a vested interest in the matter relating to criminal law, and that is that I was a member of the founding executive, and still am a member, of the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland. That has not been because I have personally been directly hurt by a criminal act-although people around me have been. It has been because I have taken a great deal of interest since, firstly, 10 years ago-as I guess it would be now-as ajournalistwith Channel 7, I met Shari Davies, the soul and inspiration behind the Victims of Crime Association in Queensland. Her father is still the president of that body. Secondly, I am interested because, as a citizen of Australia, I read too often about how victims are dealt with in the legal process. The bill before us today is all about redressing some of the failures of the legal system and some of the things that the legal system continues to throw up. In the case of the ACT, they are now dealing with the matter; but certainly in the case of Victoria and South Australia, the",167,Representatives Main Commitiee
275,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.49 A.m.),"Let me say at the outset in the debate on theWednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1633 common law application of the drunk's defence has continued to be used as a cute way of getting people off a charge: acceptable under the legal process but, nevertheless, on the basis of common values that I think all of us in this place share, a cute process. It is important to know, as I am sure you do, that safety and security are really some of the core responsibilities that people look to the government to provide. People want a sense of safety and a sense of security so that they can go about their lives. They are participants in society by choice, because they believe society will provide them with a set of rules so that they can conduct themselves properly as individuals. By the same token, people are also feeling very let down by basic institutions. We here in parliament certainly cop a deal of criticism from people in our constituencies-more than from time to time and perhaps quite often-because they feel that we have let them down on getting some of the basic things done. Likewise, the law courts of this country are bringing themselves into some questionable repute. Anything that happens in a law court on a: daily basis really does reflect upon us as legislators, because we come up with the laws and we rightly-by the separation of powers doctrine, which I am sure we all support-leave it to the courts to'judge and to sentence. The fact that people have a declining faith in the legal process is a matter which should concern us all as legislators. I believe, and I am sure all in this place believe, that people should be dealt with consistently, regardless of their race, their creed, their gender, their income or their political beliefs. I cite a couple of recent examples of my concern: the North Sydney magistrate who decided that Greenpeace protesters should be congratulated for climbing on the roof of the Prime Minister's house to unfurl a banner. If that particular magistrate had had on the roof of his house some people protesting about some matter, I wonder how that would be Judged. I heard this morning a radio commentator complaining that the Director of Public Prosecutions in the ACT said that Aboriginal elders who lit fires out 'of necessity outside Old Parliament House should be not charged despite the fact that there is a well-broadcast fact that, because of high fire danger problems at the moment, people within the ACT will face prosecution if they light a fire. That particular matter, if it is true, certainly sends the signals to others-and unfortunately. to some in this place-to ignite all sorts of racial overtones that none of us wants. The most celebrated recent use of the drunk's defence-which is at the heart of the bill before us-was the case of footballer Noa Nadruku. I know that Minister Moylan, who is Minister for the Status of Women, said quite clearly to the House of Representatives in October last year that it is 'totally unacceptable to have such a defence at a time when alcohol and drug abuse is causing so much human pain and suffering in our communities, and that a person who voluntarily gets drunk and assaults someone should be held responsible'. I am certain that there would be very few people in this place today who would disagree with that notion. Let us have a look at some of the crimes that those who get drunk might commit. In fact, research by the Australian Institute of Criminology shows that alcohol is an important factor in homicide: 34 per cent of all offenders and 31 per cent of all victims of homicide were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. Would the drunk's defence extend to the case of homicide? I presume not. Yet in a particular case that was tried last year in the ACT, two women and a man who were apparently unknown to the perpetrator were assaulted and the perpetrator was let off because of the 'drunk's 1634 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 defence'. Is it any wonder people have a declining faith in the basic institutions in our society? All too often, criminals are given the benefits of many doubts. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, because of the person that I have gathered you are, I know that you understand that a lot of criminals are themselves victims of crimes in the past. But if we in this place are going to stand idly by and allow another cycle of offenders to be born out of the victims of today, then we are letting down today's generations as well as the future generations. That is why the signal that this bill sends to other jurisdictions, to states in this country who are still maintaining the common law defence and not using the model criminal code, needs to be sent. I applaud the approach taken by the Queensland coalition government and my good friend and colleague the Attorney-General in Queensland. They have increased and toughened a wide range of penalties for criminals, including juvenile offenders. There are many people in Queensland wondering if, as a result of a state election to come, the Australian Labor Party opposition will make true their claims of being against those particular tough new codes and whether or not, if a Labor government were elected, they would reverse that. There were only two groups in the community who were upset when the criminal code was toughened in Queensland by the coalition government. One was the criminals. The other group was the Australian Labor Party. We certainly will be maintaining pressure oil the ALP, if they happen by some twist of fate to be elected in Queensland, not to give benefits back to criminals as far as laws of the state of Queensland are concerned. It is very important that we do break the cycle of recidivism to make sure that today's victims do not become offenders tomorrow. Also, it is very important that we send clear signals to the young of this country, because there are so many young people involved in criminal activities. That is certainly not to say that young people are all criminals, by any stretch of the imagination. But what is important when we have basic institutions breaking down-families, and uncertainty about how the courts and the parliaments are asserting themselves and delivering for society-is that young people are not getting a clear signal about what is right and what is wrong. The facts speak for themselves. For most types of crime, the majority of offenders are males aged between 15 and 25. Approximately 50 per cent of motor vehicle thefts in Queensland are committed by males aged 15 to 19. People aged between 10 and 14 years-that is 23 per cent of the population-are responsible for 83 per cent of all break and enters. That is a Police Statistics Review fact, from the 1995-96 review. We all have to stop and take stock of the laws we make. We also have to ensure that we arm the courts-the judiciary have to be fully armed with a wide range of sentencing possibilities, depending on the type of crime. We need to send a clear signal to offenders and to all citizens that, if you do the crime, you should do the time. The taxpayers expect results from us, as they expect them from the law courts. The basic fabric of society is certainly under challenge. If we cannot ensure that key institutions are effective and are held in hjgh regard, more and more people are going to opt out of the basic standards of society. More and more people are going to turn their backS on key institutions. They are going to challenge authority, in all sorts of everyday ways. Perhaps they might do it by committing a criminal act to draw attention to themselves; perhaps they might do it by protesting in the halls of parliament, but essentially breaching the conventions a society demands of its citizens. Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1635 Younger Australians certainly want a sense of direction. They want a sense of discipline. They need to know there are clear-cut rules to follow and they need to know that there are sanctions there if they do not. They need to know that the drunk's defence-where, if you are under the influence of some grog, you can go and beat the living daylights out of somebody and get off-just is no longer good enough in Australian society. That is what this bill is about. It is time we made the criminals pay, not just the taxpayer. It is an important bill. I am pleased the opposition are supporting it. I commend it to the House. enacted that part of the model criminal code that deals with the general principles of criminal responsibility, which includes the excuse of gross intoxication. The model code was to be progressively applied to Commonwealth law by the year 2000. If passed, this Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998] will bring forward the provisions of the 1995 act relating to selfinduced intoxication so that they are implemented as soon as the bill becomes law. To understand why the government wishes to bring forward by two years the commencement date of legislation that has already been enacted, it is necessary to consider the so-called drunk's defence and its current place in our legal system. In Australia, criminal law has generally been a state matter with the Commonwealth enacting criminal laws only under its specific constitutional heads of power. Historically, two systems of state and territory criminal law have developed in Australia. New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia are regarded as common law jurisdictions. Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are known as the so called code states and are subject to a criminal statute code. There are some significant differences in both principle and effect between these two systems. These differences are generally believed to be unnecessary. In addition, prior to recent reforms, the application of Commonwealth criminal law arising under a statute other than the Crimes Act had to be decided according to the law of the particular state or territory in which the case was heard. Accordingly, a defendant charged under a Commonwealth law could be dealt with differently in a code state from a defendant charged with the same Commonwealth offence in a common law jurisdiction. In 1987, the then Commonwealth Attorney-General established a committee chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs, to review all the Commonwealth criminal law. At this time, most of the Australian states and territories were also reviewing their own criminal laws. In 1989, the Gibbs committee issued a discussion paper dealing with the principles of criminal responsibility and inviting submissions. In 1990, the commission released a report into the subject. That same year, the standing committee of Attorneys-General agreed to put the question of the development of a uniform Australia wide criminal code on its agenda and established an interjurisdictional committee of criminal law experts to advise on the development of a code. With the passing of the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Commonwealth parliament established rules of criminal responsibility in relation to Commonwealth criminal law with the intention that they stand as model legislation for adoption at state and territory level in due course. One of the issues of criminal responsibility that was addressed in the 1995 act was the availability of the excuse of intoxication where the intoxication was voluntary. At law, the issue of voluntary intoxication has raised difficult questions. Since gross intoxication may affect a person's ability to form an intent at the time of the offence, evidence",168,Representatives Main Committee
276,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (Midday},"With the Criminal Code Act of 1995, the Commonwealth1636 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 of intoxication can be raised in some circumstances to deny liability. The excuse of intoxication is that a person was so intoxicated that he or she did not know what they were doing and could not have formed an intent to commit the offence. Where the accused person's intoxication is self-induced, the defence is sometimes known as the drunk's defence. This can be.fatal to the prosecutor's case in circumstances where the prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt that both the physical act and the mental element, or guilty mind, were present. In practice, very few intoxicated offenders have been able to rely on this excuse. Only the most grossly intoxicated are likely to successfully show that they were incapable of intending the consequences of their actions. The law with respect to the drunk's defence was different in the code states and the common law states. At common law, the High Court of Australia noted in the 1980 O'Connor case, it is a fundamental legal principle of establishing criminal liability that an accused must be shown to have formed the neces-ary intent to commit the offence for which he or she is being tried. ' Some offences require proof only that the accused intended' to commit the prohibited act. This is a general ot 'basic' intent. Other offences involve an additional purposive intent, or an intention to achieve a particular purpose or result. For example, in the O'Connor case the offence of unlawful' wounding by stabbing required proof only that the accused intended to , insert the knife. In contrast, murder is an example of a 'specific intent' offence, because it involves an 'awareness beyond the physical act. For the offence of murder by stabbing, the so called basic intent is the intention to insert a knife into the victim's body. The additional, specific intent that must be proven to establish the offence of murder is the intent to kill or commit grievous bodily harm. In O'Connor, the High Court said that intoxication was a relevant factor in determining whether or not the accused had formed even the basic intent, even if the intoxication was selfinduced. In contrast, in the code states, the position was that intoxication cannot be taken into account in offences of basic intent, but can be relevant in specific intent offences. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General preferred to follow the position of the code states on this issue, and the 1995 Criminal Code Act of the Commonwealth adopted that preferred position as one of the model provisions for criminal law in Australia. As I said at the beginning, the provisions to which this bill relates are not due to commence until 2000, in order to allow for a period of transition while the many Commonwealth offences under a variety of statutes are reviewed and consequently amended to make them referrable to the new code before it applies to them. That brings us to October 1997, when an assault case heard by an Australian Capital Territory magistrate brought the issue of self-induced intoxication to the forefront again. In that case it was proven that, in February 1997, Canberra Raiders rugby player Noa Nadruku consumed 28 schooners of beer, six stubbies and half a bottle of wine, and then allegedly assaulted his wife and two other women. Since the common law rule in O'Connor's case applied in the ACT, it was 'Open to Nadruku to argue that he was so drunk that he could not have formed the basic intent to commit the offences. Nadruku was acquitted of the two assault charges, provoking community outrage around the nation. The community response across Australia was not surprising. It affirmed the lead that had been taken by the Commonwealth in 1995 when the parliament passed the Criminal Code Act and in so doing rejected the approach taken by the High Court in the O'Connor decision. Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1637 Following the Nadruku case, the ACT government moved quickly to legislate to remove the excuse of gross intoxication. New South Wales had already legislated in 1996 to remove the drunk's defence in offences of specific intent. In February this year, the South Australian Attorney-General announced that the South Australian government would draft legislation to abolished the so-called drunk's defence. Victoria is now the only state or territory to have made no move to change its criminal law to prevent offenders from using the intoxication defence. A spokeswoman for the Victorian Attorney-General, Mrs Jan Wade, was reported on 6 March 1998 as saying that Victoria was unlikely to move to change the law, despite action by the Commonwealth and the other states and territories. The spokesman was quoted as saying that the drunk's defence was rarely raised in Victoria. I suggest that, in view of the important issues of principle involved, that comment misses the point. Until the relevant chapter of the Criminal Code Act commences in the year 2000, the drunk's defence will remain available to defendants charged under Commonwealth criminal law. This continuing state of law appears at odds with the civilised view that alcohol is no excuse for violent behaviour. The parliament canvassed the arguments for and against the retention of the drunk's defence when the Criminal Code Act was debated in 1994 and 1995. The multipartisan view then was that the defence should be removed. Although the solution to the problem of defendants who commit offences while grossly intoxicated is by no means clear cut, this is not the occasion to re-argue the matter. However there is a hint of knee jerk in the government's reaction to the Nadruku case and for that reason I raise several points that may otherwise be overlooked in these debates. Clearly, there are powerful policy considerations in support of the view that evidence of gross intoxication should not be admissible to negative basic intent. People should not be entitled to rely by way of defence on an automatistic state brought about by their own voluntary acts. Lord Elwyn-Jones, in the English Majewski case in 1977, said: If a man of his own volition takes a substance which causes him to cast off the restraints of reason and conscience, no wrong is done to him by holding him answerable criminally for any injury he may do while in that condition. A second public policy consideration is that of community protection. In the same case, Lord Simon of Glaisdale stated: To accede to the argument on behalf of [the accused] would leave the citizen legally unprotected from unprovoked violence where such violence was the consequence of drink or drugs having obliterated the capacity of the perpetrator to know what he was doing or what were its consequences. A third public policy consideration against allowing a defendant to rely on his or her own selfinduced intoxication as a general excuse at law is the general notion of justice. Lord Salmon's view in the Majewski case was expressed succinctly as follows: If there were to be no penal sanction for any injury unlawfully inflicted under the complete mastery of drink or drugs, voluntarily taken, the social consequence could be appalling. I believe the majority of Australians believe it is unjust for a person to rely on a self-induced state to escape criminal responsibility, even if, in practice, cases of gross intoxication like the Nadruku case rarely occur. But the parliament should exercise care when it proposes legislating to impose criminal liability on an accused who acted without the necessary guilty intent for 1638 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 an unwilled act. As the High Court said in O'Connor, gUilty intent is a fundamental requirement for criminal liability. An alternative to the position enacted in the Criminal Code Act on one hand, and the O'Connor position which prevailed in the ACT at the time of the Nadruku case on the other is to create a statutory offence of dangerous or criminal intoxication. This would mean that an accused could be acquitted of the principal offence if it were found that he or she by reason of gross intoxication, whether self-induced or not, acted unintentionally. Instead, the defendant could be convicted of the lesser offence of committing a dangerous act while grossly intoxicated. The arguments for and against this suggestion were thoroughly canvassed by the Victorian Law Reform Commission in its November 1986 report, Criminal responsibility: intention and gross intoxication. I do not propose to go over those arguments now, other than to observe that a serious alternative does exist. While the division of the Victorian Law Reform Commission which worked on the reference unanimously endorsed the O'Connor approach to this issue of gross self-induced intoxication, half of the members of the division urged that a new statutory offence should be created which would consist of committing a dangerous act while grossly intoxicated. I remind honourable members that anyone interested in considering the alternative should read the report. Intoxication in the context that we are discussing refers not just to alcohol but also to drugs. Clearly, alcohol and drug consumption are present in the commission of many crimes. The Victorian Law Reform Commissioner, in 1983, instigated research by Dr Allen Bartholomew, then consultant psychiatrist at Pentridge prison. Dr Bartholomew undertook a study of 274 prisoners who were charged with offences of various types and degrees of seriousness, from murder, rape and burglary to minor traffic offences. All the prisoners were males and were classified by Dr Bartholomew as either 'chronic alcoholics', 'under the influence of alcohol' or as 'drinking near the time'. Dr Bartholomew found that 63.5 per cent of the sample group were chronic alcoholics or under the influence at the time of the offence. He found that 81.4 per cent of the total group had been drinking before the offence and that 48.2 per cent of the total group had taken other drugs before committing the offence, including 18.9 per cent of the total sample who had taken hard drugs. The alcohol or drug involvement in the whole sample was 258 out of 274 or 94 per cent. These results show fairly clearly a correlation between alcohol and other drugs and criminal activity. The concern that has prompted the government to act quickly to bring forward the commencement of the relevant chapter of the Criminal Code Act lies more specifically in the context of domestic violence. In his press release in October 1997, the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) said that the approach taken in the Nadruku case was a blow for anyone concerned about the effect of alcohol related violence in the home and on the street. The Attorney said in his statement that women, in particular, have expressed concern at the use of the drunk's defence and that he shared that concern. The Attorney went on to say that nobody should be subjected to violence and tQat it must be especially disconcerting for women, as the most frequent victims of domestic violence, to have any such trauma exacerbated by what he called 'outmoded legal considerations'. I share the Attorney's concerns about the need to combat violence in the home. While I have drawn the House's attention to the thin end of the wedge argument about criminal responsibility and warned against the knee-jerk reaction to the Nadruku decision, I Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1639 also note that the reforms to the law in relation to this issue were examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and passed with multipartisan support when the Criminal Code Act was being considered in 1994 and 1995. On balance, I commend the government for having acted promptly on this matter and commend the bill. principles of criminal responsibility, originating as it did in the model criminal code project which had its genesis in the 1990 recommendations of the review of the Commonwealth criminal law headed by Sir Harry Gibbs. The recommendation was that there be uniform principles of criminal responsibility throughout Australia. Sir Harry Gibbs, a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, a judge of the Federal Court and a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland, was probably Australia's greatest authority on criminal law. He had an incredible understanding of the Queensland criminal code and I am pleased to see that his expertise was utilised in the drafting of the model criminal code and the recommendations that surrounded it. In the case of O'Connor, His Honour was in the minority. A majority of the High Court in that case were Barwick CJ, Mr Justice Stephen Murphy and Mr Justice Aitken, while the minority judges were GibbsJ as he then was, MasonJ as he then was, and Mr Justice Wilson dissenting. It is important to reflect a little on the practical reality of intoxication matters. In my 13 or so years of legal practice, never once was I successful for an accused in arguing an intoxication defence. Frequently in legal argument, when His Honour would be making rulings, the comment would be made that, ' Mr Smith was finally driven to submit intoxication.' It is virtually the last bastion of defences in Queensland under the code. There is a specific provision, which from memory I think is section 28 of the criminal code in Queensland, but it is very limited in operation. . That reflects to a degree the common law position because Mr Justice Starke said in relation to his experience the following: ... over nearly forty years' of experience in this StateI have found juries to be very slow to accept a defence based on intoxication. I do not share the fear held by many in England that if intoxication is accepted as a defence as far as general intent is concerned the floodgates will open and hordes of guilty men will descend on the community. That citation appears in the 1980 Victorian Reports 635 at page 647. However, in his masterly dissent in O'Connor's case, Sir Harry Gibbs at pages 93 and 94 of the judgment in the Commonwealth Law Reports made the following remarks: I agree with the statement of Lord Salmon in Reg. v. Majewski (79), that: 'If there were to be no penal sanction for any injury unlawfully inflicted under the complete mastery of drink or drugs, voluntarily taken, the social consequence could be appalling.' His Honour goes on: Crimes of violence committed by persons while intoxicated have never been uncommon, and the increase of drug-taking in the community today has made the problem even more serious. The law would afford quite inadequate protection to the individual, and would rightly be held in contempt, if persons completely under the influence of drink or drugs could commit crimes with impunity. There are therefore strong reasons of policy which support the rule of substantive law for which Reg. v. Majewski is authority, namely that in crimes which are not crimes of special intent, self-induced intoxication does not relieve the accused of criminal responsibility.",171,Representatives Main Committee
277,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (12.19 P.m.),"The Criminal Code Act 1995 deals with1640 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 His Honour then basically states the ratio of the decision in his judgment, which appears at page 94, when he says: Speaking generally, it seems to me in no way unjust to punish a person who commits a crime while in a state of self-induced intoxication. To do so would not, I think, offend the conscience of society or be contrary to ethical principles. Cases may be suggested in which it might appear harsh to punish a person for actions committed while in a state of advanced intoxication-for example, the case of an inexperienced child who became drunk or drugged to such a degree that he lost control of his actions-but those are the exceptions, and in general there would seem little merit in a rule that allowed a person to place himself beyond the law (deliberately or otherwise) by becoming intoxicated. It does not follow from the decision in Reg. v. Majewski that evidence of the intoxicated condition of the accused must be rejected as irrelevant. That would be absurd; the evidence is admissible as one of the surrounding circumstances, and in some cases it will be relevant to other questions in issue. MightI add the caveat that in Queensland, at least, more and more, even in relation to sentencing, while intoxication can be a matter of some submission, it does not necessarily go to reducing the penalty on sentencing. I am very pleased to support these measures. In large respect I echo some of the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Curtin( Mr Rocher), in his very well reasoned and thorough approach to this matter. I note in the second reading speech that reference was made to the government's commitment to stamp out domestic violence. I know that the context of the speech would necessarily be referring to where there is physical violence, or threats to commit same, because one of the difficulties that has emerged in this debate, particularly in recent times, has been the problem of definition. The word 'violence' is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as: The exercise of physical force so as to inflict injury on or damage to persons or property. It is an emphatic word implying great force, severity or vehemence. It is a misuse of the English language to describe lack of physical contact as violence for that word involves dreadful connotations. There is a widespread belief in the community that domestic violence does mean actual physical violence when in fact, having regard to the-legislation, certainly in Queensland, it does not necessarily mean that at all. I refer here to an extremely insightful comment by Senator the Honourable Anne Cools in her paper given on 27 April 1995 entitled Diversity and domestic violence. Senator Cools sits in the Canadian Senate and is a member of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology. She has been a leader and innovator in creating services to assist battered women and families troubled by domestic violence. She said in this paper: Until the 1970s family violence has been a neglected subject matter. The treatment of wife abuse however is now accompanied by literature, social services, law enforcement response and coercive actions which largely view the wife as a passive innocent victim, beaten by an aggressive guilty husband. Spouse abuse and wife abuse have become synonymous, and wife battering has dominated the definition of domestic violence. Here the concept of inherent moral inferiority is buttressed by the male as the innate progenitor of all malice, violence and aggression. These two concepts are supported by aggressive feminist ideologies, by the terrorism of political correctness, and are consistently seeking dominance in the discussion of domestic violence. In a recent paper that I provided to the Domestic Violence Legislation Working Group within the Attorney-General's Department, I made these observations, which I think are timely. Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1641 In relation to the issue of domestic violence, where there is actual violence or threatened violence, which is a crime in Queensland under the criminal code, it ought to be a crime in terms of drafting new domestic violence laws. This will serve a very useful purpose. It will signal to those minded to commit actual violence or threaten violence that the community regards it as a criminal offence and the perpetrators will be punished according to the criminal law. However, it also meanthat those who arf.': so charged will be judged by their peers. That is, charges will proceed according to the normal standards of proof, being proof beyond reasonable doubt,with the onus being on the Crown. The effect of such a charge will follow the normal criminal pattern with the person charged being entitled to apply for bail. Bail might ordinarily be granted depending on the seriousness of the offence and subject to conditions and that would effect, in the case of. a married couple or a couple in a de facto relationship, an immediate separation and a non-contact order, breach of which would involve arrest and incarceration rather than what the present system entails under the current domestic violence laws. Moreover, the granting of a fair trial will remove the degree of unfairness that surrounds the current situation, while at the same time ensuring that women who have been beaten will be able to feel secure that the. criminal justice system has the case in hand and that the punishment will fit the crime. It is no good saying that domestic violence is a crime, when it is not a crime as far as the law is concerned. We ought to make it a crime and, accordingly, I suggest that path .. . At the same time, we need to complement these changes with a conciliation system for where there is, between the parties, significant· disputation but no violence or threatened violence. The present system permits the granting of a domestic violence order in those circumstances. In those cases, in my view, the words 'domestic violence' should not be used but rather the term 'conciliation order'. Under this procedure, a party so affected could apply to the court for a conciliation order, which would be an interim order to obtaining a separation order. Under this order, the respondent and the applicant would be ordered to have counselling with a qualified counsellor within a stated period of, say, seven days. If the respondent failed to attend counselling in that way, a separation order could be issued in terms similar to the current domestic violence order provisions, but not for a period of two years as is presently the norm. I would suggest an order would subsist for a period of six months or until further order. This would effect a cooling-off period with some counselling, which in the majority of cases resolves these matters. My professional experience as a barrister suggests that this is the way ahead. In the case that has been most celebrated in relation to this particular issue of intoxication as a defence, the Nadruku case, it should be remembered by all honourable members that that was a decision of, as I understand it, a junior magistrate of the ACT Court. I would doubt very much that it could be said-in fact, I say this authoritatively-that that case would provide any precedent whatsoever. What is curious and difficult to understand-although, as I was not in court, I should be very careful of what I say about this-is why it was that the Crown did not appeal that decision. AgainI am only jUdging by what I read; but, in relation to the factual issues and particularly to the fact that this individual could walk up stairs-or, in other words, had had sufficient 1642 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 March 1998 intent to put one foot in front of the other to go up stairs-the idea that he had not had sufficient intent to bash three individuals is to me preposterous, both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact and common sense. I am surprised, but I understand that there may be some reason that I am not aware of for an appeal not to have been lodged. It most certainly would have been, from what I have seen of the case, a successful appeal, but there may be other factors involved which may have caused a different exercise of discretion: we do not know. Perhaps it would be nice to understand some reasons, but only the Attorney-General in the ACT would be able to disclose those reasons, I would think. It was a bad case, it was arguably a wrong case and, in my view, it was a case where the people who have been injured by the individual concerned ought to be encouraged to seek out civil remedies and pursue the individual concerned with the utmost ability that the law provides. At the end of the day, that is a one-off case. I know of no comparable case where that has occurred. Quite clearly, the Gibbs view, the minority view in the High Court, has now become accepted in relation to the common law jurisdictions and as a path for the Model Criminal Code to follow, and this legislation picks up on that and sends an important message to the community at the same time. I support the bill. who participated in this debate on the Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998], the member for Banks( Mr Melham), the member for Moreton( Mr Hardgrave), the member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) and the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith). There seems to be unanimous support for the bill and I thank the Labor Party for their support. I only want to comment, by way of reply, on one issue. Some speakers have pointed out that the so-called drunk's defence is rarely used. But, of course, one has to ask why it should be allowed to happen, even if it is rare. The Victorian Law Reform Commission, in a report in 1986, defended the O'Connor rules. They pointed out that, while it is statistically rare, they were able to identify 30 authentic cases in which it had been discovered that the accused was totally acquitted, apparently due to lack of voluntariness or intention by reason of gross intoxication. Most of these cases were in the magistrates courts and many, but not all, were minor. That research mayor may not have been complete. The likelihood is, in fact, that there were more acquittals which could not be identified. The Nadruku case, to which the member for Dickson has just referred and to which other speakers referred, is a clear example of the sort of case that comes before magistrates courts. Even if the case is dealt with in the magistrates courts rather than in a higher court, the victims of those sorts of cases can still feel the pain of the assault-the pain of the punch or the kickand the humiliation. It has an impact on their capacity to go out at night without the fear of being harassed or terrified by drunken people who act violently. If there were 30 cases in Victoria during the period between 1980 and 1986, as the Victorian Law Reform Commission has identified, that is 30 too many. The speakers have all supported the bill. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. I will put the report question forthwith.

279,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail,Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1643 Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 November 1997, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. opposition in respect of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bil11997. That role will be taken by my colleague the honourable member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson), who is the shadow parliamentary secretary for superannuation matters. However, I would like to raise a number of issues with the Main Committee and I hope that some of them will possibly be addressed by the government when they respond at the committee stage of this bill. The bill is not one which we oppose. The majority of matters are non-controversial and the opposition will generally be supporting the legislation. But, as I said, there are soine particular matters which are worthy of further comment and, indeed, potentially even of amendment in another place. This legislation amends the superannuation legislation, the Bankruptcy Act, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act. It has a number of principal areas which I will touch on briefly. Firstly-and this is an area which I will return to-the bill seeks to permit fund members to make a binding nomination of those persons to whom their superannuation benefits should be paid in the event of their death prior to retirement. But there are a number of restrictions on that nomination, and it is those nominations and the restrictions on the nomination to which I would like to return and which I suggest are potential areas for amendment of this legislation. The bill also seeks to limit the ability of companies to borrow from their own superannuation fund. That has the potential, in the event that the company is unable to repay the loans due to some financial difficulties in the future, to put members' superannuation benefits at risk. We have all seen the difficulties which have flowed recently from companies that have gone out of business, that have gone into liquidation, who are not able to pay even such basic worker benefits as wages, long service leave and recreation leave, and there are cases where superannuation funds have not been paid into the fund but have still been on the company's books. Therefore, the workers have suffered a substantial financialI loss as a result of those problems. , Although this does not tackle many of the broader issues which' we would all want to see addressed as a matter of urgency with respect to wages, long service leave and the like, it does seek to limit the ability of companies to borrow from their own in-house fund and, therefore, ensures to some degree at least that the workers' assets in that superannuation fund are better protected as a result. The legislation also seeks to make possible the use by superannuation funds of tax file numbers which were collected priorA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.41 to 12.53 p.m. speech-",178,Representatives Main Committee

282,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"You were just getting into your stride.1644 MAIN COMMITTEE ' Wednesday, 25 March 1998 However, as I recall, I was discussing the issue of tax file numbers and the fact that this legislation will make it possible for superannuation funds that have collected tax file numbers for other purposes prior to 5 June 1997 to use them now for surcharge tax purposes which will, of course, be a lot more efficient for the superannuation funds. The government is constrained to make this kind of amendment to allow tax file numbers to be used for a purpose for which they were not originally intended. This is something which the parliament would not normally do, because a tax file number is a particularly important and private number which was intended to be used only for specific nominated purposes. The fact that we are now extending that to the superannuation fund tax surcharge highlights the problems which the government has with that surcharge and the way in which the surcharge has the potential to reach to income levels well below the $70,000 threshold which the government had established for it. Obviously, if lower and middle income earners who would not normally be subject to the surcharge failed to lodge their tilx file number with the superannuation fund, then of course' the government's legislation makes them liable for the surcharge, notwithstanding that their income is below the threshold. It has always been the opposition contention that many low and middle income earners 'will be caught by the superannuation surcharge legislation and will therefore have many thousands of dollars of their superannuation fund inappropriately and improperly taxed· by the government. That is a serious problem. This legislation is just afurther indication of the difficulties with the superannuation surcharge legislation and the way in which it does reach down into other income groups. I think it is an issue which the parliament will have to return to over time, because of the failure of that legislation, the inequity in that legislation and the way in which the government was forced to construct it in such an artificial way because of their promise not to increase taxation, but their then desire to do so. The mechanism that they chose became the superannuation surcharge tax levy. Although we do not actually oppose that provision, it certainly does highlight the way in which the government's legislation on the tax aspect of this is inadequately drafted. T his legislation will also expand the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's monitoring and investigation powers and increase penalties for non-compliance and also change the way in which the tribunal itself is structured. These changes are not particularly fundamental of themselves, but when you look at them in relation to the recent decision by the Federal Court to prevent the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal from clothing itself with what were quasijudicial powers, obviously this raises a lot more, serious questions and ones which this legislation does not adequately address. The opposition is still waiting/for the government to actually address the matter of the recent Federal Court decision, which has taken away much of the intended purpose of the Superaimuation Complaints Tribunal. It has limited its activities very severely, because obviously it can no longer pursue any judicial or quasi-judicial outcomes to its investigations. That really has deprived people of a very convenient, reasonable and cheap means of gaining some degree of justice in the superannuation industry, where they feel they have been harshly or improperly dealt with by their superannuation fund. I know my colleague, the member for Wills, will want to return to that because, on so many occasions, members of the work force who have only modest superannuation investments are not in a position to take their superannuation fund to court or to seek redress through the courts in the usual way because of the massive costs which are associated with that. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, which was established by the previous Labor government,",179,Representatives Main Committee
283,Mr Martyn Evan,"That is right. The break for a division is quite substantial.Wednesday, 25 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1645 did provide them with a very cost-effective means of resolving their complaints against their superannuation fund in a way which did not constrain them to incur heavy costs in court actions. These, of course, the super fund could defend with very deep pockets indeed, but the average member of the work force was in no position to compete with them in respect of their legal funding or their access to legal advice. They would have been very much disadvantaged in that kind of fight. However, the main aspect that I want to draw the committee's attention to, in the hope that the government will address some of my concerns in its response to the Main Committee debate, is this issue of allowing members of the work force to nominate those to whom their benefits should be paid in the event of their untimely death prior to actually obtaining their superannuation benefit. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it can reasonably be said that death is the ultimate bona fide retirement. There is no doubt, on the death of the worker, that they have retired, if I can use that expression, from the work force. They are no longer in the work force. It is not an issue of doubt or dispute and there can be no question that upon the death of a worker, it is very much for that worker to determine, for that member of a superannuation fund to determine, where their benefit sJlOuld flow, given their death. If a worker or member of a super fund had retired in the normal course of events, then their benefit would have been paid to them, if it was an accumulation fund, in the form of cash. They would have retired with that cheque and their subsequent death would have ensured that the funds were treated in accordance with that person's will or, if they had no will, in accordance with the normal laws of intestacy. Alternatively, that person could have given away or spent those funds in any way they saw fit. Contrast that with the case of what happens at the moment if a member of a superannuation fund happens to die while they are at work. The superannuation fund is under no obligation to pay the member's benefits in any way in accordance with that member's direction. They have an absolute discretion as to how they treat the member's benefit upon his death and even if the member has filed with the fund a nominated beneficiary form-nominating people to whom the benefits should be paid-unfortunately the trustees, at the moment, are under absolutely no obligation to pay the benefit in accordance with that member's instructions. I would seek leave to continue my remarks in view of the hour, Mr Deputy Speaker. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
