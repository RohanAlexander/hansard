0,"House Of Representatives. Thursday, 15 April, 19s0. Took The Chair At 2.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. Plaints Have Been Made To Me By Per","sons who are unable to obtain coal, and I have already brought before the House the difficulty of getting coal. From a man whom I know well I have received a communication, which.I will let the Minister see, saying that, although the Coal Board states that no coal is available for private houses, James Patterson and Company have delivered a lorry load to a certain gentleman, and a small load to another gentleman. Will the Minister inquire why some householders can get coal while others cannot? very glad to make the inquiry asked for. We are still at a critical stage with regard to coal supplies, because, although there is no strike now, and the' coal boats are running, the shortage has not yet been overtaken; and, therefore, control has to .be exercised and priority given to certain industries, until the stocks have been replenished. I do not know why one householder should be able to get coal while others cannot get it. whether it is not a fact that nearly every house in Melbourne is, at the present time, without coal! As the -winter season is approaching, when coal will be -greatly needed, 'cannot something be done to facilitate the supply of it for household purposes? Within a few weeks the position will be serious. is one, not of distribution, but of obtaining supplies. It is all a question of shipping and supplies. If the coal were here, it could be distributed without trouble. Do my honourable friends suggest that we should give up the control of the coal trade, and allow it to flow in its normal channels? If that were desired, it would save the Department a great deal, of trouble to comply with the desire. has done good work. too; that is generally recognised, although complaints are made by many whose industry cannot be given priority. The only remedy for the -present state of affairs is an increase in the production of coaL in the statement appearing in this morning's Age that an elaborate secret service -organization is to be established permanently in Australia?

In1916, Cabinet decided? that officers of I emphatically assert that I have no in the Commonwealth Public Service should not' be granted recreation leavein. respect of the period, during, which they were members, of the Australian Imperial Force. 2 and 4. Inquiries are being made, and the information will be furnished in due course. 3. No. Except that, on enlistment, officers were granted recreation leave for the year in which tbey enlisted (phis' any arrears lo which they were entitled'), and in some cases officers were granted pay in lieu of furlough. Debate resumed from 25th March (vide That a Select Committee, consisting of seven members of. this House,, be appointed to inquire into and"" report upon the conditions of the Australian Overseas and Inter-State sea carriage. SinceI last addressed the House oh this subject there, has been a considerable alteration in the position, the Government having handed back' the ships to the various companies, -under, certain, conditions. So far as my judgment goes, these conditions seem to he very good, inasmuch as they continue control over freights and fares; and this I regard as a move in the right direction. When this matter was before the House yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) informed the. House as to the profits made in 1914 by the various steam-ship -companies, and also the"" profits, according to the balance sheets,, right -up to 1920'. I then pointed out, By my interjection, that' it would be only fair to also state the capital invested at' the variousdates, so that honourable members might judge whether the profits were fair, or wereexorbitant The honourable gentleman should -also have told 1 us that' some of thevessel's on which the companies made these, profits were out. of. Auatnaliai, and,, therefore,, beyond the influence of the Shipping Board; and, further, that some ships'-had been sold by the owners, as far as my memory serves, at' something like 100' percent, more than their book values. Now, because I Have, asked the honourable member if it would not. have been fairer for Mm to have gives, the House that information, hevery ungenerously tries to make out that I have been interested in the steam-ship companies, or hi some of them, at any rate. terest in any shipping company. Of coarse, I desire at all times to see justice done,, no matter whether .the party or company concerned is a friend or an opponent. All1 desire in the case of the shipping companies is justice, and I ask the Leader of the Opposition also to do justice, and not to mislead this House or the public. There has. been aa enormous amount of money made by some of the companies outside of Australia, and beyond the authority of. theShipping Controller. It all goes clearly to show that if we had not taken over control of shipping the industries of Australia .would have been very seriously interferedwith. As events have proved, we have been able to secure cheaper freight along the Australian coast than' has ruled in any other part of 1 the world. That is greatly to the credit of the shipping control. The Prime Minister, yesterday, gave valuable information to this House which should remove much of the misapprehension' that may haw been' created by theremarks of the Leader of the Opposition-. I move That all the words after "" upon "" be left out, with a view to insert the following words in lieu thereof:"" 1. The organization and control of InterState shipping. 2. Oversea shipping in relation to Australian products for oversea marfrets and imports generally. 3. Methods' to improve mail cargoand passenger service with oversea countries."" My reason for proposing the deletion of the words"" the conditions of the Australian overseas and Inter-State sea carriage"" is' that if the Committee were appointed to inquire upon, that basis it could enter into such matters as wages' and similar subjects, for dealing with which machinery is already provided.

47,Mr Mcwilliams,"I will accept thethat this Committee-, if it is appointed, will be an important body. As a rule I have not favoured the creation of such investigating bodies by this Parliament, as I have held the view that it is the duty of Parliament itself to deal with matters of public importance rather than relegate them to the consideration of a small number of members. However, valuable work has been done in the past in matters such as that upon which the proposed Committee will inquire. I recall the formation of a Committee upon the motion of the then honourable member for Barrier, now Senator Thomas. This Committee'was formed to deal with the question of Australian shipping, and with the rebates which the companies paid to their customers in order to compel them to deal with those companies. It was ascertained, as the result of investigations) that it was impossible for any firm to secure back freight with theshipping companies if they had not given their forward business to the same ships. light at Maryborough was the worse of the lot. was certainly ample need for such an inquiry, and the Committee did good work. The proposed Committee also, I feel sure; will perform valuable service. Notwithstanding all that the Prime Minister said yesterday, and despite the statements of the ho-monable member for Wide Bay( Mr £3,000,000, as proved by the Royal' ComCorser) to-d'ay, the shipping companies of Australia have beeni on a. very good wicket during recent years. The fact that other countries havesuffered more than Australia is no reason why Australians should be made to suffer asmuch. I trust that honourable members who may be appointed upon theCommittee will push forward their investigations and report to Parliament at the earliest opportunity, so that this House may deal with their recommendations. statement made by the. honourable memday, word was sent? out by the Controller of Shipping, inviting the companies to increasetheir freights and fares 20 per cent., in view of which enormous profits were made It is all very well for the honourable member for Wide Bay to assertthat I did not mention yesterday the amount of capital involved in the various shipping interests-, and that I did not say whether the companies were making bigger profits now than formerly. The honourable member must be aware of the amount of watering of stock that has been going on. more capital has been put into the companies. Australia which have been afraid to pay the enormous dividends that they could very well disburse. They have piled up reserves year after year, with the intention, when the opportunity arrives, and when the people are not watchful, and! have become accustomed to the continual watering of stock, of declaring, dividend's upon the increased capital. That sort of thing is being done with respect to nearly every company in Australia today. statement.. thirds of the companies in Australia have done it. I know of companies in Victoria that have done it. Victoria. fining Company, for which the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) is always apologizing, is the worse offender, having watered its stock to the extent of mission on the Sugar Industry. far the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I merely wish to have the facts stated correctly. , I am nob an apologist for any company.. I mentioned Victoria. Of course, no such thing could happen in Queensland. that it happens in any State to the extent According to the of two-thirds of the companies operating. panies,, shipping companies, and companies in other industries have put their profits into reserves, and then converted those reserves into stock.

However, I trust that the proposed Select Committee will be appointed, and get to work immediately, so that it may bring in a report of advantage to the people of Australia. [3.3] I intend to say a few words in support of the motion. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) that -while it is not advisable, except in cases of extreme urgency, to refer questions to Select Committees, yet there are one or two phases of this subject upon which the interests of the people demand that Parliament should be fully informed. I do not intend to follow those who have spoken about the treatment of Australia by the Inter-State shipping operations. It is quite clear to nearly every'one who has read what has taken place during the war, that the dividends earned by the Inter-State shipping companies have been secured largely by the very high prices paid by the Imperial Government for commandeered vessels. seas trade. and that is how the excessive dividends, if they are excessive, have been earned by these companies. Commonwealth Government has had absolute control. There has not been a penny increase in charges except with its concurrence. I am speaking with knowledge of the subject, because I have been in business ^contact with the Inter-State shipping companies for the last thirty or forty years. However, my concern is not so much with the past as with the future, and it is about the future that I desire the House and the people of the country to be fully informed. that many of the Australian shipping companies have sold the pick of their fleets at very large prices, in some cases at double the cost of the vessels when new, and I think I am correct in saying that some of them have entered into new relationships during the last year or two. nearly all of them have done so. many of them have done so, and we do 'not know what treatment Australia is to receive in the future. That is *the very information we ought to have. Some of the shipping companies have got rid of nearly half of their effective fleets. have got -rid of their old vessels and purchased new vessels it will be all the better for Australia. mentioned the point in order to show that we do not know how we are to be treated in the immediate future. I was about to say that, in disposing of their vessels, some of the companies intended to restore the strength of their fleets and supply Australia with perfectly up-to-date vessels in place of many obsolete steamers they have got rid of, but they have not been able to secure the new vessels so far. One of the biggest companies thought that it would pay them better to wait until they could buy or build at a much cheaper rate. So far they have not been able to do so, and now that Government control of InterState shipping has been withdrawn and private enterprise is again in full operation, it is essential to know exactly what service is to be given to Australia. Particularly is it essential that we should know what service we are to get overseas. For these reasons I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion as amended. Minister for the Navy) [3.8] I see no objection whatever to the amendment as During the war the suggested by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser). A great deal of good and useful work can be done by a Committee of this House, carefully selected, bending its energies and intelligence to the consideration of the future outlook of shipping in Australia. The Government heartily welcome such an inquiry. A ll sorts of statements have been made from time to time, and it is just as well that the facts of the situation should be known. But above all, I remind honourable The position is members that it is useless to trouble very much about what happened during the days of war, when the trade and commerce and industry of the whole of the nations of the world were completely dislocated. Our present duty is to see that we are facing the future with fair prospects of success. Australia is a marine country entirely dependent for its life blood upon its shipping, and it is a matter of the most urgent moment that we should know exactly what the future may be, and just how Australia is shaping to meet the newer and, we hope, better outlook.",25,Liams

Some countries have been building vessels for ages, and there is a sort of traditional skill among their workers which is almost hereditary with them. We, on the other hand, are a young country, but, of course, we belong to the same race, and our workmen have inherited the same skill. What our enterprise in shipbuilding has shown is that in the process of transplantation from older to newer countries we are losing nothing of the 'skill and cunning of the old days, but are actually adding to and crowning that which has been the distinguishing feature of the British Empire in the past. All this is infinitely satisfactory, and if have .only two representatives out of we can address ourselves in the same spirit to the future I believe there is in every way a good outlook for Australia. Coming to the question of ship construction, I believe that nearly all, if not all, of the vessels built by the Commonwealth Government have cost well under £30 per ton. When the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and I passed through the United States just before the war closed, I saw a steel standard ship of 8,S00 tons which had just been launched at a cost of £38 per ton to the Government of the United States of America. built before the war were sold up to £60 per ton during the war period I am speaking now of the price which the Government of the United States of America had to pay for the construction of ships that were being turned out en masse all over the States. dardized, they were of cheap construction, yet were costing £38 per ton. The comparison shows that our cost of construction ig coming out exceedingly well a fact upon which we may all con-' grafculafce ourselves. ping industry in Australia will prosper, are the Governasi t must, if , remote as we are from other countries, we are to hold our own. The proposed Select Committee is, however, quite another matter. It will have to do with the' organization and control of shipping from a business stand-point as well as from the point of view of construction. An inquiry of this kind, conducted with a view to ascertaining the facts, and finding out what it is best to do to meet the future, must be attended with good results. The Government welcome the proposed inquiry, and accordingly accept the amendment. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Company defied the Sugar Commission, although we passed an Act of Parliament empowering the Commission to compel representatives of the company to attend before it and give evidence. If this Committee is to do any good it will certainly come into conflict with vested interests, and we should therefore take care to give it power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and papers. I was about to refer to the same matter. I accepted the amendment to the original motion, believing that it would permit of the full inquiry that we desire.

I first brought this matter forward in 1910. In subsequent years, I moved similar motions, and finally the House agreed to the proposal. At that time, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs; and, in .reply to a question by me, he said that the Grovernment would not take any steps to give effect to the resolution of the House until after the termination of the war. During the war, Western Australia was imposing very heavy inspection fees on produce imported from other States, and those fees were having the. same effect as a duty additional to the £1 per ton provided for in the Tariff. The producers in other parts of the Commonwealth felt that this charge was unfair; and, after some remonstrance by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gjoom), Western Australia reduced the inspection fees on potatoes from about 15s. to 2s. 6d. per ton.

States? ing the States or any one else. I am merely speaking of what has happened, and showing how trouble can be prevented in the future. The discussion of this matter in the House has already done good. The honourable member foT Darling Downs( Mr Groom), when Minister for Trade and Customs, appealed to the Western Australian authorities, with the Tesult that they reduced their inspection fees, as I have said, from 15s. to 2s. 6d. a ton. I urge upon the Government the holding of a conference or some other communication with the State authorities for a discussion of the matter. convinced that satisfaction will result from such action. opinion, if the motion were carried, it would defeat its own object, because there would be again the cry that State rights were being interfered with. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) has, however, made a suggestion which, in my opinion, should meet the case. A Premiers' .Conference is to be held shortly, and if the matter were brought before it some agreement might' be arrived at concerning the inspection of produce passing from State to State. Undoubtedly co-ordination in this and other matters would benefit trade, and be of advantage to the community generally. that the honourable member for Wilmot, when I was Minister for Trade and Customs, moved and carried a motion similar to that now under discussion. Undoubtedly, some of the States have used their powers of inspection to protect their local producers. In some cases, produce imported from other States has been absolutely ruined by the system of inspection adopted. I would not vote for an arrangement under which a Victorian official was empowered to say whether goods should be allowed to go to another State, because State officials might be tempted to relax an inspection which was not being made in the interests of their own State. Undeniably, every State has the right to do what it can to prevent the introduction of diseases and pests. Western Australia was, and I hope still is, free from codlin moth, being, I think, the only State that has not got that attack the disease. In my opinion, the prevention of the spread of diseases can be best brought about by Federal inspection, though I do not share the hope that the State Premiers will agree to hand over to the Commonwealth any powers for the bettering of the position. motion as it stands will cause friction with the States, and we do not want any more of that. tion with the States, but no State should be permitted to use its powers of inspection to shut out the produce of other States. When Minister for Trade and Customs, and speaking to a former motion, of the ""honourable member for Wilmot, I I am took the same attitude. Every State in Australia had Irish blight. tralia. it, too. Except for the codlin moth, that State has as many pests and diseases as any. other, and no State should' use its powers of inspection to the detriment of other States., In my opinion, Commonwealth inspection, in some cases at least, would be better than State inspection, which has occasionally proved faulty; and I believe that this Parliament has already carried a resolution approving of Commonwealth inspection. We know that there were instances in which stores for hospital ships and transports were passed by State inspectors, and afterwards found to be diseased, and the circumstances made it impossible for the disease to have appeared after the State inspection. In those cases, the State inspection was faulty. With Commonwealth inspection, the interests of all the States would be safeguarded. We should do all that we can to prevent diseases from spreading from State to State, but without Commonwealth inspectors it is impossible to know exactly what is the position in any State. I hope that the motion will be passed.",29,Inspection Of Produce

In my opinion, there should be no restriction of trade between the States furtherthan may be necessary to check the spread of diseases. I should like to see the words "" and live stock "" inserted after the word "" produce "" in the motion. In many in stances, State authorities have acted in such a way as to greatly restrict trade in live stock, and in some cases have thus caused severe losses to the community. To my knowledge, the community, as a whole, has, on occasions, lost hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the cost of living throughout Australia has been proportionately increased owing to the jealousy between Queensland and New South Wales, and the same undoubtedly occurs in many instances in regard to produce. I call the attention of the House to a very much -better way in which these matters are managed in the United States of America, from whose "" b o o k "" we ought to take a "" leaf."" From an American official publication I take the following:A Bureau of Markets has been established as a branch of tlie United States Department of Agriculture to deal with problems as associated with marketing of agricultural produce, and particularly with perishable produce. This Bureau has rendered service to the community, because it has been, able to bring about a wiser distribution of agricultural produce, has reduced losses by wastage, and has, therefore, benefited both"" producer and consumer. Moreover, through the agency of the Bureau the marketing of perishable produce has been converted from a hazardous into a steady business. The Bureau carries out three classes of activity(1) Investigational work in marketing of produce; (2) The supply of regular market reports on all types of produce; (3) Regulatory work in connection with the enforcement of the Grain Standards Act. The investigational work includes the marketing and distribution of farm products, food supply investigations, co-operation with the States in solving marketing problems. The investigations cover market conditions, demands for specific crops, sources of supply, methods of grading, standardization, packing, and shipping. . . . . . This bureau exercises all activities in connection with the bringing of produce from the market garden or the farm direct to .the consumer. In these days, every one is suffering from the tremendous increase, in the'cost of living. This is owing chiefly, not to [53]2 lack of produce, but, on the one hand, to an inflated currency-whic h we can deal with at another time-and , on the other hand, to lack of method in distribution. There are many places in Australia to-day where large quantities of 1 valuable produce, more particularly vegetable produce, is rendered almost valueless owing to the lack of transport facilities. One of the greatest needs in Australia to-day is to hasten transit of produce from the farm to consumers. If this motion now brought forward by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) is carried, we shall do good in this direction, and it ought to have the support, not only of those interested in primary production, but of those from whom we hear so much in support, of the consumers. In my opinion, the solution of practically all the problems in this community rests on the provision of proper facilities for the producers. W it h all our natural capacity for production, we have lagged behind almost every other people on the face of the earth, in encouraging and aiding those whose work it is to feed and clothe the people. The removal of a difficulty such as that w i th which we are now dealing will help, at any rate, in bringing us nearer to a solution ; but it is only a slight step, and we shall never have any satisfaction u n t i l the House and the country realize more fully the truth of the old Roman saying that we may destroy our cities, and the country will rebuild them; but if we destroy our rural districts, grass will grow in the streets of the cities. I am glad! to see that on private members' day a motion is brought forward which shows that, there is some active interest, even if itbe'in a minor way, in enabling the p r i mary producer to get something like a. satisfactory market and a reasonable return for his labour. I support the motion, and do so p r in cipally for the reason' that the States, if they felt so inclined, could, not only in this, but in many other matters, thwart legislation passed by this Parliament. If there was one thing that we thought was firmly embedded in our Constitution, it was Inter-State Pree Trade; we felt t h a t all' barriers were wiped out, and ample provision made for the free passing from one State to another of produce and other goods which would have no in j u r i ous effect in the Stateto which they were sent, whether across the border by land",30,Inspection Of Produce

Honourable mem-bers from Western Australia should be the first to support a motion of this kind, because we have an illustration of how, by means of a regulation, that State was able to practically say there should not be free trade in produce from Tasmania and Victoria.

A Commonwealth inspector may be transferred from State to State according to the requirements of the Service, whereas State officers, as a rule, are kept in one spot. Without desiring to cast any reflections, I fear that there is a tendency on the part of State officials, if they find their Government has a leaning in a certain -direction, to give such decisions as will please the Government; indeed, this has occurred in the past. Could there be anything more glaring than a regulation imposing an inspection duty of 15s. a ton on potatoes on the Fremantle wharf, and thus thwarting what is one of the main principles for which we federated ? This applies not only to potatoes, but to many other classes of produce. Unfortunately, the High Court upheld the State Government to which I am now referring, and this shows a serious defect in the Constitution We are not here simply as members for particular States. honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) only yesterday appealed to honourable members to take a broad Australian view -to consider all these questions in a national spirit.

I have listened to four addresses on this same subject by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson), and on each occasion he has made out an exceptionally strong case, there will not be duplication. for duplication if experts who know their business are appointed. My own hope is that not only in this, but in other matters, duplication will be eliminated, for this would result in considerable saving of I agree money.

I strongly hold the view that Federal inspection at the State borders will be for the benefit of our primary producers and others, and that nothing but advantage could be derived from making the conditions all over Australia identical. There should be uniformity. I do not subscribe to the view that, if one or more of the States were to hold out and threaten to use their police powers in order to render nugatory the action of the Commonwealth, that action of itself should prevent the Commonwealth from doing the inspection work. In such circumstances, we should go, ahead and throw the responsibility definitely upon the interfering State.

In cases where the amount of work to be done was not sufficient to warrant the appointment of permanent men in the Commonwealth service, I have no doubt that we would employ State officers who are at present engaged. But I am not altogether satisfied with the employment of State officers for Federal duties. Our experience has not been entirely happy. Nevertheless, the expenditure upon the appointment of new Commonwealth officials would not be warranted if itwere found possible to carry on with the State officers already available. The Government is listing for the consideration of the next Premiers' Conference the matter of the standardization of quite' a number of items, both manufactured and otherwise, in order to arrive, if possible, at common standards-thu s rendering immense assistance to producers and manufacturers throughout Australia. I hope that the next Premiers' Conference will arrive at a decision which will enable common standards to be set up, and if the States come into line it will immensely assist us in any work of inspection which may be requisite at the borders. often have a good laugh over the form of government existing throughout Australia.

If the people of Great Britain form the opinion that imports from Australia -are not fit for human consumption, it is likely to interfere considerably with our trade, just when it should be our duty to export as much as possible and import as little as possible. Only in this way can we hope to overcome the difficulty of the increased rates of exchange. No honourable member will oppose the proposal to have one inspection of produce and that a Federal matter. are told that the question 'will be dealt with at a Premiers' Conference, and in this connection I am glad to say that Mr have the courage to tell the State PreHolman, the arch enemy of Federal progress, will not be in attendance at the -next Conference. The greatest problem throughout the world to-day is the matter of transportation and distribution, to which the honorable member for Robertson ( Mr dual control of produce should cease. -Fleming) has drawn attention. We can produce in Australia more than we require for our own consumption, and we could export larger quantities of produce if we had the means of transporting it to other markets. We have also to overcome the heavy cost of distribution. The producer has now to take his potatoes to a railway station, or a wharf; from the railway or the steamer the potatoes are carted to an agent; the agent takes them to the market; from the market they pass to the shopkeeper, and from the shopkeeper to the consumer. The present costly system of distribution is one of the principal causes of the present high prices of commodities and produce. One solution of the high cost of living would be a scheme by which produce could pass more directly from the producer to the consumer. If a case of apples is taken into a market in Sydney it is bought by other persons than those of my own race, and conveyed to a shop in . the city, for which the proprietor is obliged to pay a rental of £25 per week, in addition to having to -incur the expense of providing light and assistance. How can people expect to get cheap fruit in such circumstances? I am firmly of opinion that there Our experience of State control should he one method of control of produce. We cannot depend on action at Premiers' Conferences. State Ministers are too jealous of the little authority remaining to them to part with any of it. We shall always have considerable difficulty in overcoming their opposition to Federal control until we alter our Constitution. When I voted for Federation I did so believing that it was the only means by which steps could be taken to bring about a united Australian opinion, and that the intelligence of future Commonwealth Parliaments would be sufficient to grapple with all difficulties as 'they arose. The' subject dealt with in the honourable member's motion is one which We was mentioned by various speakers at the Federal 'Conventions, and I think that the Federal Government ought to miers that they are only second-rate articles, and that the real first-class article is the Commonwealth Government. They ought to tell them that, apart altogether from, economic reasons and the matter of 'cost and so forth, this Unfortunately our Ministers have not sufficient courage to do this. I do not know what I would say if I were in England endeavouring to explain why Australia has fourteen Houses of Parliament and seven Governors. I am afraid, we shall never be able to explain how it is that there are so many controlling forces in Australia, but I believe that if the Federal Government had the courage to take the action I suggest they would have the people of the Commonwealth behind them. If ever I have the opportunity of getting on the Government 1 ench the people will have in me the strongest advocate of a cessation of this dual control. orable member think that the States would agree to it? them that We proposed to assume this control.

It is little wonder that some of our friends outside have no respect for parliamentary institutions, in view of. the want of courage shown by members of this Parliament in demanding the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the people.

I hope the Government will show that they have a knowledge of the wants of the country by accepting this motion, and giving effect to it . I support this motion, knowing as I do that when our soldiers were going to the Front to fight for Australian liberties they were supplied with vile bullocks' livers, diseased with hydatids and fluke, which came from private abattoirs in this city. A f t e r putting something like twenty-five questions to Ministers, I learned' that these abattoirs were owned by Mr Angliss, a very wealthy man in our community; and when I was threatened with an action if -1 dared to repeat outside what The time must come sooner I said on the subject in this House, I made the statement from a public platform that if Mr Angliss or his manager knew that the meat was diseased when it Here we can left the abattoirs, hanging at the first street lamp-post was too good for him. Subsequently, when I told Mr Angliss what I had said, he agreed with me that hanging would be too good for a man who knowingly supplied such meat for human consumption. The fact that this meat was diseased was discovered by a lucky accident. An officer of the Customs Department happened to be present on one occasion when it was being put on board ship, and promptly drew attention to it . I have; evidence from soldiers that I on some occasions they saw bubbles on the liver while it was being cooked in the ship's galley. Some of them buried the meat at sea w it h musical honours. Mr Jensen, who was Minister for the Many of the people are disNavy when the discovery was made, directed, to his lasting credit, that bullocks' livers should not in futur e be placed on board ship for use as food. That diseased meat was sent out on several occasions, and one wonders what happens to the people of this huge city, who have no supervision of meat supplies by an oflicer of the Federal Government. I had practically to tear the information from the present Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), disclosing the name of the man from whose abattoirs these diseased livers had been supplied. 1 am puzzled to Those who know why there has not been a further inquiry as to the reasons leading to the making of the contract for the supply of liver. It was alleged that the diseased meat came from the Melbourne City Abattoirs. That was a base lie. The Chairman of the Abattoirs Committee of the Melbourne City Council denied it , and proved clearly that bullocks' liver was never sent out of the City Abattoirs except as dogs' meat. While I was held up in Western Australia during the influenza epidemic, the Government of that State took action to prevent the introduction of the disease from the eastern States. That action met with my f u l l approbation. I do not believe that sufficient precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the disease.

Proportional representation has been suggested, and I believe that if that system were adopted it would produce a convention of business men. have said that they cannot afford to enter Parliament are beginning to feel that they cannot afford to stay out, because Parliament itself is developing into a huge business, the employees of which are very badly paid, Men holding responsible positions in connection with ^this Parliament are not being paid, as much as are many men in tin-pot commercial concerns. This is my thirtieth year of parliamentary life. I have contested thirteen elections, and I fail to appreciate the statement by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) that there is a great deal of value to be placed upon the social prestige of a parliamentary position. I have never discovered any such advantage; in fact, I am very prone at times to keep my member's pass from view. It is absurd to put members of Parliament on the footing of employees in occupations with no people have a habit of accepting a man at his own price, and if he is satisfied to receive a small payment, the people will readily agree that that is #11 he is worth.

I shall be very brief, and shall not attempt to cover more than a fraction of the question. The necessity for an amendment of the Constitution has been recognised in a very general way in this House for many years. There have been differences of opinion as tp how far the amendment should go, but that some amendment is necessary has been generally accepted by members on both sides. I say nothing by way of regret, or even responsibility. After all, the comment, on the rejection of fihe' Referenda proposals by the people. My faith in the people is a hardy annual, and survives the blighting frosts of rejection; with the spring it shoots again, restoring my confidence that in the end they will follow the right road. For the fourth time, I think, they have rejected proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. But even if they had accepted them, still hot all would have been done, or could have been done, that needs to be doiie. Naturally, twenty year3 have produced great changes, and although we postulate that those who drafted the Constitution were men of the finest water, that their intelligence was profound, and their knowledge extensive, yet no one could pry far enough into the future to be able to say what sort of instrument of We members of government owould actually meet the requirements of this young and ever-progressing Commonwealth.

""Wihat amendment is required is a question that is easier asked than answered. Some will say that it requires amendment here, others that it requires amendment there. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) mentioned some glaring instances which find an echo in every man's heart -anomalie s such as dual taxation and the like. But no man is able to say that an amendment here and another amendment there will of themselves be sufficient. The fact is that the time has come when the Constitution must be remoulded by men who appreciate to the full the changes which twenty years have wrought, who see the defects of the present Constitution, and who realize, too, its many excellences, for it has many. And this can best be done by a Convention. In His Excellency's Speech the Government set out their intention of introducing a measure for that purpose before the close of this session, and I take advantage of this opportunity to remind honourable member* that the Government intend to carry out that policy. I shall not attempt now to say how far the Constitution needs amendment, though for many years I have advocated certain most important When I first introduced into this Chamber a measure for the submission of constitutional amendments to the people, I stated that the American Constitution, on which ours was based, was so rigid that it had not been amended in any important particular, except as the result of the bloodiest war that the world had ever known. That was, of course, before the recent great war. Since then things have changed, and even that most rigid of instruments of government has proved an ineffectual bar to progress. Had any man predicted a few years ago that prohibition would be carried in America, he would have been laughed to scorn, because to carry it involved the concurrence of two-thirds of the States. hibition, however, has now been carried there, and other amendments of radical importance have been made. our way of thinking, the American Constitution is not so well suited for the government of a free people as are the ConMr Hughes. stitutions of Great Britain, of Canada, South Africa, or of New Zealand. Had they the opportunity to express themselves on the subject, the people of this, country would say that their will must ibe able to find expression without let or hindrance through their chosen representatives in the Federal Legislature. I agree with what has been said by my honourable friend. A house cannot contain seven masters; though, in saying that, I do not for a moment support Unification. Today, when asked what power the Commonwealth had to prevent profiteering, I said, that it had none, and it will be remembered that a Deakin Government sought to pass a Federal Companies Act, but found that this Parliament has not power to do so. Although nine-tenths of the commerce and enterprise of the world is. directed by companies, .this Parliament cannot pass a law regulating their actions, and, consequently, the greater part of the capital of the country, and of the power behind that capital, is beyond the scopeof our legislation. Constitutional amendment is not a party matter. Every member of this Legislature should be jealous .of its honour and dignity, and it is a. reflection upon the good sense of ithe people that legislation in regard to matters vital to their welfare should be beyond amendments. the power of this Parliament. Theamendment of our present Constitution is called for, and, in my opinion, a Convention is most likely to frame a new Constitution acceptable to the people. Unless, amendments acceptable to the people are proposed, nothing can come of any attempt at amendment. The people have already on several occasions declined toindorse the proposed amendments. Therefore they must be asked to elect delegates-to a Convention, and subsequently must be invited to express their opinion upon the work of the Convention. There is a. great difference of opinion as to how the Constitution should be amended. Some would go only so far, others much further,, and others, again, not so far; but all agreeProthat amendment is necessary. This being, so^ the Government will give the House an opportunity to discuss a proposal for Still, to the creation of a Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution. There will be a fair and ful l opportunity provided for the free and frank expression of opinion on this subject. The Government has its own views, but it will not force them down the throats of honourable members. We desire a Convention that will be satisfactory to the community, because the work of the Convention must be acceptable to the people. I hope that the measure to be introduced will be generally supported. The time given to the discussion now before us will not be wasted if a debate ensues which will let the Government know that the House is anxious to discuss these matters. know the meaning of the 'speech just delivered Iby the Prime Minister. All I gather from it is that at some future date he will bring down a Bill providing for the election of a Convention. Is it to be brought down this session? session. We have been told that although the Government has its own views, members will be able to mould the Bill as they desire. A majority can always do that. We are indebted to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for the present opportunity to discuss this matter. In my opinion, Australia has outgrown its Constitution, though the amendments which were submitted by the Labour party in. 1911 and 1913, when Mr Hughes was a member of it, were not accepted. Now there are supporting the right honourable gentleman some who were in favour of -those amendments and others who strongly opposed them. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Joseph Cook) led the Opposition of the day out of the chamber on one -occasion by way of protest, b u t ' had to come back next day to continue the business of Parliament. The Constitution needs amending, however. Mr Groom, when Attorney General in a Deakin. Government, supplied a memorandum at the request of South African authorities advising the people of South Africa not to adopt, in framing their Constitution, the principles upon which we have based ours. against the extreme proposal of the then Labour party. proposals of the Labour party. The present Chief Justice of Victoria, then Mr Irvine, said once in this House that a proposed amendment of the Constitution was necessary, and that he would have voted for it were it not that the Labour party would have had the working of it. I hope that on this occasion we shall prove bigger-minded than he was. The Premier of Western Australia said only the other day in regard to the creation of a Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution that the representation of the States would have to be exactly on the same lines as it was in the original Convention. At the present time the Constitution cannot 'be altered unless a majority of the electors in a majority of the States agree to the proposed alteration. game to propose an alteration of that provision. behind the honourable member would abolish the present Constitution and substitute Unification. The people, however, have agreed to Federation, and the Constitution can be amended only in the way I have stated. Speaking as a citizen, and not as a party man, I say that the sooner the Government bring forward their Bill for the creation of the proposed Convention the better. A Convention could not be elected in a short space of time. Candidates for election would have to travel throughout the land, and as probably members of this Parliament would secure election, it would create difficulties to have the Convention sitting concurrently with a session of this Parliament. I think all are agreed that something must be done for the amendment of the Constitution, and the sooner the matter is tackled the better, whether by this House, or by a Convention. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has served Australia well by bringing forward a motion which allows the matter to be discussed, and the opinions of honourable members to be obtained. Any amended Constitution must be submitted to the people for acceptance. Until they have ratified any alterations that may be proposed, the present Constitution will stand. Therefore the consideration of the whole matter is necessary and urgent work for us in the near future.",39,Amendment Of Th E Constitution Election Of Constitutional Con Vention

I was very disappointed, however, by the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), inasmuch as he indicated no actual time or date when the Bill to create the Convention was likely to come before the House. He said that for many years the necessity for some amendment of the Constitution had been widely recognised here; but during the last six years, at any rate, outside, and even in the State Houses, the necessity for amendment has been strongly felt. stands, is admirable in many respects. It has faults, but they are the faults of that compromise which was inevitable twenty years ago, owing to the intense feeling of State jealousies, and the ambitions of State politicians of the time. Owing to the absence of Queensland from the final deliberations of the Federal Convention, there was inserted that section which provides for the absolute territorial integrity of the States, and this is responsible for the fact that at the present time small and gradual amendments do not ""fill the bill,"" and a sweeping change is inevitable. The reason is that one or two States preponderate so largely that alterations, repeatedly brought forward, are not possible. is overdue; it should have been before, not this Parliament, but the Parliament which sat from 1917 to 1920. Although we were at war the business before Parliament was not of such importance as to preclude the discussion of an alteration of the Constitution, without which reconstruction after the war was absolutely impossible. During the war, England, which had to finance the whole of it-financ e all the Allies, police the seas, provide 6,000,000 men, and magnify its fleets enormously-extende d the electoral franchise, which embraced an additional 8,000,000 votei'3-probably the most sweeping change in the history of England. It seems to me -that, considering the events of the first few months of the war, the Federal Parliament should have taken steps in the for the reconstruction which must folAsI low the chaos the Germans have created in the world. What happened when the war broke out? Within three months of the beginning of hostilities, Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, commandeered all the wheat in that State, because there was a scarcity in other Australian States. Though Victorians, South Australians, and Queenslanders were fighting side by side with men of New South Wales on the other side of the world, the New South Wales Government decided to commandeer the wheat in this way. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) took The Constitution, as it the matter to the High Court, acting as a true Australian should, but was defeated, thus proving conclusively that the Constitution was absolutely unworkable under any strain. It would work creakily in peace time, but in war time it was absolutely unable to permit of any progress; and within a few months we had the incident referred to this afternoon by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser). The whole of the discussion on the motion previously before the House should have taken place on the motion we are now considering; but all would have been unnecessary if we had had a Constitution under which the Government could act in the way a national Government should be able to act. Within six This proposal for a Convention months of the beginning of the war we found Queensland placing an embargo on cattle that were sent from one State to the next, those sent to New South Wales having to pay a deposit of 10s. per head as a guarantee that they would be returned. Later on in the same year, a man who had cattle at Toowoomba and land at Tamworth, was unable to get lucerne over the border for his starving stock, because New South Wales asserted "" State rights."" Such cases surely showed, the immediate necessity for some action; but nothing at all was done.

167,Mr Groom,"The war years were praccorrection. In any case, the urgent matter was reconstruction, and the provision of a basis on which the new world that our men fought and died for was to be built. But when it is proposed that industries shall be established, we find that this cannot be done, because the Constitution does not provide the powers. The Government are quite willing to establish industries, but the State Governments refuse to devolve power because it may benefit an adjoining State. These are matters which surely should have been considered. Germany, the United States of America, and Canada during the war we found Ministries of reconstruction actively making ready for the beginning of the change; but now, practically eighteen months after the ending of the war, we have still to consider the question whether we are to have a Convention, and what_ its result is likely to be. There may very easily be a barren result if we do not have the election of the delegates in the proper way. the Constitution have been defeated, but by very few votes in the aggregate. In some States there were overwhelming majorities against the amendments, and this warped the mind of Australia looking at the matter, because those majorities were thought to be more overwhelming than they were. But a revised Constitution coming from a Convention will have a much more favorable chance of being accepted. In instituting the Convention, it will be necessary to have a campaign of five or six weeks in which the whole constitutional question can be debated on platform after platform throughout the country. If we have a Convention thoroughly representative of the various interests throughout the country, and the debates are fully reported-if points of difference very sound political opinions, and be and divergence of opinion are thoroughly discussed in the pressI venture to say that the public mind will be thoroughly educated, and will be able to give a proper decision as to the merits or demerits of the Constitution proposed. But it seems to me-and I insist on this'point again-that there should be some provision for proper representation of the rural interests in the Convention. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr out by the Federal electorates. Austin Ckapman), in his motion, provides for proportional representation.; and that is absolutely necessary in order to secure proper representation in the Convention. Buti t will be necessary, especially if the big party machines get to work, to go further iri order to secure proper representation. It is agreed on all sides that what we need in the Convention are not simply politicians-no t simply men who have made a life study of politics. We also require big business men who have made big business a life study, and men who have made a In England, Prance, life study of rural pursuits, who cannot -afford, or may have no taste for, politics; but we shall not get these men unless we make it possible for them to be returned without the expenditure of too much time and money. to the people to choose the representatives ? end I repeat the suggestion I made before, that each State should be divided for electoral purposes into a certain numVarious amendments proposed in ber of electorates. If Queensland or New South Wales were chosen as one electorate to return ten representatives, it would require practically a fortune for an unknown man, however sound his ideas might be, to make himself known and place his views before the people. But we have. an electoral basis of five constituencies in the two States with small populations-Tasmani a and Western Australia-eac h returning five Federal members. Queensland returns ten members. Nowi t seems to me that if the division into five is made in each State, and proportional representation is adopted for the Convention-it will be, I take it, elective throughout, .and not nominee in any sense-w e would then have returned from these smaller areas men who, although without political desires of any sort or taste for political life, may have willing to devote, perhaps, a year of their time to. the furtherance of the constitutional project. Unless this step is taken we shall not have the services of such men. I should like to briefly outline the divisions that could be made in the bigger States. As regards Tasmania and Western Australia, they are already marked In",42,Amendment Of Th E Constitution Election Of Constitutional Con Vention

The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr sentation. A t the first Federal ConvenRjan), who at one time represented Maranoa in the State Parliament, carried a motion in the Queensland Parliament in favour of the subdivision of Queensland into three States, and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) has carried a similar motion in the Federal Parliament, and I take it that these electhat of the ten there were only two torates are representative of very similar views. This would be a second electoral unit. Then, we have six other electorates in southern Queensland-tw o metropolitan and four farming-makin g three more electoral units. In New South Wales there are five electorates in the north. Darling, Gwydir, New England, Richmond, and Cowper, which have very definite identity of interests. I am satisfied that if they were grouped together there would be no difficulty in securing the election of proper representatives. terest is there between Broken Hill and Richmond River? member had lived in the northern districts, as I have, he would know that there is the very closest community of interest between the coast and the inland' districts. during drought sends his sheep and cattle to the coast, but does so only with great difficulty, on account of the scandalous lack of railway facilities. Any one acquainted with northern New South Wales must know how closely related is the north ' coast district commercially with the tableland behind, and with the great western plains at the back of it. Returning to the unit grouping of the electorates according to community of interest, the divisions of Hunter, Newcastle, Robertson, Calare, and Macquarie would form one electoral group; while, in the south, Eden-Monaro, Hume, Riverina, Werriwa, and Illawarra would form another. Then there would be the twelve metropolitan and sub-metropolitan electorates, which would provide between them two units. Similar divisions, on almost identical lines, could be cast in respect of Victoria. For example, there is the community of interest which would draw together the electorates of Wimmera, Wannon, Echuca, Grampians, and Corangamite. It appears to me that unless grouping into units is carried out in this way there will not be adequate repretion, when New South Wales sent ten delegates, Sir John See was placed twelfth on the list, largely because he was a country man. were better men ahead of him. country representatives-namely , Sir William Lyne and Mr Brunker.

It should not be left to any State Legislature to decide how that State should be represented. I believe in the principle laid down by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.

It is only fair that each State, as an integral part of the Commonwealth, should secure full representation, and thus be in a position to propound its views in the fairest possible manner. We should adhere to the principle of equal State representation, and provide for the return of, say, ten members on behalf of each. After twenty years' experience of 'the first Australian Constitution, I think that reasonable time has been afforded during which Australia should have discovered any defects therein. The knowledge secured by four campaigns for the proposed amendment of the Constitution should also have had a clarifying effect.

The unfortunate feature of the proposals hitherto made for the amendment of the Constitution is that they have emanated from party rooms. Party fights have been fought, so that the national aspect has been lost sight of. One reason why I support the motion is that the Convention would bring about, I trust, a great fundamental change in the Constitution of the Commonwealth. I hold that the division of Australia into six huge unwieldy States is not only for electoral purposes, but, havwhole of the British Fleet. It is a deeping regard also to the development of the continent, altogether out of date. We have to-day a few glorified ports, dotted around the coastline, and holding domination over the national, political, economic, and industrial well-being of the community. America there are forty-eight States. This division of the country not only affords a far more complete community of interests than could otherwise be the case, but it brings about the fullest possible development of every industry and facility in the country. If I may be permitted to cite an individual point of view, I have been for the past twelve or fifteen years battling for greater recognition for the port of Portland. YetI find myself to-day in the ridiculous position of having to come to the port of Port Phillip to try and get something for the port of Portland. Of 'course, nothing can be done. There is, from the seaboard upward to the Murray, above Portland, the greatest and best, perhaps, of Australia's wheat areas, which would provide enormous tonnage for despatch from Portland. However, the railway lines have been constructed so that all roads lead to Rome; and Rome, in this instance, is Port Phillip. . i r JOSEPH COOK -It would be almost s a pity to spoil the sylvan beauty of that spot. greatly alarm me; but I would inform the Minister for the Navy that one of his colleagues, the present Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Poynton) has committed the Commonwealth Government' to a change of policy, so far as Portland is concerned. Mr Poynton paid Portland a visit, along with a State Minister and the heads of various State Departments, some time ago, and he undertook to ship from that port. I hope the Minister for the Navy will not flippantly treat the situation in which he thus finds himself. able member to understand that I have the greatest possible admiration for Portland.

But, so far as the motion is concerned, I trust that the calling together of a convention will give Australia the opportunity to consider whether, geographically, the whole Continent ought not to be cut up into workable divisions. It is of no use on ani occasion such as this to devote time to a dissertation upon the tremendous advantages which would follow. I invite the attention of honourable members to the position of New Zealand to-day, with her five States. I am thoroughly in accord with the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page). Because of the wanton waste in the administration of this country generally, and in its various departments in particular, I have come to the conclusion that Unification is the only method by which Australia can be governed. There will be a good deal of argument concerning whether or not we should embrace Unification; but I suppose there is no honourable member present who would not be prepared to go one or two steps in that direction, first, by conceding greater powers to the Commonwealth in the matter of control of trade and commerce, and then in bringing about the abolition of duplicate Departments.

The matteris urgent, becausewithin a couple of weeks we shall adjourn for a month, or two months, and when we meet againin July OT August the session may not extend beyond. September, or October. Also the business put forward, apart from this question is such as will not permit of the whole of it being dealt with by the end of the year. If the Government are in earnest about this matter or about carrying out their campaign pledges, they should most certainly take immediate steps to declare their-policy upon it. The honourable member who has subHonorable mitted the motion proposes that the members of the Convention should be elected* by proportional representation-. I was an ardent advocate of proportional representation-probabl y as ardent as the honourable member for Grampians, who has 1 The Prime Minister said there written a very fine brochure on the subject-bu t because of my experience of the hybrid and grotesque travesty which, was perpetrated by this Government in connection with the last .Senate election, and the horrible example of how not to< elect a Parliament we have had in connection with the recent New South WalesState elections, I found cause to alter my views upon the subject.. Most astounding Tesults were achieved by the system: adopted in New South Wales. The basis 1 upon which all Electoral Acts should be founded is that they should allow the. elector a channel whereby he may express 1 his thoughts or desires; but in New South. Wales we find that not more than a little over 50 per cent, of the people availed themselves of the franchise at the recent cent., and 72 per cent, polls at previouselections;, and in addressing meetings 1 throughout the StateI found that the for that reasonelectors were reluctant to' go to the polling booth to do. something' which they did not feel sure they were doing rightly. ing from voting can be ascribed to the system, of voting. that, the percentage of voters-, on previous occasions did not exceed.from 65 per'cent, to 72 per cent, shows clearly that, no matter what system is adopted, it is impossible to get 100 per cent., or even9.0: per cent., of electors to record, their votes. Nevertheless, I maintain that great care should always be taken to give the utmost facility to theelectors to express their opinions,, and that anything which is likely to confuse the mind of a voter is opposed to the bestinterests of the country. AParliament has recently, been conr stituted in New South Wales by a"" little over half the electors of the State, and proportional representation has not achieved that which it should have achieved.

The only difference between the two is in the matter of regulations. I venture to say that in New South Wales there will be 300 candidates for the ten seats allotted to the State in the proposed Conto decide upon and recommend to the vention. On the most conservative estimate there will be at least ten candidates for each seat, which would mean 100 candidates, but personally I think the number will be 300. How can we expect an elector to mark a ballot-paper with the names of 300 candidates on it? not propose to say anything further at this stage, except to urge upon the Government the absolute necessity for bringing forward some definite proposal. No one knows just what Ministers intend to do with regard to the Convention. They seem to have gone to sleep on the matter. This afternoon the Prime Minister was absolutely devoid of any concrete proposal or information of use to the House. dealt with so much the better it will be for Australia. The House and the people of Australia must be indebted to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) for having brought this subject forward this afternoon, and having evoked such an interesting and valuable discussion. I wish to emphasize the great necessity for having the proposed Convention elected on the basis of proportional representation. result of the referenda that have been held in the past history of the Commonwealth that unless the Convention be appointed in a manner which will give confidence to the people it is very unlikely that its recommendations, whatever they may be, will be supported by the people at a referendum. I do not know what is in the minds of the Government in regard to the matter, but I am very glad the opportunity has been afforded to honourable members to express their views upon the subject. If the Government have the slightest-intention of creating a Convention for the purpose of recommending alterations to the Constitution by means of a nominee system, it will probably be a failure and barren of results. The great cause of the lack of confidence shown by the people of Australia in proposed alterations submitted to referenda in the past has been the fact that each proposal has emanated from a party House and as the result of the party system. The calling together of a Convention people of Australia alterations in the Constitution of the Commonwealth Parliament and the Constitutions of State Parliaments, will probably be an event of the utmost importance in the creation and amendment of the Constitutions I do of the countries ' of the world. It has not been possible to make any important alteration in our Constitution for the last twenty years, although every one must have admitted, at one time or another, that certain alterations are very badly needed. The fundamental requisite of the proposed Convention is that it shall command the absolute confidence of the people, and there is no means by which that confidence can be gained except by having the members of The sooner the subject is it elected directly by the people themselves. As certainly there can be no thought of having a nominee Convention, the question arises as to the best method of conducting an election of its members. Much has been said in favour of and against the system of proportional voting. I had very great pleasure in listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), who has indicated that, as the result of the recent elections in New South Wales, he is not now so much in favour of I am convinced by the proportional representation as he was when he did me the honour of reading a little pamphlet which I wrote on the subject a few years ago; but I do not think he has taken into full consideration one exceedingly bad feature of the system adopted in New South Wales, which, by regulation, insisted that every elector at the polling booth should mark the order of his preference for every candidate whose name appeared on tlie ballot-paper.",46,Amendment Of Th E Constitution Election Of Constitutional Con Vention

The New South Wales system, although perfect, perhaps, in other respects, was exceedingly defective, of the application of that principle in because in order to obtain the benefits of this instance. The suggestion is opposed proportional representation it was considered necessary to compel an elector to vote for a greater number of candidates than he desired. The small percentage of voters who went to the poll at that election was probably due to the fact that portional representation, since it affords many were appalled at the prospect of having to vote in their order of preference for no less than twenty candidates. and it took me quite a long time to fill in my paper. honourable member desired to indicate his order of preference for twenty or twenty-five candidates. requiring electors to vote for the full number of candidates in their order of preference was most absurd.. It is no part of the proportional representation system that an elector shall be compelled to vote for one candidate more than he desires. voted against that principle in this chamdoubt we would have a Convention elected ber. and do not remember the circumstances. Any argument against proportional representation founded on the results of the recent election ' in New South Wales must absolutely fall to the ground. in the voting it was caused by the absurd requirement that an elector should vote in the order of his preference for a larger number of candidates than he desired to do. The fact that only 5f> per cent, of the voters went to the poll might have been due to fear of confusion on the part of many, or it may be that a large number of the elector's were disgusted with both parties, or disapproved of all the candidates offering. Many reasons might be advanced for the failure of a larger number of electors to vote. I wish to emphasize the point that if the next Convention is to be a success, if its recommendations are to be such as will meet with the approval of the majority of the people, it is absolutely necessary that every member of it should be directly elected by the people. one vote one value? to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

An American .State, even though it had gone ""dry,"" could not prohibit the importation of alcohol if it was contained in sealed packets without being guilty of an interference with Inter-State trade and commerce. The framers of the Australian Constitution guarded against that difficulty by providing, in effect, that if prohibition was adopted by any State, it should be effective, notwithstanding that the Constitution insists upon freedom of Inter-State trade. In no other respects was any safeguard provided, and therefore we have experienced j n Australia the difficulty that has troubled America from the birth of the TJnion.

There are other minoT defects in the Constitution, and the time has arrived when an attempt must be made to evolve a more satisfactory instrument of government. The will of the people ought to count, and it should not be defeated merely because this Parliament has not the constitutional power to enact laws in reference to certain matters. So far as New South Wales is concerned, we could not have struck a more disadvantageous time for the election of a Convention. The people are sick and tired of elections. There have been during the last few years the Federal elections, the referenda, the conscription campaigns, the triennial local government elections, and recently the election of the State Parliament, and if we desire to get the calm and considered judgment of tfhe people of New South Wales on this important matter, it would be unwise to submit the issue to them this year. If we do, there will be an even smaller vote than was recorded in connection with the last State elections. It appears to me that this motion merely proposes to create > something that will mean further delay and expense to the Commonwealth. There is a snort and right way of obtaining direct from the people the powers that we require. Is not this 'Parliament competent to place a certain proposition before the people without incurring the expense of a Conthe powers of the Commonvention? I maintain that it is, and if we. declare otherwise, we display our incompetence to carry out the work for Which we were elected. I believe it is the desire of members on both sides, and of the people, that this Parliament shall have untrammelled power. Section 51 of the Constitution contains the thirty-nine articles which limit the powers of the Parliament. All we need do is to ask the people if they are agreeable to strik"" The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth."" If that isi agreed ',to, Ihe Commonwealth will have supreme legislative power, and it will then be able to carry out a devolumarriage and tion of powers to the States. would follow the bringing of the State laws into conformity with the desires of the people. If the people will not agree to the proposal I suggest, they will not agree to anything that emanates from the Convention. I am opposed to any such waste of time and money. If about sixty men with a debatable turn of mind are gathered together to consider so controversial a subject as the amendment of the Constitution, 'they may take twelve or eighteen months to come to a decision, and all that time the people will be waiting for relief.

I recognise that the Bill isone to be discussed chiefly 'in Committee-, but it contains one or two principles upon which I wish to speak now. I do not know whether any othercountry is doing as much for the repatriation of its soldiers as we axedoing; but, as the Minister said, we have set ourselves an entirely new task. Speaking on the subjeGt ona previous occasion when we had a Repatriation Bill before us, I said' that we were doing only bare justice to the men who went overseas to fight, andto the dependants of"" those who had' fought. I do not know what is being done in the other States, but I have visited some of the vocational training branches at the Working Men's College^ and-, with the honorable members for Wide Bay, Corio, ParkeSj Fawkner, and others, I last Monday inspected houses now being-, erected at Canterbury, Bell; and' Goburgby the War Service Homes Commission-. It seemedto me* that the houses that were beingput upat Bell' and Coburg were much' betterbuilt and' cheaper than other housesin the vicinity that were being erected byprivate enterprise, and this notwithstanding the constant cry that a Government can do nothing, well. A t Bell there was a block of> fifty or sixty houses near thestation, on the righttwelvehouses on the left-hand side. Between these blocksare two or three wooden houses which, apparently, are not as well which are being erected for the soldiers. In my opinion, the War Service Homes Commissioner is doing splendid work,, and is getting good value for his expenditure. The Minister quoted last night the Herald's report of an interview with me in which I said I thought I could speak for the whole party in expressing agreeable surprise at the manner in which the work is being done.",50,Amendment Of Th E Constitution Election Of Constitutional Con Vention

Perhaps Parkes, like Yarra, is so thickly populated that there are not likely to be any soldiers' homes erected there. In my opinion, it is better to go a little distance out from town to get good land and better terms. At Carnegie, ini the Henty electorate, I am told that a number of war service houses are being erected, and in the middle of them there is to be a little park, which will be a playground for the children. That is an excellentarrangement. But, as I interjected yesterday, it is a mistake to have the ceilings only 9 feet high. I say that without possessing the practical knowledge of a builder, and without being an expert in architecture or ventilation. I believe, too, that experts have declared that with good ventilation 9-feet ceilings are sufficient-that it is better to have 9 feet with adequate ventilation than 12 feet with poor ventilation. not be poor ventilation in any dwelling. amount first set down, and that since it however, that in future 10-foot ceilings found possible to make the ceilings 10 will be adopted.

The Government may rest assured that no honourable member will censure ib if it can be shown that an effort is being made to protect returned soldiers against unscrupulous parties. Good work has been done' by the Repatriation Department, but, as in the case of every other organization, there is bound to be some dissatisfaction. Honourable members receive numerous complaints. Perhaps they get into closer touch with causes of discontent among the men than the Repatriation officials themselves. We receive complaints from men who have been in receipt of sustenance allowance. have come to me stating that they have found a few days' work during a rush period, in the Railway Department. They have lost their sustenance allowance by accepting outside work, which, however, has been of a merely temporary character. The Minister for Repatriation laid it down some time ago that when a man had retained a position for six months, he was considered by the Department to have been effectively repatriated. But it should not be lost sight of that the matter of the length of a man's engagement may depend entirely on the class of work he has undertaken. It may be by»no means of a permanent character, or such as to equip him to secure similar work elsewhere. I know of men who, to-day, are waiting for vocational training. placing them all under training. It is hard to secure instructors, particularly for some of the smaller lines of industry. vocational training, the Department is also limited by' the numbers whom we may place in any industry by arrangement with the trade unions. but I am referring to cases in which the agreement«with the trade unions does not apply. I know of men who have been waiting for some time to enter into vocational training. I doubt if there is anything worse than that a young man, after his exciting experiences abroad, should receive a sustenance allowance while he is hanging idly about the streets. It would be infinitely better for the Department to notify the approximate date on which the waiting men would be called upon to take ,up vocational training, and to permit them meanwhile to accept any sort of work available, and, if necessary, to cut down the amount of sustenance allowance. It is pitiful to see promising young men, many of whom left for the war so early that they received no training for a career, now virtually idling their lives away. In the interests of Australia, as well as of the men themselves, we should put an end to that, if possible. More than one soldier has told me he would gladly take up work outside only that he would be liable to lose his sustenance allowance, and have nothing after his temporary engagement had ended. difficulty of securing instructors, our inReturnedsoldiers ability, in some instances, to secure necessary machinery. ficulties facing the Department, and that the question of securing suitable instructors is among the most severe.

I have visited the vocational braining school allied with the boot trade. From that school a good number of men have been drafted into factories, and many to-day are earning the full rates paid to ordinary journeymen. The Minister for Repatriation stated in another place that there were 1,768 soldiers still abroad. Unfortunately we are f experiencing the same difficulties as at the conclusion of the South African war. A number of our soldiers who went overseas, instead of accepting passage back to Australia, decided to remain, and they secured certain concessions from the Department. They are now anxious to get back home. I hope the Department will do its utmost to bring back every man to Australia who wishes to return. . One other feature of the Bill is that which impliedly provides for the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League to furnish the names of not less than three persons, one of whom is to Ibe selected for appointment upon the Commission.

If there is a Wages Board to be appointed in Victoria the Minister conpaid to the members of the State Boards. cerned does not limit the selection of the employees' representatives among the trade unionists of an industry. Every individual engaged in that industry, whether a unionist or not, is served with a ballot-paper. Similarly, provision should be made in the measure for every soldier to have a voice in the selection of his delegates. It is provided in the Bill that ""the Commission may exercise such powers and perform such duties as are conferred upon it by this Act."" I do not object to that phraseology, but I do object to what is inferred by the succeeding words, namely, ""or are as prescribed."" Government, by regulation, can actually reverse the spirit of an Act. Take the case proposal for, and obtain, the approval of of the New South Wales Electoral Act, which provided for proportional representation, but in connection with which the reknow that it is ioften the practice of gulations set out that the electors must number every name upon the ballot-paper. Under proportional representation voter need not mark his preference for every candidate on the ballot-paper, but the New South Wales electoral regulations have defeated the Electoral Act by providing that each voter shall mark a preference for each candidate. The regulations provided under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act may also defeat the intention of the Act, and, as honourable members know, the House has no opportunity of considering regulations. The Acts Interpretation Act provides that any regulation made under a Statute must be submitted to Parliament, but regulations come down to us by the dozen, and even if an honourable member gives notice of motion to disallow one or more, he has no opportunity of moving in that direction. Last session several honourable members gave notice of motion to disallow regulations, but had not even the opportunity which the hon.c-rable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr authority over the public finances. Mr Tudor. noon of having their motions submitted to and discussed by the House. Whilei t is provided in the Bill that the members of the Repatriation Commission shall receive such remuneration as the Governor General decides, there is a further provision for a Repatriation Board in each State, and I presume that principle, and fix the remuneration to be tion. In some States, we shall get the class of men we require, and merely pay them for the time they spend in doing this work that in some of the smaller States there may not be sufficient work to employ men the whole of their time, but I do not think it is a sound principle to introduce. I shall have to look further into the matter, for I do not think the point was raised in another place. It is provided in clause l l that "" before exercising any power under the ActA involving the expenditure of more than £5,000, the Commission shall submit its the Minister."" Honourable members who have had experience in State Legislatures Ministers, who are restricted by legislation, to the expenditure of a fixed amount, to expend right up to the a margin they are allowed in one year, and then in the following year extend the work. This has been done in the Victorian Parliament. The Act which compels all railway works estimated to cost more than £20,000 to be referred to the Railways Standing Committee is thus evaded, and as I do not wish to see any such evasion in the administration of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act, I would like some further information from the Minister on the point? I am rather inclined to think that the Commission should be limited in its power to spend up to £5,000 without obtaining the sanction of the Minister for Repatriation. I have always objected to Commissioners being superior to Parliament. If these Commissioners are allowed to 6pend up to £5,000 in one year, and up to £5,000 in another year, they will have practically unlimited power of expenditure,and we may be giving away to them our",55,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet

265,The Mr Tudor,"I was dealing withtend to hand over to the Department of Repatriation the war pensions branch of the Department of the Treasury, I think the day will come when we shall be sorry for making such an alteration. The Department that has had to administer the Invalid and Old-age PensionsA c t is the proper one to deal with war pensions. Its staff is in touch w it h the work and should be best able to administer the war pensions system. It is provided in Clause 22 that""Member of the Forces"" means a person who during the present war was (e) enlisted or appointed for servioe in connection with naval or military preparations or operations. I desire to know whether, under that provision, munition workers who were at least engaged in ""military preparations,"" will be brought within the scope of this measure ? eligible for a war pension any person who is not now eligible. putations to the Minister on the subject, I desired to ascertain whether it was in tended to extend the war pensions system to munition workers. other point mentioned by the honourable member, I may say at once that it is the intention of the Government to hand over to the Repatriation Department the administration of war pensions. is in accordance with a request that has been made, time after time, by the soldiers themselves. shall be acting wisely in making such a transfer. Honourable members on both sides of the House have frequently complained of the duplication of Departments, and I fear that by setting u p in the Repatriation Department a war pensions branch, we shall mot act in the in terests of the soldiers themselves. I trust that in Committee we shall amend several clauses which certainly call for amendment, and that the measure, when it leaves this House, will give to the men who fought for us overseas the measure of repatriation which is so necessary at the present time. is the third occasion upon which this Parliament has attempted to mould into If the Government in shape measures providing for the repat* riation of our returned soldiers. I followed with interest the speech made by the Minister( Mr Poynton) in moving the second reading of the B ill , in the course of which he gave us a short history of the initiation and early administration of repatriation in Australia. Some three or four years have elapsed since that system was inaugurated; and the initial difficulties which faced the Minister and his staff should not now be pleaded as an excuse for any shortcomings that may exist in connection with it . I desire to admit in the freest and most generous terms, that in entering upon their Avork, the Ministerf or Repatriation (Senator Millen), the Controller and his staff, had to ""blaze the track."" They had nothing to guide them. The Minister had an untrained staff and had to develop a policy with which the soldiers themselves, who had been out of the country for several years, were not in touch. There were thus many difficulties and disadvantages to be overcome. But the business organization of a. Department charged as this is, with the expenditure of from £50,000,000 to £100,000,000, must be placed on no slipshod footing, b u t on a sound commercial basis. A t the outset the Government deterregard to the mined this movement should be upon a voluntary basis; that an appeal should be made to the people of Australia who had enjoyed four of the best years ever showered upon the'country, to make some This financial sacrifice to help our men who, during those years of plenty, were fighting our battles overseas, and that the money so raised should be supplemented I am not sure that we by means of advances from the Treasury. On the return of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), who was in England when the original scheme was launched, that policy was reversed. It was then decided that the entire responsibility for repatriation should be undertaken by the Commonwealth and that the public should be called upon to voluntarily supplement its efforts. I deeply regret that the voluntary movement was not given a f a i r trial. I recognise that it would not have been sufficient for a l l the purposes of repatriation, but it undoubtedly was not given a f a i r chance.

272,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.4],"ThisMinister and by the State Premiers. Had a spirited appeal been made in each State we should have had, in response, not the £30,000 raised by public subscription for this purpose, but at least £1,000,000. We have passed that stage, howeveT, and have come, as I said in opening, to the third attempt to mould a scheme of repatriation. This Bill deserves, and should receive, at the hands Qf honourable members the most critical analyses of not only the machinery to be provided, but the methods of administration proposed, and the limitations which it will place upon the Repatriation Commission when appointed. I regret that the work of repatriation was not at the outset placed in the hands of a Commission. I Also deplore the fact that this Parliament did not lay down to a greater extent the guiding lines which they desired the repatriation system to follow. We should not have left it either to the Minister OT the Commission to decide who should.be competent to receive assistance and who should not. Asi t is, that is still an open question. It is not determined by this Bill. sures are repealed by the Bill, and when it comes into operation all regulations determining who shall be the beneficiaries under the scheme will also lapse in so far as this Act itself and' the regulations thereunder determine. Clause 11, sub-clause 2, provides thatBefore exercising any power under this Act which involvesthe expenditure of more than Five thousand pounds, the Commission shall submit its proposal for, and obtain, the apmum is £150, but in certain instances proval of the Minister. I should like the Minister to give us the official interpretation of that, provision. It seems to me that, notwithstanding the appointment of a Commission, the whole question of policy will still largely remain in the hands of the Minister. If , on the other hand, it refers simply to specific transactions the honourable member's reading of the sub-clause is correct, then it provides for only an ordinary business precaution, to which no exception can be taken. If , on the other hand, it is designed to limit the authority of the Commission and to prevent it from dealing with a class of beneficiaries which it thinks should be brought within the scheme, but whose inclusion would involve an expenditure of more than £5,000, I think it is objectionable. I have always stoutly objected to the discrimination which the Act and the regulations permit. I desire to be as generous as possible in my recognition of what I believe to be the Minister's admirable conception of repatriation generally. I recognise that the Minister, and the Government as a whole, desire to give those who fought for this country a fair chance; but I point out that under regulation 60 practically only three classes of cases are entitled to financial assistance. Under it tens of thousands of men have been dissappointed. I am not going to say that repatriation is a failure. To do so would be to disregard the good intentions of the Ministry and the hard work of the Minister for Repatriation. But omitting such items as grants of £10 for tools of trade, technical training, and so forth, under regulation 60 financial assistance to enable a start in business to be made again by those who have been to the Front, and many of whom while away have ripened All previous repatriation meafrom boyhood into manhood, can not be given in many cases. It can only be given under three different headings. In the first case financial assistance may be given to a widow with children; secondly, to a married man who is incapacitated and unable to follow his former occupation; and thirdly, to a man who, prior to his enlistment, owned a small business, which he gave up, and to which he desires to return. The maxithe Minister .may give assistance up to £250. Scores of genuine cases which Local Committees have investigated and submitted with recommendations to the Minister, are turned down, with the stereotyped reply, of which every honourable member knows, ""Not eligible under seetion 60 of the regulations."" ' I hope that the Commission to be appointed will be trusted to review the whole question of repatriation generously. I hope there will be a great enlargement of the field of beneficiaries. After all, this assistance is not by way of g if t ; it is only by way of loan repayable with interest. I suggest once more to the Minister-and I earnestly stress this point on the Government-that we should widen the field",58,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet
273,Sir Robert Best,It does.,59,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet
274,Mr Rodgers,"It is doubtful. I fof beneficiaries under this Bill, and take repayment from the men, if the Government desire it, in the shape of war gratuity bonds. ment, without incurring any huge expenditure, would satisfy hundreds of men. In the majority of cases the gratuity will be given in the shapeiof bonds which will not be redeemed for four years. The soldier's needs are immediate; he cannot get anything for his bonds at once, and the Repatriation Act makes no provision for him. The Commission should consider the two Acts side by side, and widen the scope of assistance to include almost every man who satisfies them that he genuinely requires and deserves it . assistance to restoring men to their pre-war occupations ? changed the temperament and desires of many men, and they will require a change of vocation. The miner, for instance, may have lost his taste for underground work, and may desire to engage in some other occupation. earnestly impress this view upon the Minister, and hope that the Commission will not be hamstrung by being unable to consider matters of policy of this descripbusinesses than in any other way, and I tion, but that such an interpretation will be placed upon clause 11 that the Commission will not be powerless to make further grants. If that is not done there can be no change from the policy of the past, and the Commission will be a body merely appointed to carry out the regulations as they are to-day. governed by regulations. Section7 provides for the general control of administration by the Commission subject to the Minister. when the Prime Minister returned to Australia he was inundated with requests from returned soldiers. He replied that he would break the bonds of red tape and see that their grievances were remedied. Here we have a genuine opportunity of making provision for practically every man. soldiers, all of whom have been in the danger zone and have fought the same battle for the same cause. What is the use of having a regulation which provides that we may pick out three of those men as being eligible for assistance, but compels us to tell the other twelve that they are not eligible under section 60? The present discrimination is far too wide. The Minister may object that my proposal In this way the Governwould involve an enormous amountof money. I repeat that this assistance is not a grant, but is. in the form of a loan, and the gratuity bonds provide a means of liquidation. We have already made provision that, in so far as there is eligibility for participation in the benefits of the Repatriation Act, war gratuity bonds may be taken in discharge of obligations under the Act. tions in the present Act, more money was lost in connection with advances for businesses than in any other way. the .private repatriation scheme in my own electorate, I have had 80 committees working in harmonious co-operation with the Department, and they have had a fairly wide experience of the Act and of its shortcomings. I place no blame upon I the Controller and his staff; he is governed by an Act and regulations. The Minister says that more money has been lost in connection with advances for repeat again that the Department will be safeguarded in future by being able to take the gratuity bonds in liquidation of any liability. If necessary, the amount of the advance may be limited to the value of the bonds, and even with that limitation the Department will be able to render immediate and valuable assistance to soldiers who are in pressing circumstances. By reason of the repatriation scheme that I am conducting in my own electorate, I have almost daily opportunities of coming in contact with cases of disappointment and distress. I have, committees of earnest and capable men, who have given their time, services, and money, voluntarily and generously, and one of the principal objections they have to the carrying on of this work is that they are able to help, under the Government scheme, so few of the Range up against the wall fifteen soldiers; the majority are not eligible under section 60 this Bill to prevent an amendment to that section.

283,Sir Robert Best,"There is nothing iuthe House the necessity for such an amendment. I was hoping that the Commission would be endowed with sufficiently wide powers to be fible to deal with a ! 1 these cases. If that is not to be done, I can see uo justification for the creation of the Commission. The work of repatriation will be finished in a short time, and if the administration of the War Service -Homes is not intrusted to the Commission, what work will there be for it to do? It will become merely a Commission to administer the War Pensions Act. I hope the Government will take advantage of the experience that has been gained up to date, and will give the Commission a genuine opportunity of justifying its creation. If it 'be merely a Commission to administer regulations which in the past have failed to satisfy the soldiers, its creation will not be justified. Vocational and technical training will be finished in a couple of years, because the period of .training usually is limited to six months, and unless national workshops are established-and that is not proposed at present-wha t will there be for the Commission to administer? I hope that the Commission will have power to review the whole of the work done' up to date. Many millions of pounds are to be made available for repatriation work, and the best business ability and brains that the Commission can command should be brought to bear upon the work of restoring the soldiers to civil life. In regard to vocational training, I know that in the establishment of training shops, the Department, starting from scratch, and without the equipment and plant possessed by private firms, is seriously handicapped. Nor 'has the Department at its disposal a staff of skilled men, such as private firms have, to teach the young trainees; but vocational training will do more harm than good if it turns out merely half-matured fledglings, men who with only partial training, have to compete with the best artisans of the Commonwealth at the same rate of wages. They will be in a worse position than if they had had no training at all. Make the technical training efficient and complete. I believe that the training shops are doing good work, but only a certain number of men are able to gain admission ; others are knocking at the door and [54] trying to get in. I was hopeful that in this phase 'of repatriation work the Minister would have enlisted the co-operation of the people who carry on the big industries of this country. Take, for instance, the training of motor mechanics. The Government training shop has only a limited capacity. Young men enter the shop with an idea of getting a thorough grip of the whole motor trade, but they have, at the most, two models to work upon. Contrast these trainees with the ,; young men who are trained in private motor works The latter enter a great commercial enterprise. There they see many types and varieties of motor cars, and they get a thorough knowledge of repairs, renewals, accessories, and the assembling of parts. I was hopeful that arrangements would be made by the Department with these firms that a proportion of the returned soldiers should be taken into these establishments under a special arrangement, and given a complete course of training in motor mechanical work. Then when a buyer came along and wanted a chauffeur, one of these young fellows, now thoroughly qualified, could be recommended. The young fellow, trained with the limited scope and capacity of the Government training school, and who has worked upon only one model or two, has not had sufficient mechanical work under his notice to prepare and equip him in the same way as the young fellow in the private workshops is trained. Therefore, he has not an equal chance of getting employrnerii subsequently. the training school to private establishments, and gain further knowledge. that under the industrial laws of this country the young man who enters a private workshop must receive the standard wage, but the trainee from the Government establishment has not reached such a state of efficiency as will make him acceptable to a private employer, who is obliged to pay the prescribed wage. up the difference. a young man started his technical and vocational training in a private workshop, he may get assistance from the Department for six months: but if he elects",60,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet

I bring these matters forward with the desire that within the short space of time still at our disposal repatriation may be handled effectually. . Seeing that millions of pound's of public money are being spent, it is our duty to make sure that efficient methods are being adopted. The soldier, after he has finished his training, must compete in the world with those who have been trained in the' ordinary ways. It must not be forgotten that many trainees, by reason of war in juries and shocks to the nervous system, may require longer than the ordinary period of training to acquire efficiency, and they should be provided for in some way, either by being given a longer period of tuition in the workshops and schools, or by being employed in Commonwealth or State factories. Some men have, every week or two, to give u p what they are doing because of recurring ill ness, and at the end of six months cannot have profited so much by their training as men who are physically fit. There should be some classification, and special provision made for those who suffer from the drawbacks I refer to. 15,405 men are undergoing training in the classes as industrial trainees, or have advanced beyond the training classes, and have .oassed' into factories as partially trained men. men passed into the factories as partially trained ? what they earn and their sustenance allowance is made up by the Department.

308,Mr Rodgers,"What I wish to getto me on the question are not so convinced of this. The War Service Homes Department is, in my judgment, one of the most important and powerful wings of the repatriation scheme. The provision of homes for those who have fought for and saved this country is a cardinal principle of the scheme. I congratulate the Government on having; undertaken the work, and may be tJardoned for saying that I was, I think, the first in the Commonwealth to advocate the provision of soldiers' homes. If there has been delay in building houses, the soldiers have benefited by it to this extent, that they will get better and more up-to-date houses by reason of the preparations that have been made. Material and labour are more costly than they were, but the War Service Homes Department promises to create a great national asset by doing justice to the soldiers in providing them with homes, and by meeting one of the great needs of the o>untry, additional housing. who marries and goes into occupation of one of these houses will start on a very good mark compared with the outsider. The houses are being well and faithfull y built, and the Government is to be congratulated in regard to them. known, of course, that gigantic buildingoperations are in progress all over the world, and this Government will be faced with the problems that are being met with elsewhere arising out of the high cost of material and labour and the scarcity of supplies. Under all the circumstances, the Government has done well. houses have been well planned, and it is an excellent thing to give returned men the opportunity to help in the building of them. I regret, however, that there has not been closer co-ordination-if I may use the Minister's words-of the efforts of State and Commonwealth in regard to country homes.' Under the War Service HomesA c t £700 is the sum that may not be exceeded in providing a home for a returned man; but in the country districts of this State only £625 is allowed for a home, stock, implements, and all equipment that may be necessary to put an unimproved farm into order. course, is in addition to the value of the land. wealth has a liability in respect of the exmore liberal allowance for the purchase penditure of the money which is advanced to the States for the settlement of soldiers on the land, and there should be a co-ordinating officer to act between the Commonwealth and the Statesi n connection with all advances made for soldier settlement. I know that the War Service Homes Department could not supervise the erection of houses in country districts, but there should be a better understanding between the Commonwealth and State authorities as to the manner in which the money provided must be spent. There should be vastly more than £625 allowed to soldiers settling in the country. The city homes provided for soldiers are cosy and up-to-date, but there is an absence of proper provision and modern conveniences for the wives and children of the soldiers who battle for a living on the land of the country. But when the city home is compared with the rushed-together, flimsy building put up for the soldiers on country land, it is plain that we are not putting the two types of soldiers, with their wives and children, on anything like the same The young soldier footing, as f a r as housing accommodation is concerned. in the country, in addition to the sum you have named, gets land valued at £2,500. paring the values of the two propositions, but suggesting that better provision should be made for the home in the country.. A man who starts from scratch on part of a subdivided estate, with nothing there at all, is The allowed £625 to buy stock and i m plements, and provide a home, and his conditions are very adverse compared with . the conditions of the other soldier.' I do not blame this Government, because this is a State activity, but I do suggest that the Ministerf or Repatriation have a further conference with the States with a view to increasing the advance of £625, so that there may be a greater margin in order to provide comfort in the homes. A man who goes On the land in the country in Victoria is granted land of the total value of £2,500; if he goes on what is called sheep That, of country, the advance rises to £3,500, which, in my judgment, is a very f a i r and In my. judgment, the Commongenerous provision. But I advocate a of stock and .implements, and the establishment of a home, 'because it is useless",62,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet

I consider the terms of repayment under the housing scheme very generous, and the conditions reflect the greatest possible credit on the present administration. the method of' repayment amounts to no more than a reasonable rent. cottages we saw to-day, compared with private property, possess an equity of £100 to £150, and this is a splendid investment, on the achievement of which, without causing a boom in land values, I congratulate bhe Government. The manner in which this phase of the work has been carried out I can refer to with great satisfaction. in New South Wales will never see success if they live sixty years. original settlers of the country who started uuder conditions one-hundred fold worse than those of the man of to-day? -c man who had come back much imSuccessful land settlement depends more on the grit and temperament of the man who "" takes it on "" than on the burdens and difficulties he has to face. No one can say to-day whether land is too high or too low in value, because new systems of cultivation, with methods of irrigation and so forth, so alter values that what seemed dear last year is a bargain to-day. Another opportunity is now available to the Government to give the Commission a much freer hand than the Commissioners in the past have had. This, I take it, will be an active working Commission, intrusted not merely with the administration of the regulations. If the latter should prove to be their only work, there will be very little satisfaction know how we are to avoid its consefor the soldiers who have been long asking for their appointment. I trust that the Commission will be given an opportunity to review the whole subject of repatriation in the light of experience gained up to date. The staff is now trained and efficient, and if the repatriaestablishment, there are turned out tion scheme and the gratuity scheme are linked together, the gratuity being made the basis on which new grants can be made under the repatriation scheme, some of the disappointment and bitterness of the past may be followed by justice to the men who have done so much for us. [9.51] I am pleased the Government have placed before us a somewhat comprehensive scheme of repatriation. There was need for a comprehensive scheme, A long term is allowed, and but in the one presented there are many defects which will take some time to reThe move. For instance, the trouble and injustice under regulation 60 are not removed, and one wonders why such hard and fast lines have been drawn. Surely every man who went to fight took the same risk, and yet the Department sets out to differentiate. People ask why a man does not get an opportunity to set up in business in his own line, and we are told that he cannot do this because he was not in that line of business for himself before he went away. In my opinion, that condition is laid down in order to protect tlie business people of the community-to protect vested interests. I was talking to a member of a Local Committee the other day about a. sad case of paired in health, and who, feeling that vocational training would not be of use to him, desired to go into a certain line of business. Under this regulation, he was not allowed to do' so, because he had not been in the business before he went to the Front; and the Committeeman said that if all who desired to go into business were permitted to do so, there would be no business left for the ordinary business men. who' had not gone to the Front. If that is the reason for the regulation, it is a selfish one, which ought to receive no support from the Government; and I must say that I have never been able to get any other explanation. However, the regulation, is still there, and I do not quences. As to vocational training, I was unable to accompany other honourable members to Wirth's Circus, but have seen much of it, amongst other places, at the Working Men's College, Melbourne. A t that fairly adept tradesmen, and we are told by the Minister that, after they have received certain instruction, they are to be handed over to private employers, who will train them until they become perfect. That is too much, however, to expect",63,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet

315,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"from private employers, who are in business to earn profits, and not as philanthropists. We must not forget that a great proportion of the men are impaired in health, and that it will take some time to restore them to their normal condition. Then, there is, perhaps, 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, who seem to think they have done all they ought to do, and expect to be kept. I do not make that charge against the general body of soldiers, but we all know there is a small percentage who take that view, and they are not the sort of men that private employers will tolerate. Many of the soldier officials in the Department have not treated their fellow diggers and their dependants as they ought to be treated. However, the Grovernment have an opportunity to deal with this phase of the question in a proper way, if they desire, but I am afraid, again, that they will 'be prevented by consideration for vested interests. Three years ago, for instance, it was suggested in this House that the Government, ought to consider the propriety of manufacturing complete motors in Australia; and it was a good suggestion, because the motor industry here has not yet been "" scratched."" We are still importing motors wholesale, and the trade is one which will not retrograde, but will extend largely. There are men here who could be taught to build complete motors at the expense of the Government, and the cost would not be more than that which has been incurred in other directions up to the present. We put men into vocational training, and they do not follow up that training because there are no places to exercise it ; and if they do get into an establishment, and are discharged for any reason, they are ""dropped."" The money spent on vocational training, and on affording sustenance of two guineas a week for, in some cases, eighteen months, should have been devoted to training the men in Government establishments; and a great opportunity, as I say, is presented in the motor trade. A t the risk of being charged with harping on one string, I again suggest that the Government are afraid to take this step because it would infringe on the vested rights of those already in the industry. This affords no reason for inaction, in any case, because, apparently, private enterprise is not endeavouring to exploit this particular line. In 1908, when the [55] Tariff was before Parliament, the imposition of a duty on chassis and engines was suggested in order to encourage their manufacture in Australia, but both employers and employees were against the idea. Members of the Labour party were entreated not to place those articles on the duty list on the ground thab it would be a long while before we could manufacture engines and chassis here, and that if we were to impose duties upon those parts we would lose the work of bodymaking. I will not believe that Australian skilled labour cannot manufacture motor engines. I will not believe that work of that nature is too intricate for Australians. It is not fair to ask private enterprise to lose money in establishing an industry of this nature, but here is an instance where the Government could have entered the field. If they were to speculate even as much as £1,000,000 the outlay would be well worthwhile. Let us look also at the wool. industry. We do not produce one-twelfth of the woollen' materials required in Australia, outside of the manufacture of blankets. The Government might well have said, "" We will give men vocational training and take them right through the industry from start to finish. If we lose £3,000,000 in establishing an industry which will furnish Australia with a substantial portion, at any rate, of its woollen material requirements, the money will have been well spent."" The Government, however, prefer to go on sinking money in the payment of sustenance allowances, most of which money is lost. I am pleased that something practical is being undertaken at last, even though the motor industry and the manufacture of woollen materials have not been touched, Until we manufacture the greater portion of our home requirements we will never be able to purchase goods at reasonable prices. It may be objected that the Government have no constitutional right to enter upon the manufacture of commodities for general use, but I am certain that no High Court judge would dare to interpret the Constitution in such a manner as to prohibit the Government from providing vocational training for a large body of returned men in the establishment of the woollen manufacturing industry. I do not want to set town against country or to seek to make political capital, but the honourable member for Wannon. ( Mr Rodgers) has been complaining that only £650 has been allowed to a man who is establishing himself in the country, for the purchase of necessary stock, machinery, and a home. What about the thousands of men in the cities and towns who can get nothing like £650 to give them a start? Of course, I do not know how much stock a man could get out of the £650, but when to that loan is added the sum of £2,000 for the purchase of land the total constitutes a heavy encumbrance, and as much as any man can stand, especially when he is aware that he * has paid the very top price for the land he has chosen. The trouble in placing returned men on the land is that Australia does not gain more farmers thereby. For every new man established it is generally the case that some experienced and longestablished farmer retires. good to Australia. ' The honourable member for Wannon says there has been no boom in connection with the sale of country land. There have certainly been inflated values for some time. While men in the country have been receiving up to £2,650, there are many others, in the country and in the towns as well, who have secured nothing as yet. Some of the land secured by the Victorian Government under the compulsory purchase system would not carry a cow to fifty acres, yet returned men have been handicapped with blocks of that character. I do not know, therefore, that they are in any better case than others who, although they have had equal claims to assistance, have so far received nothing. Activities in regard to war service homes have been so far fairly successful. officials selected by the Government to conduct that branch are able and well meaning men. They have had to meet many obstacles and have had to fight Trusts as well. Just as certain individual returned men have had the good fortune to secure advantages while others equally entitled have received none, so have individual districts gained advantages while other equally worthy districts have had no help under the war service homes Bcheme. I point out the peculiar position in which returned soldiers in Port Melbourne find themselves. trict sent as many men to the war in proportion to population as any other part of Australia. Yet there has not been a posed increase overcome the difficulty ? home built in Port Melbourne under the war service homes scheme. The amount do so, but even so it would be necessary fixed for homes purchase was £700, and to reduce the minimum frontage space at Mr Mathews. there have been arguments advanced for the extension of that sum. I can only say that if the amount of the loan is increased to £800 a soldier's wages will have to be increased in order to bear the added burden. The amount of £700 is about as much as a returned man working in a factory in my district could shoulder. In Port Melbourne there is a large area of vacant land, stretching from the cricket ground to the Yarra; it is known as Fishermen's Bend. For years the Victorian Government have been taking a nice sum of money, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, by way of payment from sand carters. In connection with the project to secure some of that land for the building of war service homes, however, the That is no State Government has demanded £1,060 per acre. That price has made it impossible for a Port Melbourne soldier to secure a home under the Act, either for £700 or upon the basis of an increase to £850. Interested local bodies in Port Melbourne have been doing their utmost to secure the opening up of this area for war service homes, and in this connection I might say that I have found myself in a peculiar position. The local branch of the Returned Soldiers Association are unfortunately a somewhat Conservative body, while the municipal council has a majority of Labour men. Both are desirous of doing their best for the returned soldiers at Port Melbourne, and they have naturally taken the War Service Homes Department to task. I have found myself in the extraordinary position of having to defend this GovernThe ment, and stand up for the war service homes officials, because I know that the latter have done their best in the circumstances. We have suggested a reduction of frontage in connection with the building of homes, from a minimum of 40 feet to 33 feet, but even that is not small enough to enable a returned man to secure land in the district. We recently approached the State Minister concerned, and asked the Hon. Donald Mackinnon if it was not possible for the Government to sell the land at £500 per acre for the purpose of erecting war service homes. That disSo far, no reply has been received.",64,Robert Best I S The Atlas An Months And Have Not Got A Housa Yet

317,Mr Mathews,"It might just aboutpresent permitted. The men in Fort -Melbourne must live close to the factories in which they work. They cannot go a long way away and get cheap land in some less settled neighbourhood'. I urge the Federal authorities to communicate with the Victorian Government to see if some arrangements cannot be made to secure areas for the construction of homes in my district. It is not asking too much for the State Government to sell the land' at £500 pOT acre. building of homes? tainly is. Trust require the land for a new dock same fifty years hence? About 150 acres could bo obtained today at the lowest rate offering, namely, £900 per acre; but in respect to that portion certain filling would require to be carried out. I am tired of having to. defend the Federal Government and the War Service Homes Department, and it is hard for me to persuade bhe interested bodies in my electorate that the Federal authorities are not to blame. My charge is against the State Government for asking so much for their land I hope that Senator Millen will approach the Hon. Donald Mackinnon, the Assistant State Minister, so that the returned' soldiers of Port Melbourne may have the opportunity of securing homes for themselves. The insurance regulation is a disgrace to any civilized community. Why a monopoly is given to one company I do not understand. extreme risk is taken the company can dispose of it by re-insuring somewhere else, as is usually done, but those who take the initial risk make the most money. one insurance company should be given the opportunity of doing all the work, and emphatically I say that in any ease, evenif one is selected to do it, it anxious to make as good a measure as should be an Australian company. I have no word to say against the fitness of the firm of architects appointed by the Commonwealth Bank to supervise the construction of isolated homes, but in my opinion the percentage allowed is too pigh, seeing that so much work is standardized, and that the plans must be used over and over again. There ought [55]2 to he some investigation into this matter. It is the soldier who is called upon to pay. Of course, I admit that one isolated house cannot be built as .cheaply as one of a group of a dozen or fifty, and that a fair percentage must be allowed in a comprehensive system of building isolated houses. Bank is building no more houses. The work has been taken from it. that such was the case, and I am pleased to hear it.
