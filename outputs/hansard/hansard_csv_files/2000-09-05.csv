Aviation: Ayers Rock Airport (Question No. 1643) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2000: (1) At which airport did the Ansett A320 aircraft carrying the Olympic Torch and International Olympic dignitaries to Australia from New Zealand land on 8 June 2000. (2) What aviation rescue fire fighting category is the A320 aircraft. (3) Do Australian or International Civil Aviation Organisation regulations require the provision of the aviation rescue and fire fighting services for the arrival or departure of international flights. (4) Were aviation rescue and fire fighting services provided for the arrival and departure of this aircraft; if not, why not and who made the decision not to provide these services. (1) Ayers Rock Airport. (2) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) advises that the A320 aircraft is classified as a Rescue and Fire Fighting Services (RFFS) category 6 aircraft in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards as stated in Aerodromes, Annex 14 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chapter 9, dated 4 November 1999, as “International Standards and Recommended Practices”. (3) CASA advises that there are international standards for the provision of aerodrome rescue and fire fighting services. These can be found in Aerodromes, Annex 14 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chapter 9, dated 4 November 1999, as “International Standards and Recommended Practices”. The ICAO Rescue and Fire Fighting Standards do not regulate the provision of the service but establish standards and recommended practices. Australian Rescue and Fire Fighting Services regulations are currently being developed by CASA. CASA advises that the current Australian practice is in compliance with ICAO standards and provides RFFS for the arrival and departure of scheduled international passenger flights, with the exception of Christmas Island where a standards difference has been filed with ICAO due to remoteness of the island and the frequency of aircraft operations. CASA advises that Ayers Rock airport is not required to provide RFFS as the airport does not meet the current criterion for the provision of the services. In addition, the flight carrying the Olympic Torch is regarded as a special one-off flight and not as a standard international passenger transport flight. (4) CASA advises that as Ayers Rock Airport does not meet the criterion for the provision of RFFS, and as the flight was not regarded as a standard international passenger transport flight, Rescue and Fire Fighting Services were not provided. CASA was consulted on the use of Ayers Rock Airport for the flight on 25 May 2000. CASA indicated it had no objection to Ayers Rock being designated an international airport to permit a service by an Ansett A320 to travel from Auckland to Ayers Rock direct on 8 June 2000 carrying the Olympic Flame. Colston, Former Senator: Movement Records (Question No. 1655) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 21 June 2000: (1) Has the Australian Federal Police received a copy of the movement records of former Senator Colston, in respect of the ‘travel rort’ court proceedings discontinued on alleged medical grounds outlined in the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions media statement of 5 July 1999. (2) Are the records a document of public record on the litigation file and available for public inspection. (1) No. (2) The documents on the litigation file do not include movement records. Access to documents contained on the litigation file is a matter for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Privacy Commission: Australian Business Numbers (Question No. 1660) (1) Did the Privacy Commissioner recently undertake discussions with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in respect of the disclosure of the Australian Business Number (ABN) information.

217,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 22 June 2000:(4) Did the Privacy Commissioner conclude that the disclosure by the ATO of the ABN was lawful under the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act, when the Privacy Commissioner had not conducted an investigation in respect to the disclosure; if so, on what basis was the conclusion reached. (5) Did the Privacy Commissioner request the ATO to modify its conduct and practices; if so, on what basis was the request made. (6) What was the final outcome of the discussions between the Privacy Commissioner and the ATO and what action has the ATO undertaken as a result of those discussions. (1) Yes. The Privacy Commissioner has advised me that his Office held a number of discussions with the ATO in respect of the collection, use and disclosure of ABN information. (2) The Privacy Commissioner has advised me that the following concerns motivated his Office to undertake those discussions: (a) whether the information collected involved personal information; (b) whether the ATO complied with Information Privacy Principle 2 contained in s.14 of the Privacy Act 1988 when it solicited the ABN information from the individual concerned; and (c) whether in releasing information to Dunn& Bradstreet the ATO had complied with the Information Privacy Principles. (3) No. The Privacy Commissioner has advised me that on this occasion he did not conduct a formal investigation pursuant to his powers under s.40(2) of the Privacy Act 1988. It has been a long standing practice of his Office to conduct preliminary enquiries with the relevant agency and then seek to conciliate outcomes wherever possible. This approach has proved very effective over the ten years of operation of the Privacy Act 1988. (4) The Privacy Commissioner has advised me that his preliminary enquiries confirmed his Office’s view that the disclosure was authorised pursuant to the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 and therefore lawful. The Privacy Commissioner has also advised me that he was satisfied that the disclosure of ABN information was made pursuant to a contractual agreement entered into by the ATO and Dunn& Bradstreet which contained stringent privacy and confidentiality terms and conditions. (5) Yes. The Privacy Commissioner has advised me that during his preliminary enquiries, he advised the ATO that the IPP 2 statement only partially complied with the requirements of IPP 2 as the statement was scattered throughout both the electronic and hard copy ABN application information guides. The Privacy Commissioner suggested that the ATO modify its conduct and practices in order to better administer its privacy obligations. As a result of those discussions the ATO agreed to: (a) review current wording on website and paper documents to improve notice to individuals as to what will be done with their personal information and to ensure better compliance with IPP 2. The ATO also agreed to seek the Privacy Commissioner’s input and assistance in this process; (b) consult closely with the Privacy Commissioner in relation to any future bulk release of ABN records; (c) examine options to recommend to Government, including the possibility of an opt-out option that would limit access to personal information associated with the ABN; and (d) consult with the Privacy Commissioner in relation to any changes to the Regulations associated with the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999. (6) The Privacy Commissioner has advised me that on 22 June 2000 the Privacy Commissioner reached agreement with the ATO in relation to the resolution of: (a) the wording to be used in its IPP 2 statement; (b) the location of the IPP 2 statement on its website and in ABN registration packages; (c) the appropriate wording to be used in bulk data licence agreements to ensure that stringent privacy safeguards are in place;",100,Questions On Notice

(1) The number of individual transactions undertaken by the Transport & Regional Services Portfolio’s material general government sector agencies, the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DoTRS), the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and the National Capital Authority (NCA), are provided below: DoTRS AMSA CASA NCA (a) 1998-99 Unavailable# 5,000 37,369 Unavailable* (b) 1999-00 31,882 5,000 37,064 4,100 (c) 2000-01 32,000 5,000 37,000 4,100 (d) 2001-02 32,000 5,000 37,000 4,100 (e) 2002-03 32,000 5,000 37,000 4,100 (f) 2003-04 32,000 5,000 37,000 4,100 # Due to implementation of new financial management information system *Due to change in agency’s banking arrangement While it would be impractical to identify transactions with individual members of the public from the total number of individual transactions, DoTRS estimates that these would amount to no more than 5% of its total transactions. Similarly, CASA and NCA estimate that these would amount to no more than 1% of their total transactions. Estimates provided by AMSA are for two functions that involve a significant number of transactions with members of the public, that is, the Australian Shipping Register and the Marine Qualifications Register. (2) DoTRS, CASA and NCA have used the total number of financial payments and receipts, and AMSA has used new/amended registrations in, or searches of, the Australian Shipping Register and the number of Marine Qualifications Certificates issued as the number of transactions. (3) None of the agencies have conducted any transactions on line. However, in 1999-2000, DoTRS transacted 40% of payments and 5% of receipts by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Similar figures for NCA were 55% and 23% respectively. Agencies are currently further developing their electronic commerce strategy. At this point of time the estimates of the future proportion of online payments/receipts are not available from any agencies. (4) Agencies are unable to estimate the cost of administering these transactions, mainly because the transactions are often only one of a number of associated functions leading to payments or receipting. (5) Not applicable (all agencies).",101,Questions On Notice
