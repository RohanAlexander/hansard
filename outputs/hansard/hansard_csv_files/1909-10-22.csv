I have obtained the greater part of this information from the association in Melbourne to which most of these men belong, as well as from the Victorian Chief Inspector of Factories. As to the waiters, I find that they are paid £ 2 ' 2s. per week, and work the statutory hours. Waiters employed at leading hotels are paid 30s. per week, but it must not be forgotten that in such establishments there are additional means of income which are not usual in the Parliamentary Refreshment Room. waiters, if they work overtime, are paid 2s. 6d. an hour for the first hour and is. 6d. for each additional hour.

In view of the representations which have been made to me, I have had the conditions ' of tender altered, so that any pine, grown in any part of Australia, may, if found suitable, be used. called in every State, and in various parts of each State; and are the ballot-boxes to be made and delivered in one State alone?

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 21st October, vide page 4898) : move That the following proposed new section be inserted :"" 150. No oflicer, other than officers of the Cadets, shall be promoted, except probationally, to any rank higher than that of Captain until he has passed, as prescribed, a course of practical and theoretical instruction at the Military College lo perfect him in the practice of his own arm of the Forces, and to accustom him to the uses and possibilities of other arms."" The purpose of this proposed new section is to insure that our militia officers shall have an opportunity to ^become as efficient lege, we ought to use it. as possible. It is only by giving them some such means as this of securing efficiency together there will also be an interchange that we can prevent the creation in Ausof views amongst the various arms, which tralia of a military caste of permanent offiwill show the weakness of their preconcers. The whole point is that if we do not ceived methods, outside the actual terms make our militia officers as efficient as they of training, practical and theoretical. More can be made we must have them leaning on important than all, if we can get them to perhaps the permanent adjutant or instruca central college, our training will be practor attached to each section.""

Under this proposal we shall make all militia field officers truly efficient. In peace they will be capable of directing the education and training of their regiments, just as they will be charged with' the responsibility of leading them when the crisis comes. This proposal will not involve any important financial consideration, because, on the present war organization, there are only 201 majors on the list, in addition to nineteen majors on the reserve list. It is obvious that the whole of these 201 officers would not have to come up at once. If we had only 200 on the establishment, we should not expect to have more than forty of fifty coming up every year and the difficulty of getting them into some central college should not be, as is sugBILL. gested, insuperable. Officers of the Permanent or of the Militia Forces who do not wish to be put to the trouble of passing these examinations will immediately resist such a .proposition, but it ought not to be difficult to get a sufficient number ofmajors to come up for the course proposed. The alternative suggested in some quarters, that of having an instructor or two travelling round the country to instruct the majors, will not bring about that high state of efficiency that would be secured if all were brought together for instruction. If they come together there will be emulation and mutual competition.",16,Telephone Wires Perth Entrie Sin Country Exchanges Have Their Names C In Telephone List

If a better means can be suggested of achieving my object, I shall jump at the chance to escape the responsibility of moving such an amendment as this. But we must give our militia officers the opportunity of training at such a college as is suggested. If we do not we must rely on the antiquated, harmful, and effete system of permanent adjutants,-or some other system of the kind, that will lessen their self-reliance and weaken their efficiency to such an extent that they will become absolutely incompetent for their command when the time for action arrives.

All that it proposes is that their that the officers shall also be efficient. If qualifications shall be brought under review. If there is anything to be feared from that proposal it is that fJhe college authorities, because of persona] sympathy, may strain the qualities of mercy, and so sacrifice the efficiency of the forces. We must, however, take that risk. We cannot guard against every abuse, but we can adopt the mild expedient of bringing the qualifications of the present officers under the review of those directing the affairs of the college, and in doing so take some steps to guard against incompetence. Minister of Defence is putting up an excellent fight against what he considers to be a proposed injustice. If he could show that the proposed new section would have the effect he fears, I should certainly support him. But honourable members who consider that the injustice at the present time lies in a different direction from that which the honourable gentleman suggests must support this proposal.

No one would oppose more strongly than I should any proposition for mere theoretical examinations. In my younger days I had an opportunity to pass, and did pass, some, but the mere passing of such examinations or the holding of academic degrees does not count for much. Holders of academic degrees, as Carlyle put it, are often little men on long crutches. Some men have practically the whole alphabet at the end of their names, and that is all they have got.

The honourable member for Wentworth does not propose to deprive such men of their rank; he simply proposes that they shall be placed on the reserve list. Surely an army is not merely for show purposes, or to enable men to undergo physical drills.

We propose to reform our defence system, and when the honourable member for North Sydney says, ""We are not experts,"" I have no hesitation in .replying that we ought to keep away from the man who poses as an expert. My fear, however, ia that the Minister will become the toy of experts, who differ amongst themselves from year to year, and are constantly fighting. A few years ago Mr W. H . Smith, a London bookseller, but a shrewd business man, .who amassed a fortune, had charge of the British Admiralty, and carried out some of the most effective reforms that the Admiralty has ever known. That is my answer to the honourable member for North Sydney's remark as to honourable members not being experts. If we are to refrain from criticising'a Bill merely because we are not experts, why should we consider if in Committee? We might just as well take the Bill as ladled out' to us by the experts, and not trouble to discuss it. The honourable member for Maribyrnong was right in his references to theoretical examinations. He is an ex-field officerI am not throwing cold water on his fire brigade experiences-and an ex-Postmaster General. No one has ridiculed more than I have done some of the examinations prescribed for candidates for admission to the General Division of the Public Service. Recently candidates for the position of linesmen in the Postmaster-General's Department were asked to pass a stiff test in dictation, and one of the words they had to spell was "" phantasmagoria."" HadI been asked to spell it, I would have said: "" I have put up all the other poles; what sort of a pole is ' phantasmagoria ' "" ? Many' useless examinations are passed by men who are never heard of again. The gold medallist-the the senior wrangler of his year-is seldom heard of after he leaves the university. I am not very keen on theoretical examinations, but I am in favour of examinations being held to determine an officer's fitness for the post he occupies. I do not know what the Minister is fighting about. We have had some sad experiences of political officers.

AlthoughI supported last night the proposal for the establishment of a Military College, I am not in favour of that institution being used to squeeze out of the service men who may be good practical soldiers, although unable to pass a highly technical examination -The Minister ought to accept the proposed new section. Wlien speaking a few minutes ago I cited a case which, to my mind, showed the absolute necessity for inserting in the Bill such a provision as this. I propose now to give an even stronger illustration of its urgency. Some years ago we had in one of the States a commandant who suffered so severely from a certain complaint that it was impossible for him to cross a horse, and medical men said that he would never be able to ride again. That officer, however, was promoted to the position of State Commandant of Queensland, where he received a higher salary to perform duties which he could not possibly carry out. He died soon afterwards. I was certainly sorry for him. He had seen service in South Africa, and I was willing that he should obtain all the recompense that the Commonwealth could give him. A Labour Ministry was in power at the time, but the then Minister of Defence did not know the true position regarding this oflicer until I brought all the facts before him. This officer was physically incapable of pei forming any of his duties, yet he was promoted to one of the most important commands in the Commonwealth. Later fin he was superseded by an officer who was well able to do the work expected of him. He could readily have passed a very stringent theoretical examination, but was unfit to do practical work. I could cite twenty or thirty other cases in support of the position I take up, but think it unnecessary to do so. It is not my desire that any man who has done good service should be deprived of his rank, and no man would be under this provision because of his inability to prove his fitness. He would retain his rank, but would be placed on the retired list. think that the honourable member for Balaclava has completely misunderstood the posihis humanity on the other. tion. He appeared to imagine that under this proposed new section-and , in view of the repeated interjections of the Minister, he had every justification for believing that it was capable of the interpretation that he placed upon it-officer s of high rank were going to be asked to pass an examination in theory as well as in practice, such as will: be passed in future by younger officers graduating for the position of field officers. No such proposal is made by me. This provision is most explicit. It simply declares that whosoever cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a man selected by the Minister himself, according to methods prescribed by the Minister, his fitness for the position he holds should not continue to hold it. The Minister says that my proposal will cause injustice. Injustice to whom? Injustice to a number of officers who, I presume, cannot prove their fitness. just in their case. do "" an injustice "" to them, then we must be proposing to do an injustice to the country that expects us to be true to our oaths and to see that the country's forces are efficient, and that what we pass shall be carried out. we shall do an injustice to competent officers. competent man have his spirit, ambition, and enterprise stamped out of him by the fact that some gentleman who has influence and who, perhaps, can appeal to the pity of a Minister, is allowed to remain over him? Does not the Minister know that a gentleman occupying one of the highest positions in our military service was able to have corrected the decision of a Minister of Defence some four years ago, and to have that decision corrected, not on grounds submitted by his expert officers, but as the result of pressure brought to bear by leaders of parties' in this House? The Minister knows the case to which I refer. I am not at liberty to say more, but the incident shows that some such provision as this is necessary in the interests of the Minister of Defence himself. It shows that without some such provision as this the Minister will be in the same position as he is in to-day-a t constant war with conscience on the one hand, and with",31,Defence

If there are men who should be efficient they are the officers in command of that service. If we ever come to the practical test of warfare, the lives of the men will be at the mercy of the competency of the officers. I am sure we are all at one upon that point. vision retrospective? 0 'of having no officer in command, even in the humblest position, who is not thoroughly competent, this new departure will fail unless it is a new departure from the letter A. to the letter Z of our military system. We start this new force with a large number of officers of whom I wish to speak with the utmost respect, and who have shown patriotism in the most practical way by years of service, and it would be a cruel injustice to them to test them as to their efficiency as you would test a beginner. If I thought this proposal would inflict that injustice upon the officers in the service I should say that it ought to be scouted. other way of carrying out this proposal. not die out gradually ? regarding a matter of such urgent importance to the people? I have the greatest admiration for my honourable friend, who will never die out. I believe he is more, efficient now than he ever was in his life, and if these officers were only like him, an examination of any kind would be an insult. This is the first opportunity I have had of publicly congratulating my honourable friend the Minister of Defence upon the magnificent way in which he has introduced this Bill, and I again congratulate the Committee upon the way in which it has endeavoured to make the Bill even better than it was when introduced. If we can possibly finish it this afternoon, I think we should all endeavour to do so. Consequently, I shall say no more, except that it is possible for the Minister, under the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, to make the test one which would not be unfair or unjust, but would redound to the advantage of competent officers. If there are left in the service a few who have ceased to be competent, the discredit of their inefficiencv is spread over the whole service, and therefore, in the interests of the service and of the officers themselves, this proposal should be agreed to. I am confident that if it is passed in any form which the Minister upon consideration will agree to, it will be possible to submit all our officers to a fair test which will redound to the advantage of those who are competent, while removing from this new system, in the case of those who are incompetent, what I regard as its most serious danger of failure. jections to this proposal have been based on. a charge of injustice or unfairness to officers who are long past the stage for passing theoretical examinations. on that ground at all. their objections on the ground of unfair r ness and injustice to officers now in the service, in asking them to pass a theoretical examination. to the loss of the best officers. would be unfair to ask them to undergo a theoretical examination. I agree with the right honourable member for East Sydney that in many walks of life there are exceedingly competent men at the 'top of the tree who could not pass such theoretical examinations as they passed when they first entered their professions, but the wording of this provision shows that the honourable member for Wentworth had no such idea in his mind. In proposed new sections 150 and 151 he requires certain officers to pass a course of practical and theoretical instruction; but all he provides in this amendment is that those provisions shall not apply to any existing officer, so long as he receives, as prescribed, a certificate of fitness for his rank. He says nothing here about passing a theoretical and practical examination, and, as the right honourable member for East Sydney says, there could be prescribed under this provision conditions which would do no injustice or unfairness to any officer now in the sendee. member sketchwhat he thinks would ""be a fair test? could be removed by inserting after the word ""fitness"" the words "" in practical work."" that amendment.",33,Defence

We are beginning practically a new Defence Force, and its weakness, if it has any, will lie in having incompetent officers. It is altogether wrong to keep in the force, and put in charge of new men, officers who could not obtain from the Director of any Military College a certificate of fitness in practical work in the field. Any Director could see at once from their method of handling troops in the field whether they were worthy of a certificate of fitness or not. The amendment which I suggest would prevent the infliction of injustice and remove the fear of some honourable members that existing officers would be called upon to pass a theoretical examination. I should be afraid if this proposal were adopted that it would be regarded in the Military Forces as a kind of want of confidence motion in the existing officers. If there is any body of men that I admire it is those officers, especially those from civilian walks of life, who have given up a great deal of their time to military duties. To pass such a proposal as this would be virtually to pass a motion of censure on them.

Why: should it be assumled that this new-fangled Director of the Military College will be better than all the Ministers that we have had in charge of the Department, or why should it be supposed that the officers under him, just because we are passing a new Act, will be more competent than the men who' have voluntarily borne the heat and burden of the day ? We should think very seriously before we take such a drastic step. I have always a great dislike to throwing mud at anybody, and to pass such a provision as this would be distinctly throwing mud at the officers who have produced what we must admit to be a fairly efficient force, when we consider the disadvantages under which they have laboured for years. We ought not to destroy discipline altogether by casting discredit, as this proposed new section would do, upon the very efficient officers whom wer now have in the service. thoroughly concur in the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland. It makes the intention of the proposed new section all the clearer and takes away the last shred of excuse from those who are opposing it. could ever take the last shred of excuse from the honourable member, but the objections to the proposal seem to be based on the argument that it is not right to call upon officers who have served for a considerable time to pass an examination.

303,Mr Mcwilliams (Franklin) [2.42].,"that the. proposed new section provides a good way of doing so. Our service, like other services, is bound to contain a certain number of failures, and it is proposed to hand over the responsibility of determining what officers are unfit to a thoroughly competent authority. If there is one thing that we must avoid, it is political influence. This provision will remove the slightest suspicion of anything of the kind, and will prove a haven of refuge to future Ministers. We may have Defence Ministers who will not be capable of determining fairly what officers are unfit, and, indeed, nothing can be worse than to leave it to the Minister for the time being to determine on conflicting evidence the fitness or unfitness of an officer. The Director of the proposed Military College will be above reproach, and the officers could look to him for justice. to the fitness of our officers. Who will which none of the present officers could pass. not be fit for his position. The great majority of our officers will not thank those who suggest that they are afraid to submit themselves to tests. There are many who would gladly welcome an opportunity to do so. We are attempting to thoroughly reform our defence system, and should not shirk responsibility at the outset. of responsibility. But some honourable members wish to provide in the Bill for what should be a matter of administration. of the fitness of officers should not be left to the Minister. that it should. sion of this kind, the determination will have to be practically that of the Minister, on the advice of his officers, and that might create considerable ill-feeling, and disturb the harmony of the Department. The Minister regards the provision too seriously. I think that it will work beneficially, and remove from his shoulders a responsibility which I am sure he does not wish to bear, and which some Ministers would be unable to bear. certain Departments of the Public Service were transferred to the Commonwealth, those in the service were allowed to retain all the rights and privileges which they possessed under State administration. Are pur military officers to be differently treated ? There have been officers who have been unfit, and I have brought such cases under the notice of Ministers; but it would be an insult to many worthy men to ask them all to go up for examination again, as if they were so many school boys. Many of them, almost before the honourable member for Wentworth was born, were doing work which showed that they were fit for their positions. honourable member for Wentworth proposes to do a desirable thing in a wrong way. He proposes to make the Director pf the Military College the absolute authority as this Director be, that he alone should say that certain officers, are capable, and certain are not capable ? the best specialist that Australia can get. fuse to give such a power to any individual, without review or appeal. Those who are the proper persons to determine the capacity of the officers are the heads of the Defence Department, the military men who, under the new system, will have the responsibility of recommending that officers be retained in, or retired from-, the service. To require proof of fitness for practical work might tie the hands of the Minister too much. An officer must have other qualifications besides that. not be the best judge. honourable member for Gippsland complicates the position. We are beginning a new system, and if our legislation is not perfect, we can improve it later on, but we should start on fair lines. The honourable member for Wentworth has obtained recognition of the principle which he has asked the 1 Committee to adopt, and may be content to allow it to be developed, if necessary, by future Parliaments. He should not try, at this stage, to make us commit ourselves to a hard-and-fast rule.

That is now in the Bill, and, therefore, we have provided that all the incompetents must be retained. The Bill now enacts that no incompetent officer can be dismissed. This proves that honourable members who supported the Minister in the last two divisions did not know what they were voting for. Whether an officer is incompetent or otherwise, no one will dare to interfere with the rank that he holds. not insure his retention in the forces. some other reason than incompetency was shown for his dismissal. this Bill is concerned, the English language has no meaning. The Minister has announced that a new standard is to be set up equal to that of the Imperial Army, and that our organization is to be assimilated in every way to that of other parts of the Empire. If that is to be so, surely the chief officers of our forces ought to be those who have passed the latest and highest examinations. If we sent some of our present officers to take part in brigade operations with the Imperial Army, the Imperial officers would very soon reject them. While I have no objection to their staying in the forces in the ranks that they hold so long as they are competent, we ought to give seniority to more competent officers, if we have them, and this proposed new section provides that that shall be done.

I do not think that that is desirable. very sorry that on this occasion I cannafi follow my honourable friend, who, I think, has rendered valuable service in connection with the Bill. The effect of the provision might be that a very old and efficient officer who had shown his fitness by practical work might be superseded by a brilliant young student who had passed his technical examinations, but who did not possess the experience which the other had gained from long service. All that we wish to say is that when there is a vacancy the best-qualified officer ahall be promoted to it. The man who has passed an examination is to be preferred to the man who has not. tion is to confer seniority, apart from any question of promotion. plucky enough to submit himself to examination, and able to pass the test, should be given seniority over those who do not do so. Imperial soldiers have expressed the opinion that we are not making sufficient provision for commissioned and non-commissioned officers. That is the weakness of the scheme. We should offer a premium to officers to study and make themselves efficient. That is done by saying that promotion shall go to those who pass examinations. the Militarv College. vided that only men W'ho had attended the Military College should be given seniority, I would not support the provision; but what we are asked to enact is that those who have passed the prescribed examinations in any part of Australia shall be given seniority over those who have not done so. Apparently, a set is likelv to be made against the proposed Military College; and, unless the Committee take care to preserve it, influences are at work which may do much to nullify our effort to create a suitable training school for commissioned and. non-commissioned officers. The proposal offers incentives to officers to studv and improve. doubt some honourable members are prepared to support the Government against this proposal without really considering it. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has correctly stated that we have guaranteed the positions of certain officers, whether they are competent or incompetent. It is expressly stipulated that they shall not be affected by the preceding provisions. that they shall continue to hold their present rank. who is only a Saturday-afternoon colonel, parading once or twice a year-and there are such officers, even about Melbournestand in the way of the promotion of the officer who, by diligent attention to his duties, and hard study, has qualified for promotion, and has shown his capacity to fill the position to the greater advantage of the State? The man who does nothing should not be preferred to the man who improves himself. as the Lord Mayor of Melbourne did last vear. a case which is open to question. Such officers should not be allowed to stand in the way of the advancement of men of experience and ability, who have made themselves acquainted with the latest developments of military science. provided for. the discretion of the Minister; and the honourable member for Wentworth rightly contends that there should not be such discretion, but that in every case qualified men should be given preference when vacancies occur. to me of slight importance, because other clauses provide that officers cannot be promoted until they have passed the prescribed courses. those who already hold positions. a premium for improvement? trospective legislation.

CATTS (Cook) [3.51]I hope that the Minister of Defence will consult' with the Prime Minister, with a view to arranging to let honourable members know in advance what business will be taken from day to day. In the past, thc notice-paper has been altered a good deal. It was made when we were.on that side of the chamber 1 Mr J. H . CATTS -In that case, 1 hope honourable members will give it a sympathetic hearing. Some of the measures now before the House-the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill, the Defence Bill, and the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, for instance-involv e very big questions; and honourable members who wish to acquaint themselves with the interests affected, and to intelligently represent their constituents, have to study very hard to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with all the details. Ministers are in a far better position, because they have their responsible officers to prepare statements for them, and all tbe information they require is at theirfingers'ends. It is trying, however, for a private member, who is endeavouring to faithfully discharge his duties, to have constant alterations of the business-paper, because this causes him to lose the thread of his study at times, and makes it much more difficult to retain a clear comprehension of the subjects' under discussion. I do not make a party question of this; but I hope that the Ministers Will see the justice of my complaint. Minister of Defence) [3.56] -In regard to the complaint of the honourable member for Cook, it seems to me that the Government have no evidence of the unpreparedness of the' Opposition. My experience is that members are too well prepared. However, .1 will consult with the Prime Minister on the subject. On Tuesday we will proceed with the Defence Bill. tion put by the honourable member for Herbert, I may be permitted to say that copies of statutorv rules are sent direct to honourable members from the Departments concerned, and that an effort will be made to insure that they shall be received by honourable members in ample time to enable objections to be made, if desired, within the time fixed by the law.
