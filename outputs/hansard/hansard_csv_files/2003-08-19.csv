You might note, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, that I said ‘Solomon Islands’ and not ‘the Solomon Islands’, because that is its correct designation.

The impression I have had over that period of time has been of a country in decline whose institutions have been under severe pressure. In spite of the fact that it had a legal system that I would describe as sound a system of law based upon legislation and the common law precedents familiar to those of us in this country who practice law and a system which was essentially sound in its composition and constitutional foundation, sadly, over time that institution-and in particular the courts, the police and the jails-have suffered. They have suffered because they have been attacked from within and without by elements in Solomon Islands which regrettably were initially in areas of the state, departments and bureaucrats, and more recently by criminal elements. The tragedy of Solomon Islands is that the boundary between government and those who would trash the system and the institutions of Solomon Islands has completely disappeared. From that point of view I see it as absolutely necessary that Solomon Islands be given a helping hand. I can think of no better words to describe the program of deployment than ‘Helpem Fren’, which is the name given to our deployment in Solomon Islands. Second, I am pleased to support this motion because the second part of the motion concerns our endorsement and support of our personnel in the armed forces who are going to Solomon Islands. Some 1,500 personnel will be deployed, including 155 Federal Police, 80 members of the Australian Protective Service and a small number of officials drawn from relevant government departments, including Treasury, Foreign Affairs and the Australian Agency for International Development, the Attorney-General’s Department and DOFA. In all, the deployment will be of approximately 1,800 personnel, and our military deployment will be led by Colonel John Frewen of the ADF 2nd Battalion-a distinguished Australian soldier. It is headed by Mr Nick Warner, a senior official from Foreign Affairs and a former High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea. He has a long record of dealing with Pacific countries in crisis, such as Solomon Islands is in at the moment. As a commissioned officer in the Royal Australian Navy Reserve, I am delighted that our forces are leading the way in Operation Helpem Fren. Sometimes when you are up, you have to help those who are down, and that is the situation in the Pacific at the moment. Australia is MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Notices

400,Mr King (Wentworth) (4.30 P.m.),"It is my pleasure and indeed honour to support thea country that has shown that it has not just the right values but also the strength to help others who are in difficulty. Thankfully, those who are in difficulty are looking to us for leadership and assistance and not elsewhere. They are not looking to the darker forces that have sought assistance from al-Qaeda and others; they are looking to us and to the values that we all share and espouse on both sides of the House. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to be able to support the deployment on that ground as well. uty Speaker, only last Friday, 15 August was Victory in the Pacific Day. Significant numbers of Australian troops were involved in the Second World War at Guadalcanal. If one goes to Guadalcanal today, one can still see the old tanks and landing barges that were attacked and hit by the Japanese, whose incredibly superior forces took on our landing forces and did amazing damage, yet we triumphed. Only the other day the Manoora was in Guadalcanal, and it dropped a wreath where the Canberra was sunk by Japanese aircraft, with 80 lives lost, as it was supporting the landing forces at Guadalcanal. Interestingly enough, one of the naval personnel on that ship was the father of our current Minister for Defence. Thankfully, he survived. Australia has a long history in the Pacific and in defending values that are important to our country and to countries such as Solomons in the Pacific. differential in pay between Australian Federal Police and ADF personnel in the Solomon Islands? I understand that it is $100 a day and, surely, that must be of great upset to defence personnel deployed in the same region, doing the same kind of work. understand it, by ADF personnel officers in a way that, I am sure, will be satisfactory to them and for the appropriate resolution of the deployment. Certainly Nick Warner has indicated that that issue has not in any way affected the outcomes that he is looking for and the effectiveness of our forces on the ground. Sometimes in relation to those issues adjustments need to be made, especially where you have personnel from different parts of the Commonwealth working alongside defence personnel. Third, Australia should be in Solomon Islands because it is in our own national interest. It is in our own national interest because national security is broader than just protecting the borders of our own country. We have seen that in the ravages that occurred in East Timor. Earlier this year I was in Taiwan, where I attended a very interesting conference on Asia-Pacific security. We heard from many representatives of countries around the Pacific who felt under pressure in relation to national security issues and who felt that it was terribly important that all countries worked together in the Pacific to ensure that those outcomes were in the interest not just of each other but of the whole. Australia’s national security interests are involved. Those interests require our presence in Solomon Islands. All of us-I am speaking as an ordinary Australian-have a deep concern in ensuring that the national security of that country is protected, because it is also in our own national interests. With those considerations in mind, I warmly support the motion. MAIN COMMITTEE",117,Solomon Islands

406,Mr King,"I am glad you asked that question, because that issue has been addressed, as IThe problem in Solomon Islands has become one of utter lawlessness. The Townsville Peace Agreement of 2000 and the subsequent international peace monitoring team attempted to deal with interethnic conflicts in Solomon Islands, but those ethnic tensions have quickly degraded into a shocking fight between criminal gangs and those who would bludgeon institutions of government, commercial interests and ordinary shop owners. I remember having perhaps the best Chinese meal that I have ever had anywhere in the world-and I have had a few around the place-in Honiara, back in 1993. There were some wonderful Chinese restaurants along the waterfront there, but they have all gone. Small business now finds it impossible to operate. Many expatriate Australians who lived in Honiara and, indeed, in the outer islands in the west and in other parts of Solomons have found it impossible to live there with their children. We had the recent example of a churchman, who was working as a pastor in one of the villages, being slaughtered. I have also had involvement with timber companies that have found it impossible to get their product to market simply because of the utter lawlessness that has occurred. Over the last six years per capita GDP has halved, falling below $US500 in 2002, and the economy contracted by 14 per cent in 2000 and by another nine per cent in 2001. It really is a shocking situation. Perhaps it reached its nadir with the slaughter of Sir Alfred Soaki, the former police commissioner and National Peace Councillor who was assassinated in February this year, and cabinet minister Father Augustine Geve who was killed in August of last year. Women are unsafe on the streets. Kidnappings, murder, rape and torture-all of these have gone unchecked. I want to speak briefly about the longer term. I want to propose that Australia help this break-down of law and order in the system not just through Operation Helpem Fren and the $200 million that we are putting into the operation but also by looking at a new measure. I believe there is a need for Australia to show leadership, as we are doing through aid programs in other countries, such as Cambodia, where we are putting significant aid into the establishment of court, police and jail systems. We need to do that in Honiara to get these people back on their feet. But we also need to ensure that they are not going to fall by the wayside again. Australian taxpayers cannot be expected to go back, time and again, to solve these sorts of problems. We need to know that Solomon Islands is going to be re-established as a secure, stable country that continues to see Australia as a friend, and which we see as a friend, with values that are not dissimilar. Therefore, I am proposing that a legal system rather similar to the Privy Council system that formerly existed under the British Commonwealth be established across the Pacific islands and the Pacific countries, that there be a high court of the Pacific, and that a legal system that seeks to reinforce the values of law and order that exist in this country, New Zealand, Fiji and formerly in Solomon Islands be established. In the future, we will be proud of what our troops have done if we adopt such a measure now and in the longer term. government to join with governments of other Pacific countries in responding to the request of the Solomon Islands government for assistance in restoring law and order and the structure of government in that country. I join with other members of the opposition and the government in congratulating the ADF, the Australian Federal Police and other Australian personnel in Solomon Islands on the operation so far. I am pleased to see that this mission, Operation MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Solomon Islands
407,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (4.44 P.m.),"The opposition supports the decision of theHelpem Fren, appears to be already marked by considerable success, particularly as shown by the surrender of gang leader Harold Keke. Nevertheless, this exercise will be an expensive one and will impose further strain on our overstretched defence forces. WhilstI am keen to maintain the bipartisan tone of this debate, it would be irresponsible not to point out the size of the intervention and the burden it will place on our defence personnel, which is already great. A deployment of this scale, it is my contention, might not have needed to be so extensive if early warning signs about the situation in Solomon Islands had been heeded by the government some time ago. There have been problems in the Solomons for many years. There were interventions by armed gangs during the so-called coup of 2000. The first two months of 2002 saw the shoot-up of the police headquarters in Gizo, a government minister accused of extortion, daily acts of intimidation of businesses and individuals, an increasing number of home robberies, hijacked vehicles, the murder of police personnel and the assassination of government officials. Some of these were outlined by the previous speaker. They have all been part of the worsening situation of the last three years. Solomon Islands is an excellent example of what happens when a colonial power withdraws from a country and then leaves it to its own devices with a state structure which cannot be sustained because the state has insufficient revenue, because there are not enough trained personnel to maintain the state infrastructure and because the postcolonial system takes little account of ethnic and regional differences. This is not an argument for continued colonial rule; it is an argument for the view that postcolonial states must continue to receive active assistance from their wealthier and more developed neighbours when these problems occur in order to overcome them. Sadly, the Solomon Islands did not receive this timely support. The former colonial power must take some blame for this, but so must the Solomons’ wealthy near neighbours, Australia and New Zealand. The Howard government signalled its lack of interest in the past in Solomon Islands-not ‘the Solomon Islands’, as the member for Wentworth pointed out in his remarks-and our other neighbours when it came to office and abolished the post of Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, which had been filled with distinction in the Labor government by the former member for Kingston, the Hon. Gordon Bilney, a former diplomat and the predecessor to the current excellent member for Kingston. Our neighbours correctly interpreted this as a sign of indifference. So did people like George Speight in Fiji and the ethnic warlords in Solomon Islands, who assumed that they could intimidate and loot weak postcolonial governments without fear of punishment. The government cannot claim that it had no warning about the impending crisis in Solomon Islands. I agree with the member for Griffith when he argues that the foreign minister should have taken notice of the warnings he was given three years ago by, amongst others, the member for Denison. He and the government should have agreed to a modest deployment of police in the Solomons at that time. The present extremely expensive deployment, as I said previously, might not have been necessary if this had been attempted. The intervention would have had the support of the Solomon Islands government and would have been welcomed by the people of Solomon Islands. It might have encouraged the people to stand up to ethnic gangsterism. I was a bit taken aback by the interjection of the foreign minister at question time that thousands of people had had their lives saved by interventions that he had been inMAIN COMMITTEE volved in. I thought that was a bit of hubris. Timely action at the time might have been more appropriate in the case of Solomon Islands. The government hoped, at the time, that a patched up Townsville agreement would solve the country’s problems. I am not suggesting that Australia should have gone in, guns blazing, at that point. It should have been obvious, however, that ethnic disputes were the real problem in Solomon Islands, and a number of informed people said at the time that this was the case. The real problem was the collapse of the state’s revenue and hence its infrastructure. The reason that people in Solomon Islands began to take the law into their own hands was that they no longer had any confidence in the state to protect their lives and property. A sign from Australia, at the time, that it was willing to bolster the rule of law in Solomon Islands with more than words might have saved Solomon Islands from the troubles of the past three years. We could also now say that it would have saved the Australian taxpayer a lot of money. I would like to focus on some remarks by a former foreign minister of the Solomon Islands Labour Party, who was speaking on the ABC on 5 June 2003 about Australia’s lost opportunities. He said: Obviously, when the government in any country is not in control of enforcing the rule of law in that country, then the Government cannot function, and that was the situation the PM of Solomon Islands was in when he asked for assistance. When Australia sort of decided that maybe that was not a good course of action, instead of discussing the matter with the PM, it seems to me that it was just ignored, and it has been left, and now it’s too late to do anything about it. This Australian government often seems to forget where we are in the world. We are in the South Pacific and we are in Asia. The government should focus on that. We cannot pretend we are part of Western Europe or tucked away with our friends from North America. Our first priority must be this region of the world. As Dr Stewart Woodman from the Australian Defence Force Academy says: We could have seen this thing coming for some time, I believe, in the Pacific, but in some ways I suspect our focus has been, shall we say, in larger games to the north. Despite this, there was a clear need for police intervention. David Hegarty from the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the ANU said just a few months ago in a submission to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee: In the past, Australia has, appropriately, said that it respects the national standing of neighbouring island states and that it deals with them on a government-to-government basis. But the legitimacy and efficiency of some governments is likely to reach the stage where those conventions of basic international discourse cannot be sustained. Australia may well face the circumstances where it will have to intervene in more direct ways. Presumably this will be done in concert with regional nations, but it will require high levels of sensitive diplomacy and make high demands on armed and unarmed services required to work in what may well be chaotic circumstances. When considering interventions of whatever kind-from military to humanitarian assistance-policy planners will need to be alert to the principles that not one size fits all, that interventions must be designed to meet specific circumstances .... Lessons can be drawn from the three successful interventions in the region-East Timor, Bougainville and Solomon Islands-which illustrate the necessity of: understanding the particular local circumstances getting the shape and nature of the intervention force right appreciating the limitations of intervention ... MAIN COMMITTEE building the peace from the moment hostilities cease. It is on this issue of a postconflict crisis in our region that I want to make some remarks. Such issues as disarmament, demobilisation, rehabilitation and indigenous leadership of the peace process are all important issues that we must take into consideration. Similarly, the Solomon Islands Labour Party said to the same inquiry: Australia should give priority to getting law and order in Honiara back on track. There was a project by AusAID known as the Institutional and Capacity Strengthening Project. In this project, advisers are provided to the Royal Solomon Islands Police. However, this has proved not to be capable or an effective measure of assisting the Solomon Islands Police Force return to normalcy. This is not surprising, as most of the high-ranking police officers whom the Australian advisers have been assigned to advise are heavily implicated in the events of the ethnic crisis and the coup of 2000. Also the relationship between these high ranking police officers and the so called former militants ... is basically intact ... It is the view of the Solomon Islands Labour Party that the only way to break this nexus between the law breakers, law makers and law enforcers is for a neutral force to be dispatched to the Solomon Islands to support the efforts of the majority in the country who want to clean up this mess. That is why, as the Leader of the Opposition stated: The principal aim of this intervention is to restore peace and stability in our region. As such it is fully consistent with Labor’s foreign policy, which focuses on the region. The action forms part of a consistent pattern of Australian intervention in regional conflicts, from Cambodia in the early 1990s to East Timor and to Bougainville in the past few years. However, there are some problems with this intervention. The people of Solomon Islands do welcome this police interventionA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.55 p.m. to 5.09 p.m. come the restoration of law and order. There is widespread concern about the heavy Australian Defence Force presence there, however. There are 1,500 ADF personnel now in Solomon Islands. Australia must be alive to how this is perceived by people there and in the region. While there is an obvious need for the AFP contingent to be protected, other countries have expressed concern about the number of ADF personnel present. Just like the US intervention in Iraq, it would be much better for the people of Solomon Islands, for the people of Australia and indeed for the people of the United States if there were a policy of ‘quick in and quick out’. As soon as the security situation is restored, having only a minimal level of security profile and presence would be ideal for the restoration of Solomon Islands sovereignty. Some valuable political lessons have been learnt by this government. When we have a military deployment like that in East Timor, the people rally around the flag and the leader. The Prime Minister might want to keep Australian troops deployed in Solomon Islands month after month until the election next year-I hope that is not the case. I also want to draw attention to something in the intervention-that is, defence personnel and Federal Police officers are working side by side in the same operation, with troops getting $1,059 a week and police getting $2,200 a week. In my view, this discrimination against Australian soldiers is a disgrace. Justifiably, many of the defence personnel deployed to Solomon Islands are angry that such a discrepancy exists between troops and Federal Police officers. I MAIN COMMITTEE",119,Solomon Islands
408,Mr Danby,"As I was saying before the suspension, people from Solomon Islands welknow that the Federal Police officers union negotiated a very good arrangement, but Australian troops should be treated equally. Both the Federal Police personnel and the defence troops face the same hardships and possibly the same dangers in performing this important national task. The Minister for Defence has stated that defence personnel are authorised to shoot to kill if needed, under what he termed ‘military rules of engagement’, yet the Howard government has authorised a deployment allowance of just $55 a day, with no tax concessions on salary. At the same time, the government has granted Federal Police officers sent to Solomon Islands an exemption from income tax, and a number of additional allowances. This leaves a Federal Police officer $170 a day better off when compared to what they would receive in Australia. In my view, there is a dramatically different treatment of defence personnel as compared to that of police personnel on the same mission. Only after being questioned in parliament by Labor did the government release details of the terms and conditions given to the AFP personnel. On top of being short-changed compared to the AFP personnel and being confined to base, defence personnel have been surviving on hard rations for at least three weeks. While fresh food is available from locals who are just four hours flight away in Townsville, ADF personnel have been forced to eat dry rations. As any of us who have spent time with the ADF will know, eating from ration packs is certainly not something that one wants to do over a long period of time-indeed, not even for a short period of time. This is an example of the ADF personnel being treated rather poorly. I conclude by saying that, despite this, I and the opposition support the intervention because it is the right thing to do to help our Pacific neighbours. It is right for the people of Solomon Islands. It is a responsible exercise of Australia’s role in the region. I am very pleased with the way that the deployment has worked out at this stage. Labor hopes this intervention will show similar gangster elements in other Pacific countries that such deployments might happen if they try to abuse their power against the legitimate governments of our neighbours in the Pacific. Labor supports the motion. (5.13 p.m.)-More than ever before, Australia is engaged in assisting our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. We now have more than 150 police and Protective Service officers and about 1,500 military personnel engaged in assisting the Solomon Islands. Let me address some of the points made by the member for Melbourne Ports, who clearly had misunderstood something that he had read and did not understand the situation in regard to both salaries and allowances. All ADF and AFP personnel deployed as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands are entitled to the same tax treatment under the Income Tax Assessment Act. The salaries and allowances of all ADF and AFP personnel will be tax free after a qualifying period of 91 days of continuous service in the Solomons. The tax exemption applies from the first day. Where the member has become a little confused is with regard to allowances. The Australian Federal Police receive a deployment allowance of $48.86 a day, which is tax free after a qualifying period of 91 days of deployment-as you would realise, the AFP will, of course, be there for a lot longer than the military. By comparison, ADF personnel receive a deployment allowance of $55.50 a day in recognition of the level of threat. This allowance is tax free from MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Solomon Islands
409,Mrs Gallus (Hindmarsh,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)the first day of deployment but, as I said, they would expect to be there for a much shorter time. Perhaps the member for Melbourne Ports would like to take that on board. Although the agreement to assist the Solomon Islands to resolve their current problems was signed only four weeks ago, progress to restore law and order has been above expectations. As the parliament would know, Harold Keke, whose activities have terrorised the Weather Coast on the south side of the island of Guadalcanal, recently surrendered to the regional assistance mission. Harold Keke and his senior offsiders are now securely in custody while police investigate their alleged crimes. Australia’s presence in the Solomon Islands has been welcomed by everyone in the country, including rebels such as Harold Keke, former members of the Malaita Eagle Force, civil society, the parliamentary opposition and, of course, the government, which initiated the request for help. When asked, we responded to the call for assistance on condition that there was a formal request from the government of the Solomon Islands, that enabling legislation was passed through the Solomon Islands parliament and that unanimous support was received from the nations of the Pacific Islands Forum. At this point, I stress that this is not solely an Australian operation. Australia is leading a joint regional operation, with personnel from New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga and PNG serving alongside Australians and with contributions expected next month from Vanuatu, Samoa, Kiribati and the Cook Islands. As the largest nation in the region, it is appropriate that we take the majority of the burden. But, without the support of our neighbouring Pacific countries, Australia would not have been prepared to take on the engagement in the Solomons to the extent that we have. We are a neighbour; we are not a neo-colonial power. We are taking the lead as part of a cooperative intervention. Operation Helpem Fren is part of Australia’s continuing assistance to the Solomon Islands. Unfortunately, over several years the Solomons have faced a number of difficulties. In late 1998 ethnic tensions escalated when the people of Guadalcanal became resentful of the large number of people from the neighbouring island of Malaita who were settling on Guadalcanal. By mid-1999 the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army, later named the Isatabu Freedom Movement, had taken control of much of the land around the capital of Honiara. As a result, up to 20,000 Malaitan settlers were repatriated from Guadalcanal to Malaita. In response, the Malaitans formed the Malaita Eagle Force and took armed action against the IFM. In June 2000 there was a coup, with MEF militants, together with disaffected police officers, seizing control of key installations in Honiara and forcing the then Prime Minister to resign. Following the coup and in response to requests for assistance, Australia brokered a ceasefire between the factions. With a long history of involvement in supporting Pacific island states, in August 2000 Australia was able to initiate the Townsville Peace Agreement, which effectively brought the end to much of the ethnic conflict. The peace agreement was then implemented with the help of the international peace monitoring team, which Australia led and largely funded. Unfortunately, although ethnic fighting largely ended, new problems started to emerge. In the last few years law and order in the Solomons has deteriorated, undermining the stability of the country and contributing to its decline. As part of the breakdown in law and order, government officials, including the Prime Minister and his cabinet ministers, have been threatened with violence by ex-militants, criminal MAIN COMMITTEE gangs and rogue elements of the Solomon Islands police. As a result of these problems, per capita GDP has halved, exports have dropped 80 per cent and budget deficits have spiralled out of control. The police force has shown that, by itself, it cannot restore law and order. Under the Howard government, more than ever before Australia is taking a key leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region. When asked for help by the East Timorese, this government stood up for the Timorese and provided the assistance needed to help Timor Leste become the world’s newest independent nation. When we received a request from the Solomon Islands for help, we marshalled support from the region and as a result today we have the regional assistance mission restoring law and order in the Solomon Islands. As I mentioned earlier, the progress to date has been outstanding. About 2,500 weapons have been handed in with a couple of days still to go until the 21 August deadline when the weapons amnesty ceases. Harold Keke has surrendered and members of the former Malaita Eagle Force have handed over a number of weapons. The people of the Solomon Islands are starting to feel secure and hopeful for the future. Our contribution to the Solomons is much greater than just our leadership and contribution to the regional assistance mission. As was the case in East Timor, our involvement will not stop with the cessation of military activity in the Solomons; Australia will remain to assist with the rebuilding of that country. In recent years, Australia has been contributing over $35 million a year in development assistance to the Solomon Islands. This has included community projects to support peace building and to provide a ‘peace dividend’ to Solomon Islanders. These projects help the communities to help themselves-for example, by supporting local villagers to build their own schools by using their own labour. We have assisted in training and strengthening the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. We have also helped keep rudimentary health services running throughout the Solomon Islands-essential support that has saved lives. However, because of the situation in the Solomons, Australia will now provide significantly increased aid, continuing to build on the work we have done to date and increasing our support in two key areas. These two areas are law and order, and economic stability. Under the law and order part of the Australian aid program, we will be assisting the Solomon Islands to complete their new prison so there will be a secure facility in which to hold those who have broken the law. We are also helping to train the prison service staff who are responsible for guarding the prison. Australian personnel will be assisting Solomon Islands magistrates and other parts of the justice system by providing training and on-ground support. Similarly, we will be building on the present gains with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force to further improve their capacity to maintain law and order. The second part of our increased aid program will focus on economic recovery. There is an urgent need for strict budgetary processes to be put in place in the Solomon Islands so that the basic government functions can be afforded-for example, so that government employees can be paid the wages they are currently owed. The program will fund experts to work with their Solomon Island counterparts in such areas as finance, revenue collection, customs, debt management and public sector reform. Under the Howard government, Australia is engaged in our region more than ever before. We are playing a leadership role that will create stability in the Solomon Islands. We are helping our neighbours reach their potential, economically and socially, and as Australians we should be proud. And we should be proud of our forces who are serving in the Solomons, both MAIN COMMITTEE the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Defence Force. In answer to a complaint made by the member for Melbourne Ports in regard to food, I assure the member for Melbourne Ports that a kitchen is now open on the Solomon Islands and for the past couple of days everybody has been receiving fresh rations and will receive them into the future. The member for Melbourne Ports can be reassured about that. In conclusion, as a nation we should be very proud of what we are achieving together with our neighbours, and we should be proud of the friendships we continue to forge in the region. the Opposition and other Labor Party speakers who have indicated our support for the Australian Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. This intervention force is led by the Australian Federal Police, the military and Protective Service personnel. As the Leader of the Opposition says, it meets all the criteria that Labor believe to be necessary for an effective and legitimate Australian commitment to a peacekeeping effort in the Solomon Islands. Australians have read with concern and seen on TV screens that lawless gangs have virtually taken control of Solomon Islands and turned ethnic disagreement into a reason for armed attacks on innocent civilians. If we are able to provide military personnel to conflicts in far-off Iraq and Afghanistan, it is only fair that we come to the assistance of our near Pacific neighbours when specifically requested to by their elected governments. It is also only fair that we provide security as well as social and economic assistance to small Pacific states such as the Solomon Islands which provided a blanket of protection to Australians in the Second World War and which, since that time, have been locations for outgoing tourism. I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of our Pacific neighbours, such as Vanuatu, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Kiribati. I notice that these states will be providing some peacekeeping forces to the Solomons. I have also had an overnight stop in Honiara. The other thing I should mention when talking about our assistance to these countries is that volunteers from Australia provide great assistance to these people, particularly in the medical field. Only a week or so ago, in my office, I presented certificates to a couple of people who were volunteering their services in Fiji. In general, people from these regions are peace-loving, family-oriented people. Their relaxed culture centres on family, church, singing, dancing and, of course, sport, particularly rugby union. We are fortunate to have many of these communities living in Australia today. We are able to enjoy their culture, and their sporting skills strengthen our various sporting codes. But this unique Pacific culture can easily be destroyed by corruption, lawlessness, poverty and environmental damage. The Solomon Islands, which gained its independence in 1978, is facing numerous political and economic challenges. It has seen corruption, resource exploitation and economic stagnation. These pressures have led to ethnic disputes over land and jobs, resulting in violent clashes between ethnic groups, with casualties on both sides. The violence has been made possible in some cases by the use of a number of illegal weapons which have come from the long-festering conflict in nearby Bougainville. It is pleasing to see that, as a result of the intervention of our peacekeeping forces, many of these weapons are now being turned in and destroyed and one of the leading troublemakers, Harold Keke, has surrendered and is now in custody.

410,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (5.24 P.m.),"I rise to support the remarks of the Leader ofbeen surrendered since the Australian troops arrived in the Solomons on 24 July. This is a pleasing result. The Labor Party has urged a proactive role for Australia in the Solomon Islands. It did not agree with the government in 2001 when it held that the solution to the Solomon Islands’ problems was home-grown. The member for Denison, in his contribution to this debate, pointed out that the Australian government should have acted earlier when the Solomon Islands situation was less serious than it later became. When an Australian delegation, led by the President of the Senate and including the member for Denison as deputy leader, visited the Solomon Islands in April 2000, the Prime Minister of that country at that time asked the delegation why the Australian government had not supported the Solomon Islands request for a Commonwealth intervention force of approximately 50 police to reinforce their local police force. At the time of this request, the elected government was still in office, key institutions of the administration were still functioning and the police force, with some difficulties, was still providing law enforcement in the capital, although, of course, it would have been greatly assisted by a further injection of police from neighbouring countries. Unfortunately, this request was not taken up by the Australian government. Only a short time later the country descended into anarchy, with the armed kidnap of the Prime Minister and his forced resignation. Many people died in the violence that followed. The Labor Party saw, as outlined in the Leader of the Opposition’s speech, that the problem of lawlessness in the Pacific islands was of great importance to Australia’s long-term foreign policy interests. Indeed, the Labor Party created the position of the Minister for Pacific Island Affairs when it was in government. The Pacific islands are in our immediate geographical region and, while our trade, military and cultural ties are stronger elsewhere, we nevertheless have an obligation to engage in our region. The ALP has always recognised this. The lawlessness in the South Pacific had the potential to create an environment where drug running, people-smuggling, money laundering and other transnational crimes could flourish. Of future concern in today’s terror-charged climate is that terrorists themselves could use our Pacific neighbours as a stepping off point to attack targets in Australia. This would be more likely to happen in a country where law and order have broken down. That is why regional stability is so important and why this peacekeeping mission is supported by the Labor Party. It is important for Australia and New Zealand to be seen as the goodwill leaders in the Pacific because this is our region of influence-not Iraq or Afghanistan. We are prepared to subject Australian taxpayers to finance our military operations in faraway lands, but we cannot afford to fuel up our own naval patrol boats in the Pacific so that they can fully patrol their area of responsibility. This is another fact that we were advised of during my two trips to the Pacific. In many cases, the patrol boats were tied up and limited in their operations because of the cost of fuel. The other issue that I observed in my two trips to the Pacific is the growing influence of other nations, particularly China. This will grow if Australia and New Zealand leave a vacuum. There are considerable strategic, social, environmental and humanitarian reasons for accepting the Solomon Islands government’s invitation to be part of a peacekeeping force, and it is good that the Australian parliament is able to accept this invitation in a bipartisan way. Quite clearly, the assistance to the Solomon Islands, subject to that government’s request, MAIN COMMITTEE needs to go beyond restoring law and order. Restoring the economic and commercial structures will also be important. Earlier media reports have referred to the virtual collapse of the banking system in the Solomons. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald in May this year by Tom Allard, it was reported that ANZ, Westpac, the National Bank of the Solomon Islands and the Solomon Islands Central Bank had closed their branches following visits from ‘well-known Solomon Islands enforcers’ demanding to open an account. The ANZ spokesman is quoted in the Allard article as being ‘concerned that the request to open an account could serve two purposes-to provide the means to launder money or to encourage irate investors to besiege its premises demanding promised returns’. The issue of Australia’s responsibility under international law also needs to be examined concerning our involvement in the Solomons. The shadow minister, the member for Griffith, covered this point in his contribution in this debate. The Solomon Islands situation is that a sovereign government and the parliament of that country requested intervention, and therefore the doctrine of state sovereignty which forms the core of the UN charter is preserved. Also, the fact that the mission to the Solomons has been endorsed by the Pacific Islands Forum again reinforces the doctrine of state sovereignty. I believe that the Australian government should not simply stop at restoring law and order; we should offer the Solomon Islands assistance in restoring their domestic economy, which, because of the law and order problems, is on its knees. The CIA’s World Factbook, which was updated on 1 August this year, states: The bulk of the populationof the Solomon Islandsdepends on agriculture, fishing, and forestry for at least part of their livelihood. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. However, severe ethnic violence, the closing of key business enterprises, and an empty government treasury have led to serious economic disarray, indeed near collapse. Tanker deliveries of crucial fuel supplies (including those for electric generation) have become sporadic due to the government’s inability to pay and attacks against ships. Telecommunications are threatened by the non-payment of bills and by the lack of technical and maintenance staff, many of whom have left the country. The Australian government’s natural desire to withdraw troops as soon as possible should be tempered by the need to work with the Solomon Islands authorities to restore the economic and civil infrastructure. It is highly likely that this will take more than just a few months. We have seen in Afghanistan and Iraq that winning the peace is a lot harder, in many cases, than winning the war. We see in the Solomon Islands that the civil infrastructure has collapsed. There is a lack of confidence in the local law enforcement agencies and the judiciary. Politicians have been accused of corruption. There are disagreements on land rights and the rights of various tribes. The present government also needs to restore its authority. Now that we are there, Australia must ensure that we achieve for the people of the Solomon Islands a situation that will enable them to return to their relaxed, peaceful lifestyle. As a means of playing a greater role in the very difficult circumstances facing our Pacific neighbours, the federal government should consider reintroducing a minister with Pacific island responsibilities. MAIN COMMITTEE We have a responsibility to our region as well as to our allies elsewhere. The intervention force in the Solomon Islands, along with our troops in Bougainville and East Timor, are examples of the leadership role that we can and should be playing. I support the motion. recognise the extraordinary professionalism that the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in Townsville contribute to Australia’s peacekeeping operations overseas. Townsville has been the centre of most of Australia’s military operations overseas in the last 20 years, and the Solomon Islands deployment is no different. Many of the resources of the ADF have come out of Townsville, and many ADF people in Townsville, both in the Army and the Air Force, have been involved. I pay tribute to the Commander of the 3rd Brigade, Brigadier David Morrison, who as leader of the 3rd Brigade has responsibility for the operations of the 2nd Battalion in the Solomon Islands and of the 1st Battalion in Timor. I also pay tribute to the men and women of the Royal Australian Air Force and, in particular, to Wing Commander Glendon Krause, base commander of 323 in Townsville, who almost on a daily basis is servicing and supporting the airlift movements that occur from Townsville direct to the Solomon Islands in resupply operations and other movements. Townsville indeed is the centre of Australia’s overseas responses, particularly in relation to the Solomon Islands. The 2nd Battalion has been a very busy battalion this year. Not only is Lieutenant Colonel John Frewen, the CO of the 2nd Battalion, with his company in the Solomon Islands; he also has a contingent in Iraq. That particular contingent has the role of protecting Australia’s diplomatic post in Baghdad and protecting airport operations at the airport in Baghdad. Later this year, in October, the 2nd Battalion has been chosen to trial the United States Land Warrior system. This is a revolutionary, state-of-the-art system where the soldier operates in the battle space as a system. It is quite remarkable. The equipment enables the soldier not only to remain much safer than currently is possible but also to be much more highly effective than currently is possible. It does that through a number of mechanisms, and these mechanisms will be trialled by the 2nd Battalion at the high-range training area and perhaps at the Tully jungle training area in October. Soldiers wear a kit which is basically a computer, battery packs, computer controls, a GPS, a wireless LAN and a radio communications system. Attached to all that is a weapon that has both thermal and visual sights on it so that the soldier can operate whether it is day or night. The beauty of this system is the safety that it affords the soldier in the battle space. The soldier can be out of harm’s way while effectively being a very dangerous element to an enemy. The commander, who may not even be on the battlefield and might be in another country, through an eyepiece that the soldier wears can present to the soldier a topographical map of the battle space that the soldier is in. On that map can be the exact location of all other members of the company who are part of that operation. On top of that, the commander can superimpose the locations of the enemy so that at all times soldiers know where the enemy is and where the friendlies are. Because the weapon that the soldier carries has imaging sights on it, the soldier does not even have to be able to see the target. The soldier can be safely behind a wall, in a building or on the edge of a cliff and can put his weapon around the corner or over the cliff and see the target without actually being in danger. A few weeks ago I was very privileged to trial the MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Solomon Islands
411,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (5.37 P.m.),"I would like to use my contribution in this debate toLand Warrior system in the United States. I was given five live rounds and I was able to hit the target five times without actually ever seeing it. It is a great system. The wireless LAN is just revolutionary. It comes with all the computer LAN facilities that we have in a normal office but it is on the battlefield. You can have access from one soldier to another soldier, one soldier to all soldiers or one soldier to the commander. It has endless possibilities, as it operates as a local area network. On top of that, there are more developments coming which Australia will be part of. For example, there will be a photovoltaic soldier’s uniform which will charge the batteries, and the soldier will not even know that his uniform is charging them. There will be fibre-optic controls that will allow certain other sensor operations-which I cannot speak about-to operate, with the soldier not even being aware that he is a sensor in the battlefield and giving the commanders very accurate information indeed. The 2nd Battalion is without doubt currently Australia’s prime battalion in the Australian Defence Force. I congratulate the men and women who operate within that battalion on their professionalism. But I do not want to forget the 1st Battalion, which is also based in Townsville and is currently on rotation to Timor. In two weeks or so I will be seeing Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Smith and his people over in Maliana. I look forward to renewing old acquaintances. They are over there again in relation to Australia’s national interests and looking after the people of East Timor. The government have put enormous resources into making sure, as we have in the Solomon Islands, that our national interest is well supported by the Australian Defence Force. We could not allow a failed state to exist in our region and we cannot allow future failed states to exist in our region. That is why the Prime Minister’s attendance at the South Pacific leaders forum has been so important. All the nations have come together with the same common purpose and view. Australia will play its part in whatever needs to be done to ensure not only the homeland security of our country but also the security of our friendly neighbours. There has been some misinformation put about in relation to the Solomons. I am very sad to see that-the Australian Defence Force should not be used as a political tool. There have been some in the community who have not played the game and that is disappointing. There have been allegations, for example, that the allowances that our soldiers get in Timor are considerably less than what the Australian Federal Police get. Nothing could be further from the truth. I want to put that particular allegation to rest. The Australian Federal Police personnel in Timor receive an allowance of $48.85 a day. In comparison, ADF personnel receive a daily allowance of $55 in recognition of the Solomons operational environment as determined by the Chief of the Defence Force, not by the government. Contrary to the assertion that police officers are better off because they are entitled to tax-free salaries, AFP, APS and ADF personnel deployed to the Solomon Islands are all entitled to the same tax treatment under the tax act-let us be very clear about that. In relation to the claim that the ADF members are not allowed to move around, there is a very good reason for that. The commanders have determined that it is not wise to have too many uniforms in the wrong places. Whilst the commander there has now allowed some of the troops into Honiara, it is done on a rotational and managed basis so that it does not present the wrong view to those who are in the Solomon Islands. In relation to ration packs, there was the claim that the members of the Defence Force had to eat hard ration packs while the memMAIN COMMITTEE bers of the AFP were basically doing it very nicely, thank you very much, with fresh food. Before the soldiers left Townsville they were told and they understood that they would have to go onto hard ration packs until it was prudent to make other arrangements. Those other arrangements have now been made and the soldiers are able to have fresh food. That will be ongoing. But make no mistake about it: when it comes to operational matters the ADF will do what needs to be done in the interests of mounting a proper operation. They are not going to take the way out which says, ‘First and foremost, when you go to a foreign country we will have toffee and ice-cream for you.’ The ADF does not work like that and nor do they expect it. It is to their very great credit that the members of the ADF are indeed so professional. I would like to indicate that as well as being a centre for the Army and the Air Force Townsville is also a very important port for Navy ships, principally the Manoora, the Kanimbla and the Tobruk. The LPAs in particular-the Manoora and the Kanimbla-have been to Townsville so many times this year, taking heavy lift equipment out of Townsville to the Solomons and elsewhere, that there is a case to be made for the Manoora and the Kanimbla to be home ported in Townsville. I have raised this before, and currently the Navy has decided that the Manoora and the Kanimbla should be forward based in Townsville, meaning that it is likely that they could be tied up for 75 days a year. With the way that the Manoora and the Kanimbla have been supporting the 3rd Brigade in Townsville-the 3rd Brigade is their major customer-it is probably sensible to base those two ships in Townsville and to establish a Navy base. It is high time that Defence considered that. That would save running up and down the coast in the way these ships do going back down to Sydney, where they are currently home boarded. It is high time to move them to the North, because that is where their need is and where their customer is. I will be again raising with Defence the prospect of home porting the Manoora and the Kanimbla in Townsville, and I hope that I will get a favourable response from Defence in that regard. I, too, hope that it will not be too long before we see the 2nd Battalion back home in Townsville. As I said, they have had a very busy year, and they will go back to being the online battalion in the not too distant future when the 1st Battalion returns to Townsville. They are doing a mighty job. All Australians are proud of what the ADF have been able to do in the Solomons, the very efficient way in which they have been able to do it and the results we have been getting. There is every confidence that the deployment will be of a shorter rather than a longer duration. In closing, I would like to pay a tribute to the sometimes forgotten members of the ADF team-that is, the families who remain at home. I thank them for their support of their partners and spouses by remaining in good spirits back home in Townsville. I hope that we will be able to reunite families in the not too distant future. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (5.51 p.m.)-I also rise to support the Prime Minister’s motion for intervention in the Solomons by Australian police and defence personnel as part, fortunately, of a combined regional support force. That this intervention was the result of a formal request from the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Allan Kemakeza, and was formally endorsed by his parliament is of some comfort for us in the opposition that this time the government got the process right. This decision, unlike the one taken to engage in war in Iraq, means that intervention takes place as a direct result of a majority-supported request from the parliament of the Solomon Islands, within the context of public support for the restoration of confidence in the state by its citizens and its regional neighbours. Law and order is MAIN COMMITTEE definitely the key to building a prosperous, safe and fair society. Without law and order and some governance certainties, domestic strife, crime and corruption do grow and good people can be forced to look the other way. Eventually, we were observing a once proud and strong society fragmenting with sadness and fear. This intervention is significant and will not be free of difficulties and sacrifice. But just what has occurred to make this intervention necessary? It is possible to detail the historical events in the Solomons that reflect the decline in statehood, but it is also important to study Australia’s role and responsibilities in that decline and in its restoration. Security in the Solomons declined steadily following the emergence of ethnically driven violence on the island of Guadalcanal in 1998 particularly. The tension arose from the Guadalcanal people’s resentment of the influence of settlers from other islands, particularly Malaita. By mid-1999 the Guadalcanal militants had taken control of the countryside around Honiara. This violence triggered an exodus of some 20,000 Malaitan settlers back to Malaita. In June 1999 a state of emergency was declared and, in spite of the Honiara peace accord, law and order continued to deteriorate. In 2000, after a military coup, the Townsville Peace Agreement was signed after talks assisted by New Zealand and Australia. A peace monitoring council was formed to enforce that agreement, and in 2001 observed elections saw Sir Allan Kemakeza elected Prime Minister. In spite of his early reform efforts, the finance minister, Laurie Chan, resigned on 7 December 2002 in protest against the cabinet’s decision to pay $6.2 million in response to extortion demands from local police. Throughout this period of instability, the economy of the Solomon Islands rapidly declined. Per capita GDP was halved from a high of $US1,000 in 1996 to below $US500 in 2002. The total amount of public debt that the Solomon Islands bears at the moment is estimated at some $2 billion in their local currency. After Laurie Chan’s resignation, the Solomon Islands government considered replacing the Prime Minister. I was in the Solomon Islands, as part of a delegation led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, the very day that was being considered by the Solomon Islands parliament. Even as a relatively new backbencher then, the evidence of our neglect of our relationship with our Pacific neighbour was evident. The minister and his parliamentary secretary had perhaps come too late, too infrequently, after doing too little. The tension in Honiara on that December day in 2002 was palpable, with an atmosphere of unrest and anticipation of imminent violence. Honiara appeared to me, as a visitor, as a maledominated city-too many young men, with too much time on their hands, little money, no work, spasmodic education and very little to do. A casino and betel nut were perhaps the main distractions. As part of the delegation I visited our aid projects, ranging from the Community Peace and Restoration Fund program to the Lighthouse Rehabilitation Resource Centre for adult literacy. In both places I saw genuinely hard working people with great motives and motivation, but they were certainly constrained by some of our requirements in aid. It was sad to see a Community Peace and Restoration Fund program perhaps dominated by the bureaucratic demands of paperwork and strategic plans; one wondered whether that was really the way to achieve the best outcomes. At the Lighthouse Rehabilitation Resource Centre, where adult literacy was a major goal, I saw happy people working very proudly to attain some outcomes, but I MAIN COMMITTEE also saw teaching aids that would have had very little success and which were very inappropriate. At the Honiara hospital there was great dedication by our aid workers who were assisting with record keeping and administration, but it was obvious that resources were low and that hygiene standards were lower than we would expect. That the fracture clinic dealt mainly with beaten women was a sad reflection of the disharmony in that local community. During that visit the female MPs spoke with women leaders who told us of their difficulties in becoming involved in governance in their country. With a high birth rate-an average of five or six children is common in families, with nine, 10 or up to 12 in some village communities-women have a primary role in maintaining family life and therefore have few opportunities to be involved at the decision making end of that community life. However, it is women who have a real vested interest in restoring harmony within their communities and who are generally the community builders and peacemakers. I hope that our continuing Australian aid projects in the Solomon Islands attempt to give more opportunities to women to participate in the rebuilding of their nation’s strength. The Solomon Islands is one of our nearest neighbours. It is only three hours flying time from Brisbane. Over the past five years, sadly, it has become a nation in decline, suffering a political and security crisis which has stifled its economy, disrupted our aid programs and donations and inflicted hardship and much suffering on its people. But there have always been many strategic imperatives for Australia in maintaining a strong relationship, one of mutual benefit including humanitarian, economic, security and diplomatic concerns. The Solomon Islands’ dive towards state failure has been evident for some time and it has been evident that they have needed our help. I strongly support this motion because I know how much it is needed. More aid has never been a solution. Withdrawing aid under threat was also not a solution. Building a strong and respectful diplomatic relationship has always been essential and that takes a great deal of effort, consistency, trust and certainly respect. This new approach that we have seen in the Solomons has been needed, and I was delighted to see the recent Pacific Islands Forum signalling that some of this will be a lasting beginning which will be beneficial-and jointly beneficial to our Solomon Islands neighbours. It will be beneficial because it has that joint control and involvement and genuine cooperation and consultation. Australia must not be seen as a benevolent colonial type, interfering in the domestic policies of other countries. There is no room for paternalism and we must avoid the perils of neo-colonialism. We must intervene in a way that is appropriate to the interests of the Solomon Islands and to our national interest as well. Reform is essential. Some of the reforms discussed at the Pacific forum are being fleshed out in the right way. Good ideas have been put forward. No-one has accepted anything they felt uncomfortable with. There is a great opportunity for pooling of economic resources. There will be an opportunity for regional training. The approach to establish a college to train a regional police force, should it be successful, will be a great measure that has arisen from this forum. It is better, though, to assist with the basics first. The basics are, of course, law and order. Cooperation in other ventures can perhaps come later. The appointment of Greg Irwin as the next Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum has been welcomed. Fortunately, consensus does exist that he has the correct diplomatic creMAIN COMMITTEE dentials and genuine regard from within the region. His brief is to reform the regional organisation of the forum that has existed for three decades and its secretariat. The opposition encourage him and congratulate him on his appointment. We clearly cannot tolerate deviations from this important initiative and agenda, but we certainly must make sure we continue our aid programs and that anticorruption measures are built into those in the right way. The outcome should always be important in judging and funding our aid projects. Currently, assisting the sense of self-determination and sovereignty that our neighbour the Solomon Islands aspires to is paramount. Sustaining the national pride that that country has always had is important. When I was in the Solomons there was an amazing contrast between the very remote islands and the sad situation in the city. We must show our respect for the cultural independence of our island neighbour but realise that we cannot stand by and watch any longer the decline and deterioration that can result, as we know, in corruption and crime. The government and the opposition have shared real concerns that that decline could result in organised gun running, money laundering and other crime-and even assist the efforts of terrorism in our region. We congratulate the Pacific forum. It has set a new check list of good governance, and that has been accepted. It asked the governments in its member countries to respect the rule of law and democratic institutions and to display honesty in dealing with their people and their legislature. Those are noble ideals. The forum has endorsed the Australian led intervention and decided to establish the regional police training initiative, with Australia being a major contributor. Multilateral cooperation is a better model and one that the Labor Party have always endorsed. We have seen success in Cambodia, Bougainville and East Timor from this approach and we are pleased that it is guiding the Solomon Islands intervention process now. There has been discussion of the need for some standing regional forces to be set up. That is something that requires very careful negotiation. It can only be initiated at the will and with the agreement of our Pacific neighbours. It must have a role in assisting them with crises of all kinds, particularly as that area is prone to the problems of weather extremes. The real task now is to help each nation of our Pacific region to maintain their identity and independence through stronger mutual involvement in and cooperation with all nations in the region. Pacific nations will need to be convinced that Australia’s agenda is supporting Pacific foreign policy, not our own independent foreign policy or one dependent on existing alliances. It will take a sustained and comprehensive multinational effort-and we are hoping that that is what we will see-to solve the violence and corruption, and restore order and safety. But we must be prepared this time to make a sustained effort. We cannot be there for the short haul; we must be there for the long haul. We in the opposition praise the Australian Federal Police and our military personnel who have been sent to the Solomons. We are proud of our forces and know that they act with integrity. However, I support Senator Evans’s comments that there are issues of treating our forces with consistency and equity. It is true that the Australian soldiers in the Solomon Islands are being paid much less than their police colleagues while on this assignment; $56 per day for our defence personnel compared with $166 per day for their police comrades cannot be building harmony at the moment. There are no tax concessions on those salaries either. I urge the government to consider that our defence forces make a marvellous contribution and give very unselfishly. It is time we considered that they have been under great strain for some time. MAIN COMMITTEE I would also just like to make special mention of Dr Chris Miller, a Newcastle doctor, who is now in the Choiseul province as a primary health care administrator. He is supported by generous donations from the people of Newcastle. I think three containers of medical equipment have already been sent over-all donated and all assisted locally. I know that Chris is being received very well by the community of which he is now a part. He details in some of his emails the problems with TB-a disease which we have perhaps forgotten about but which is very real in that community. Finally, I support the motion and praise the involvement of New Zealand in negotiating towards this outcome. Obviously our New Zealand neighbour is very highly regarded by Pacific nations for its integrity. I wish our forces and our personnel a safe return and, of course, I wish peace, harmony and a strong nation state for the people of Solomon Islands. and Community Services) (6.06 p.m.)-The member for Newcastle has given a neat summary of the sequence of events which has led to the impasse and the crisis which preceded Australia’s leadership of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. It is perhaps sad that it takes these moments of crisis to force members and senators in this place-and perhaps Australians more generally-to a more intimate understanding of the special circumstances and challenges faced by our neighbours. I suppose the whole human race suffers from an intrinsic tendency towards self-centredness and towards the squeaky wheel. We need to move towards an attitude of greater engagement and an active building of human relationships with all of our Pacific neighbours, who have suffered in the past from the smallness of their size and the remoteness of their geography. The nation of Solomon Islands would constitute about three electorates in this federal parliament in terms of population. Nonetheless, when even a very small neighbour goes through a period of crisis, which some in diplomatic circles describe as verging on becoming a non-state, the whole world feels it. Even at this great distance, we feel it. It demonstrates, in a way, that the whole of humanity is in fact connected. The hand cannot say to the foot, ‘You are not a part of this body.’ When one part feels pain and injury, the whole body feels it. That injury has been growing in Solomon Islands-in particular since December 1998, which saw the formation of the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army. Members may be aware that Solomon Islands is an archipelago made up of a vast number of coral atolls and uninhabited and inhabited islands. Although it has a population of only 500,000, it is serviced by 30 airports and boasts 120 indigenous languages. That, I think, is an expression of the geographical isolation and remoteness of these small settlements dotted across the archipelago. For different reasons, Papua New Guinea likewise has a vast number of languages and different tribal and clan groupings, which has made the formation of a unified nation state a very great challenge. We in this country, having in effect completely marginalised the small Indigenous population of Australia, have had the benefit of a largely ethnically, linguistically and religiously homogenous population for the first 160 years of our existence as a modern nation. Of course, the Solomon Islands is not in that fortunate position. So, as the people of Malaita converged in search of employment and access to services around the capital of Honiara in the Guadalcanal Province, we saw growing tensions between the two ethnic groups. These tensions began with relatively innocuous skirmishes and expressions of criminal behaviour. MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Solomon Islands
412,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for FamilyI recently spoke with some Solomon Islanders who said that when the troubles first started they just assumed it was a few of the boys playing up. They never imagined that a mere five years later their country would be coming to the attention of the world as a consequence of the civil war which has brought the small island nation to its knees. The signature form of engagement and the particular method of killing in the strife that developed between the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army-which subsequently became the Isatabu Freedom Movement-and what was then called the Malaita Eagle Force was the decapitation of victims by machete, which of course struck terror throughout these communities. As a consequence we saw the economy go into freefall and the cash agricultural crops collapse because markets could not be found, and travel between and on the islands became impossible. I recently had a Solomon Islander in my office who talked, with a beaming smile, about the fact that since the arrival of the regional assistance mission, led by Australia, for the very first time he was able to get a taxidriver to drive him from Honiara to his village up on the ridges in the hills surrounding that capital city. It is difficult for us to visualise the challenges and problems faced by this country, which even in peacetime faced significant policy dilemmas, such as the dying of the coral reefs which surround the island, long-term problems of deforestation as the pressure for cash crops became great, and problems of soil erosion. To those natural environmental challenges were added violence, lawlessness, the tendency for extortion, the compromising of the police force and of most of the organs of government, the emergence of organised criminal gangs, the assassination of prominent figures active in the peace movement, the closure of banks, and the freefall of the economy. We are now engaging in this. It has been suggested that we did too little, too late; in fact, to be fair to the government, Australia has been quite actively engaged in this process for some time. It was aboard the HMAS Tobruk in July 2000 that the ceasefire was first negotiated, which subsequently led in October 2000 to the signing of the Townsville Peace Agreement. Australia was very active in providing monitors, along with numerous other states, for the elections which took place in December 2001 at which a mere 12 out of the 50 incumbents were re-elected. At that election, Sir Allan Kemakeza was elected to again lead the Solomon Islands as Prime Minister. By all accounts he is working with great industry to try and stabilise the situation, with the help of the regional assistance mission. Australians sometimes will express a patronising frustration with the apparent institutional incapacity of the Solomon Islands to get their act together, but in debating a motion such as this we ought to acknowledge that we do not come to the debate with entirely clean hands. I cite merely one example. It was Alvaro de Medana, the Spanish explorer who first discovered gold 400 years ago at the mouth of the Mataniko River in the Solomons. That deposit, according to most estimates, has the capacity to provide 30 per cent of the gross domestic product of Solomon Islands. In fact, an enterprising Australian company, Ross Mining, responded to the government tender to develop the resource and in the end was successful after an exhaustive process involving negotiations with 21 clans and 600 signatories and the establishment of an excellent relationship with the Gold Ridge landowners association, who, under the agreement that was finally negotiated, were given a guarantee of 1.2 per cent of the production of the mine regardless of the profitability of the mining company. That mine stands idle today, with the millions of dollars of expenditure that Ross Mining had made gone completely to waste, not because of bickering among the landowners but very MAIN COMMITTEE largely because of the actions of an Australian law firm acting in support of an unscrupulous businessman, Denis Reinhardt, supported by Slater and Gordon out of Brisbane, who worked for three years to frustrate every attempt to open the mine, primarily because their client wanted the contract to provide the mine with electricity. In a matter that was determined at first instance and then appealed and appealed again to the Solomons appeals court-a matter heard by Sir Anthony Mason, a former judge of the High Court in Australia-this Australian law firm was guilty of a range of tortious actions in maintaining a legal action for the improper purpose of seeking to gain revenue from the outcome. At a time when we are critical of Solomon Islanders for their obsession with compensation and with a ‘cargo cult’ mentality, it is deeply regrettable that respected Australian law firms have been setting that kind of example. So today a resource worth potentially a third of the entire gross domestic product of this country is lying in desuetude. I conclude by making a few remarks about how Australia ought to constructively engage in the rebuilding of this small island neighbour of ours. Other speakers have referred to the dangers of a colonial or postcolonial mentality of paternalism, of patronising an island people. On the other hand, it is perhaps true that, out of fear of the accusation of imperial, arrogant behaviour, we have tended not to be engaged enough in the affairs of our island neighbours. Somehow we have to find a balance which involves a high level of institutional and human engagement with our neighbours but which at the same time does not convey arrogance from the leading and largest economy in the region. We have to find ways to strengthen the institutions of Solomon Islands without a blanket template imposition of Australian values, traditions and structures. I note that The World Factbook describes the system of government in the Solomon Islands as a ‘parliamentary democracy tending towards anarchy’. It must be our hope that, over the decades ahead, the people of the Solomons can make their parliamentary democracy a truly indigenous institution, that the police force can be characterised by consistency and integrity, that the economy can be restored to some measure of stability and prosperity, and that the natural resources of the Solomons, which are in some abundance, can be effectively harnessed in an environment of peace and respect for the rule of law. We ought to begin this most recent chapter in the engagement between Australia and the Solomons with a recognition that we do not have 20/20 vision, we do not have the answers to all the problems and we have not had a record of sparkling success in standing alongside our Pacific neighbours in a non-patronising but actively engaged leadership role that allows them to strengthen their own institutions in their own way while moving towards a position of stability and the freedoms which come from the rule of law, which we all take for granted in this country. I commend the motion, and support and acknowledge the level of expertise and interest that my colleagues have demonstrated so far. tion members, I am supporting the government in this initiative. We welcome the initiative. We believe it to be in our own best national interest. Earlier in the debate, when I was in the House, there were a couple of issues raised to do with personnel that I thought I should deal with. Firstly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the ADF troops there now were no longer getting ration packs and were getting fresh food. I welcome that and I am pleased about that. The honourable member for Herbert seemed to think that it MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Solomon Islands
413,Mr Price (Chifley) (6.21 P.m.),"Firstly, I want to make it very clear that, like all opposiwas okay that the Australian Federal Police and others in the Solomon Islands should be getting fresh food and the troops getting MRE meal packs, because, before they departed, the troops were told that that is what they would be getting for three weeks. That may be the case, but the honourable member for Herbert usually displays a greater keenness for the welfare of troops than that comment reflects. The other point I would make is that there is a degree of controversy about the relative pay of the Australian Federal Police, who are receiving $170 a day in allowances and concessions, and the ADF personnel, who are receiving $55 a day. There is a difference of about $120 a day. As I understand it, the defence people are saying that, given the nature of the deployment, $55 a day is the appropriate ADF allowance. I am happy to accept that reassurance, but we do have a problem, because our troops are more likely, I think, to face a hazardous engagement. After all, that is why they were sent there in such numbers; it was not merely for display, although there is some display. They are there for real engagement, although hopefully that will not be required. We do have a problem when there is this anomaly. I do not think it is good enough for the government to dismiss it in the way that they have. We need to sit down and work out a system that appears to reflect relative justice to all those that are there. I am not saying the police do not deserve the money they are receiving. That is not my argument. My argument is that, if we have two groups of people there doing very important work, there should be a measure of wage justice. Please do not so easily explain it away. While I am on that, can I say that the hallmark of this government is to deploy troops to situations without a defined time line for their deployment and a defined exit strategy. That causes me concern. I raise this not in a really partisan way. I raise this as someone who knows only too well that in Rwanda and Somalia people pleaded with us to stay but we said, ‘This is what we’re sending our troops for. This is what they’re expected to achieve. This is when they’ll be pulling out’-and they did. I accept that there is difficulty in transitioning a situation from that heavy reliance on troops to a more normal situation. It is not easy to achieve but unless we put these time lines on we put out troops’ lives at risk. I would say that I am probably a little bit the odd one out within the Labor Party about my concerns for East Timor. I have always taken the view that the only people who can bank on future security are really the Indonesians. We need to build up the in-house capability of Timor Leste but, most particularly, push the relationship and the dialogue and the understanding. In East Timor, again our troops are going to have their allowances halved. Madam Deputy Speaker, you may say that is fair enough as the situation is very different from when they were first there and, after all, we are shortly to draw down from over 1,000 troops to a ‘company group’ of about 383 troops-and that is going to happen. But what I do not think is clearly understood by the Australian people is that their area of responsibility is going to increase by a third. So we are reducing our troops by two-thirds but at the same time we are increasing the area of responsibility by one-third and we are cutting their pay in half. It is predicated on the assumption or belief that East Timorese are going to be able to take over some of the functions. I am not in a position to talk about that. I regret to say-and I have said it to some of my colleagues, not being one of these smart people that always have this great hindsight-that on the recent Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade trip to East Timor we did not speak with the East MAIN COMMITTEE Timorese and we did not speak to the UN about their assessment of the ability for these functions to be taken over. So what am I saying? I am saying that, like all Australians, I hope things go well and on track, but there are possibilities that they may not. That is a concern to me. This deployment of troops to the Solomons is very necessary. I do not argue about it, but what is the time line? We know that we are going to have an involvement in the Solomon Islands for some years, but how long are we going to have the troops there? What are the preconditions for bringing them out? When will they come out? I cannot answer those questions. If there is a government member here that can provide those answers, I would be very pleased if they would. While I am talking about these things, I want to put on the public record that in recent times no government has asked more of the ADF in the national interest and the pursuit of government policy. I believe the ADF has responded magnificently. However, I also think that the ADF is dreadfully stretched and none more so than Army. We now have the absurd proposition where Army is saying that it is government policy not to support the 1-1-1 principlethat is, one unit deployed, one resting and one training up. That has been rejected. We have five reserve brigades and we now have a combat company out of each reserve brigade-that is one 100 people, if we are using 100 as a number; numbers are always rubbery in Army. Out of more than 3,000 troops, you get 100-a company brigade-and they are supposed to be the combat element that will provide assistance in protecting buildings and in a general protection role. Having a defined role for reserves is great, but a few years ago I was advised that the training and proficiency required for the protection role were not as high as they were for regular soldiers. That troubles me. We are also using the five brigades to provide slots for the Army-the so-called slot theory: where there is a deficiency, you pluck someone out of the reserve and put them into full-time service to provide slots. That has proved to be useful, but at the end of the day, if you are spending nearly $1 billion-$950 million-on your army reserve, you want to get more than five companies out of it. I should also add that they are blended companies; they are not formed units. So you will not necessarily have a full platoon or a company stationed at one depot; you will have bits and pieces spread all over the place, and they will be blended to make that company. How you get training proficiency on an individual basis or with one or two people working together defies my belief; I have not seen the military theory that supports that. If you are spending $950 million on the reserves, you need to do a lot more than that. Under the Howard government, we have never had a ministerial statement about the reserves. I have spoken in the House about-I will be guarded in my language-the change to high-readiness reserves and all that. We have not had one ministerial statement on the combat reserve. As a member of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, I can say to the House that I have pleaded time and time again to see the sustainability model of Army, because I have significant doubts about what it is currently premised on. We are currently doing an inquiry into Australia’s maritime strategy. We cannot get-but we have asked for-threat assessments. You cannot judge the strategy-not that we want to be critical-if you cannot get the threat assessments. These are concerning things. I have said in the past that the very success of the ADF can lead to problems of complacency, of resisting the urge to change. With defeat comes the neMAIN COMMITTEE cessity to change. Our very success-and I am one to hail the success-brings with it problems with regard to properly reforming the place. I apologise that I have strayed into broader defence issues, rather than speaking about the Solomon Islands initiative. I just remind government members that the previous government had a junior minister responsible for Pacific island affairs. I am not saying that it is the absolute panacea to all the problems, that it is the ultimate solution, but I think that it is an appropriate thing to contemplate, especially as in the Constitution the federal government was given exclusive responsibility for Pacific island affairs. The now Minister for Foreign Affairs, when in opposition, was always accusing us of taking our eye off PNG. Ironically, I guess, the problems have developed in the South Pacific. The Solomons are considered to be a failed state. I regret to say that there are other countries which, if we do not call them failed states, are at least in a very worrying condition. Hopefully, this will be a model of regional cooperation and of Australian initiative and partnership with countries in our region that will bring long-term and sustainable-that is the key pointbenefits to our region and in particular to the 500,000 people who comprise the Solomon Islands. I commend the paper to the House. by the Prime Minister regarding the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. It is important to highlight at the outset that all parties in the parliament have expressed their support for Australia’s mission in the Solomons. The Leader of the Opposition left us in no doubt last Tuesday as to Labor’s strong bipartisan support for the regional intervention force and for the processes by which the decision to commit Australia’s resources was taken. I also note Mr Crean’s acknowledgment of the fact that the Prime Minister had briefed the opposition on the government’s plans. In the Senate, the foreign affairs spokesman for the Australian Democrats and the leader of the Australian Greens both reported their support for the motion. This is indeed an important example of cross-parliamentary support for a government initiative that bodes well for the success of the mission. Criminal lawlessness cannot be tolerated in any society. In the Solomon Islands, such lawlessness has created the basis for a social and political failure. It has manifested itself in an upsurge of kidnapping, murder and torture, as criminal elements in that community fight amongst themselves. Police have been unable to control the criminal element and innocent people have been caught up in a situation which is not of their making and which has assumed such proportions that the Solomon Islands parliament has called for assistance. The Solomon Islands is one of Australia’s closest neighbours, and over the past five years its political and economic life has descended into a deep crisis. The government has found it nigh impossible to maintain the functions of public service and public administration. The Solomon Islands people have undergone suffering and hardship, and the situation has been exacerbated by the doubts of international donors that aid can any longer be used effectively. Australia and other Pacific nations were confronted with the reality that inaction on their part will almost certainly allow further disintegration of public order and allow the prospect of any semblance of government in this small and vulnerable nation to disappear. This difficult situation has emerged from a troubled national history. After the Second World War, control of the islands reverted to Britain and the formal machinery of national government was established. What failed to develop in the intervening two decades before MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Solomon Islands
414,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (6.35 P.m.),"I wish to speak in support of the motion movedindependence was granted in 1978 were the institutions and ethos needed for effective self government. This led to a feeling that is still widely held amongst Solomon Islanders that, because it was so poorly prepared for independence, the country was not given a decent chance right from the start. During the 1980s and later, Solomon Islands governments were characterised by their erratic use of government resources, and in fact corruption did become endemic. Not surprisingly, people began to lose confidence in government and the formal political processes of that country. Disputes between ethnic groups over land provided the genesis for the current high malaise. Since the war, people from the island of Malaita have progressively moved to the island of Guadalcanal to work in agriculture and urban jobs in Honiara, including the public service. Resentment grew as the Malaitans intermarried and bought up land from traditional landowners on Guadalcanal. Without rehashing this long history, the bottom line is that, in 1998, tension escalated out of control and clashes between the two sides resulted in significant casualties. The government was unable to maintain law and order, particularly as armed police had split and taken sides along ethnic lines. Tourist resorts, the main palm oil plantations and the Gold Ridge goldmine-in fact, all of the country’s key export earners-ceased operating. Without adequate revenue, government services faltered. Foreign nationals were evacuated as armed gangs roamed the streets. Despite local Solomon Islands women’s, church and youth groups working to establish a more settled environment, a gang culture took root in parts of the country, especially in and around Honiara and on the south-west coast of Guadalcanal, the Weather Coast. The culture of corruption deepened; government credibility and authority eroded and the economy effectively collapsed. GDP fell by 14 per cent in 2000 and 10 per cent in 2001. It has halved in real terms since independence in 1978, while population has grown at the rate of 3.3 per cent per year. The statistics since 2001 are usually marked by blanks and N/As. Exports fell 60 per cent in the five years to 2001. Some of the problems of governing the Solomon Islands were poignantly outlined by the Solomon Islands foreign minister following the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in June. He said: You’re looking at the economy ... You’re looking at Treasury being harassed and intimidated. You’re looking at Cabinet not being able to meet in its Cabinet. We’d have to go into different locations for it. You’re looking at militants shooting at the Prime Minister’s house ... there’s a whole bunch of problems we have that we need to address. And anything, any prerequisite for economic recovery, must look at the law and order situation. This recitation of problems reveals a cluster of characteristics of a state verging on failure. The risk, as the Prime Minister has said, is that if this downward spiral is not arrested the result could be ‘the total collapse of Solomon Islands’ governance and sovereignty’. There is good neighbourliness in the mission to the Solomons, but the reality is that there is a great deal of enlightened self-interest as well. In recent years we have developed an increasingly acute awareness of the potential danger that failed states pose not only to their own citizens but also to the international community. A study published in The Washington Quarterly says: ... failing or failed states draw terrorists, where the breakdown of authority gives them the ability to conduct their operations without risk of significant interference. MAIN COMMITTEE Failed states offer a place where terrorist organisations can conduct training, store arms, base communications facilities and develop businesses to generate income for terrorist acts. Terrorist organisations and organised crime networks can establish transshipment points for drugs, weapons and money. Ineffective or non-existent law enforcement permits terrorist groups and criminal groups to engage in smuggling, drug trafficking and other activities which provide the funds for terrorist operations. Weapons held by the armed forces of the failed state may fall or be transferred into the hands of terrorists. Indeed, in the Solomons, a police armoury was raided and weapons were stolen. Thus, to the humane concern for the well-being of citizens of failing states, the association between failed states and transnational crime and terrorism adds a very real security imperative for intervening to stop the failure of sovereign nation states. Australia’s aid to the Solomons has almost trebled in the last five years, from $13.2 million in 1998-99 to an estimated $37.4 million in 2003-04. This has had a positive impact-for example, it has increased government revenue and kept rudimentary health services across the country running. Australia helped to broker the Townsville Peace Agreement in 2000 and was a key contributor to the international peace monitoring team overseeing the agreement’s implementation. When the situation deteriorated dramatically earlier this year and the Solomons sought strengthened assistance, the Australian government was willing to provide it on three conditions: firstly, that the Pacific Islands Forum supported the initiative; secondly, that there was a formal request from the Solomon Islands for assistance; and, thirdly, that legislation was enacted in the Solomons to authorise the presence of external personnel. At the meeting in Sydney on 30 June, ministers representing all 16 Pacific Islands Forum countries agreed: ... the extent of the problems facing the Solomon Islands now called for a concerted regional response, as envisaged by the Biketawa Declaration. They unanimously: ... endorsed the provision of a package of strengthened assistance to the Solomon Islands including a policing operation to restore law and order, supported, as required, by armed peace-keepers and a program of assistance to strengthen the justice system and restore the economy and basic services. This regional commitment is a significant one for Australia. As the Prime Minister has said: With the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, Australia has signalled it is willing, in a cooperative and collegiate way, to play a supportive, stabilising and, if it is required, more interventionist role in the region. Over and above the unanimity of purpose in the region, the mission does have United Nations endorsement. Secretary-General Kofi Annan commended the Pacific Islands Forum countries’ collective action to support the government and the people of the Solomon Islands in their quest for the restoration of law and order and stability. The Secretary-General particularly noted the leadership offered by Australia, together with New Zealand, in close partnership with other countries in the region. He emphasised that the United Nations was fully prepared to contribute actively to peace building in the Solomon Islands. So this is a mission with both regional and general international backing. The second requirement was that a formal request for assistance be made by the Solomon Islands. The Prime Minister has received such a request from the Solomon Islands Governor General on behalf of the Solomon Islands cabinet. Moreover, the Solomon Islands parliament MAIN COMMITTEE has endorsed the strengthened assistance offer. The third and final requirement was met on 17 July when the Solomon Islands parliament unanimously passed legislation giving powers and immunities to enable police and other personnel to carry out law enforcement functions. As well as being a necessary formality, this is also symbolic in a context where the mission is seeking to restore one of the essential elements of a strong and independent nation statenamely, an effective legal system. As the foreign minister has said: This intervention ... has to be done in a way that is consistent with the normal processes of Solomon Islands law. Thus, with all three of these conditions met, on 22 July the Australian government agreed to deploy the regional assistance mission, and the mission is of course now under way. The mission essentially involves two stages. The first is to stop the violence, get the guns and other weapons out of the community and restore law and order. Having restored a secure environment, the second stage is to implement economic and governance reforms, rebuild the police force, the judiciary and correctional services, stabilise government finances, ensure the delivery of basic services, undertake economic reform and rebuild the essential machinery of government. This fundamental and wide-ranging agenda is intended to provide a basis for the future independent security and prosperity of the Solomons. The strength of Australia’s commitment to restoring to the Solomon Islands peace and security and control of its own affairs is evidenced by the scale of its likely costs in terms of both money and time. The mission is estimated to cost between $200 million and $300 million annually for up to 10 years, covering the commitment of military forces-which is expected to be short term-and an expectation that the Australian Federal Police, aid officials and economic advisers may be involved in the Solomons for many years. As reported in the press today, the Australian Defence Force chief, General Peter Cosgrove, after visiting the regional intervention force, has confirmed the success of the mission so far-a success further highlighted by the events at the Pacific Islands Forum over the weekend. At the same time, General Cosgrove did underscore the need for avoiding complacency and the fact that much does need to be done. But the reality is that this early assessment is very encouraging for the mission and for the future of the Solomons. In conclusion, to all the personnel conducting this mission on the ground, from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga and Papua New Guinea, I offer my appreciation of their efforts and I offer my best wishes for their safe and successful return. I note particularly the Australian contingent of 155 Australian Federal Police, 80 Australian Protective Service personnel, 1,500 defence personnel and various government department officials. The thoughts of the whole parliament are with them and their loved ones. I commend the motion to the House. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (6.50 p.m.)-It is the accepted responsibility of developed nations to assist less fortunate nations. This is, after all, the rationale for foreign aid, of which the Australian government provides around $1.8 billion annually. The substantial proportion of that aid is spent in our immediate region, most particularly in Papua New Guinea and in the other nations of Melanesia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. This too is a given. Papua New Guinea is our former colony. There is a fraternal responsibility on our part for that nation’s future development as well as a strategic return on our investment. Similarly, Vanuatu is a former Anglo-French colony which received its independence in 1980, and the Solomons was granted independence by Britain in 1978-so far, so usual. MAIN COMMITTEE But this moment marks a turning point in a three-decade-long national approach to the Pacific islands. The Australian government has agreed to escalating calls for intervention in the Solomon Islands. Fifteen hundred Australian troops supported by 500 colleagues, including from New Zealand and Fiji, are now in the Solomon Islands to support the efforts of civilian administrators and police led by the former ambassador to Port Moresby and former ambassador for counter-terrorism, Nick Warner, to restore order to that troubled nation. In essence, Australia is now offering actions, not merely words, in response to pleas for assistance. We have not necessarily been so responsive in the past. From the Solomons alone Australia has in the past ignored governmental requests for military intervention, notably just prior to the 2000 coup in Honiara. This inaction has not necessarily been unwarranted nor has inaction been necessarily callous. The planning response to the 1987 Fijian coups revealed the significant degree to which the Australian Defence Force was incapable of deploying military force away from our shores, particularly without the support of the United States military. It is only now, after a much needed investment in the ADF capability and after the experience garnered in Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq, that such a deployment is a ready option. Thus the deployment of the civilian and military forces to the Solomons is to the government’s credit. Australian intervention signals to our friends and neighbours and to the rest of the world that we are serious about the alleviation of suffering and the defence of liberty. It must be said that there are issues of strict national interest that propel us towards preemptive action in the Solomons. One reason surely is that a failed Solomons threatens a domino effect across Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, and further afield. Another is the everpresent threat that the political vacuum in Honiara will be filled by undesirable states-for example, Libya, whose interest in neighbouring Vanuatu has long been noted-or non-state actors such as terrorist groups. The ABC has already reported the news that suspicious Pakistani nationals have been observed visiting the islands. But as Dr Robert Ayson of the ANU Strategic and Defence Studies Centre has noted, it is not, nor should it be, a narrow realism that motivates Australian intervention. We have an obligation to our neighbours to come to their aid when required. This is not paternalism; far from it. This is fraternalism. Our historical responsibilities, our shared past, our hopeful future together draw us back into the region. Five hundred thousand Solomon Islanders look to Australia for their salvation, and the world looks to us to meet that test. Not that the test in question is not difficult. I had the opportunity to join the foreign minister, along with a number of other parliamentary members, in Honiara last December, and I had the privilege to meet the resolute but embattled supporters of democracy in the Solomons both within and without government. During my visit to Guadalcanal I was shocked by a realisation that there was a sense of sheer fear from just being on the streets of Honiara, a capital wrenched by ethnic war and civil disorder in a nation bloodied by violence. We would not expect an Australian to live in such conditions and we ought not to expect our neighbours to do so. A variety of issues needed to be addressed before an intervention was green-lighted. These included, firstly, that intervention could proceed only at the instigation of and with clear support from the Solomon Islands government. Such notice was prefigured by Prime Minister Sir Allan Kemakeza, the Right Honourable Father Sir John Ini Lapli, the Right Honourable Sir Peter Kenilorea, Malaitan Premier Reuben Moli and Deputy Commissioner of the Royal MAIN COMMITTEE Solomon Islands Police Wilfred Akao. On 11 July, the parliament of Solomon Islands confirmed a formal request for assistance by the Governor General and has since passed enabling legislation to facilitate coalition operations on its islands. The intervention has the strong support of the people and government of the Solomon Islands. Secondly, it required a firm understanding of the costs. It has been estimated that a 10-yearlong civilian engagement could cost Australian taxpayers $850 million and could risk the lives of Australian soldiers and police as well as civil servants. These costs, however they have been estimated, must be considered in light of the more than $100 billion in aid to the Pacific which constitutes our response to regional dysfunction to date and the greater costs that might accrue through inaction. Thirdly, another basic requirement was multilateral support of and participation in an intervention. This does not necessarily mean the involvement of the United Nations. There is already a good general understanding on this issue among Australia, New Zealand and the other members of the South Pacific Forum as well as a broader Commonwealth concern that might include the United Kingdom in related operations. This is essentially a matter of balance between operational efficacy and the sharing of risks and costs. On 30 June, the Pacific island foreign ministers met in Sydney and unanimously agreed to support intervention. As I have already noted, Wellington and Suva have backed up that declaration with a military commitment. Fourthly, it requires the realistic provision of armed support. Given the existing situation on the islands, particularly on Guadalcanal’s Weather Coast, any multinational police force that is dispatched must be able to rely on combat-ready military backup. Late last month hostilities were apparently reopened by Harold Keke, and up to 10 local militia supporters were killed in gun battles. It is positive to note that the particular problem of Harold Keke has been resolved-he is in the custody of the intervention force. Furthermore, the effect of the civil war and the dissolution of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force has been to distribute across the community a number-possibly 1,000 or 2,000-of military style firearms. The dispatch of a 2,000-strong military component was therefore a realistic reaction to possible interference with the civilian mission, and therefore appropriate rules of engagement have been formulated and underwritten by resolution of the Solomon Islands parliament. In the first instance, the army is there to assist in the achievement of civilian goals, not vice versa. Fifthly, Australia should be prepared for a long-term commitment in the Solomons which will necessitate broader economic and governmental reforms so as to ensure the state’s future viability. We also need to reopen consideration of how Australia’s domestic policies impact on the Pacific-most particularly our immigration policy for islanders. This is important given the continuing population pressures, the need for remittances and our approach to regional trade. It seems appropriate in this instance to talk at some length about the Solomons themselves. Originally inhabited about 1,000 years before the birth of Christ, the several hundred islands spread over 645,000 square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean were discovered by the Spanish in 1568. The six largest islands of the archipelago carry the bulk of the population of 500,000. Geography is therefore a great asset and a great liability for the Solomons. Geography has given the nation a barrier from much of the trouble in the world, although it could not prevent Guadalcanal being one of the principal battlefields of World War II. MAIN COMMITTEE But the geography of the Solomons has also left their future marginal. Just one per cent of the land is arable; the rest is largely coral reef. Cyclones are usual in the summer wet season. There are only 34 kilometres of sealed road and no internal waterways or, for that matter, railways. While tourism was once a useful money-spinner, particularly from visiting American veterans, that industry has largely been destroyed by the violence. The country ranks 177th in international living standards with per capita GDP around $A780. What nonsubsistence enterprise that does exist is centred on palm oil, timber and fishing, with some mineral deposits such as gold, copper and bauxite. Literacy runs at about 62 per cent and conditions in the health system are so extreme that patients at the Honiara hospital have in the past been expected to provide their own meals. Those Solomon Islanders who are able to access a comfortable lifestyle are generally public servants. As a result, the state’s bloated wage bills have savagely eroded the national wealth. There is also a significant problem that has been identified by Australian public health professionals: demography. Nearly half of the population is aged under 30. It is the young urban men and teenagers, 80 per cent of whom are unemployed, who swell the ranks of the gunmen. Even if an educational future can be found for these youths, there must be jobs for them to go to once they leave the classroom. So why the need for military intervention in particular? The answer to this question lies back in the late 1990s. The fundamentally weak economic and social condition of the islands after independence allowed ethnic tensions to spill over into politics and eventually conflict. Since the war, many islanders from Malaita had settled on Guadalcanal, the island home to the capital, Honiara. Over time, Malaitans came to dominate the Guadalcanal economy and the public service. Interestingly, underlying much of the Guadalcanalese-Malaitan tensions was the issue of gender relations. Guadalcanalese are matrilineal in their traditions, the Malaitans patrilineal. Thus in 1998 a number of Guadalcanalese men presented demands for compensation from the government for alleged Malaitan damages. In response to refusal these men formed the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and began to seek the forced repatriation of Malaitans. By 1999 some 20,000 Malaitans had been driven into Honiara from the countryside. Others fled back to their home island. Violence intensified when the Malaitans formed the Malaitan Eagle Force, which included considerable numbers of serving police. With the police split and the government split, the country descended into anarchy. Both sides petitioned the government for ever-larger compensation. The goldmines shut, the palm oil plantations emptied and government revenue disappeared. Despite an attempt at Commonwealth mediation, the final step downwards was in 2000 when the then Prime Minister requested foreign military intervention to save his government. On5 June members of the Eagle Force openly backed by police seized the Honiara armoury. The Prime Minister was deposed and armed gangs walked the streets. Only after the Townsville Peace Agreement, brokered in October, was a ceasefire called. That has been maintained only at a cost of further reconstruction. I have not been unduly focused on the history of the Solomon Islands. I am indebted to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and their remarkable historical summary for this account. The results of the last five years have been: an unresolved ethnic war; a sidelined parliament and governor-general; numerous armed factions, including Keke, who is involved in the revolutionary army; an expectation that government can be extorted into paying off militants-in MAIN COMMITTEE early July, over 200 militants demanded goodwill payments from the Prime Minister to desist from violence; a delegitimised police force unable and on occasion unwilling to end the violence; an economy built on pyramid schemes, public service wages and foreign aid; and over 1,000-perhaps 2,000-weapons at large. The passive approach has had its successes. More money is going into building better governance practices, a neutral party from the Greater Manchester Police has been appointed to head the police and weapons have been returned under an amnesty. But the passive approach has reached its end. Only active intervention can facilitate the possibility of reconstruction and an end to the violence. In consequence, only active intervention can secure Australia’s humanitarian and strategic interests in Melanesia. To some extent, this enterprise may serve as a useful template should-God forbid-a similar exercise be required elsewhere in Melanesia in the future. I conclude by expressing my appreciation not only for the leadership of the Australian government on this matter and in particular the work of our foreign minister but also for the diligence of the Solomon Islands High Commissioner to Australia, Mr Milner Tozaka, who has done much to drive Australian interest in his homeland, and the independent policy think tank, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, whose report Our failing neighbour: Australia and the future of the Solomon Islands was released in June. That report should be required reading for all Australians interested in our foreign relations and is testament to the useful role being played by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in public debate. Despite the looming challenge in the Solomons, I am reminded of the apt comment made by the ABC’s veteran South Pacific reporter Graeme Dobell in an address to parliamentarians back in February. He said: There is no exit strategy for us in the South Pacific. After all, this is where we live. I commend the motion to the chamber. Australian government in helping to coordinate, organise and execute Operation Helpem Fren, otherwise known as the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. Operation Helpem Fren is a major undertaking. It represents a commitment by Australia, in concert with other parties throughout the region, to work in assisting the stabilisation, development and securing of the long-term democratic structures of the Solomon Islands. Government is ultimately about doing the difficult things, not the easy things. Governance is that process where a government is committed not to self-perpetuation but to the pursuit of regional and national development. This action in relation to the Solomon Islands, which follows on from actions in relation to East Timor, Fiji and Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, is about a government exercising the role of governance. It would have been easy to turn a blind eye. It would have been easy to be passive. It would have been easy to take no action. But action has been taken. In that context, I want to view this from the perspective of what is happening in the region. What we view when we look at the South Pacific and parts of South-East Asia is that there is a postcolonial challenge, and that postcolonial challenge comes in two parts. It comes, first, in relation to the legacy and, second, in relation to the responsibility. The postcolonial legacy has meant that there are effectively three issues which cover many of the states in South-East Asia and the South Pacific in our immediate neighbourhood. It is a neighbourhood that does have significant challenges. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Solomon Islands
415,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (7.05 P.m.),"I rise to give my strong support to the actions of theFirst, there are significant economic challenges both in development and in scope and viability. Many small states in a modern economy are on the verge of crossing or not crossing the threshold into viability or unviability. Secondly, we also see that there is significant social tension, whether it is in parts of Indonesia, which draws together a series of different cultures; in parts of Papua New Guinea; in the Solomon Islands, where you have the Malaitan and the Guale people; and in other microstates throughout the region. Thirdly, vying with these two facts of perilous economic viability and significant social instability in some countries-and I do not want to overstate the issue but identify it as a real and significant challenge-there is a security challenge. That security challenge is twofold. Firstly, it is about the question of internal stability-the ability of states through the governance procedures in their own countries to provide and protect the security of their internal population. Secondly, it is about external security, regional security and regional stability. We have witnessed over the last five years a very clear testimony worldwide to the fact that, where there is a vacuum in state structures, these are the places where those who are committed to instability, to using the opportunity of a vacuum, will flock. They come because they can use that as a base for actions designed to breed instability in the broader structures. That is the lesson above all else of Afghanistan: there was massive instability and a vacuum, and that was used as a base for an international terrorist organisation. When you look at the regional context, who has responsibility? We see two layers of responsibility. There is self-responsibility, and we should never, ever walk away from that notion. Those who are in government and those who have societal roles in these microstates have self-responsibility to take action. They simply cannot look to the legacy of the colonial past and abrogate their own responsibility. So a part of our role is helping to ensure that there is recognition of self-responsibility. Secondly, Australia has a role in terms of its own regional responsibilities. We do not walk away from that, because when we look at the region we see, as I mentioned earlier, significant challenges and difficulties which countries and microstates have to overcome. Three immediate ones prior to the Solomons come to mind. Firstly, with Papua New Guinea we saw the Sandline crisis, where there was an attempt to bring mercenaries into the country as a way of quelling the instability that was occurring in Bougainville. As part of that, Australia played a significant role in helping to develop, with New Zealand and other states, a binding and effective peace process which brought together the Bougainville islanders and the mainlanders from Papua New Guinea. Although the process is continuing, although it is not resolved and although there are difficulties, there has been enormous genuine progress which makes a practical difference on the ground to the lives of the people in places such as Loloho and Arawa-areas which I have been fortunate to visit and in which I have seen first-hand the challenge facing Bougainvilleans. Secondly, there is Timor. Australia played a very significant role in the process of independence, in securing the area and in the birth of the state of East Timor. Prime Minister Howard wrote to President Habibie. He wrote a letter, which was not in any way historically determined-it was a conscious choice; he could have or he could not have taken the step-in which he pushed President Habibie to offer East Timor an act of independence: a choice, a referendum, a plebiscite on its future. That was taken up. Australia then played a very significant role in the election preparation and it played a critical role in helping to put together, lead MAIN COMMITTEE and broker the United Nations peacekeeping force, INTERFET, which helped secure the peace and the long-term future of East Timor. Thirdly, Australia has helped Fiji-perhaps in a more delicate way and, fortunately, without having to resort to some form of military presence-to stabilise the government after it faced its most recent coup. Australia played a very important diplomatic role in helping to bring the parties together. Against that background of regional difficulties, there is an overlay of the global environment. Where there is regional instability, we also find developments in international security at the global level. Over the past five years, these developments have melded into the challenges we have within the region. The core change that we recognise here is that, in terms of international security, there has been the development of non-state actors. Non-state actors are groups which are committed to acting as if they were a state or to bringing down existing states or existing structures. In particular, I refer to al-Qaeda. It is a group not just with a minor vision but with a 100-year vision of an extremist globe. It is not about being Islamic; it is not about any one religion; it is a sliver extremist group which attacks, first and foremost, the mainstream of those from its own religion which it purports to represent. As a number of people have said, it betrays the religion which it purports to represent. Its vision is of a Taliban style Afghanistan writ large across the globe over a 100-year period. It has an interim 30-year goal. It has the vision of securing a base within a series of core Islamic states: Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan and Egypt. That is where it does its primary work in terms of trying to fragment the state or, if not to fragment the state, to displace the government. Either of those will help serve its purpose and provide a base. In pursuit of the 100-year vision and the 30-year milestone, it is developing staging platforms. That is where the global security element comes into the question of the Solomons, because what we see is that collapsed or collapsing states create a security vacuum. In that environment al-Qaeda and other non-state actors who seek to perpetrate acts against the existing system try and establish themselves. That is why there were two great concerns with the breakdown that occurred in the Solomons. Firstly, there was a humanitarian concern to do with stability, basic governance, human rights and the day-to-day lives of individual citizens. Secondly, on a regional level, there was a concern that this vacuum, if not filled by the international community-by a benign presence with the aim of genuinely restoring the rights and day-to-day freedoms of ordinary Solomon Islanders-would certainly be filled or be at risk of being filled by those who would seek to destabilise and use the Solomons as a base for much more malign purposes. The current conflict between the Malaitan and Guale people has led to financial collapse in the Solomon Islands. It has led to a collapse of services and it has led to a breakdown of law and order. Those two risks to society-humanitarian damage and a security vacuum-are both present and clear. In that context, Operation Helpem Fren was established at the request of the Solomon Islands Prime Minister, Sir Allan Kemakeza. Australia agreed to participate under five core conditions. The first was that there was full parliamentary support from within the Solomon Islands. That was delivered with a unanimous vote of the Solomon Islands parliament, and not without significant debate, as there should have been. The debate was real, it was full and there was genuine disagreement, but in the end there was unanimous support from the Solomon Islands for international action. Our second condition, which was a very important condition, was that there would have to be cooperation MAIN COMMITTEE with our Pacific partners. I am delighted to say that it is not just an Australian operation but that New Zealand and other nations from within the South Pacific Forum are participating in the operation. The third condition was that there would be unequivocal protection for our police personnel, who would form the basis of the operation. It is not a military operation; it is a police operation and it is an operation focused on civil administration. But underpinning that is military support to protect the police and the civil administrators. That is where it fits in. It is not a military operation primarily but a civilian and police operation. The fourth condition was not that this would be a piecemeal operation but that it would be aimed at providing comprehensive support to the Solomon Islands, and that we would address, through civil administration, their treasury, their finance, their customs and their law and order procedures and help them to build a functioning civil administration which would last long after the international presence and representation had departed. The final condition was that the operation would be confined in scope, that there would be a clear point of exit and that it would be aimed at securing and establishing a peaceful situation on the ground and allowing the country to rebuild on its own terms and through its own responsibilities. In that context, I am delighted to report, as have others, that the mission has been an outstanding success. Two of the key causes of instability-Harold Keke and Jimmy Rasta-have surrendered themselves to the police. Action is being taken to demilitarise the country. There is an amnesty on weapons, which is now drawing to a close and which has had a tremendous impact. Crime levels have dropped and civil society is gradually being restored. There is a long way to go. We are at the end of the beginning. We are no further through it than that, but the basic principles of stability have been established and provide a basis for really developing an indigenous civil society and civil administration which is capable of running the country in the long term in a way which allows people to prosper and flourish and to live a real and effective life free of the combination of threat, terror and poverty which was the true characteristic of life for many Solomon Islanders, who are magnificent, beautiful people, but who have suffered over the last five years. I commend the Australian action and I commend the motion to the House. fence Industry, Science and Personnel to say simply how proud I am of our Australian Defence Force personnel in the mission to the Solomon Islands. When we purchased the Manoora-a second-hand ship originally purchased from the United States Navy-together with the Kanimbla, as we have named them, there was a huge outpouring of criticism in the press, calling them rust buckets, saying that we had bought a pup. We bought them cheaply but the renovation was very expensive-about $300 million-yet to have bought one new vessel would have cost us around $300 million. Well do I remember visiting Forgacs shipyard in Newcastle when the ship Manoora was in dry dock. I climbed over the ship from top to bottom and saw not only the problems of rust-which certainly did exist but were able to be dealt with-but also the problems of asbestos and the tremendous job that had to be done by an Australian shipyard. It was done. Both those ships have become very much an important part of our ability to deploy. I recall that, at the time of the first Fijian coup, I was in Fiji at a meeting of the International Democrat Union. Indeed, I was sitting with Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara when it was announced that there had been a coup. I remember Bob Hawke as Prime Minister making stateMAIN COMMITTEE",147,Solomon Islands
416,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (7.20 P.m.),"I rise as a former Minister for Dements about what Australia’s intervention might be, and I remember the reaction of the Fijian paramount chiefs, who said, ‘Don’t worry about Australia; they can’t even get here’-and they were right. WellI remembered this when I was Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel; I remembered that we needed the ability, and the capacity to transport our troops to deploy. When the Manoora and the Kanimbla became operational, for the first time we had the capacity to deploy a battalion. We could load and unload them by helicopter. We could take kit. We had the ability to effectively deploy. So when I saw the Manoora being very much part of this operation, taking 600 personnel as part of the mission to the Solomon Islands, I thought of the days when I climbed over the ship that had so much work to be done to it. I felt a great sense of pride in our personnel and their ability. We have 1,500 ADF personnel currently in the Solomon Islands. There are 155 AFP personnel, and there are 90 officers from the Australian Protective Service. The effect has been quite dramatic. I think there are three more days to go until the end of the amnesty for the surrendering of guns, and I think we have already collected about 2,000 guns. Under another program we had, we gave the Solomon Islands two patrol boats. These are effective boats which we have given all around the Pacific. They are meant to help small nations protect their fishing rights and have a presence that indicates that they can protect themselves to a degree. There has been great interoperability between the ADF and the deployment of those patrol boats, and I know that one of them at least in the Solomons has been effective as part of this operation. In relation to the surrender of Keke and other leading people who have been very much responsible for the lawlessness which has prevailed in the Solomon Islands, we can take great pride in the way we have conducted the operation, which, we must remember, at all times was done by invitation, as has been pointed out by speakers in this debate earlier. We have done the right thing. We are helping a neighbour to restore law and order and to get rid of the corruption which has been like a disease. My main point in rising was to say how proud I am of our Australian personnel and the defence industry that provided the wherewithal to be able to deploy, and to stress again and again the point that I made as minister and will continue to make-that is, if we are to have a truly effective Defence Force, we must have a sustainable defence industry, which is the backup that enables us to deploy. My contribution tonight is short but the feeling of pride I have is great.
