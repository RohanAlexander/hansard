Second Reading Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (10.01 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill makes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953, the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992, and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to a number of acts, as set out in schedule 2 of the bill. An important element of the government's child-care policy is the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate. Introduced in July 1994, this cash payment helps offset child-care expenses for children while both parents are, or the sole parent is, working, studying, training or looking for work. Parents who are using child care for any of these work-related purposes can claim a rebate on the cost of formal child-care services, such as centre based long day care and family day care, or informal child care, such as care provided by nannies and baby-sitters. The child-care cash rebate is administered by the Health Insurance Commission-Medicare. The introduction of the child-care cash rebate recognises the fact that the cost of the child care is a legitimate work expense for parents in the labour force. It has improved the affordability of child care for many working parents. . This bill includes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to ensure consistency with the intentions of the scheme. The first group of amendments provide hardship provisions to assist certain groups of persons who are currently precluded from receiving the rebate but who should be entitled to the rebate. These groups are: children over the age of 13 years who have a disability or other specified special need which requires ongoing child care; parents who should be considered to have work-related commitments, such as those who are eligible for, but not in receipt of, a carer pension; and families in which one parent has a work-related commitment, but the other parent is unable to work or look after their children due to extenuating circumstances, such as a medical condition. An amendment is sought to allow carers under the age of 18 years who have specified formal child-care qualifications to register under the scheme. Further amendments are proposed to confirm in legislation that family registration is able to be backdated to the date at which the family was first eligible to register, and that the rebate can be paid when a child is absent from child care for specified reasons.",138,Adjournment Sion Records Showed That The Registered Office
227,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,"MC778 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 Finally, there are some administrative amendments proposed to rectify a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen, and to make consequential amendments to the act to bring it in line with changes to other Commonwealth legislation. These include amendments to allow the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registration is being considered. This will avoid unnecessary recoveries by government, while ensuring that individuals maintain their right to appeal against long-term decisions. Other administrative amendments are proposed to: allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the date at which they were first eligible to register; cancel family or carer registrations and recover payments when an administrative error has been made; ensure that the rebate is not paid for child-care expenses which have been, or will be, reimbursed by another agent such as an employer; clarify the eligibility of persons who are not Australian citizens by correcting the description of visa categories to bring the act into line with changes in the Migration Act; broaden the nature of courses which overseas students can be undertaking in order to be eligible for the rebate; allow the managing director of the Health Insurance Commission to delegate powers; allow the minister to have some discretion over receipting requirements; and remove technical defects in the original act. Most of the proposed amendments will be retrospective back to the introduction of the rebate on 1 July 1994, so as to provide maximum assistance to families who should have been entitled to the rebate. Whilst the financial impact of these amendments will be minimal, they serve to strengthen the original intention of the act and to clarify and facilitate certain procedural aspects of the child-care cash rebate scheme. The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are designed to correct a number of minor drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994, which established the professional services review scheme. In addition, the amendments will allow the appointment as a president of a professional services review tribunal of a person who holds or has held judicial office in a state or territory jurisdiction. Professional services review tribunals consider requests from affected practitioners for a review of a determination of a penalty-which may include the disqualification from Medicare-following a finding by a professional services review committee that the practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice. It was not realised at the time the legislation was drafted that section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act specifies that a reference in any act to the word 'office' shall be construed as a reference to an office in or for the Commonwealth. The proposed amendment corrects this oversight, which has limited significantly the number of persons who can be considered for appointment as a tribunal president. The proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are designed to correct a deficiency in the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994. That act, which gave the Health Insurance Commission the power to investigate fraud under Medicare and to deal directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions, does not allow the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized under the authority of a Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC779 search warrant for more than 60 days unless proceedings for an offence to which that material may afford evidence is instituted within that period. Although the powers of investigation legislation is modelled in large part on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has pointed out that the provision relating to the retention of seized material was based on a similar provision in an early version of the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994. That latter provision was subsequently altered to allow the retention of evidential material until the reason for its seizure no longer exists or it is decided that it is not to be used in evidence. The proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act provide for the retention of such material in similar circumstances. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has advised that, without the proposed amendments, the commission's search warrant powers are effectively unusable-not a desirable situation. The bill also empowers the Health Insurance Commission to engage in hedging of investment transactions, provide consulting, management and related services and .exercise its powers and perform its functions overseas. The commission has undertaken a number of consultancies primarily, but not exclusively, under the auspices of the World Bank. As these activities are expanding, and moving beyond the use of spare capacity in the commission's operations, it is desirable to make explicit provision to cover this activity. The Health Insurance Commission is an Australian organisation at the forefront of international best practice in the performance of its various functions. Its expertise is recognised both within Australia and internationally. The commission is in a position to perform a flagship role for Australia in areas attracting growing international attention. So far as the proposed hedging power is concerned, this is consistent with other Commonwealth legislation and has been addressed, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, to resolve any doubt about the commission's ability to enter into hedging transactions. Hedging is, of course, one of the tools necessary in a prudent and balanced investment program which includes some overseas investments. The commission operates Medibank Private in competition with other private insurers and must have available to it the same opportunities to manage the funds vested in it by its members. This bill also contains amendments to parts of the National Health Act 1953 which regulate the administration of nursing homes. The government has decided that these amendments should not await the introduction of the new Aged Care Act. The amendments to the current legislation are essential to address two immediate concerns that have been identified. The first concern relates to the complexities of the current payment system. The second concern relates to nursing homes which are able to charge increased fees to their residents and yet fail to provide the basic standard of nursing and personal care. The first concern is addressed by a series of minor amendments that relate to the simplification of the nursing home payment system. Many of the criticisms of the administration of this program relate to the complexity of the current system. Both the November 1994 report of the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee on the validation of CAM and SAM funding of nursing homes and the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 19: 1994-95 Efficiency audit-validation of nursing home funding acknowledge the complexities of the current system and have identified problems which have arisen as a direct result of these complexities. For example, the Auditor-General has identified problems MC 780 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 in the delivery of appropriate information to nursing home proprietors relating to the Commonwealth's requirements for the payment of benefits. As these simplification measures can be legally achieved by changes to subordinate legislation-that is, the nursing homes financial arrangements principles, a disallowable instrument-it is proposed to proceed down this path. This would allow simplification to proceed quickly and therefore result in a clear and demonstrable response to one of the concerns of the Auditor-General. The introduction of these simplification measures will not result in any change in the entitlement of nursing home proprietors to Commonwealth benefits. These measures will not result in any change to the level of advances paid to nursing home proprietors. The simplification measures will make it easier for a nursing home proprietor to see how the level of Commonwealth benefit was calculated. The current daily calculation of 'loadings', under or over expenditure of amounts paid for nursing and personal care, and OCRE, other cost reimbursed expenditure, will cease and these amounts will be included in the level of advance payment on a monthly basis. These amounts will no longer form part of the 'scale of fees' determined under subsection 40AA(6) but will be included in calculation of the 'notional scale of fees' determined under section 46D of the act. The amendments to sections 40AD, 40ADA and 51A of the act are consequential to the above simplification measures. These amendments will preserve the right of a nursing home proprietor to seek a 'merits review' of the decision as to how much Commonwealth benefit is advanced under section 51A. An aggrieved nursing home proprietor will continue to be able to seek the referral of an appeal to the Nursing Homes Fees Review Committee of Inquiry of a decision on the level of Commonwealth benefit paid under section 51A. The retention of a right of 'merits review' is essential to ensure that unnecessary and costly appeals to the courts are circumvented. The second concern is addressed by a series of minor amendments that relate to nursing homes which have been granted 'exempt bed status.' Recent newspaper reports relating to the compliance of nursing homes with the standards made under section 45D of the act have highlighted an anomaly in the current legislation. The anomaly is that the current provisions of the act do not enable the revocation or suspension of 'exempt bed status' for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing home care. The anomaly must be immediately addressed and the amendments contained in the bill will overcome this concern. The granting of an 'exempt bed status' under section 39AB of the act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting 'exempt bed status' is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available at a nursing home. It is clearly incongruous to continue to allow a nursing home to charge additional amounts for a supposed increased level of accommodation and services, when the level of nursing and personal care fails to meet the basic standards. The amendments contained in this bill provide the power to suspend or revoke the 'exempt bed status' of a nursing home where there is a declaration in force, under subsection 45E(l), that the nursing home does not satisfy the standards determined under section 45D of the act. The amendments make it clear that while the 'exempt bed status'of a nursing home is suspended, or revoked, a proprietor will be unable to charge the increased level of fees that would otherwise be payable by the nursing homes' patients. Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 781 It should be noted that the exercise of this new power will only occur where there are serious breaches of the section 45D standards. The decision to suspend the 'exempt bed status' of a nursing home wiil be made where there is some prospect of the standards being reached within a short period of time' and where both the nursing home proprietor and management show a commitment to taking remedial action. The decision to revoke the 'exempt bed status' of a nursing home will be made where the nursing home proprietor' or management fail to show a commitment to taking appropriate action within a reasonable time frame. Where there is little prospect of standards being reached within a reasonable period of time, then the current power, in section 44 of the act, will be used to revoke the approval of the nursing home altogether. The decision to suspend or revoke 'exempt bed status' is to be subject to internal review, as well, as review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 is to specify directly the health ministers to be consulted by the minister before appointing the chairperson of the council, the chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a principal committee of the council, and the member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research. Currently, the act provides that the minister is to consult in relation to these appointments with other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference. The composition of that membership can of course vary from time to time and currently includes the New Zealand minister, for health. The proposed amendment would specify ,that it is the health minister of each state and territory who is.to be consulted in relation to the appointments . . I now tum to the amendments made to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. One of the principal purposes of these amendments is to establish the basis for a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian register of therapeutic goods and to provide better definition toÂ· some poorly understood aspects Â·of the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods which have been identified in its first four years of operation. A mechanism to address shortages or the absence of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included in the bill. Amendments that update and consolidate the entry, search and warrant powers in the new part of the act have also been included,. together with changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the 'penalty units' classifications used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation. The bill also closes a gap within the current regulatory scheme, by which legal therapeutic goods of unknown 'quality, safety or efficacy are at present not able to be removed from the market. Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration trust account with the Therapeutic Goods Administration reserve, consistent with changes to be made by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1995 and related bills that will replace the Audit Act 1901. The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This is intended to ensure that technical and scientific data sought to be relied upon in connection with a general marketing application will be properly evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. One of the success stories of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 has been the orderly transfer of listable products-vitamin and minerals, homoeopathic, herbal and sunscreen preparations above SPF4-into the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods. Since the MC782 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 commencement of the legislation on 15 February 1991 some 14,000 listed drug products have been placed on the Australian register of therapeutic goods, and are currently being added to at the rate of some 2,000 per annum. This very strong demand for listing new products on the Australian register of therapeutic goods reflects the keen interest in the community in having access to safe and well manufactured alternative medicines, and the expectation is that the present very high level of product applications will continue. The impact on the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the very high number of product applications has been substantial, with the average approval times for individual products averaging five months-well in excess of the initial target of 30 days. To address this problem, the government provided $0.775 million in the 1994-95 budget for the development of a new streamlined process for listing products on the Australian register of therapeutic goods which would cut product approval time to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products. The new process makes absolutely no changes to the policy on listed products but does provide a fully automated document lodgement and assessment process, which will be available to industry from 1 July 1995. The new electronic lodgement facility and all supporting documentation have been developed through a steering committee with membership drawn from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the three affected industry organisations and the Consumer Health Forum. The new accelerated listing process continues the pre-market assessment of applications which is one of the central planks of the national regulatory scheme. Responsibility for making the assessment will be vested in the applicant, who will be able to undertake the assessment against published criteria and documentation and submit an application in a form which is electronically compatible with the Australian register of therapeutic goods database. Applications are to be accompanied by a certificate that the goods are eligible for listing, are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, their presentation is acceptable, they conform to standards and have been manufactured by an appropriately licensed manufacturer in Australia. Goods which are manufactured outside Australia will still require TGA approval of the manufacturer before a listing application can be made. Lodgment of an electronic application under the accelerated listing process is expected to be able to reduce the time frame for product approval from an average of five months to approximately two weeks. Subsequent to the approval, the TGA will carry out a 100 per cent audit of product eligibility, both in terms of formulations and claims made, and will subsequently undertake a random audit of applications which are lodged annually for listing on the Australian register of therapeutic goods. The accelerated listing process will meet the requirements of industry for certainty in terms of product launches, whilst maintaining the existing high level of surveillance of product quality and safety. In the event that the TGA surveillance demonstrates that certification by a sponsor was false, then provision is included in the bill for cancellation to be immediate on any safety related issues but, in other circumstances-for example, less serious label errors-sponsors would have the opportunity to make a submission before any decision is taken to proceed to cancel the product. Any decision by the TGA to cancel the product listing is subject to appeal to the minister and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A new provision, section 19A, has been included in the act to provide the government with the means to deal with acute shortages of drugs supplied in Australia or that no longer are supplied here by their sponsors, or to temporarily allow into the Australian market a drug that Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC783 is not available in Australia but is required to address an emergency. The act as it stands allows individual patients to access unapproved drugs in limited circumstances. This entails prescribers to gain individual permission for each patient from Canberra, or for a prescriber to seek the status of an authorised prescriber under the special access scheme. Although both of these schemes are used with advantage to permit the supply of small volumes of unregistered drugs, they are too unwieldy and too slow to make available substitute drugs, or new drugs, on a larger scale to meet an unforeseen emergency or to permit interim supply of a product registered overseas during the period of evaluation in Australia. There are a number of reasons why approval may be sought and granted for supply of drugs under this provision. For example, a company may find itself out of stock of a particular product and wish to supply the same product as registered in the United States or Canada. Recently, there has been a shortage in Australia of lithium drugs used in the treatment of mental illness. It has proved very difficult to obtain a substitute product from an overseas source because of the requirement to have the product registered prior to supply in Australia. Companies who have the product have been understandably unwilling to go to the trouble and expense of registration as a stop-gap measure. Although vast improvements have been made in the approval time for new drugs in Australia, it remains inevitable that companies will register their drugs in America or Europe prior to introduction into Australia and that Australian patients and their doctors may have to wait until a company applies to register a drug in Australia. Provided that an application is in place in Australia and that the drug is deemed to have a unique therapeutic potential by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, it is proposed to permit limited supply on the basis of one or more overseas approvals. In this context, Australia has a number of arrangements in place for the interchange of information with reputable drug regulatory agencies around the world. These include the United States, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Through its membership of the PER-that is, the pharmaceutical evaluation reportsscheme, Australia is in a position to deal with most European agencies and with South Africa. The emergence of new diseases, new treatments and medical emergencies may mandate the supply of unregistered medicines as an emergency measure. Such an occasion might be the need to immunise a large number of people against a tropical disease with a vaccine held in insufficient quantities in Australia. If such a vaccine is not registered in Australia, supply is presently cumbersome requiring individual approval from Canberra. The safety measures to be put in place will include resorting to temporary approval under section 19A when no registered substitute produce is available. Furthermore, delegations under this section are to be limited to the national manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the head of the drug safety and evaluation branch. Restrictions and conditions relating to the supply of such substitute products may be imposed to ensure that this provision cannot be used to avoid the process of drug evaluation and registration in Australia. The interface between food and drugs has been a source of considerable confusion since the commencement of the Therapeutic Goods Act in 1991. The existing definition of 'therapeutic goods' excludes 'food' but, in the absence of a definition of what constituted 'food', claims have been made, for example, that: skin treatment products that 'nourish' the skin are a food and therefore not a therapeutic good, MC 784 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 . gelatine is a food therefore products-including drugs-in gelatine capsules are not therapeutic goods. . These examples demonstrate the legal complexity involved in enforcement action through the courts, in the absence of a clear definition of what constitutes a food for the purposes of the Therapeutic Goods Act of 1989. Detailed discussions have been held between representatives of the National Food Authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, state and territory health agencies, and with the food and pharmaceutical industries, aimed at clarifying the food-drug interface. The outcome of these negotiations was agreement to introduce a definition of 'food' into the Therapeutic Goods Act which made it quite clearand Health be granted an extension of time. those in favour say aye, on the contrary no. I think the ayes have it. the Main Committee, there is an indication that the committee can proceed unless agreement to the unresolved question is necessary to enable further questions to be considered. Strictly speaking, the agreement to this unresolved question is not necessarily required, but given that this is the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health and is an important speech, I seek guidance from the parliamentary secretary as to whether he would conclude his remarks at a later stage or wishes to insist on this extension of time. sure that the parliamentary secretary is even going to finish it in another 10 minutes. I wanted to say a few words on that point. The honourable member for Herbert did not seem very keen on that, so I was not keen to be very cooperative, but I will withdraw my opposition if that would help you. cooperation. Extension of time granted. would have thought the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) would be very interested to hear what the government has to say about every section. However, let us continue. I was referring to these very important negotiations between the National Food Authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, state and territory health agencies, and the food and pharmaceutical industries, which were aimed at clarifying the food-drug interface. The outcome of these negotiations was agreement to introduce a definition of 'food' into the Therapeutic Goods Act which made it quite clear that decisions on what constituted a food or a therapeutic good were closely linked to its presentation and promotion and that a food could not be",139,Representatives Main Committee

236,Dr Theophanous,"This is a very important bill, with many different sections to it. IWednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 785 restricted by any specific dosage limit. The words 'prescribed dose' and 'frequency of administration' have been included in the definition of 'food' and are to be read in a pharmaceutical Sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages. The existing legislation has an anomaly in that it contains provision for a product to be removed from the market if it is cancelled from the Australian register of therapeutic goods, but has no similar provision for removing from the market illegal therapeutic goods that were never included in the register, whose quality, safety and efficacy are unknown. Where such products are detected and action is taken against sponsors, there is no existing basis whereby these products can be removed from the market pending either prosecution or submission of an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for inclusion of the product on the Australian register of therapeutic goods. Provision has therefore been included in the bill to enable the secretary to require persons to take steps to recover from the market any illegal therapeutic goods or to inform the public in a specified manner, and within a reasonable time frame, that the product has not been reviewed for quality, safety or efficacy by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Decisions of the secretary in this matter are appealable to the minister and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill also proposes to redraft the main offence provision in the legislation, which currently provides that offences of import, export, manufacture or supply of goods in Australia are committed by a person who is the sponsor of therapeutic goods. The definition of sponsor does not, however, include a person who exports, imports, manufactures or arranges for the export, import or manufacture of goods on behalf of another person who is a resident of, or carrying on business in, Australia. The effect of the current provision is that the TGA must undertake intrusive investigations into the business affairs of persons that still fail to establish who the sponsor of the goods is, precluding any proceedings from being instituted to deter or prevent theÂ· unlawful supply of unapproved and sometimes dangerous therapeutic goods. The bill proposes to clear away the need for such investigations into matters that can best be established by those in possession of facts best known to themselves, the sponsors, by establishing that the offence of import, export, manufacture or supply of goods in Australia for use in humans is committed by a person, and by including a statutory defence for the person to demonstrate that he was not the sponsor of the goods at the time the offence was committed. This arrangement will protect the innocent agent from prosecution, and remove from the TGA the requirement to undertake extensive investigations into the business affairs of persons who are simply acting as the agents for product .sponsors. The act currently contains provisions for entry, search, inspection, sampling and seizure in relation to premises of sponsors, manufacturers and other premises for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the act, ensuring compliance with standards (GMP audits and postmarket surveillance) and gathering evidence of offences committed against the act. These provisions are restricted to authorised persons, are provided for both with and without warrant, and are spread across a number of sections and subsections contained within parts 3 (sponsors), 4 (manufacturers) and 6 (any premises) of the act. The bill proposes to consolidate these provisions into a new part 5A entitled 'Entry, searches and warrants', the existing powers have been reviewed and the provisions have been redrafted to bring them into line with the current MC 786 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 legal policy cited in part lAA of the Crimes Act 1914, which was inserted by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994. The bill now makes it quite clear that entry without warrant to the premises of sponsors and manufacturers cannot be exercised at residential premises unless the sponsor or manufacturer uses the premises for commercial purposes in relation to therapeutic goods as well as a residence. The bill also introduces a power of entry to enable authorised persons to enter premises where it is necessary to do so in the interests of public health so as to avoid an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury. This provision is sought to enable, for example, the prevention of extremely dangerous products from entering the market (in the case, say, of toxic contamination); or the halting of dangerous manufacturing process (in the case, say, of a clandestine laboratory utilising volatile chemicals). The bill also proposes that a number of indictable offence provisions in the act be reduced to summary offences. Since the inception of the act, experience has shown that these matters can be more appropriately dealt with by a court of summary jurisdiction rather than through the much more lengthy trial process. This change will convenience both the Crown and the accused as well as the judicial system. The act currently contains forfeiture upon conviction provisions in relation to illicit goods. This provision currently applies only to summary offences. The bill proposes that the illicit goods, the subject of indictable conviction, also be forfeitable. The amendments detailed in this bill largely address process and safety: the process by which drug products supplied in Australia are listed on the ARTG, as well as providing a basis for distinguishing between foods and drug products, and safety, in providing a mechanism to remove products of unknown quality, safety and efficacy from the market. The bill also reviews and consolidates the enforcement provisions under the Therapeutic Goods Act, and brings them into line with the most recent Commonwealth policy in this area. As such, the bill will substantially assist the sponsors of listable drug products in getting good quality and well manufactured medicines onto the market in a short time frame, whilst improving the ability of the Therapeutic Goods Administration to protect the Australian public from substandard, unsafe or ineffective products. Other changes included in the bill are provisions to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration trust account with a new reserve account, consistent with changes to be effected by the new financial management package, including the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 that will replace the Audit Act 1901. Section 45 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 will establish a Therapeutic Goods Administration reserve and make provision for the annual appropriation of moneys into the reserve equal to the receipts identified under that section. Changes to the appeals procedure for the review of decision to register or not register therapeutic goods under section 25 of the act have also been included in item 148. These changes are designed to encourage applicants for general marketing of registrable therapeutic goods to provide all relevant scientific and technical data to the secretary before a decision on registration is made under section 25 of the act and to ensure that any new technical and scientific material not previously before the secretary will undergo proper evaluation before a decision on review based upon merits is made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC787 Mr Deputy Speaker, this comprehensive bill is recommend and I commend it to the House. opposition spokesperson for agreeing to an extension of time. It is important for the government that the second reading speech does include the government's position on these things. As all members know, that can be taken into account if any of these matters are dealt with in court in the future. I might say to the departmental people present that they might take account of the fact that it is necessary to tailor these speeches to half an hour in future and the government should not be put into a position where we have to seek the indulgence of the opposition for the government's position to be put on the record. I thank the Main Committee. Dr WOOLDRIDGE (Chisholm) (10.43 a.m.)-I enjoyed listening to my friend and colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous). It reminded me of a story the former honourable member for Kooyong, Mr Peacock, used to tell. When he followed Bob Menzies, he put a lot of work into his maiden speech. Before he gave it, he rang Bob Menzies and said, 'Would you have a look at my maiden speech?' So he went around to Haverbrack Avenue and Bob said, 'Leave it on the table. Come back in a week.' He went back in a week and said, 'What did you think of it?' Bob said, 'It is a very good speech, but too long.' He said, 'What do I do?' Bob said, 'Cut out half.' Andrew said, 'How do I do that?' Bob said, 'It doesn't matter. Cut out either half. It won't make any difference.' It is apparently a true story. I rise to speak on the first portfolio under the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995. I hope calling it No.1 does not mean that it is the first of a number of omnibus bills to come through this year. There is no miscellaneous provisions bill here, no tidying up of an act here and there. This is an act with almost 150 different items which introduce substantial amendments to three acts: the Childcare Rebate Act, the National Health Act and Therapeutic Goods Act. Just how substantial the act is is shown by the length of the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech. I hope this sort of legislation is not something that will be copied too often. As the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, this bill amends six enactments: the Childcare Rebate Act 1993; the Health Insurance Act 1973; the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973; the National Health Act 1853; the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992; and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) will have something to say about the Childcare Rebate Act. I will make some comments about the amendments to the other enactments. I will say, however, that I will not require as much time as the parliamentary secretary. This is essentially because the coalition, whilst being somewhat irritated at the way these amendments have been lumped together, does not oppose the provisions of the bill. It is noted that, in contrast with some other legislation that I have had to deal with of late, the government has consulted effectively with groups involved-the aged care industry, the therapeutic goods industry, the Attorney-General's Department and other interested parties-to ensure that the legislation reflects sound day-to-day practice. The results are some common sense approaches to commonly agreed problems. Before saying anything in particular about the proposed changes to the National Health Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act, I just say for the record that the proposed amendments to the other enactments covered by this bill are basically straightforward an<;l are, on the whole,",146,Representatives Main Committee
237,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson),"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I thank theMC788 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 cleaning up some definitional uncertainties. In respect of the National Health and Medical Research Council Act, for instance, these amendments will not affect the council's operations but will simply clarify the definition of health ministers by referring to their offices rather than membership of the Australian Health Ministers Conference. I will say something briefly about the Health Insurance Commission Act amendments. We accept the government's assurance about the need to recast the commission's power to retain seized evidentiary material to ensure that its search and seizure powers are effective without intruding inordinately on the liberty of the citizen. Similarly, we do not oppose the proposed empowerment of the commission to engage in the hedging of investment transactions, although we notice that the commission would largely be exercising this power on behalf of Medibank Private. If the government believes that the commission, as the operator of Medibank Private in competition with other private health insurers, needs to have fund management powers consistent with its competitors, perhaps it will also admit that the commission's high level of infrastructure support actually gives Medibank Private a cost advantage over its competitors. Surely this cost advantage is one of the reasons why Medibank Private, as was reported in the Herald-Sun in Melbourne last weekend, is able to offer the best deals under the government's new legislation, while paring its reserves back to the statutory bone. Before leaving this act, I should say that I am somewhat ironically impressed that the Health Insurance Commission has the resources to spread its wings formally into the consultancy market. I hope that the new found entrepreneurial drive does not distract scarce taxpayer funded resources from the important primary role the commission has in the administration of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits schemes. Presumably, any consultancy fees will in some way be ploughed back into the commission's operations, thus reducing the Health Insurance Commission's need for recurrent Commonwealth funding. I now tum to the National Health Act amendments in relation to ministerial and regulatory powers relating to exempt bed status nursing homes. As honourable members will be aware, exempt bed status homes provide above normal standard accommodation and can share residents' direct fees for this level of service. They meet a growing demand for premium nursing home accommodation for those who are willing and able to pay for it. About six per cent of nursing home beds are now exempt, something the coalition in government may well look at boosting if there is a proven demand. As the government has pointed out, there is presently an anomaly relating to the compliance of exempt bed homes with the statutory outcome standards. That is, the act as presently worded does not enable the suspension of revocation of exempt bed status for those nursing homes which have failed to meet the outcome standards. This has attracted some attention as a result of an investigative report by the Age newspaper last year. If exempt beds provided at a direct cost to the user are going to be a viable and attractive alternative in residential aged care, users and their families must have full confidence that the product they are purchasing is of the highest possible quality. Therefore, we do not oppose the government's amendments to the act to ensure the power to revoke and suspend exempt status, especially since our understanding is that the amendments also protect the interests of those residents who may enter the home on a normally funded basis in a period of suspension or revocation of exempt status. If these people find themselves hit financially if they want to Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC789 stay in a home, or in an individual bed restored to exempt status, they should not be penalised unfairly. I also note that the aged care industry organisations support the government's intentions. Having said this, I must say that the solution to the problem is driven by the nature of our present centralised and bureaucratic funding and management of residential aged care. I have made no secret of the fact that I would like to see a greater role for industry peer review in the nursing homes standards monitoring process. It certainly does not mean a deregulation of nursing home standards, nor does it mean the federal government walks away from standardsit should not-but the present system is cumbersome and bureaucratic. I am also a little concerned that the inconsistent operation of the standards monitoring process around Australia may lead to unnecessary or premature imposition of suspension or revocation sanctions in some cases. We have had complaints of monitoring teams applying standards subjectively or unduly heavily, and I get the impression that different officers in different state branches of the Department of Human Services and Health themselves sometimes have varying interpretations of what is good practice against outcome standards and what is not. I note that any decision to suspend or revoke exempt bed status is reviewable internally and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I simply hope these changes will not mean an undue expansion in the use of the review processes and therefore the drawing off of scarce public resources in relation to these reviews. Finally, I want to comment briefly on the proposed amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act. We welcome these amendments, which will facilitate the more streamlined listing of many low risk listable products under the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods. I am impressed by the new combined self-assessment and electronic checking process to ensure that pre-market assessment of such therapeutic goods is as swift and cost efficient as possible. This represents savings to manufacturers and marketers, and it represents savings to government. Similarly, on the measures to deal with acute domestic shortages of drugs normally supplied in Australia, no longer supplied by an Australian sponsor or to allow temporary entry of the drugs still to be listed on the Australian register, provided that quality assurance exists-and I am assured this is the case-any reasonable freeing up of the importation requirements is a sensible step. I would urge the Therapeutic Goods Administration to monitor the operation of these and other liberalising measures in this bill to ensure that user and public safety is not being compromised by their operation. In terms of the prosecution, search and seizure amendments contained in this bill, I will certainly say they make sense to me. I welcome the amendments ensuring that the innocent sponsor of a suspect therapeutic good is not prosecuted for something where he or she was in all innocence party to import, export, manufacture or supply. I welcome the general recodification of the Therapeutic Goods Act's penal, investigative and seizure powers in a clearer and centralised form and the making clearer of the powers under warrant of TGA officers acting within the law. I am a little uneasy about the extension of the seizure period from 60 to 90 days, but I understand the importance in some cases of needing to undertake or commission detailed evaluation and scientific analysis of seized substances as part of the evidence gathering process. Finally, I also welcome the opening of an added opportunity to have expert consideration in listing application decisions incorporated into the loops of internal or Administrative Appeals Tribunal reviews of what are invariably highly complex technical data and related MC790 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 information. I believe that the government's hope is that this will discourage applicants from doing 'quick and nasty' listing applications with limited information available to the primary decision maker, in the hope of speeding up the process and reducing the need for review. I have to say, however, that in many ways we live in a 'quick and nasty' world where there will always be people who hope to manipulate the system for their advantage. While commending the government's intention and supporting it, I will wait and see what its actual effects will be over time. As I said at the outset, the coalition does not oppose this bill. We accept the need to take the steps outlined in it and we believe that, on paper at least, the changes implemented by these amendments will be for the better. Once again, though, I point out that in this bill there is material for at least three, and perhaps more, bills of real substance which would have better been taken separately rather than in this omnibus form. It certainly would have helped us get a quicker understanding of what these amendments are trying to achieve. Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, I want to dwell on the second last item dealt with by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and concentrate on one or two sentences of the changes that have been made to the Therapeutic Goods Act, which just shows how long the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) could have been if he had dealt with it in great detail. One of the items refers to the temporary approval and supply of unevaluated drugs for use in Australia in limited circumstances, covering situations where there is a shortage of a registered drug in the Australian market or where a registered drug ceases to be available and there is no other equivalent registered product. I refer to a drug which has recently been very successfully used in Australia and emphasise the importance of the government accommodating its introduction. A range of illnesses under the broad definition of schizophrenia require a combination of drugs and psychological therapy. Until about 40 years ago it was almost impossible to find a satisfactory drug to deal with schizophrenia. People were hospitalised-I should say 'institutionalised' because one could hardly call them hospitals-and were seen in the grounds hugging themselves and rocking or extremely violent in padded cells, perhaps having been given electric shock therapy. Very rarely were the drug therapies successful, and psychological therapy on its own was not particularly successful. Schizophrenia covers a wide range of illnesses, but it is really an extreme form of what has been described by Dr Ainslie Meares as 'atavistic regression', regression to a primitive mode of thinking, which is an important facility in humans who seek relief from anxiety situations. Most of us get that: we are able to obtain regression to that primitive mode of thinking through a range of means, for instance, by listening to classical music for some. For others it might be sitting with a tinny in front of the footy, so the methods can vary a lot, although I must say that tests with students show that they study best using classical music, even if they think they do not like it. There are various ways of regressing to that primitive mode: relaxation is one; yoga is another. Having a holiday might be regression or even-I do not know that many do it now---:chopping the wood, digging the garden or feeding the chooks. These might be ways of getting away from it all, where one can regress to where the mind is not particularly active.",149,Representatives Main Committee
238,Mr Snow (Eden,"Monaro) (10.54 a.m.)-In speaking on the Human Services and HealthWednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 791 Schizophrenia was seen by Dr Ainslie Meares as an extreme form of regressing and not being able to come back into life. In other words, the person regresses as a defence against what might be some very major trauma. The condition is manifested in a range of behaviours, such as totally unpredictable, violent behaviour and aggression, or there could be just a placid withdrawal-someone may appear to be superficially pleasant but behind it all have suicidal tendencies. He or she regresses to that primitive mode of thinking, does not come away from it and 'schizophrenia' is an all-embracing sort of definition. Clozapine has been used in Australia. The program at Woden has been available to people not only in the ACT but also to people in south-eastern New South Wales. The drug has had a great deal of success while on trial in Australia. A disease such as schizophrenia, which could be due to a genetic tendency, could be triggered, though, by trauma at home, at work or even, I believe, by smoking marijuana. So far, the drugs that have been used before Clozapine have been successful with a range of people who suffer from schizophrenia. Drugs such as Melleril, Largactil, fluphenazine, Anatensol and Modecate have very often been effective. But there were patients-some of them caught on the borderline of schizophrenia-for whom these drugs were not very effective at all. They had a number of side effects, without having particularly beneficial effects in treatment of the disease. Clozapine was found to have side effects too, particularly a granulocytosis. Woden Valley Hospital established a controlled program with Clozapine, where, after being hospitalised for some time, people were able to visit a therapist-first of all a pharmacist and then a nursing staffer was provided. Those patients were able to visit that therapist at required intervals. They were given blood tests and a range of other tests and discussed their experiences with the therapist. The dosage was adjusted appropriately on occasions when they returned to the therapeutic adviser. It was very often started at a high level and then reduced gradually. Clozapine has shown a very high level of success in a number of areas. First of all, people were able to return to the work force after, in some cases, many years absence. They were able to return to study, when they had not been able to study-at school perhaps-for years. There was a reduced tendency towards suicide, and those people could take a better part in society, socially and at home within the family. Paranoia was reduced in many of the patients. In a number of them, the anxiety level was stabilised. As with other medical treatments, people need to be balanced with their dosage in order to cope with life, but not to have so high a dosage as to protect them from the normal psychological trauma which we all suffer. That is the difficult time. When the dosage is being reduced the patient experiences some trauma. The patient, the therapist and the family have to decide whether that trauma is the sort of trauma we all suffer in life from the pressures that come to bear on us. That is the challenge when people are being stabilised on a drug like Clozapine. I believe Clozapine ought to be extended-and this is an aside-to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so that it is available to patients on an authority, rather than, for instance, patients in Eden having to travel some 250 to 280 kilometres to Woden Valley Hospital to see their therapist regularly, and to get the supply from the hospital. Once the therapy has been stabilised, surely the patient's doctor should be able to obtain an authority in Eden and supply MC792 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 the medication with the concurrence of the psychiatrist who is in charge of the patient, so that this patient is able to receive drugs and perhaps attend less often. Attendances for drug supply, particularly at the beginning where there have been suicidal tendencies, need to be monitored very carefully. The amount of the drug given needs to be fairly limited. For that reason, any supply from the local pharmacist through a local doctor should be limited in quantity, especially at the beginning. Sometimes, if there are situations where patients are not being properly monitored, the general practitioner can at least ask those patients how they have been farIng and, if they do not turn up, can contact them. This is an extremely important drug, which is now available to people who have schizophrenia, who have had no success with other drugs and who have been continually returning to hospital for further treatment. The number of returns to hospitalisation has also been reduced by the use of Clozapine. The parliamentary secretary has shown tremendous interest,and his 'appointment and his interest have encouraged people in the health field. I would say to him that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme ought to include Clozapine, and I know that the evidence which has come to me from the people who run the scheme in Woden and which I am happy to supply would substantiate what I have been saying. . I commend the government on the bill as a whole. For instance, I have had people who havmade representations to me who have been excluded from the rebate scheme under the Childcare Rebate Act but who should be eligible for the rebate. Specifically, children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special need which requires ongoing care have been mentioned, as have their carers under the age of 18 who possess certain child-care qualifications. I believe that this may involve a slight increase in expenditure. Of course, we actually included these people in the estimate for the rebate scheme and then-I believe, inadvertently-they were not able to take advantage of the scheme. That is important. It is also important for the government on behalf of the taxpayer to get away from the situation where people are getting double payments for child care through, for example, an agency or an employer. The changes that have been made to the new procedures, requiring the secretary of the department to give marketing approval for drugs, where the sponsor of the product certifies a list of matters that relate to the safety and quality of the goods, are important. Also important is the requirement for the sponsor of goods' that have been unlawfully supplied to inform the public that they were wrongly supplied and to take steps to recover any of the goods that have been distributed. I commend the bill to the House, and reiterate the importance of the ability of government, when it has a lot of information from overseas, to use the latest available be_neficial drug as the treatment of choice. Dr KEMP (Goldstein) (11.07 a.m.)-As previous members have pointed out, this bill is an omnibus bill containing amendments to various pieces of legislation in the human services and health portfolio. This morning, I want to deal with the amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. According to the explanatory memorandum on the bill, these amendments are being presented to ensure consistency with the government's intentions for the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. ' The key amendments to the act provide hardship provisions to assist some people who are currently excluded from the chiid-care cash rebate, including children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special need which requires ongoing child care, carers under 18 Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC793 possessing suitable child-care qualifications, and parents who are currently unable to have work related commitments. In addition, the amendments allow for the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registration is under consideration. This measure is to avoid unnecessary recoveries by the government, while not abrogating individuals' rights to appeal longer-term decisions, presuming that the appeal is not upheld and that financial adjustments by government may be necessary. Other amendments deal with a raft of issues, including backdating of carer registrations to the day the carer was first eligible to register; the cancellation of registrations due to administrative error; ensuring that rebates are not paid on child-care costs which are reimbursed by an employer; and other amendments of what is described as a clarifying nature. These include availability of the rebate for certain absences from care; backdating of family registration; eligibility of overseas students to claim the rebate; and correcting technical defects in the principal act which relate to recovery of overpayments. The range of amendments and of the issues which they address highlights a number of the shortcomings of the government's child-care cash rebate scheme and underlines the lack of certainty and stability in the government's child-care policies. The child-care cash rebate was originally targeted to parents who have children aged under 13 and who use child-care facilities outside the home while they work, seek work or are in education. It was expected that some 230,000 Australian families would make use of the scheme. The government allocated $152 million to the scheme in its first year of operation. Now, less than one year after it has come into operation, the government has realised that its original assessments were wrong. The estimate for child-care cash rebate expenditure has been scaled back by over $60 million to $90 million-a massiveunderspending on the rebate in its first year. The government, to my knowledge, has not been able to satisfactorily explain this extraordinarily large discrepancy between its initial assessments and the actual outcome. Of, course, there is a possibility that claims are being 'hoarded' by parents to be claimed in bulk at a later stage. If that is the case, it is possible that there will be a substantial blow-out in the estimates which have been provided in this year's budget. Around the same time as the child-care cash rebate was introduced, the government also introduced the home child-care allowance. This payment to those parents who choose to look after their children at home, rather than participate in the paid work force, was to provide-and I quote the words of the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) at the time: ... an independent source of income for women in unpaid employment in the home. It will not be income tested on family income. That was-as he usually does-putting the best light on things,because it was, of course, to be income tested, but to be income tested on the income of the principle carer. That was not highlighted in the Prime Minister's statement. The home child-care allowance was to replace the dependent spouse rebate and, as a payment direct to the primary care giver, recognised the unpaid work of women caring full-time for children. When the home child-care allowance was introduced, it was means tested, as I have said, on the income of the primary care giver. The promised $60 per fortnight was available to those care givers whose income was less than $10 per fortnight. Thereafter, the amount payable was reduced. This has impacted quite severely on low-income parents who may want to supplement their income by a small amount of part-time work. It is typical, really, of the way in which the government's child-care policies, including announcements made in the recent budget, have MC 794 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 impacted adversely on lower income people and the way in which one would have to say that the battlers in this society have been extraordinarily, gravely disadvantaged by the policies that are being pursued. The child-care area is just one example amongst these. The inequity between the child-care cash rebate and the home child-care allowance has been highlighted by the coalition since its inception. The child-care cash rebate is not means tested, while the home child-care allowance is. In addition, the rates of the two payments are quite different. A couple in paid employment seeking work or an education, with two children in formal care outside the home, can receive $61.20 per fortnight. A couple in which one partner works while the other stays at home to care for two children receives $30 per fortnight. It seems that, in the government's estimation, child care provided by parents is the least valued kind of child care in our society. The home child-care allowance was introduced while the dependent spouse rebate was still existing. It was subsequently found that many families were worse off under the new system than they had been under the dependent spouse rebate. It was only after protracted argument that the coalition was able to ensure that people who qualified for the dependent spouse rebate, but were ineligible for the home child-care allowance, would not have their financial assistance reduced. Like the child-care cash rebate, the home child-care allowance was conceived in a blaze of publicity and fanfare, was born in subterfuge, and is now about to be hidden out of sight inside the new parenting allowance. This bill evidences the same lack of foresight and planning in the implementation of the child-care cash rebate as did the debacle the Minister for Social Security presided over when the home child-care allowance was introduced. The range of issues dealt with by this bill indicates that the government's implementation of the child-care cash rebate was hurried, ill-conceived and, in many respects-some of which are acknowledged in this bill-unfair. One would have to say that the measures to backdate registrations and extend eligibility for the rebate look something like an attempt to show that the initial estimates of expenditure on the scheme were not as wrong as they currently appear to be. The amendments extending care to parents in the home looking after children with a disability are a response to concerns expressed by parents: concerns which should have been considered before the act was introduced into the parliament. In my capacity as shadow minister for family services, I had a number of calls from parents caring for children with disabilities who currently received the rebate but who, once the child turned 13, were then ineligible to continue to receive it. They were also ineligible for any other kind of assistance under any other program. This of course put them in quite serious circumstances. The government was prepared to leave these people on the scrap heap when this scheme was first introduced. The recent budget further confirmed the ad hoc nature of the decisions that the government makes in the child-care area. This lack of stability, lack of predictability, and continuing uncertainty for families, comes as one change after another is made by the government to its schemes. It leads to a situation where many people in the community, particularly those with less access to information and who find information rather harder to obtain, are disadvantaged by these continuing changes. The government has no strategy in this area. Decisions are made from year to year and, indeed, sometimes from month to month. It produces a high level of instability in the nature of the benefits, and in the terms and conditions on which they are Wed\nesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC795 provided. It means that many of those who would be entitled to these benefits never realise that tH-y are entitled because they simply cannot keep up with what is happening. In tl#s recent budget, the government mouthed its usual rhetoric of caring, while slashing outlays' on child care. It claws back about $330 million from the commitments made to child care la-t year. For example, while amending the Childcare Rebate Act to ensure consistency with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme, the government has restricted access to child-care assistance to parents not in the paid work force. This is a measure which will save the government $325 million in outlays over the next four years. The people who will be hit hardest by this reduction of more than $300 million in expenditure over the next few years will be the battling families in this society. The lower income families will be the ones who will have their access to child care restricted by these decisions. They will not be able to afford child care beyond the 12 hours for which they will be awarded child-care assistance. This figure of 12 hours is a totally arbitrary figure. It has been plucked out of the air. It is not part of any strategy to deal with child care. It has been put there solely to provide the government with large savings to make up for the extraordinary level of financial mismanagement which we have seen from this government in recent years. The government desperately needed to bring back something that looked to the public like balance so it has clawed several hundred million dollars out of the pockets of the poorer people in our society-the battlers in the Australian society. However, there is no hesitation in extending the un-means-tested child-care cash rebate. Much of the responsibility for providing these child-care places, provided for under the government's previous schemes, has fallen on private child-care centres. One of the consequences of the decisions which have been taken in the budget, as members of the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations said earlier this week, is to throw into doubt the jobs of thousands of child-care workers who previously were providing child care to the children of these battling families. So not only are families damaged by these decisions but the job prospects of thousands of child-care workers, according to the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations, have now been put at risk by the budget. This bill really exemplifies the completely ad hoc nature of the government's approach to this whole child-care area. It is a matter which is causing increasing concern within the community as one decision after another makes child care less and less affordable for those people who have very little money in their pockets to spend. The coalition has consistently called for the development of child-care policies in full consultation with the whole range of different sectors of child care and not imposed by one group of interests on the other. It is quite clear that, instead of basing its policies-including the policies in this bill-on wide consultation, the government is simply looking at a series of short-term concerns and interests rather than giving families in Australia, and particularly the battling families, the opportunity to take advantage of policies within a settled and secure framework. Ill-conceived, poorly administered, ideologically driven policies and the lack of certainty and stability are having adverse impacts on poorer families in this community. This bill just further underlines the ad hoc nature of the decisions that are being made. Macarthur, I might point out that the bleepers that are allocated to honourable members are not meant to operate in this chamber. I recognise that the honourable member for Macarthur",152,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Andrew),"BeforeI call the honourable member forMC796 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 I was doing all he could to silence his delinquent bleeper. At a time convenient to him, dmight be appropriate to raise with the sergeant the fact that his bleeper is doing more than bleepers are meant to do within these premises. They were actually beeping me to make sure that I was here. Obviously, there is something wrong with the cameras in here as well. This is actually my first speech in this chamber. I am very pleased to be here. In a sense, it is like a maiden speech all over again. I am pleased to speak in support of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995. This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts, including the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953, the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. As I said, this is my first speech in this chamber, the Main Committee, and I am pleased to be able to address my remarks today to two of my favourite policy areas, child care and health. The amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 are to ensure consistency with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. Several amendments provide hardship provisions to assist certain groups of people who are currently excluded from the rebate scheme, but who should be eligible for the rebate. These groups include children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special need which requires ongoing child care; carers under the age of 18 years who possess certain child-care qualifications; or parents who are currently unable to have work related commitments under section 39 because of extenuating circumstances. A number of administrative issues and technical errors in the drafting of the act also require amendments. For example, amendments are needed to make consequential changes to bring the act into line with other Commonwealth legislation such as the Migration Act 1958; to allow the delegation of powers by the managing director of the Health Insurance Commission; to allow the minister some discretion over receipting requirements; and to strengthen powers to recover overpayments of the rebate. The amendments will also allow the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registrations is being considered. This will avoid unnecessary recoveries by the government while ensuring that individuals maintain their right to appeal against long-term decisions. Further administrative amendments are proposed to allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the day on which they were first eligible to register; to cancel family and carer registrations which occurred due to administrative error; to ensure that the rebate is not paid for child-care costs which have been or will be reimbursed by another agent such as an employer; to clarify that the rebate is payable for child-care costs incurred for certain specified absences from care; to clarify the backdating of family registrations; to clarify the eligibility of overseas students to claim the rebate by amending the way courses of study are described; and to correct technical defects in the original act. Child care is one of the most important areas of social policy and economic policy that has been addressed by this Labor government. The number of government funded child-care places and the Commonwealth's commitment to child care have grown dramatically since the election of this government in 1983. In recognition of the increasing participation of women in the work force, the government has sought to provide quality, affordable child care through the various Commonwealth-state child-care agreements.",157,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Haviland (Macarthur) (11.23 A.m.),"I will certainly take those comments on board.Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC797 Child care is a very important area of social justice, which is why I think it is such an impOitant area. Because women are now quite rightly asserting their right to work, it becomes even more important. The lack of affordable, quality child care is indeed a barrier to many people, particularly women, who seek to enter the labour market. So that is why this Labor government sees that it is so important. Originally, child care was considered to be a welfare issue. To some extent, child care is still available for non-working parents through occasional care, but the main thrust of the federal government's children's services program is to do with employment related child care. The thrust is to provide access to the labour market for families with children so that one or both parents can access the work force. It is an economic need as well as a social justice issue. The priority of access guidelines in the child-care program ensure that priority is given to children whose parents are either working or seeking employment, and to groups with special needs. The federal government has been very active in promoting work based child care, where an employer provides child care either at the workplace or elsewhere. In my former employment I was very active in setting up work based child care in a federal department. That seems to have gone pretty well. There is more of a trend towards providing work related and work based child care. The child-care program has had some difficulties with some state governments. It was interesting to listen to the. previous speaker, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), criticising the government's child-care policies, saying that the government had had problems with its. child-care policies and it was all ideologically driven. I am very proud to be part of a government that does have policies, particularly policies which are based on the ideology of access and equity, enabling people to enter the work force. I think it is a fair comment that the opposition does not seem to have many policies on anything at the moment, particularly on child care. I think it is one of the last areas that members of the opposition should criticise the government on because it is, after all, this government that has done so much to provide child care forAustraIian families in the last 12 years. Notwithstanding that, we have had some difficulties with state governments. We have only got to look at the record for some of the conservative states to understand that the opposition is hardly in a position to criticise the government on policies like child care. Dr Theophanous interjectinggovernment-that is, the Kennett government-took 2Y2 years to sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreerilent. It finally did so recently: Even worse than that, the previous New South Wales government did not sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement for 4Y2 years. This was despite the fact that the previous Premier seemed to have forgotten the fact that he had not signed it and actually claimed during the election campaign that he had signed it until it was pointed out to him that that was not true. I 1lm very pl-ased to say that within weeks of coming into power the Carr Labor government has indeed signed the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement. So now the families of New South Wales, particu1arly areas with young popUlations and fast growing populations, like my electorate, can finally get access to the affordable, quality child care that they should have after having had 'to waitJor nearly five years to access the places available under the Commonwealth-state child-care program. I do not think the opposition is in a very strong position to attack the government on child care of all things.",158,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Haviland,"Of course, as the parliamentary secretary points out, the VictorianMC 798 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 The other area covered by the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) which I want to cover today relates to Medicare, and the enhancement of our universal health insurance system to provide access for all Australians to quality health care while at the same time keeping the costs of Medicare in check. The amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 correct a number of drafting errors and allow for the appointment as presidents of the Professional Services Review Tribunal of people who hold, or have held, judicial office in state and territory jurisdictions. This corrects an oversight in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which, by not defining 'judicial office', by virtue of section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 prevented the appointment of current and former judicial office holders in jurisdictions other than that of the Commonwealth. The amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act also enable the commission to retain evidential material seized pursuant to the execution of a search warrant until the reason for seizure no longer exists or until a decision is made not to use it as evidence. That is a very important area, also. I have spoken at least two or three times in the House on this sort of issue, particularly on the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Act when it was first debated and passed by the House of Representatives. That arose out of concern about the tendency of some doctors-a minority of doctors-to abuse Medicare through overservicing or excessive servicing, which has been a problem that has been around for some time. The Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Act has been the best attempt so far to address that, providing the Health Insurance Commission with enhanced powers and clearer legislation to be able to combat overservicing by medical practitioners. The first public acknowledgment of the extent of medical fraud and overservicing came to light in February 1982, when the then opposition health spokesperson, Dr Blewett, revealed some information that had come from the health department stating that the extent of abuse of the pre-Medicare health system was up to $100 million a year. That was for the 1980-81 financial year, and $100 million then represented about seven per cent of the total Commonwealth medical benefits and fund benefits paid under the previous health system, so that was obviously of some concern. . It was interesting that, shortly after that revelation, documents from the Department of Health verified that that was an accurate estimate based on the very complex computer system known as the fraud and overservicing detection system, or FODS. The AMA supported that estimate when its actuaries had had a look at it. In those days, before Medicare, when the AMA was not trying to beat the Labor government around the head about Medicare, it was quite happy to support that estimate as being a true reflection of the extent of abuse. That led to a Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry which was set up in February 1992 to inquire into medical fraud and overservicing. It is interesting that the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee at the time was the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly). There was a rather amusing little article in the Sun-Herald a couple of weeks ago stating that the honourable member for Bradfield and I had more in common than people might have realised. Apart from the fact that we both lost preselection on the same day, he was the chair of the committee which set up that inquiry, and the inquiry ultimately led to administrative arrangements which ended up meaning that I had a new job, back in 1984. Also, I was involved in presenting submissions to that inquiry in 1984. Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC799 The Public Accounts Committee inquiry produced interim report No. 203 in December 1982, which was a fairly damning report on the administration by the Department of Health of the program which was supposed to curb abuses of the health insurance system as it was then. That resulted in the removal of the director-general of health and the resignation of the director in Victoria. Following hard on the heels of the Costigan report on tax avoidance, it was a fairly embarrassing report for the then Fraser government, which acted fairly quickly and put in some new administrative arrangements. They were put into place throughout 1983, after the election which changed the government. . In 1984, the Labor government introduced Medicare, which changed things dramatically in the health insurance system. It brought in the universal health insurance system which survives and, in fact, thrives today. It is indeed the best and fairest and most equitable health system that Australia has ever had and, I would suggest, one which other countries, including the United States, look at with some envy. As I mentioned before, the AMA tended to change its attitude towards these issues after Medicare came in, although it had opposed it at the time. I was working in the health department's surveillance investigation program then and we found that we were being undermined both from within the department, by some of the medicos who worked for the department, and also in the community. We were called 'Big Brother' and all sorts of other names because we were starting to have some effect with the help of the FODS computer system that I mentioned. We were starting to produce reports, although slowly, because computerisation and technology were not what they are today in terms of timely reports and things. But we were starting to show some results which were potentially very embarrassing to sections of the medical profession, so we were targeted. What ended up happening was that there was a huge political bunfight over Medicare, with the surgeons in New South Wales going on strike. Part of the way that the dispute over Medicare was resolved was that, at a hearing of the Public Accounts Committee on 27 March 1985, the minister announced that our function of combating medical fraud and overservicing would be taken over by the Health Insurance Commission. That was meant to resolve a political problem. It was an understandable decision, though one that a lot of my work colleagues at the time did not agree with, and the commission then assumed responsibility for the program. About seven years later, in late 1992, the Auditor-General's Audit report No. 17 was fairly scathing of the commission's work in this particular program. It suggested that the estimate of seven per cent of the total Medicare benefits as the level of abuse-which had been mentioned in 1982 and never really discredited, although a lot of people had tried to do socould still be valid at the time of that report, that is, in 1992. I mentioned in a speech on some health legislation in 1993 that, if it was still seven per cent, that would amount to over $300 million in 1992-93 terms. If it was still seven per cent today, it would be a lot more than that it would be more than $350 million a year. That is not to say, of course, that any government program that could possibly be put in place would ever recover $350 million. I am not suggesting that. That would be a bit like saying that if a million people a year broke the speed limit on the F5 freeway and were fined $150, you could recover $150 million. Of course, you would never catch all the people speeding, so you could never recover that much money. But I believe it is certainly an estimate of the level of abuse, although it is acknowledged that you could never possibly reduce that totally. MC 800 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 I think the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 is the best attempt so far by any government to put in place measures to deal with this very important issue. It is very important because, as good as Medicare is, and as much as I support Medicare, it does cost a lot of money. It now costs over $5 billion a year in medical benefits schedule payments alone. That is a lot of money out of the budget and we need to make sure that the costs do not escalate any more. There is a lot of pressure in the community for Medicare to cover other types of health care, such as dental consultations, chiropractic, and everything else. There is a pretty good social justice argument for it to cover those areas: why should the medical profession have a monopoly over coverage under Medicare? But if you look at the economics of it, there is no way, politically, that you could justify extending Medicare benefits. It would simply cost too much money and it would not be very popular to stick the Medicare levy up to five per cent or something like that; it just would not be politically tenable for anyone to do that. Therefore, it is even more important that measures be put in place to prevent abuses of Medicare so the integrity of Medicare is protected and everybody can benefit. This legislation and certainly these amendments are very important to ensure that the professional review tribunal can operate and can be effective. I am hopeful that it will be more effective than the previous system with the medical services committees of inquiry. They were never very effective. They took years to resolve cases and, considering the potential number of cases, they looked only at a small number. The new system should work a lot better and these amendments to the legislation are very important in that system. I am pleased to be able to speak on this bill and I commend it to the Main Committee. and to reaffirm that the coalition will not be opposing the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995.I want to comment on the previous speech made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mf Haviland) regarding child care. Most of my comments will address child-care issues. The honourable member mentioned that child care is not a welfare issue, that it is too important. In fact, that is a discriminatory comment because certain parts of child care are treated as welfare issues in Australia. The Labor Party only discovered child care at the last election. I will talk about that later. To recapitulate, the bill is an omnibus bill which covers the Childcare Rebate Act 1995, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953-which was a good year-and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Most of the amendments proposed in this bill are lengthy but basically straightforward. I will be addressing my remarks exclusively to the child-care amendment and the whole issue of child care under this government and its departments. My research has come from discussions with a group in Western Australia called Choices for Family, particularly its Western Australian spokesperson Shelley Curry. I will use a lot of her words today. I am sure people realise that there are four topics which should not be discussed at a dinner party. The first is religion. We have argued over this since time began. It has caused numerous holy wars; there are a couple going on at the moment in the world. It is best to avoid talking about it because the debate might break out about the hypocrisy of the faithful or the true believers, or, as they are now called, the few believers. The other topic that should not be discussed at a dinner party is sex. It is not a topic to be talked about as people tuck into a hearty meal. People would also agree that politics is a no-no",159,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Richard Evans (Cowan) (11.42 A.m.),"I join this debate to support my colleaguesWednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 801 topic for discussion at any dinner party. Lively debate normally follows any discussion on politics. Even the suggestion of the Prime Minister's name might bring forward colourful language. As I move into this particular field of endeavour, more and more I find that people either love or despise politicians, and usually despise is the case. However, I must comment that the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke is not controversial any more. I think everyone agrees about him these days. There is a fourth taboo topic that should not be discussed. If we were in the 1960s, it would probably be the Vietnam War. If we were in the 1970s, it would probably be nuclear energy. But we are in the 1990s. The taboo subject not to be discussed at dinner parties these days is child care. It can, of course, be discussed at great length, but only if the child-care situation of all the other guests at the dinner party has been tactfully sus sed out. Unfortunately, we have to work out where we stand on this very contentious issue before we can freely talk about it. It is a bit like politics: people either love it or hate it. The reason child care is so -ontentious these days is that it is, in fact, politics. Child-care is no longer a simple matter of deciding what best suits your family needs and aspirations. Child care is no longer a matter of choice. We now have to weigh up our desires as parents against a powerful system of carrots and sticks aimed at channelling parents into becoming two-income families. The Childcare Rebate Act is part of the process. Parents are subtly and not so subtly being told that, if they are at home with their children these days, they are just not cutting it. It appears that the business of nurturing a child is now some sort of hobby, that it is a pleasant way to spend one's leisure but not really worthwhile. This is the line being pushed by the Labor feminist lobby of recent times. Ms Eva Cox, the convener of the Women's Economic Think Tank, social policy analyst and spokesperson for the New South Wales Women's Electoral Lobby, recently stated on the ABC radio program the World Today: The people who benefit from having a woman at home is the man, not the community, not necessarily the children. I mean, it's very nice having time off with your kids . . . but it is not something which has a clear public benefit, it's a private benefit, and it ought to be seen as such. Ms Cox has lost touch with reality and has no concept of what it is to fully nurture a child, to have an interdependent relationship. Clearly she does not recognise that having children is something which does and should require adjustments to one's life and sacrifices of one's own desires to some degree. The men Ms Cox so scathingly sees as the beneficiaries in such a family arrangement, like most of the single-income families of today, sacrifice considerable wealth by agreeing to work as a team in partnership with their spouse and support the mother of their children at home. Apparently this point is totally disregarded by Ms Cox. And does the working mother always benefit? It seems all too often the working mother ends up under the strain of having two full-time jobs, all the while feeling torn between the two. Sure, working mothers may be a public benefit-Ms Cox probably thinks it is great for the affirmation of her feminist ideology-but at whose expense? Children are not a pleasant accessory to one's life. For most parents they become the focus of and the real purpose to their lives. Yet this attitude that parents share is continually derided by people like Ms Cox and those opposite pushing the same sort of line. I am sure honourable members are aware that these days many families are under pressure both financially and socially to have both parents in the paid work force. Now that the taxation assessment system for most families has no recognition whatsoever of the dependants being MC 802 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 supported by the wage earner in a single-income family, some families are doing it rather tough. The government has finally recognised this difficulty by introducing their latest bandaid, a one-off payment on the birth of one's child. It is just about enough to cover the extraordinary bill from the obstetrician, but then people are left on their own. Parents at home now receive the home child-care allowance, which is about to pass into history and be re-configured as the parenting allowance. The point I am trying to make is that the payment comes from the social security system and, therefore, could be interpreted as saying that families with a parent caring for children at home are a burden on the taxpayer. The government clearly agrees, because it calls the most natural child care 'welfare' as it pays it through the social security system. On the other hand, the Childcare Rebate Act allows double-income parents to receive childcare fee relief and, if their income exceeds the means test maximum, they can also receive the child-care cash rebate. This is considered by the government as an entitlement. The previous speaker alluded to that as well, saying that it is an entitlement for working parents but not an entitlement for single-income families, and that single-income families are welfare. Child care is considered a work-related expense by the government. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her junior, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), were indignant in their defence of the payment, insisting it is quite different from welfare. It is a work-related expense, they say. It is also non-means tested. Assuming that it is a work-related expense, then surely the single-income family with a spouse caring for children at home should be considered a work-related expense. After all, if one spouse, usually the mother, did not give up paid employment to look after the children, surely the other spouse would have to. Maybe child care is not seen as a co-parental responsibility. Maybe it is seen as a woman-only responsibility by the government-it seems that could be the case-or maybe parental child care is not considered as legitimate as formal child care. I agree with the Choice for Families group when it says that child care is not a work related expense; and it seems the tax department agrees too. Child care is, in fact, a cost of having children. Whether parents relinquish an income to do this so-called work themselves or pay someone else to do it, it is a cost of having children. The cost is incurred because one has children that must be cared for. It is the very existence of children whose needs must be met that requires financial sacrifice. The choice as to how best to meet those needs should be made by families, not coerced by the government. The policies of the government, and legislation like the act we are amending today, are placing artificial divisions between families according to the decisions they are making in relation to child care and child rearing. I could have said that these families are making choices about child care, but for some families there is no real choice. For instance, if families are living in rural areas, there is no real choice about child care. If a family has a child with a disability, there is no real choice, although this amendment does address the eligibility for rebate for some of those families. If a family has a multiple birth, there is no real choice. If a family cannot survive on one income, there is no real choice. If parents believe that nurturing their own children is the only way to parent, then there really is no choice. Yet this government, so full of platitudes and rhetoric about families, appears to place greater value on the choice to become a two-income family. It seems that child rearing is only a legitimate occupation if one pays someone else to do it. If parents do this work themselves, then the time it takes, the energy and the skill all disappear, and such parents are seen by many Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 803 as being in a mindless state of dreaming along at home with no real work to do. The truth is that these parents are working at providing-with the love of a parent, which no centre can provide-all that is needed to nurture children. They are providing a safe environment, nutrients, stimulation, rest, life experience, opportunities for conceptual formation and, of vital importance, bonding: a long-term relationship of commitment to that particular child. It can be unglamorous work, requiring a hardy self-image and given no social recognition, yet many parents feel they must do it. They endure it because it is of a vital importance to them. Yet, for doing so, they are deemed non-working, and their contribution is totally disregarded by people like Ms Cox and those that determine Labor Party policy. Of course, there is an alternative to this. One can use paid child care. That is to be high quality care, and that should be so. We must surely provide the best care for our nation's children, because our children are our future. Support services are being put in place, and rightly so. There are well targeted subsidies and fee relief to assist families with the cost of child care, and rightly so. No-one argues against it. But there should be a balance. This provision should not be at the expense of those who provide child care at home. Support services should be balanced and equally provided to families who chose both paths or either path. Families that provide child care should not be treated as welfare recipients, and should be given the opportunity of lifting their status. They are treated as welfare recipients, yet they pay for the social security system. The child care debate is discriminating against those families that provide their own child care, and this should not be so. Government policies are creating nice little boxes for families, but the fact is that most families do not fit these nice little boxes. Many parents of families are neither fully at home nor fully in the work force. Child-care arrangements will always change as the child grows, yet the government does not seem to recognise this sort of diversity. For instance, parents who chose shift work in order to do their own child care get neither the parenting allowance nor the child-care cash rebate. Those that share a job miss out. In my electorate I have a couple of teachers who are parents and who share a job-one works two days and the other works three days-so they can look after their family. They miss out, while some on extremely high incomes get support. The issue of child care is complex and costly, and it is also discriminatory and entirely confusing. It is time we had a look at the way we provide support for families. We should be treating their welfare, in particular the welfare of children, as the real priority. It is time we developed an approach to family support that recognises the diversity of families without seeking to socially engineer their child-care choices, as this Labor government does and would have us do. It means that the government is really into social engineering. It brings these policies forward to get elected, and then it does not understand the ramifications of them. The future of our nation relies heavily on the health and well-being of our children. It is truly unfortunate that children do not figure too much in government legislation. Too often money does, but children do not. Too often the ALP tosses money at problems and hopes that solutions can be found; it does not actually go back to the core and prevent. It is clear in the matter of child care that the government has in fact got it wrong. I support the amendments to this bill, and I call for an urgent review into our nation's childcare policy and legislation. I give notice that I will be moving a motion, and in fact I will be writing to the chairman of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs asking for an MC 804 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 inquiry into child-care policy. If in fact this cannot be done in the term of this particular government, because an election is now due, I am sure that the Liberal Party will do it once we are in government. . The Liberal Party really is the party that is working for the family. In particular we are taking on board this child-care issue as one of the most important issues affecting the community. In fact, in marginal seats like mine I can say that it will be an issue at the next election. Unfortunately the Labor Party has not recognised this; it tries to discriminate between stay-at-home parents and working parents; it is trying to force parents back into the work force, and that is not good for their children. I will just give a little anecdote before I finish, Mr Deputy Speaker. The other day I went to a child-care centre. A three-month-old baby was lying in a pram by itself. There was a cold wind, but it was lying there goo-goo-gaaing and all that sort of stuff. I went over and stroked its face. It responded immediately; it wanted to touch, it wanted to play. This child was one of 15 children, some of whom were in a sandpit, which the child carer was looking after at the time. This three-months-old child has been at this child-care centre since it was six weeks old. Now this child really needs the parents' love, but the parents probably have to work, they probably have to in fact look to their income. What is causing these parents to work? Why are we not trying to help these children by allowing parents to stay at home? Parents staying at home are treated as though they are on welfare, and that is totally different. I support the amendments to this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I look forward to a further discussion on child-care policy nationally. section of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) I would like to speak on relates to the Therapeutic Goods Act. On 18 December last year a constituent of mine Mr Maurice Czarniack was fined $96,000 for allegedly breaching the Therapeutic Goods Act. I am still of the belief that Mr Czarniack was victimised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, with the full support of the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley. Mr Czarniack is an ordinary sort of a man. I do not mean that in a disparaging way; he is a very pleasant person, but he is just an ordinary small businessman, a pharmacist, who produced a mixture, amongst others, called 'Well Being Essiac Herbal Mist' which the Therapeutic Goods Administration apparently, at the request of larger pharmaceutical companies, deemed to be in breach of the Therapeutic Goods Act, despite it being made only of food products. I wrote to the then minister for health about this on 11 November 1993, 13 months before Mr Czarniack was charged. The day before that,ll federal police raided his house, his business and his mother's home, causing, as you can imagine, considerable stress to himself and his family. And all of this was because of an alleged breach of the TGA: 11 federal police raiding his business and his home. You would think the man was some kind of rabid terrorist. Mr Czarniack's argument was that his product only contained food products and, therefore, was not in breach of the TGA and did not fall within the definition of the TGA. This bill amends the TGA to include the definition of food, which has not previously been included. How such a definition would be interpreted by the courts in relation to Mr Czarniack's case I am not sure, but following the guilty verdict against Mr Czarniack in December last year",162,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Cameron (Stirling) (11.58 A.m.),"I will only be speaking briefly today, but theWednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 805 I issued a media statement calling for food to be included in the definition of the TGA. I therefore give this amendment my reserved support. Let me say at this stage that I am a cynic in relation to these particular creams and potions. Notwithstanding that, everyone must be treated as equal before the law. On this occasion I do not believe that Mr Czarniack was treated fairly at all. Mr Czarniack's products are all natural. I have actually seen him eat them; I do not know what they tasted like. In fact, the active ingredient is egg. Without egg, which apparently provides nutrients to the skin, his products are ineffective. Mr Czarniack was fined $96,000. Why was he fined that amount of money when the act did not define food? That is what his products were. The only thing was that, although Mr Czarniack ate it, the product was wiped onto the skin. At least that was what was suggested. Why, for his putting egg into his product, were Mr Czarniack's home, his pharmacy and his parents' home raided by 11 Federal Police officers? One of Mr Czarniack's biggest problems was that there were no secrecy provisions. He had invented a product, but if he registered it with the TGA it would reveal its contents. I am informed that a large pharmaceutical company lodged the complaint against Mr Czarniack simply because he was offering competition. Now a small businessman is $96,000 worse off. The other point worth noting is that, while the TGA rules that his products are therapeutic for the purposes of its act, the tax department views them as cosmetic so that it can hit him with a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. Mr Czarniack was advancing to the stage of exporting his products. Now, because of a poorly drafted law, a minister acting at the behest of a large pharmaceutical company and the fear of those companies of competition, he is back to being a struggling small businessman. The Therapeutic Goods Administration stands condemned for its refusal to share intelligent dialogue with Mr Czarniack and, instead, hunting him to issue a massive fine of $96,000. I am not sure that these amendments would assist Mr Czarniack any more but I hope that highlighting this particular case brings to the government's attention the concerns of small inventors who have innocently gone about their business, have not mixed a chemical or lethal cocktail of any kind but have been harassed and abused by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We might just remember that for one egg a constituent of mine was raided by 11 federal police and fined $96,000. That is appalling and it is also fairly stupid. The news last night had the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) looking at recent inventions. This is one invention the government has put the kybosh Â·on without any fair or logical reason. I trust that the government will consider such cases when looking at this legislation in the future. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Cal well-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (12.03 p.m.)-in reply-I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and also the honourable members for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), Eden-Monaro( Mr Snow), Goldstein (Dr Kemp), Macarthur ( Mr Haviland), Stirling( Mr Cameron) and Cowan( Mr Richard Evans) for their contribution to this debate. AlsoI thank the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Chisholm, for his overall endorsement of this package of much needed legislation. I note the shadow minister's comments about increased industry involvement in the aged care industry. On behalf of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) I spend a lot of time with nursing home proprietors and workers, opening various nursing homes and hostels all over the country, and most importantly with nursing home and hostel residents. MC 806 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 We believe that the correct arrangements are those that put the residents first, as they should be. The government is similarly concerned to protect the rights of consumers and to maintain confidence in the provision of nursing home care and especially personal care in nursing homes. Indeed, this is one of the clear aims of the amendments to the act. The outcome standards were developed as a direct result of wide consultation. The booklet Living in a nursing home, which was published in 1987, contained the material which subsequently led to the minister making standards under section 45D of the National Health Act 1953. The shadow minister mentioned several cases or accusations that the enforcement of outcome standards has been inconsistent and sometimes harsh. It is true that several complaints have been lodged with the Commonwealth Ombudsman. However, it should be pointed out that, up to this point, no such complaints have been upheld by the Ombudsman. Professor Braithwaite from the ANU reported on a study done into the reliability and validity of nursing home standards in 1991, on 50 standards monitoring team visits in New South Wales and Victoria, involving some 30 teams. In general terms, Professor Braithwaite found that outcome standards could be monitored both consistently and with validity. Some degree of inconsistency was found to have existed in the variation in the standards met between the states, but we are remedying that. In response to Professor Braithwaite's reports, the government has introduced a national consistency strategy to ensure variations are kept to a minimum. The strategy includes: national training for standards monitors; exchanges between monitors from different states; holding national standards workshops; compliance sheets and statements being selectively explained and reviewed between central and states offices; staff attending standard review days in different states; and maintenance and analysis of a database holding information on each visit to nursing homes and hostels, which allows analysis of textural justifications being given for reining in problem standards. These initiatives were positively acknowledged in Professor Braithwaite's 1993 report Raising the standards. I make those comments in response to the shadow minister's statement about consistency. In other words, we were already aware of this issue and have already acted on it, so he is a bit behind in his comments in relation to that matter. But I would hope that he would take on board what has already been done and what is being done. On the question of peer review, the government is not clear what the opposition actually means by the reference to peer review in relation to the regulation of outcome standards. On the one hand, the opposition states that it supports consumer confidence in the provision of care in nursing homes, yet when faced with the example of nursing homes where these standards are not met, it can only suggest that peer review will somehow remedy the situation. I want to just issue a warning about peer review. It is all very well to say that we should allow this industry, in a sense, to regulate itself. But it was found in other areas of government that, if we allow too much freedom in this area, we will end up with a situation where cases that should be controlled are not. That is one of the big issues. The opposition appears to be unaware of the present involvement of the nursing home industry in the review of standards. Each state and territory has a standards review panel which is set up under section 45E of the National Health Act 1953. These panels consider appeals from nursing home proprietors who are dissatisfied with the departmental assessments. Each panel has an industry representative, Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 807 together with a consumer representative. Accordingly, a significant level of peer review already exists, but, as I said, it has to be measured. I would like to tum now to the comments of the member for Goldstein. The government does have a policy, a strong commitment and a proud record in relation to child care. I thought it was quite extraordinary to hear him talking about ideologically driven policy on child care when he has been the representative for many years, both in the academic world and the political world, of the most ideologically driven philosophy that has occurred in this country and, indeed, in the whole of the Western world in the last 40 years. I am referring to the New Right, Thatcherite philosophy of which he has been one of the prominent spokespersons and one of the prominent supporters. So, coming from the member for Goldstein, that was a bit rich! But let me say very clearly: the government's policies in relation to child care are based on a comprehensive assessment of the way in which we need to meet needs of people-real needs, of real people. It is based on a philosophy, yes. But the philosophy is one that is generally accepted by the vast proportion of the Australian community, and I refer to the social justice principles. Those social justice principles are the very principles we have been trying to talk members of the opposition into ever since they went into opposition in 1983. They still seem incapable of understanding that the Australian community is committed to and interested in social justice principles. But, having said that, can we just give a few facts about child care? Since 1983, funded places have increased from 46,000 to over 250,000 as at December 1994. The government has made a commitment to meet demand for work related child care by 2001. Similarly, expenditure has increased from $65 million in 1992-93 to an estimated:-listen to this, Mr Deputy Speaker-$1.53 billion in 1998-99. Affordability of child care has also been enhanced by the introduction of child-care assistance and by extending the number of eligible families; the implementing of the child-care cash rebate which recognised child-care costs as a legitimate expense of working; and the implementation of quality improvement and accreditation. Having said all that, I wish to reiterate that the 1995 budget continues the government's commitment to families, with continued substantial growth in children's services programs that were approved and the targeting of the program for working families. The budget also recognises the need for occasional care by providing 12 hours per child per week for development sessions. The member for Goldstein tried to make this into a negative. Instead of a positive, he tried to make it into a negative. The further recognition of occasional child care was made into a negative. What an extraordinary statement from an opposition which wanted, prior to the last election, to cut billions of dollars off social programs and which now refuses to tell the people what it wants to do, refuses to state any policy because everyone knows that the moment it states its social policies it will involve substantial cuts in areas such as child care. I thought that the speech of the honourable member, given his record and his ideological predilections, was amazing. The rebate, of course, is part of the government's ongoing commitment to assist families with work related child care. The rebate is not means tested, consistent with the practice of not means testing the work-related concessions. At 29 May 1995, 244,000 families had registered for the cash rebate and 201,000 had claimed a rebate. New registrations are running at 2,000 a week. There is evidence that many families have not yet established a regular MC 808 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 claiming pattern, but we are hoping that they will do so. Amendments will address issues which have arisen since the establishment of the scheme in 1994 and will strengthen the rebate scheme. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. In response to the member for Cowan, the government's support for the child-care cash rebate is part of this government's continuing commitment to assist families with children. The rebate is part of a comprehensive package of assistance for families whatever their employment circumstances. These payments include family payments, current home child-care allowance and the new parenting allowance, maternity allowance and, 'Of course, child-care assistance. This package of payments responds to work force participation patterns which suggest that today most women will spend some time in the paid work force and some time at home caring for their children. The government believes that the policies in place ate appropriate and beneficial whilst offering a real choice for all women, whether at home or in the work force. . CanI also say that I am advised that the member for Stirling's claims are .not entirely accurate. The case he referred to is an emotive one and subject to much. publicity. Mr Czarniack has pursued his claims on appeal through all avenues. We, of course, encourage that and, where people have a just case, we look at it. I am not in a position to further comment on this case, but I can say that the government is always open to considering cases where there are allegations of injustice in the delivery of services. Mr Deputy Speaker, in your comments as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro you asked for the consideration of a particular drug involved in the treatment of various mental illnesses-I think it was Clozapine-and whether or not we can look into the question of the provision of that drug without people having to go to a hospital with a psychiatrist. Twill take up this matter with the minister and will respond to you at the appropriate time once I have a response from the minister. I want to thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate . .It pas been an important debate. I apologise that the second reading speech was so long but we had so many pieces of legislation to deal with. I commend the bill to the House and to the parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Motion (by Dr Theophanous)-by leave-agreed to: That the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Consideration resumed from 29 March. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The bill amends defence legislation for the following purposes: to enable senior acting appointments to be made at ministerial level rather than by the Governor General; to replace provisions under which officers hold their appointments at the Governor General's pleasure; to implement recommendations of the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review;",166,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Punch (Barton,"Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (12.17 p.m.)-I move:Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 809 to extend the home loan assistance application deadline for a limited group of former members; and to ensure that the military superannuation and benefits scheme complies with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. I will deal with these matters in tum. The first amendment will enable the appointment of officers to act as the Chief of the Defence Force, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force to be made by the minister rather than the Governor General. This will streamline the procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden on the Governor General. The second group of amendments concerns retirement and termination of appointments. At present the Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act and Air Force Regulations provide that officers hold their appointment at the Governor General's pleasure. Under the existing provisions, officers could be retired or have their appointments terminated at any time and on any grounds or for no grounds at all. The Defence Force is the last major Commonwealth career group subject to the concept of holding office at pleasure. This concept is no longer appropriate to a career service. The amendments to the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act replace the current blanket provisions with provisions that specify the grounds on which an officer can be retired early or have an appointment terminated. The amendments also introduce specific procedures for the management initiated early retirement of officers and enable the promotion of senior officers on limited tenure where they accept a promotion on that condition. Corresponding amendments will be made to the Air Force Regulations. While these amendments will give the defence organisation management flexibility, they also increase the level of protection available to affected officers. Under the proposed provisions an officer could only be retired early or have an appointment terminated where one of the specified grounds is made out, or where the officer is subject to the management initiated early retirement procedures. Where appropriate, an officer to be retired early or have an appointment terminated would be given the reasons in writing for the proposed action and an opportunity to show cause why it should not proceed. The main exception would be where the period of fixed term appointment had expired, often referred to as a short service commission. Affected officers would also have the right to lodge an application for redress of grievance under the Defence Force Regulations and are entitled to submit a complaint with the Defence Force Ombudsman. Similar safeguards apply to the management initiated early retirement procedures. In addition, I emphasise that management initiated early retirement would only occur after all attempts to redeploy or retrain an affected officer had been exhausted and would be accompanied by the offer of a financial package. The third group of amendments is to the Defence Force Discipline Act, which provides a scheme of discipline for all members of the Defence Force. The legislation came into operation, provision was made for a board of review to review its operations after three years. The board found that the scheme was generally adequate but made a number of recommendations to enhance its operation. These proposed amendments to the act would achieve this and also bring the act into line with the Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions for the investigation of offences. Perhaps the key amendments are those which enable the appointment of discipline officers to deal with minor infringements of discipline. The board found that the present procedures MC810 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 for dealing with minor infractions are unnecessarily complex and administratively burdensome. A discipline officer will have the power to decide, with a minimum of formality, matters which do not have any element of criminality and to impose minor punishments. These will not carry the stigma of a criminal conviction. I should emphasise that the discipline officer will only be able to deal with uncontested matters and a person who wishes to defend the matter will have the right to a full hearing under the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act. Where an accused person does wish to have the case handled by a discipline officer, there will be no entitlement to representation but the right to call evidence in mitigation of punishment will apply. Three new offences are created: unlawful discharge of a weapon, and refusal to submit to a medical examination or supply a specimen where a medical examination is being carried out as part of the investigation of a service offence. The latter offences will obviously assist the prosecution of offences involving drug abuse. The Defence Force has in place a firm no drugs policy and the maximum penalty for use and poss-ssion of cannabis is to be increased from a fine equivalent to seven days pay to a fine of 14 days pay for a first offence and dismissal from the Defence Force for a subsequent offence. Sentencing options for minor offences will be enhanced by introducing the punishment of extra drill, to a maximum of three hours spread over three days, increasing the maximum period of extra duties from three to seven days, and enabling suspension of the payment of all fines. Currently members of the Defence Force who are suspended from duty pending the investigation of an alleged offence or suspended while awaiting trial for a civil or criminal offence are entitled to payment of salary and allowances. This entitlement will be removed where a suspended member has been charged with an offence. Such a member will, however, be entitled to engage in employment outside the Defence Force during the period of suspension. These changes will parallel the provisions applying to the Australian Public Service. The remaining amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act will streamline existing procedures for the conduct of investigations and hearings conducted by service tribunals and bring certain provisions in the act, such as those dealing with confessions, into line with current Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions. The bill also amends the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Act to overcome a defect in the administration of the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme. In 1992 the act was amended to provide access to the home loans scheme to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force after 14 May 1985 and were discharged because of a compensable disability before 15 May 1991, provided these persons applied for an entitlement certificate by 1 September 1994. While the changes to the act were publicised widely through service and ex-service channels at the time, it was nevertheless considered that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to attempt to contact every former member who might benefit and who might otherwise not become aware of the benefit. Unfortunately, some former members received late advice of the changes. As a result, some 17 applicants were debarred because the cut-off date of 1 September 1994 for lodging applications had already passed. Accordingly, the bill extends the time limit from 1 September to 1 December 1994, so that these persons will not be disadvantaged. Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 811 The final amendments made by the bill are to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act. This act establishes the current superannuation scheme for members of the Defence Force. The amendments will allow the military superannuation and benefits scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which provides for enhanced prudential supervision of superannuation funds. The amendments are of a technical nature and relate to the decision making powers and roles of the board of trustees and the minister. They are similar to amendments made last year to the superannuation legislation relating to Commonwealth civilian schemes. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act requires, among other things, that the trustees of superannuation entities not be subject to direction by any person and that the approval of the trustees must be obtained for any change to the governing rules of the scheme. In the case of the military superannuation and benefits scheme, the governing rules would include the trust deed and regulations. The amendments remove the present requirement for the trustees to have regard to statements of government policy in exercising their functions, and provide that financial statements be in a form agreed between the board of trustees and the minister, and require the agreement of the board of trustees to any changes to the trust deed or the regulations. Honourable members will appreciate from my comments on the individual measures that this legislation is essentially part of the ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force. With this in mind, I look forward to the House's support for the legislation. It is not expected to have a significant financial impact. I commend the bill to the House. Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, but I want to say a few things about it. In opening, there are two comments I would make regarding the procedures of this chamber. Firstly, I find it absolutely ridiculous that a member having been expelled from the other place and being responsible for this legislation-in this instance, the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey)-is not able to respond as he should to this measure this morning. be shown by members of the government to the House, including by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating). Had they shown respect, and did they show respect, I would treat the intervention with a little more good humour than I do. There is an aspect that members of the government need to recognise, and that is that attendance in this chamber is not counted as attendance in the main chamber. In other words, if you are present here in the Main Committee, even if you make a contribution-as Minister Punch, who has just made his second reading speech, has made his contribution here-but you do not at any time this day attend in the main chamber, then you will not be noted as being present in parliament. It therefore seems quite ridiculous to me that somebody who is not allowed to be in the main chamber is apparently not allowed to be here in the Main Committee, even though his presence here is not counted as his being present there. It is just one of those little things which strikes me as being slightly ridiculous.",170,Representatives Main Committee

249,Mr Sinclair,"We could talk very happily about the degree to which respect needs toMC 812 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 The second point that I wanted to make is really quite significant. I know the honourable member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan) is on the Procedure Committee. It is important that ministers' second reading speeches, as we now know them, be made part of the first reading rather than the second reading process. I believe it would be very helpful, in most instances, for second reading speeches-such as that which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Punch) has just given and which we are now about to consider-to in fact be presented at. the time of introduction of the legislation. There are several aspects to this, not the least being that, as all members are aware, the courts now take into account a minister's second reading speech in interpreting the context of a bill. So that there can be more informed debate, I think it is appropriate that that second reading speech become a first reading speech, and that time be allocated for that purpose in the main chamber-or here in the Main Committee if that is where it is being presented, as it is in this instance-so that there can be some knowledge of the purpose and content of the bill. I put those recommendations forward for serious consideration in matters unrelated to this particular debate. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is an interesting bill. I am always fascinated by ministerial rhetoric, so I was glad to hear that it is part of the government's 'ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force'. Pardon me if I am slightly cynical about the degree to which that can be said to apply to these amendments. However, I will look at the bill in detail, and then come back and comment upon them. There are certainly aspects of the amendments which concern me. Indeed, I wonder whether it is not part of a wider political agenda which includes starving the Defence Force of funds in certain directions. I think that is quite seriously affecting the morale and good humour of those in uniform in a way which does not appeal to me, nor do I think it is for the nation's good. I am concerned about the extent to which some of these amendments do not seem to contribute towards the better management of the defence service, but contribute to the containment of blow-outs in expenditure and premature redundancy rather than anything else. As the minister has indicated, the package covers a number of other individual pieces of legislation in respect of the services. He identified the principal content of the bill. I want to go through each section. As I have said, in spite of my cynicism about the purpose of the legislation, the opposition will not be opposing it, although there are aspects of it about which I am concerned. I would like to get some response from the minister in due course, if I may. The changes with respect to the Military Superannuation Benefits Act no doubt make sense. They are in line with other changes. I certainly see no reason for them not to be approved. Similarly, the change to the deadline within the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act r makes sense. am appalled that apparently 17 people did not receive notice in time. I wonder how and why. In fact, in other circumstances individuals have had great difficulty in getting any response from the Defence Force on a number of issues. It concerns me that letters to the services are not replied to in time or are not replied to at all. I regard it as ordinary good practice in office administration to answer letters. I know of a number of instances where letters have not been answered by the Defence Force, and in this instance apparently 17 letters were not posted in time. Whatever the reason, it is not administratively efficient and, while it might be a bit of a leap, it strikes me that if people are incompetent in doing little things then they are not necessarily competent in doing big things. It is unfortunate that a change has to be made to legislation simply because these letters were Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC813 not posted in time to enable those applicants to take advantage of this particular change to the home loans assistance legislation. In any event, the opposition does not oppose the measure included within this bill to extend the time limit from 1 September to 1 December. Under the amendment of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, I am sure that all those who are serving are delighted to know that they will be able to get their punishment of extra drill to only a maximum of three hours spread over three days. I think that that sounds like a far more rational treatment than some that one can recall. I must admit that if one goes back to the days of Nelson, rum, sodomy and the lash it is significantly better. I am glad to know that at least in some things we have improved the lot of those in uniform. shown at times, my friend. That is part of the problem. My cynicism is based on experience of deteriorating morale and reduced capacity in training. We are having these new Collins class submarines built 'but I gather that at the very best we are going to be able to man three of them. It rather concerns me that the same applies to the PC3s, the long range maritime patrol aircraft; and to the FAI8s. I certainly do not think we are providing enough funds at the sharp end of the services to keep people trained. That is a bit of a diversion but the opposition does not oppose that part of the amendment. I notice in the minister's second reading speech a phrase that I just wanted to comment on. I would appreciate it if he could respond. He may not be able to do so at the. moment but I think it would be worth checking. In his second reading speech-and I did not check it in the bill-he says: ... members of the Defence Force who are suspended from duty pending the investigation of an alleged offence or suspended while awaiting trial for a civil or criminal offence are entitled to the payment of salary and allowances. Of course, this is to be removed. My concern is that that person should go through some type of a preliminary hearing before being denied payment. I do notsee.suspension in an arbitrary fashion as necessarily judging that person guilty. In the services as much as in the civilian community a person is considered innocent until proved gUilty. If there is an arbitrary suspension I do not believe a denial of payment of salary and allowances is appropriate. While I accept this form and I am not going to dispute it I think that some preliminary process to determine the suspension is appropriate. I do not know whether departmental people. have that kind of power over the uniformed services anyway but I think that a quasi-judicial process is very important-it might be a mini court-martial; it might be a matter of the officer responsible taking evidence-but there needs to be some process. If that person is denied salary and allowances it is also of concern to me that service people, because of the location of the particular facility where they are operating, might be a long way from employment. We all know the difficulties that spouses have in getting employment when they are transferred, for example, from Victoria to Queensland. A nurse or a teacher often finds it hard to even get registration in that state. If such people are going to be denied the continued pay and allowances, I do not know whether that includes their housing. So there are aspects to it which I think need to be looked at. It is arbitrary and quite different from provisions applying to the Australian Public Service. A. public servant is normally in a place for a lot longer in an environment where he or she and the spouse can work reasonably if there is work available.

The way I read this measure at the moment it could be too arbitrary, and I have reservations about it for that reason. Above all, I think it essential that there be a preliminary hearing of a quasi-judicial nature which will ensure that there will be no arbitrary denial of natural justice to the person accused, nor a denial of that person's presumption of innocence, until such stage at least as there has been a consideration, because it is applying a penalty which in some instances could be extraordinarily severe. This is particularly so because many members of the defence forces really are denied the opportunity for both spouses to work; in other words, they are virtually in a single income family environment as distinct from the dual income that is now far more the common practice around Australia. So there are consequences of those changes which I think might well need review. I accept that they flow from recommendations of a committee. I know that there is the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal, but I am just a little concerned at those two aspects of it. If those matters cannot be answered now, I would appreciate the minister having a look at them-that is, a quasi-judicial hearing, and an assurance that people will not be unduly disadvantaged because of the fact that people in uniform are a long way from nonnal facilities. I will move on. We come then to replacing the existing provisions of the Defence Act under which officers hold their appointments at the Governor General's pleasure. I accept that there is certainly a reason to try to change from a system which really is perhaps a little antiquated and one which is certainly not appropriate to career service, using the minister's language. I am concerned, however, at several aspects of this change. The first amendment is designed to streamline procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden for the Governor General. I am worried about the degree to which, if we are going to make people subject to definable terms, the government will use this newly introduced, management-initiated early retirement as, as one serviceman put it to me, an alternative redundancy scheme, because that would certainly be totally unacceptable. It should not be an early redundancy scheme. I understand that there are problems which in part flow because the number of senior vacancies now available may not be as great: The changes to be introduced are perhaps directed more to that than to the reason given in the minister's second reading speech. But I do have a worry that, in the character of the legislative change, it could be that people will be prejudiced by not receiving what I would see as a normal progression of appointment. There are problems that flow, no doubt, from the limited opportunities for service at a senior officer level. I know many positions that were previously available for a person of a two-star rank are now being downgraded to a one-star rank, and of course one-star appointments are now reduced to a colonel equivalent. In good industrial relations practice, were these people members of the bureaucracy, I am not too sure that they would be very taken by this type of enforced, management-initiated early retirement. I know there are forms of redundancy and that it all sounds great when you put a few more descriptive phrases around it, but I am just a bit suspicious of the industrial good practice that this represents. I note what the minister said. I accept that the services are now career services in a form that perhaps some might have said they were once not, although I doubt that anybody who served in the past would see them in that way. I accept that there is Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 815 more management flexibility, but I am a little concerned about the way it is being introduced and the consequences of it. There are several aspects of this first amendment which enable the appointment of officers to act as Chief of the Defence Force, Vice-Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force to be made by a minister rather than the Governor General. I am very apprehensive about any change that removes the Executive Council right and responsibility. The Executive Council is largely an unknown body as far as most members of the public are concerned. It is a group that does not necessarily achieve the publicity that ministers attract. If a regulation is passed or a particular appointment is made, it is the inevitable consequence that people note-whatever is passed or the person appointed-rather than the procedure that enacts it. As all ministers are well aware, even attending Executive Council for some can be seen as something of a burden. But Executive Council is as important a part of our democratic system as cabinet or as any other facet of ministerial responsibility. Within Executive Council, where there always needs to be at least three persons present, it is possible for appointments to be questioned. It is possible for an entirely independent person, the Governor General, or, if he is not present, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to pass judgment on the particular merit of a recommendation. As soon as you remove that power and make something subject to a minister's fiat then it creates a little bit of a difficulty. I say that because the minister, obviously, is going to have his prejudices. The minister may not be, with all the goodwill in the world, acting necessarily in what some would see as a dispassionate and independent way. I have long felt that appointments by the Executive Council have a great advantage. I note the minister's argument is that this change is going to: ... streamline the procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden on the Governor General However, I suggest that that is one of the reasons why we have Governors-General, to exercise that administrative burden, to act as the President of the Executive Council and to be able to provide a bit of dispassionate judgment. I know that those who are keen advocates of the republican cause might say, 'Well, it shouldn't be for a Governor General, it should be for a President.' Whatever the form of government there needs to be an executive council and the Executive Council is a group which can judge dispassionately a minister's recommendation. Under our system, sadly, more often than not there is more effective scrutiny at Executive Council level than there can be in the parliament. That is because so often decisions are taken at executive level which even the honourable member for McEwen( Mr Cleeland) may not be aware of. I know that there are not too many that the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) does not consult him on but there are probably a number of areas where I suspect that the Governor General might be advised to a greater degree. In those circumstances I suspect that it is advantageous to have an Executive Council determination. I accept the change and note that it is going to be by appointment by the minister. I know it is only an acting appointment-I know all those thingsbut it is the last straw on the camel's back. I have some reservations about it. MC 816 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 May 1995 I note also another aspect, another one of my concerns that has been there. for a while. It is now part of the system. It is the pecking order and the way it is listed that I am n.ot particularly happy about. You will note the order, and the minister has impeccably put. them in the correct order. He mentions: . .. the Chief of the Defence Force, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of a,n arm of the Defence Force In days gone by this is something that would have snuck in. A few years ago the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force was the most junior of the three stars in the services, and as far as I am concerned he still should be. As minister I pushed the joint service idea within the services and I still think it is the way to go. But there is a problem because of the way in which individual service chiefs are now relegated in the scheme of things behind the genÂ·eral dictates of wearing a purple uniform. I remain to be convinced that there is merit in promoting the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force to the exalted status of being No.2 in the pecking order. I believe he or she should still be behind the individual chiefs of the arms of the Defence Force, although I know that the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and the honourable member for Moncrieff probably, like me, wait with interest for the day when we will have a woman in any one of those positions. No doubt the day will come. Because of the time, perhaps that might be a debate we could have on another occasion. There are several other aspects that I want to mention briefly. There is, with respect to the Defence Force Discipline Act, one other change which I did not address and that is the new offences created. Firstly, there is the offence of unlawful discharge of a weapon. I have no doubt that there have been a number of instances which have promoted that particular change, and I believe that change is desirable. Secondly, I wanted to address the offence of refusing to submit to a medical examination or supply a specimen. This is an interesting change. The question of the degree to which there is a capacity to be able to enforce the testing of people for AIDS in the ordinary civilian community is a matter of some public debate. I am one of those who believes that, given the consequences for the person providing professional health care, there is an advantage in having obligatory testing. I know that in this instance it is said to be because of the no drugs policy in the Defence Force, a policy which I totally endorse. This is a procedure and practice which really does have considerable merit in the assessment of whether or not a person is subject to AIDS, as much as to whether or not a person is subject to drugs. It worries me that in the community at large, health carers can be exposed unnecessarily to the possible consequences of treating people, simply because they are unaware that their patients may be subject to AIDS or to other highly contagious diseases. Indeed, Ebola, another one of those very contagious diseases which has been tragically apparent in Zaire recently, is something that we all note with horror and we trust it will never appear in Australia. That particular change to the legislation is important and is certainly to be endorsed. Before concluding my response to the legislation, there were two things that I really wanted to say. Firstly, I am concerned about the management initiated early retirement and limited tenure appointment conditions. I see them as being introduced not because of good management to the services, but because of the way in which manpower generally is being restricted within the defence vote, in order to acquire new equipment and to maintain a modem defence force. Nobody can deny that it is essential. Nobody can deny that, in the nature and character of trying to ensure that the ADF is able to meet any contingency, we should spend Wednesday, 31 May 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 817 a significant amount of money on re-equipment. My worry is that there also is a need to maintain a balance between the funds provided at the manpower and training end and the equipment end. I am not happy with the present situation in the services. There are a number of areas that need to be modified. I am one of those who remain to be convinced that the ready reserve is the way to go. I was taken by a speech made by a very distinguished former major-general in the Australian Defence Force, Mike Jeffery, only last week. He was talking of the extent to which we could commit those 3,700 regular soldiers who leave the army each year to a part-time commitment of seven days service annually for five years. I am impressed by the idea of utilising the skills of those who retire, particularly those who are still in an age bracket where they are can make a contribution. We need to use those people to a greater degree than we do now. I would like to see such a group being able to transfer into the reserves in a more appropriate way. Major General Jeffery talks of making them a territorial reserve. There is no doubt that we do have difficulties in being able to adequately defend the many facilities we have in this far-flung continent of ours. I suspect that reserves are the way in which we can best do that, rather than. utilising the members of the permanent forces. It is time that we looked at contingency planning, in order to better utilise the higher level of skill that is now apparent in everybody in the Defence Force. There is no doubt that, with the marked development of technology and the re-equipment, it is necessary to have a higher level of skill. That brings with it a consequently greater loss when the training, the experience and the education of a former member of the ADF goes back into the civilian force. Indeed, we are all conscious of the degree to which, for example, the civilian airlines for years have relied on the training of the RAAF to provide a constant regeneration of personnel for their new air fleets, and even for the maintenance of their existing air fleets. So the idea of looking for some way in which we can get better use of those who are retiring from the permanent forces is something that should be addressed. If we did that, and we provided more money so that we could better maintain the morale of people in the services, we would be a lot better off. When we start talking about management-initiated early retirement and limited tenure appointments, the consequences concern me. I think that both measures place a particular responsibility on the chiefs of the respective services: the navy, the army and the air force. Were this measure to be introduced in this form in the Australian Public Service, I think many people in the Public Service would be very sceptical. They would be worried about being given promotions to higher levels for temporary periods of time. It just does not work in civilian employment, or, if it works, it does not work to quite the same degree. I acknowledge that there have been a number of temporary appointments in the services, over the years. It has always been a practice of the system. But I am a little concerned about the way in which it is going to be played out. For that reason, I think that the success or otherwise of this measure is going to depend very much on the way in which it is administered. For that reason, the various chiefs of the defence forces will need to be very careful, as I am sure they will be. The opposition does not oppose the measures. But, as I say, I do have some particular reservations about some aspects of the legislation. Debate (on motion by Mr Cleeland) adjourned.
