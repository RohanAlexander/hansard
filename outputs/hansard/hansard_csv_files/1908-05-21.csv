2,Mr Bowden,"Has the Prime Minisin Papua, reported in to-day's newspapers, and will he inform' the House if any arrangement has teen made by his Depart-, ment for the survey of the boundary line between German and British New Guinea? formation, but .that from unofficial sources Is quite credible. British miners, working in territory beyond the Papuan border,, when asked by German officials for dues required of persons mining in German Kew Guinea, have paid them. As to the statement that a constable had heen taken capfive, the fact appears to be that he offered himself as a guide.' In neither case has there been friction or aggression. As I informed the House a few weeks ago, we have sent a letter to the Colonial Office requesting it to ask the German Government to authorize the local Administration of German New Guinea to meet our representatives with a view to a final determination of the boundary. the Prime Minister-i . Has his attention been called to a cablegram in this morning's papers, stating that the attention of the Imperial Government had been called byquestion in the House of Commons to the '-' unsatisfactory state of affairs existing in lation will soon become large enough to Papua""? 2. Has his attention been called to an article in to-day's Age dealing with the need for administrative reforms in I'apua, and setting out the position thus : -(« ) The Minister for External Affairs knows "" little oinothing of the doings of 'the local nominee Legislative Council; (i) Efforts have been made to secure the passing of Ordinances in Council favouring the -compulsory acquisition of native lands, and :the taxation of natives for enforced labour -purposes? 3. Have the issues raised in -this article received attention yet? What steps have been taken to place the Public Service and administration generally of Papua on a proper basis; and can the Prime Minister say when an Administrator will be appointed? thing justifying the allusion in the House of Commons to Papuan affairs, because, apart from the difficulty which' arose in connection with the application for land-By certain officials, there has been nothing to call for attention. Probably some exaggerated newspaper statement has given rise to the question. Administrative difficulties existed at the time of the land difficulty, to which T propose to make allusion at an t early date, in view of a statement from the Director of Agriculture, which should be taken into account. There is no administrative friction now, so far as I know. now as it was before. it is only those to whose .views effect has not been given who are dissatisfied. Even where there are not representative assemblies there are parties and the statements of neither side in regard to its opponents is to be received without qualification. In my opinion, the present administration of the Territory is satisfactory. What was proposed in regard to the native lands is a comparatively old story. The Government of Papua submitted a land ordinance, one of whose clauses contained ambiguous, terms as to the mariner in which land might -be acquired from the natives. As the wording did not satisfy me, I sent back the ordinance, so that the clause' might be expressed in terms which would put it beyond doubt that the native lands are not to be trenched upon. The proposal emanated from non-official members of tlie Council, selected to temporarily represent the white settlers; but I hope that settlement'will proceed so fast that, the popujustify some form of representative government. This will enable the views of the people, which are entitled to be taken into consideration, to be clearly expressed. I hope to provide for the appointment of Administrator in the course of the next three or four months. replying to the question put by the honourable member for Calare, said that the opinion that friction now existed in the Public Service of Papua was held only by what might he called the ""opposition party"" in the Territory. Does he regard the Anglican Bishop of New Guinea-who , when in Melbourne -recently, made strong statements bearing out the contention that friction does exist-as being numbered amongst the opposition in Papua, and will he take care that the appointment of an Administrator is made whilst this House is sitting and not during arecess ? which side the Bishop of New Guinea is to be ranked, but should suppose that he could not be properly classed with either. Without knowing the source of his information, I am unable to say whether he shares the view that friction exists. As to the. second question put by the honourable member, -I have",14,Difficulties Ap

9,Mr Deakin,"I am not aware onalready said that I hope that an Administrator will be appointed three or four months hence, and Parliament is not likely then to be in recess. most the whole of the white population of Papua desire that the present Acting Administrator shall be permanently appointed, and has not that fact been conveyed to the Prime Minister by a member of the Legislative Council of the Territory? doubt whether the present nominee members of theCouncil-wh o are not Government officials, but were nominated after inquiry on the recommendation of the late Administrator-reall y do on all questions represent the exact opinions of those whom they were appointed to represent, I reply that they have made a recommendation in that behalf. population by petition urged the appointment of the present Acting Administrator to the permanent office ? certaining whether the nominee members speak on behalf of the whole white population, or merely express their individual opinions. As experienced members of the Council, their opinion, apart from any other consideration, is entitled to weight; but 1 am unable to say how far they Speak on behalf of the people outside oh that particular point. the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that, although, certain gentlemen claimed to voice the opinions of the white residents of Papua in reference to the permanent appointment of the present Acting Administrator, their action has since been repudiated by other white residents of the Territory? tions, both commendatory of, and in opposition to, the proposition of those gentlemen. In each case individual opinions only were expressed. the Minister of Trade and Customs some information about the sugar industry. Referring to the deputation from the Queensland sugar growers who waited on him yesterday with a view to secure his consent to a reduction of wages on the plantations, was a shorthand note taken of what transpired at the interview ? If so, will he cause a transcript of the proceedings to be laid on the library table ? Isi t true that one of the deputation contended that 3s. c-d. per day was adequate payment for white workI s it. not a fact that alers on the plantations, or that the planters could not afford to pay more? D i d the deputation deny the Minister's contention that the rate of payment for day work should be higher than when the worker is engaged by the week? What is the substance of the regulation to which the deputation took exception? .Does he intend to comply with the wishes of the deputation by so altering the regulation as to bring about a reduction of the wages of the workers engaged in this industry ? notice it would be difficult, as requested by the honourable member, to deal seriatim with the questions that he has put to me. A deputation waited on me yesterday, and as I had a shorthand writer present I shall be able to make available to honourable members a report of the proceedings. It was contended I have no means of asthat the new rate for casual labourers fixed under the order issued this month-namely , 5s. per day and keep-wa s too high, and that the industry could not stand it . I felt that the evidence on which the order was issued was sufficient to warrant it, and I shall be pleased to furnish honourable members with a f u l l report of what took place at the deputation, so that they may learn for themselves what representations were made. I should like to ask and what answer was given. Treasurer noticed the resolution passed by the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, now sitting in Brisbane, to the effect that as the Commonwealth is arranging to mint its own silver, it is desirable I have had communicathat the decimal system of coinage should be simultaneously adopted? Is he also aware that a Commonwealth Committee on coinage and weights and measures reported in favour of the decimal system, and that its report was adopted by this House? Further, will he take that report into careI desire to elicit from f u l consideration when arranging for the coinage of silver by the Commonwealth ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have not seen the resolution to which the honourable member has referred, but the whole question has been brought prominently before me on several occasions. The matter requires careful consideration, and probably joint action by Australia in regard to the decimal system",15,Difficulties Ap

I have given it consideration, and intend to discuss it with the Prime Minister before making any definite promise as to what is likely to be done. to ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that the Committee did consider the question of whether the Commonwealth should await the adoption by the Empire of decimal coinage and of the metric system, or whether it should anticipate that adoption, and that this House also had that question before it when it adopted the report of the Committee ?

Mr J. H . CATTS -I s the Prime Minthe view, though now erroneous, that they were ister in favour of the Tariff being submitted liable to pay, stipulating at the same time that to a referendum of the people at the next should the final Court of Appeal decide to the general election? at the next general election the Tariff will be submitted to the criticism of the electors by all candidates who choose to express their views upon it . the interests of the Commonwealth would be served by submitting the Tariff to a referendum, which, after all, would have a merely negative effect. We could receixe a direction to alter the Tariff without any ciear indication of what alteration should bo made. ' Mr J. H . CATTS I desire to ast the Prime Minister whether, in view of the urgent need of securing an expression I desire of opinion, from the electors upon the Tariff-especiall y in the absence of any legislation in regard to the new protection -h e will hurry on the general elections when such an expression of opinion may be obtained? honourable member realizes that the first part of his question is to be taken seriously, because any proposition in regard to an existing Tariff would require to be accompanied by alternatives. Otherwise, a I certainly will merely negative resolution might be affirmed, the effect of which would be to dislocate the business of the whole of the next Parliament. to think out the questions to be submitted. the honourable member's question divides itself into two parts, namely, the means a general election, and the grave and serious risk indicated by the interjection by the honourable member for West Sydney, that : the question might be submitted in such a way as to prejudice the public interest unless all the alternatives were presented to the. electors.

Of course, in Victoria where adult ing reference to the compilation of the suffrage does not prevail, the rolls must electoral rolls-question s t'o which I pronecessarily be different. ' mised an answeito-day. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked whether an official had been instructed by the tention of the Minister of Home Affairs to Department to deliver forms of applicathe fact that when speaking on the Election for enrolment in his electorate. The toral Bill, in 1902, I said that the States reply with which I have been furnished should be consulted witha view, if posisThe Department has no knowledge of the persimilated with the Commonwealth, franchise son referred to by Mr Mathews. The honourable member for Kennedy asked all the Parliaments. The only objection what steps were being taken in respect of then urged to that suggestion had reference the compilation of new rolls. The official to the State of Victoria. I wish to ask the reply isAction is being taken in all States with a view subsequently to the preparation of new rolls at an early date, sented by Committees in the same direction. and every endeavour is being made to secure the co-operation of the Governments of the several States in the matter. The honourable member for .Melbourne Ports also asked whether orders had been issued to returning officers to hold themselves in readiness for a general election. The reply with which I have been furnished isNo orders have been issued. The Returning Officers are expected to be in readiness to hold an election at a reasonably short notice whenever required. The honourable member for Boothby asked a question having reference to the removal of names from the electoral rolls, and the answer with which I have been furnished readsThe officers are well informed as to their duties under the Act in relation to the purification of roils. If Mr Batcnelor will submit any names said to have been improperly removed from the rolls, the matter will be investigated. the Minister's reply that the Commonwealth rolls are being compiled with the assistance of State officials, I desire to ask whether the Department is confining itself to the information given by those officials, seeing that the franchise for the Commonwealth is of a more liberal character that the franchise for some of the States. I need scarcely point out that if the Commonwealth officials are confining themselves to the information supplied by State officials, many persons will be disfranchised? officials were relying upon the State officials, but that they were acting in co-operation with them.

58,Mr Chanter ' (Riverina) [3.7],"I was prevented from doing so. The session is drawing to a close, or so it is believed, and the time at our disposal is limited; and my only object is to have a Select Committee appointed to inquire into the facts and mete out justice. It is not necessary, nor is it proper, that I should go into the whole of the facts, seeing that I am asking for an inquiry in order that steps may be taken to have justice done to those concerned. my duty, however, to advance some reasons for my opinion that justice has not been done, and to suggest a remedy. When Parliament passed the Post and Telegraph Act, giving the Postmaster General power to act on his own initiative, honourable members thought that an action of such gravity as one involving interference with the liberty of the subject by preventing a business firm from receiving the correspondence of its clients, would not be taken unless approved by the whole Cabinet. plain been the result of an Executive act, the position would be very different; but I believe that the House, like every other British Assembly, will declare that no punishment shall be meted out to an accused person until he has been given an opportunity to refute the charges brought against him. Hood, of the Victorian Bench, laid it down as a principle of law that no person should be punished without trial, and the honourable member for Flinders, in dealing proGladstone, made a similar statement. Dr. Rentoul, too, as recently as yesterday, laid down the dictum that trial should precede punishment. But the Minister has not acted on that maxim. tent to act on the statements of one side without giving the firm affected an opportunity to reply to the charges brought against it . ferentiated between this firm and others?

I He do not propose to discuss the merits of this case; but I hold that' if the Postmaster-General took action on what he believed were sufficient grounds, the House should be so informed, in order that it may be able to deal fairly wifh the complaints of this firm.

Only the other day I heard a legal luminary declare that it was very difficult for any man' to be unbiased, because his experience naturally inclined him either one way or the other. In the present instance, the action of a particular firm has been called into question by the Postmaster-General. The course which he has pursued may be either right or wrong. The honourable member for Riverina motion with a view to righting the injustice to which he considers the firm in question has been subjected. I have nothing to say as to the conduct of that firm. I know nothing concerning it beyond that which I have gleaned from advertisements which I have read in the newspapers. It is true that'a member of the firm endeavoured to interview me upon one or two occasions, but I declined to see him, because I desired to be able to deal with this question without any bias whatever I am quite prepared -to support any inquiry into the action of the Postmaster-General which is likely to be a thorough and satisfactory one. But I ask honourable members to consider whether the proposal of trie honourable member for Riverina, if adopted, is likely to result in such an inquiry? In the first place, he merely proposes the appointment of a Select Committee, which has no powei to take evidence upon oath. empowered by the House to take evidence upon oath. put witnesses upon their oath, it will be of no value whatever.

I do not think it necessary to go into details in respect of the nature of the business which this firm apparently carries on. No medical men with any experience can be ignorant of the fact that persons has submitted a have suffered untold injury as tbe result of illegitimate practice of the character suggested. Another' objection which I would urge to the proposal under consideration relates to the personnel of the Committee which the honourable member for Riverina desires. That Committee includes the names of the honourable member for Illawarra and the honourable member' for Capricornia-bot h of whom sit upon this side of the House-the honourable member for . Kalgoorlie, the honourable member for New England, and the honourable member for Riverina, who sit upon' the opposite sideof the Chamber. I do not think that such a Committee constitutes a well-balanced selection of the members of this House. Personally, I should like to see a somewhat larger Committee appointed, and I think that it ought to include the names of one-or two members of the medical profession who are also members of the House. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Riverina did be not include members of the medical profession in his proposal. Quite recently, when the City Coroner proposed to sit alone upon If the Committee cannot an inquest into the Sunshine railway accident, we know 'that public feeling was aroused to such an extent -that persons with technical knowledge were selected as a jury to assist him in his investigations. give evidence.

IRVINE There is the right to appeal to Parliament against the administrative act of any Minister, and Parliament can say that it does not approve of what has been, done. That is the only appeal. tried on the floor of the House. Mr W. H . IRVINE -No; but when the action of a Minister intrusted with the responsibility of administering a Department is questioned, the challenge cannot be made in the courts of law. Unless you do away with the whole basis of responsible government, it must be made in Parliament. The only appeal is to Parliament, when wrong is alleged to have been done by an act of administration. I am not aware, in any community under responsible government, of any other appeal, from the exercise of his discretion by a .Minister which has done wrong to an individual, than that provided in the right of every member of Parliament to ask the House to condemn the Minister's action. I challenge the Prime Minister to bring forward any case to the contrary. For. my part, I am of opinion that the Postmaster-General's action was justified by the facts of the case, and I was entirely with him until I heard his extraordinary statement, which showed his attitude and that of the Ministry to be subversive of the very principle of responsible government. External Affairs) [4.14] -On this question I hold an opinion quite opposed td that just expressed by the honourable and learned member for Flinders. When Parliament conferred upon a Minister charged with the control of a Department power, without consulting the Cabinet, to take action which may affect the prosperitv, and even the solvency of any private business or private citizen, it took an unusual step, and one difficult to parallel, though it might be to some extent illustrated by the powers conferred in other Acts. A decision such as that of the Postmaster-General can be taken Committee to inquire into every act of adat any time, whether Parliament is or is not judication by. the Minister of Trade and in session, and it is in its essence judicial. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Then is it not to responsibility ? be exercised until both parties have been heard ? cised. A number of judicial acts are done Minister allow the appointment of a Selecton cx parte representations,' and the PostCommittee to inquire into the case of every might have to act upon practically ex parte representation. But the fact that the act is really judicial place's on the Minister the responsibility of hearing both sides, whenever that is possible. In this case he has done so, and I , being acquainted with all the facts, agree that he has acted rightly. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Ho w does.it differ from an ordinary administrative act? honourable and learned member for Flinders, who endorses the action of the Postmaster General, seems to be that when a citizen of this country who considers that he has been wronged by that action comes to this House, which is the only tribunal available to him Mr W. H . IRVINE -If,wronge d by administrative act. learned member declines to make a distinction between this and other administrative acts. But I draw a broad distinction. There have been numerous cases in which a House recognising the impossibility, without undue expenditure of time, of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion, has appointed Committees or Boards to inquire for it into matters with which 'it was competent to deal without such reference. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Does the honourable' member speak of inquiries as to the right or wrong of an administrative act? the consequences of such an act may have been to deprive of one of the greatest necessities of civilization the humblest citizen in the land, or to strike a blow at the foundations of one of its greatest commercial institutions, by cutting it off from post and telegraph communication. . wha did such a thing be cut off from the Ministry? that course when he thinks it right to do so. The question . is whether there is an appeal, and, if so, to what court? The only appeal is to Parliament. Mr W. H .

Replying to the honourable and learned member for Flinders, I say that while there have been important Customs cases in which the transactions challenged have stretched over long periods, in everv such instance there is a right to appeal to the courts of law.

The courts are closed to the complaint. the proposition of the honourable member for Riverina impugned the authority of Parliament or the responsibility of the Ministry, no one would be more prompt than I to resent it.

The step proposed to be taken by the Government is new. I know of no case in my parliamentary experience which has presented similar features' or demanded similar action. In order to meet the position at once we have improvised a course of action which I believe to be essentially just to the person complaining, and also just to those who are inclined upon the facts known to uphold the action of the Government. Jt is unjust to no person, and is not unconstitutional in any sense. Ministers are prepared to welcome the appointment of any Committee of Inquiry, no matter how searching it may be, and when that Committee reports they will accept f u l l responsibility for dealing with its recommendations as they have accepted it for their past actions. I had no intention of speaking upon this matter until it assumed a very grave aspect in respect of the practice of this House. The extraordinary announcement of the Prime Minister, however, has elevated it from a simple protest against the action of the Postmaster-General into a high constitutional question. The honourable member for Flinders has very properly pointed out that the course proposed by the Government is a complete departure from constitutional practice. The Prime Minister has admitted that he knows of no precedent for such a course, and that 'the whole movement has been improvised by the Government to escape from a situation which has no parallel in our Australian history. previously arisen when a man was denied the right of appeal to a Court. with the points connected with this case in my own way. The Prime Minister has affirmed that no similar case has arisen or could have arisen. But that does not get rid of the charge made by the honourable member for Flinders, that the Government proposal is a complete abrogation of their obligation to deal exclusively with matters of administration. Everybody with an elementary knowledge of constitutional practice knows that legislation is a matter for the Parliament and administration a matter for the Executive. As soon as the The y are reflected in Government are unable to satisfy the House by their methods of administration they am referring to the are called upon to take the opinion of honourable members as to their fitness to retain their positions. I am entirely in I am perfectly preaccord with the honourable member for Flinders in regard to the constitutional aspect of this question. But after sitting here for seven years I begin to look upon a regard for constitutional practice as being 'somewhat archaic. We have not had responsible government since 1901. Can honourable members say that we had an exhibition of responsible government last night when the Treasurer ber must not refer to another debate. come so accustomed to this loose view of constitutional practice that even the Prime 'Minister begins to forget the guiding principles of that branch of knowledge. He now tells us not only that it is constitutional for the Postmaster-General to admit that his action should be the subject of independent inquiry by the House, but that when the proposal for an inquiry is about to be put from the Chair, he and the whole of his colleagues will leave the .House and express no opinion one way. or the other. Surely, if the Prime Minister thinks that the decision of the Postmaster-General is a just one, he and his colleagues should remain in the Chamber and assist to negative the proposal of the honourable member. If , on the other hand, they think it just to have his decision reviewed, they should support the motion. Certainly they ought not to run away. I agree with the Prime Minister that the occasion is somewhat unique, because under the Post and Telegraph Act we have placed unusually arbitrary powers in the hands of the Postnot master-General-power s which have never previously been vested in a Minister.

I have never seen the papers relating to this matter. table of the Senate. mitted the Postmaster-General practically to stop the whole business of a firm which has no appeal. I charge the Government with moral cowardice in running away from this 1 motion. this Parliament has nothing whatever to do with the morality of the contents of letters. security of the King or of the Commonwealth, tlie Government have a perfect right to interfere. But, as carriers of letters, we have no more right to interfere in regard to the moral contents of letters than have the Railways Commissioners to inquire into the object of a man or a woman in travelling from Sydney to Melbourne. But since we have conferred this arbitrarypower upon the Postmaster-General there must be somesafety valve in cases of injustice^-otherwisee we have created and perpetuate a veritable Star Chamber. It is a monstrous proposition that a Postmaster General with ""goody goody"" notions such as are possessed by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, should be invested with the arbitrary ppwer to place an-embargo upon the whole correspondence of a business firm without a right of appeal. I do not care what the letters may contain -ther e must in all fairness be a right of appeal on the part of that firm. All that is proposed now is that there shall be an inquiry, and the proper course for the Government, if the Prime Minister was so anxious to do justice, was to say to the people concerned, "" It is true that the Minister has decided against.you, but, if you will name certain persons whom we ap' prove, we are perfectly willing to have an inquiry by an impartial tribunal, in order that we may ascertain in what way, if any,' the Minister has gone beyond a reasonable exercise of his powers."" To come to the House and say that they will allow this motion to be carried, but that they are not going to support it, because they do not care whether fhe Committee be appointed or not, is to take up, not only an unconstitutional, but a cowardly, attitude. If the H o w can we Government believe it just to have a Committee of inquiry, they ought to support the motion; or, if they think the motion un-just, they ought to oppose it. But I am beginning to be inured to breaches of constitutional practice. Mr W. H . IRVINE -This goes further than any breach we have seen hitherto. We have perso.

But I f those contents touch the constitutional practice is what we like to make it. We may carry on Parliament for years and make so many and constant inroads on recognised constitutional practice that at last the inroads become a part of our constitutional practice. I am perfectly satisfied to see an arbitrary power of the kind under discussion to some extent mitigated by the appointment of a Select Committee, in order that there may be an impartial inquiry as to whether those concerned have or have not received justice at the hands of the Postmaster-General. agree in the. main with the reasoning of the honourable member for Parkes. The position of the Government, as disclosed in the speech of the Prime Minister, is certainly the most extraordinary 1 have witnessed since I entered Parliament. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General had sufficient evidence to.justify the action he took; but I think that the Government, now that action has been taken, should know whether or not it is one which requires review, and they ought to have the courage to either support or oppose the motion. That appears to me to be the' straightforward attitude that the Government ought to adopt.

In the course of his remarks, reported in 12 A..L.R;, the Chief Justice saidBut it is clear that this is not merely a Ministerial duty; it is a duty involving the exercise of discretion, and upon which he must form his own independent judgment, and he may form a conclusion in one way'or the other; and this Court cannot revise his judgment in a case where he is called upon to exercise, his discretion. it was a It is quasi-judicial in this sense, that it is to be made upon evidence. That is admitted right through the judgment. It is said that this is not a judicial proceeding, because the parties cannot be heard; but I point out that it would be simply impossible in many of the cases for the parties to be heard prior to the prohibition. For instance, if it were desired that the promoters of a German lottery should be prohibited from sending circulars throughout Australia, the Postmaster General could not wait until they had been heard, because, :n the meantime, the country would be swamped with the circulars, the replies, and the lottery money sent, and the proper administration of the Act rendered impossible The prohibition JOHN FORREST -The honourable should be declared, followed by an in (mediate demand on the parties to show cause why it should not be continued.

I think I myself have drawn attention to the statements appearing in the press in regard to that matter. Some of those undesirables have already come under the official notice of magistrates in this country 'in a not too -creditable way. It is about time we put a stop to this kind of thing, especially as it for Parramatta has something of import, is now proposed to spenct.another sum for the repatriation of other Australians who have gone to New' Caledonia and other places: There does not appear to have been a careful watch kept over this expenditure, in order to see that it was applied only to thepurposes for which it was voted, and that the necessitous people who wished to be brought here had actually been residents previously of Australia. We ought not to vote this sum. the general discussion on these Estimates last night, I observed that as most of the money had been expended, any attempt to reduce a vote would be only so much wasted time. All we can do now is to avoid occupying the time of fhe Committee longer than is necessary.

We start on . this page with ""other printing,"" and end with "" Shackleton."" It is difficult to get anything out of .those items, but I know that the Prime Minister is only too glad of suggestions, no matter how humble the quarter they come from, for the improvement of his Department. The Department of External Affairs is one which is not usually very much in evidence at question time, but it controlsmatters of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth. I find that there is a vote of ,£20 put down for a paying officer in London.

Prime Minister is assisting the Chairman, and not the honourable member for Dalley. I am anxious to obey the Chairman's ruling, though I may appear to be trying to evade it. We have passed no better legislation than that covered by the Immigration Restriction Acti f it is properly administered, and none that will be more freely canvassed if the Act is not properly administered.. The reverse of immigration restriction is immigration encourgement, and whilst it is the duty of the Department of External Affairs to prevent the introduction of undesirable immigrants, I am afraid that the Department is not as active as it might be in encouraging the immigration of desirable immigrants. We know that at the present time there is a vast stream of emigration from Great Britain to other parts of the world. honourable member not to discuss that question. Minister sees the difficulty in which the honourable member for Parramatta and I are placed. The honourable gentleman's well known affability is of great advantage to him in the passing of the Estimates of Departments of which he has charge, and I trust that he will find a means in replying to the observations which have been made to afford information on the matters which have been referred to, both with respect to immigration and the course to be adopted in the future in making arrangements for advertising the Commonwealth. The sum of £550 is set down in connection with the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference in London, and I am sure that if the amount were increased by another .£500 it would not be considered too much to pay for the services 'which the Prime Minister performed for Australia during his recent .visit to the Old Country. It is not often that it is possible for men to pay compliments of this character to political opponents, but that is all the more reason why, where they are deserved, they should be paid to men who have satisfactorily performed a public duty. I recognise the value of the services which the Prime Minister rendered to Australia at the recent Conference, and also during his visit to watch the passing of the Commonwealth Constitution.. The Bill submitted by the honourable gentleman for expenses was about the lowest submitted by any representative of Australia. I think that should be said, although I do not suppose the honourable gentleman will thank me for putting it on record. The services rendered by the honourable gentleman at the Imperial Conference cannot be estimated in pounds, shillings, and pence. The' important work which he did during his visit was really surprising, and must have left him neither time nor energy to do work of a kind which would have claimed the attention of smaller men. tically opposed to the Prime Minister that is no reason why he should always be pouring out vitriol. A political oppo' nent does not lose his independence by recognising good work done by any public man holding different, political views.

It has been shown that the cost of living in Perth and the coastal districts of Western Australia is» sufficiently high to warrant an allowance of 5 per cent, to the public servants living there. The allowance paid to those on the gold-fields, however, was fixed on the assumption that the cost of living in Perth was the same as it is in Melbourne.

I find that he saysThe original district allowances were not based on a comparison between Perth and the gold-fields, but between the cost of living on the gold-fields and the eastern States. ' I have searched through the Public Service Commissioner's original classification scheme, and have been unable to find a sentence in it to support that assertion. My opinion is that this excuse is merely an after thought. actually used must have been the costof living in Perth. Moreover, there is extrinsic evidence that it was so based, because the district allowances paid to officers on the gold-fields and in the remoter parts of Western Australia prior to Federation were practically the same as those which the Public Service Commissioner recommended. And those allowances were fixed by the State Governmentof Western Australia upon the basis of the difference between the cost' of living on the gold-fields and in the remoter parts of the State, and' the cost of living in-and around Perth. That is at least corroborative evidence that the district allowances recommended by the Public Service Commissioner were not based upon a comparison between the cost of living on the gold-fields with the cost of living in the eastern States. In anv case, as the honourable member for Brisbane has pointed out, it is but justice thatofficers employed at remote stations should have their allowances relatively increased. I suggest that the Treasurer obtain another statement from the Public Service Commissioner. He should ask that officer where in his original classification scheme he has said that he based the district allowances upon a comparison between the cost of living on the gold-fields and in the eastern States. pared to submit the honourable member's remarks to the Public Sen-ice Commissioner. when the State Government fixed these district allowances they had regard entirely to the difference in the cost of living, in various parts of Western Australia, and not the cost in the other States.

But I may remind him that the matterto which I have, directed attention has given rise to a sense of injustice amongstofficers stationed in the remoter parts, not only of Western Australia, but of Queensland and New South.Wales.

732,The Chairman,"The r e is nothing in '£200 set down for incidental and petty cash expenditure upon page 18 of these Estimates. Probably the telephone message to which I refer is debited to that item. : Treasurer sent to the Department of Trade and Customs with a view to getting the covering paper of the Bulletin admitted free. I desire to ask the Treasurer whether the practice of long distance telephoning between the Departments is a general one, and whether it springs from any motive other than a desire to maintain secrecy. I ask the Treasurer to impress upon the Public Service Commissioner the necessity of again revising the district allowances granted to officers in the light of the experience gained under' the old classification. not in all, that is now being done. naturally arises where officers. are not treated alike. The officers located in almost every remote portion of Australia naturally think that they' labour under special disabilities. But I know that there is a strong feeling amongst South Australian officersparticularly amongst the linemen employed between Port Augusta and Western Australia-that they are very badly treated in the matter of these district allowances. In some cases they, were very much better off when they were under State control. For instance, one of the heavy items of expenditure with them is the cost which -they have to incur for the conveyance of rations and other goods. Owing to the extremely high cost of conveying goods to these distant parts, the South Australian Government used periodically to send up goods upon being requisitioned to do so, and to pay the cost of carriage. But under the present system the officers themselves have to pay that cost, and the district allowances do not nearly cover the-extra expenditure which they have to incur. I have been informed that no district allowances are paid to the linemen to whom I have referred. They feel that they labour under a special disability as compared with the Western Australian officers at Eucla. Whether this is so or not, I am not in a position to say, but certainly the complaint ought to be investigated. 1 know that there is a strong belief that the South Australian officers at Eucla are treated worse than are the Western Australian officers at .that place. While both technically receive the same district allowances, the fact is that all theWestern Australian officers have been placed in the senior positions. No doubt this is due to the fact that prior to Federation the Western Australian officers received higher salaries than did the. South Australian officers. But I desire to impress upon the Public Service' Commissioner the necessity of dealing out even-handed justice in' this matter. I wish also to emphasize the objection urged by the honourable member for North Sydney in regard to the large amounts involved in these Additional Estimates. He referred particularly to the amounts set down for contingencies. In my opinion, there is a great deal in his complaints. It seems to me that the Estimates-in-Chief should have provided more fully for the probable expenditure of the year, and the large sums appearing in the Additional Estimates are not evidence of foresight on the part of those responsible for their preparation. Proposed vote agreed to. . DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND CUSTOMS. Proposed vote (Divisions 37 to 45), r £12,867. [10.23] I should like some information in regard to the amount of £1,776 asked for_ in connection with Dr. Elanysz' experiments for the extermination of rabbits by communicating to them a disease. Does the amount cover the total expense. incurred by the Government, or will further accounts be presented later on, and has finality been reached in connection with the experiments ? I should be glad if the Treasurer would make a general statement as to the position of affairs. Some New South Wales pastoralists spent a large sum of money in bringing out Dr. Danysz, and when he returned to Europe strong efforts were made, by circularizing pastures,protection boards,' local government boards, progress committees, pastoralists' unions, and farmers and settlers' associations, to bring pressure on the Government to allow the dissemination of the virus on the mainland. Apparently that effort failed; but the public should know what view the Government take in regard to the request.

No doubt, however, the interests at stake are sufficiently strong to cause further efforts to be made to secure the end aimed at, namely, the free distribution of disease for the extermination of the rabbit pest. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.27] -This matter was intrusted to me at the outset by the Prime Minister. The history of the experiments ' is well known. The Department of Trade and Customs, of which I was head, took charge of the virus when it was brought to Australia, and it has been in Dr. Tidswell's keeping ever since. experiments should be made on Broughton Island, and we contributed towards the cost of erecting premises and obtaining animals for the purposes of the experiments -I saw Dr. Tidswell in Sydney last week, and as the assistant left behind by Dr. Danysz had complained that we intended to keep the virus and use it , taking credit for the destruction of the rabbits, which should be given to him, after consultation with the Prime MinisterI wired to Dr. Tidswell to send it back, which he has done.

It has not the effect which it was thought that it would have, realized the expectations of Dr. Danysz. find out, it has not. Dr. Tidswell says that there is an Australian microbe similar to, if not the same as,' that introduced by D r. Danysz, but that it does not destroy the rabbits. He thinks that the Danysz virus, under natural conditions, would not have the effect expected from it , and that it is useless to experiment with it further. here paid to Dr. Tidswell? Sir WILLIAM LYNE covers the payments made for the purchase of animals and the erection of buildings, and to Dr. Tidswell, whose services were lent to us by the State. I believe'.that the New South Wales Government have made a further claim since these Estimates were prepared, but that the amount is small. still acting for the Commonwealth Government ? ' Sir' WILLIAM LYNE No ; the experiments have ceased. With the sendingaway of the virus his services to the Commonwealth ceased. ment taking care to prevent the introduction of the disease? done everything possible to prevent its introduction, and Dr. Tidswell says that the It was agreed that rumours afloat as to its introduction to the mainland are without foundation. He informs us that he has exercised great care, and is confident that none of the virus has. been distributed here. If D r . Danysz had any more virus in his possession we could not exercise any power over it . The virus is in small phials which one might carry in one's waistcoat pocket; but so f ar as I am aware Dr. Tidswell has exercised every precaution to'prevent it reaching the mainland.. again to call attention to the extent of the proposed votes in the Estimates of this Department as well as in those relating to all other Departments in respect of rem-' porary assistance The honourable member for North' Sydney has protested strongly against the enormous expenditure for which provision is made under the headings of "" Miscellaneous"" and "" Incidental expenditure and petty cash.""

Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.42] -On these Estimates we are asking for a sum of nearly £ 5 , 0 0 0 for the purpose of temporary assistance. When honourable members recollect the. amount of , revenue which we have collected' and, the extra workwhich we have had to do, and when I mention that the heads of the Department advise that they do not expect the same amount of work to be done next year, no doubt they will recognise at once how unwise it would be for us to make permanent appointments until it. is made clear that there is permanent work to be done. That accounts for the increased amount for temporary assistance. I agree with the honourable member for Lang that it is most undesirable that we should have temporary men doing any work which is of a permanent character. As soon as it is made clear that any work is of a permanent character, I think it is desirable that permanent bands should be employed. As a justification for these items, I may mention that last year the revenue amounted to ,£9,753,000, and that this year it is estimated that it will be £11,931,000 The. cost of collecting the ""Customs and Excise revenue last year was £ 2 13s. 3d. per cent., and the cost this year is estimated at .£2 7s. 6d. per' cent. It will be seen that the cost is decreasing. Considering ""the tremendous increase in the work, that messages relating to the Tariff have been passing between the Houses, and that whenever a Tariff item has been dealt with a telegram has had to be despatched to every Customs House in the Commonwealth, honourable members tan easily understand that,, not only do we require a lot of temporary assistance, but also that our account for telegrams must be very large. telephones ? stand that the honourable member dealt with that question on the Estimates for the ""Treasurer's Department.

[16.52] I had intended to make reference to the question of experiments with the rabbit virus. I should like to ask the Minister' whether the Commonwealth Government have completely obliterated the whole question of rabbit extermination from their minds, because, in my opinion, there is no more serious question to Australia.
