Is the Minister aware of that, and if so, will he have the schedule corrected? glad if the honourable member will give notice of his question.

I propose to put before the Committee the testimony of a free-trader who was a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, and who was deservedly respected by all parties in the House. The gentleman in question, Sir William McMillan, who was deputy leader of the Opposition in this House, and has been at all times a free-trader, took part in the Federal referendum campaign, and is reported to have said :Victoria has been under a protective tariff for many years, and the.result of that protective tariff is that thousands of pounds worth of articles which come in here through our ports never come in through Victoria's ports at a l l , because they are either produced or manufactured in Victoria. Now supposing for one moment that when the Federal Parliament meets, the average tariff of Australia, which may be called the Victorian tariff, is adopted, you will see clearly that this colony (N.S.W.) having been for many years under a free trade system, must take years before it works out the result of a protective system.

But the feeling undoubtedly exists that it ought to be established, and we know that an attempt has been made to establish it. The honourable member for Parkes is well aware that Lithgow is a place which offers special advantages for the establishment of the iron industry on account of the coal and lime deposits in the vicinity. He also knows that in the .past large sums have been expended there in an attempt to establish the iron industry, and that those efforts have failed. . My own opinion is that their failure was due to the fact that a combination of importers had determined that the industry should not be established, and had so contrived to control prices as to crush it out of existence. A t Mr Sandford's works at the present time there is a large stock of pig-iron on hand. Only the other day South Australia wanted a few thousand tons of that class of iron. Sandford Proprietary reduced the cost of that iron to an amount which was only just sufficient to cover its actual production. But what did the importers do? They at once contrived to reduce the price of pigiron below the cost of production. order to kill the industry, they actually sold the iron for considerably less than they had _sold it for previously, and for less than fhey have demanded for it since. is not merely a question of a few pounds; He suggested that we should follow the it means importations to the value of about bad example of the States in the past, -£7,000,000 per annum,. strive by every means in our powerI lay a further burden of interest on fhe care not how, so long as the end is atpeople.

But, personally, I am quite prepared to errant to industries such a measure of protection as will equalize the wages paid in foreign countries and those paid in Australia. It seems to me that, if we deal with dumping, the natural protection which our industries enjoy should be sufficient to adequately protect them. If we go further than that, it appears to me that for the sake of a few operatives and manufacturers we shall be taxing thousands. The honourable member for Riverina appears to be absolutely mad upon the . question of protection. He declares that when once we initiate a system of protective duties it"" does not matter if we levy imposts amounting to hundreds per cent. But would the honourable member apply that argument to industries which employ only 200 or 300 men, and produce commo1 dities used by thousands of working people ? those ? We have only to look at the Tariff to ascertain how many men are employed in the industries concerned; and the question is whether it is worthwhile, by giving protection, to increase prices', and perhaps tax 1,000 people for the sake of 100. case of the kind.

U n fortunately, however, extreme protectionists go further, and tax the primary producer up to the hilt, at the same time declaring that he will benefit by the, process. I do not see how the primary producer can benefit under such circumstances. I should like, to say a word or two now as to the new protection. High protectionists tell us that when industries have become established under protection prices come down lower than previous to the Tariff, by reason of internal competition. If that be true, I do not know how the unfortunate workers are to fare. We know that under the new protection the workers are very naturallyand justly determined to claim as big a share as possible of the enhanced prices. unfortunate workers in free-trade countries ? ing with the position of the new protecT h e y are numerous. tionists.

361,Mr Archer,"I shall refer to that,adversely criticise in any way the Tariff, because the Acting Prime Minister"" seems to get so angry. In the last short session, before the Imperial Conference, the honourable gentleman said that he would have plenty of time to study the reports of the Tariff Commission and other documents while travelling between here and England, so that no time would be lost by the prorogation of Parliament. The natural conclusion was that the Tariff when brought down would be a perfect and truly scientific Tariff; but I do not think the Government can claim that the result is up to expectations. that the Acting Prime Minister worked very hard on the Tariff on his way from 'England. been a very rough passage. However, the question has a very serious side; and when the Government threw the Tariff on the table in the way in which they did, without saying anything as to its nature, or apparently, without even being seized of the seriousness of the position, they inflicted great injury on the country. That is not the sort of conduct we have the right to expect from fhe body of men who have the' interests of the Commonwealth within their control. case of chairs; it is evident that the Minister who dealt with the Tariff never intended that those articles' should be taxed to the extent of 7s. 6d. each on a value of 3s. or 4s. commendation of the Tariff Commission, the members of which, I understand, are prepared to defend it. it by explaining that they did not mean tlie recommendation to be taken as interpreted by the Acting Prime Minister. There was the expert advice of the Customs officials at hand, and the Minister ought to have produced a much better result, because I know those officials to be exceedingly able men. The criticism is perfectly just and well-earned that the Minister has evidently shown no consideration for fhe interests of commerce and trade, or for the welfare of the people, in the introduction of this Tariff. Whatever time may have been wasted in discussing the Tariff here, no time has been wasted in discussing the financial position. The country is indebted to those honourable members who took the trouble to go into the question very fully-the honourable member for."" Flinders and the honourable member for Kooyong amongst others-and who raised the debate to what I consider a distinctly high plane. I do not agree with the accusation made against those honourable members, that they went out of their way to raise the feelings of the States against the Commonwealth. As to States rights, if an honourable member on this side ventures to say a word in their defence, he is immediately charged with disloyalty to the Federation I see no justification for 'any such accusation, because when we speak of States rights, we are not referring so much to. the Premier or Government of a particular State, as to the people of the State, who, it must be remembered, are also our electors. If by any action of the Commonwealth Parliament we make it imperative for a State Government to impose heavy burdens on their people, it is we who must be held responsible. At the time of the Premiers. .Conference at Brisbane* most of' the newspapers of Queensland took, perhaps, a rather narrow attitude in connection with the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. But one particular newspaper, which has great influence in Queensland, took the view trfat, as the Federal Parliament necessarily Take only one example, the had complete control of taxation, would it not be better, instead of making a fuss and raising ill-feeling to simply take the view that the State electors were also the electors of the Federal Parliament, and so throw the whole onus of the situation on that Parliament; that if we were the cause of extra burdens on the people, we should be called to account. In my opinion, that was a good position to take up; because, as I said beI f so, they will defend fore, when we on this side offer any criticism as to the attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the States, we are not dealing with a State in its governmental aspect, but with the people of the State whom we represent, and who are also State electors. The honourable member for Riverina, speaking of the States debts, said he was perfectly satisfied that when the Constitution was framed it was intended that at the end of 1910 the Commonwealth should take the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. The honourable member contended that there was no intention that any portion of that revenue should then be returned to the States, or used for the payment of interest on the States debts; but that, on the other hand,",36,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With
362,Mr Austin Chapman,I understand,37,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With
363,Mr Archer,Then it must have,37,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With
364,Mr Austin Chapman,That was a re,37,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With
365,Mr Archer,"the Commonwealth should take the whole of the money, and use it for Commonwealth purposes, leaving the States to do as best they could. When I heard that remark I procured some figures, in order to arrive at 'some idea as to what would be the financial position of the States if that idea of the honourable member for Riverina were carried out. I have not yet had time to look at the figures, and, therefore, do not know how they will bear on my argument; but I think they will be worth recording. Let us suppose that the ten years had expired in 1905-6, when the general revenue of Queensland, exclusive of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise from the Commonwealth, was £2,996,475. The three-fourths' which it received from the Commonwealth in that year amounted to £857,048. The expenditure on administration, & c , excluding interest on the debts, was £2,178,831, while the interest was £1,546.881. Excluding from the revenue the three-fourths of the Customs revenue returned, the figures show that Queensland would have been left with a deficit of £729,237. The idea of the honourable member for Riverina in regard to the retention of the whole of the revenue by the Commonwealth may, for all I know, obtain pretty freely on the other side. I would impress upon the Committee that had the course indicated been followed in 1905-6, Queensland would have had a deficit of about three-quarters of a million. In making such suggestions, honourable members display an utter want of appreciation of our responsibilities to those who, after all, are Federal as well as States member for South Sydney considers that electors, and so give rise to the talk of secession which we are all so sorry to hear. They should be more guarded in their statements. it is only a threat. ber for Riverina, I am sure, has too great a sense of his responsibility to utter anything in the shape of a threat in this House. When the honourable member for Flinders was discussing the transfer of the States debts the honourable member for South Sydney, whose views must certainly be taken into serious account, interjected in a way that indicated a belief on his part that if the Commonwealth took over the debts of the States it should also take over the assets representing those debts. The honourable member for Flinders said that it was intended that we should burden ourselves with the interest on the States debts as existing at the inception of the Commonwealth, and that this burden was to be taken on our shoulders' as against the enormous revenue from Customs and Excise with which we were invested. The honourable member for South Sydney then interjected in the form of a questionWe were to take all the liabilities, leaving the States all the assets? Later on, when the honourable member for Flinders said that the Commonwealth had been granted under the Constitution what this year represented a revenue of between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000, and inquired, ""Surely that is an asset?"" the honourable member for South Sydney interjected, "" If it is, it is a very secondary one."" Apparently the honourable member does not consider that the power to impose Customs and Excise taxation is a very considerable asset. The honourable member for Flinders went on to say that if it were not a substantial asset he did not know what was, and the leader of the Labour Party repliedBut the States, according to the honourable member, are to keep what the debts represent. The report continuesMrW . H . IRVINE -The honourable member would like to take over the whole of the railways, the waterworks, and everything else belonging to the States. should certainly follow the debts. It will thus be _ seen that the honourable if we took over the debts of the States the assets represented by those debts should be handed over to us. He would expect to have handed over to the Commonwealth railways, irrigation works, and also, in many cases, works undertaken by local authorities on which borrowed money had been spent. In other words, the honourable member appears to favour unification. It would be impossible for the Commonwealth to assume the control of all local works, as suggested^ by the leader of the Labour Party, without at the same time undertaking the whole management of the States. That, I think, is absolutely out of the question. It is not provided for in the Constitution. We are endowed with certain powers, and we cannot go beyond them. I fail to understand how the honourable member could take up such a' position. Another point which ought to be",37,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With

368,Mr Watson,"The assets created by debtsremembered in this connection is that, although a railway may originally have cost £1,000,000, its value to the State to-day is much in excess of that sum. I have here a table showing that, from 1901-2 to 1905-6, the return on capital invested in the State railways of Queensland, was as fol lows :-1901-2 , £ 1 8s. 8d. per cent..; ] 9 3, £ 0 2 l I 2 S "" d . per cent.; 1903-4, £ 2 is. i d . per cent. ;1904-5, . £ 2 10s. 2d. per cent. ; and 1905-6, £ 2 16s. 5d. per cent. It will thus foe seen that the return is gradually increasing. the position in regard to a Queensland State railway, constructed ten years ago at a. cost of £1,000,000, and the earnings of which had averaged i j per cent, below the rate which would pay interest and .redemption? That deficit would have been made good from year to year out of the pockets of the people of Queensland, and would represent a total of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of the ten years' period. In other words, such a railway which the honourable member for South Sydney would take over as an asset, representing the original debt of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , would have cost Queensland £1,150,000. Many of the railways of Queensland were constructed thirty vears ago, and have shown a heavy deficit, although I am glad to say that that deficit is gradually becoming less. In the case of a railway constructed twenty years ago, at a cost of £1,000,000, and worked at an average loss of 2 per cent., Queensland would have had to pay £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 to make good that deficit. would foe made good in another. ing good these losses. indirect benefit flowing from a railway. It is an aid to settlement. makes the asset still more valuable. The original cost of a railway does not represent the hard cash actually spent upon it. The fact that a railway is an aid to settlement makes it worth far more to a State than it actually cost to construct. In these circumstances, the argument that we should take over the Tail ways or irrigation works represented by the debts of the States is utterly fallacious. as their sleepers and ballast are concerned, have been worn out and renewed. sands of pounds have been spent on the maintenance of our railways. ture will be necessary in that direction. gest that the assets should follow the debts in this matter is to take up a false position. When the States went on the London money market to raise their loans the money-lenders did not know to what purpose the money was to be devoted. No mention What would be was made of any special asset. The only asset that the money-lenders wanted was the taxable capacity of the people. That >s the only asset of value to those who lend 1 money to a Government. What has happened from time to time in connection withvarious republics in South America to whom money has been loaned by European countries? Whenever any difficulty has beeii experienced in securing the payment of interest or principal no attempt has been made to take possession of the defaulting country or its public works. The control of its Customs and Excise Department has simply been taken over, and in that way satisfaction has been secured. In the case of national debtsthe Customs and Excise revenues constitutethe only asset. The arguments advanced! by the honourable member for South Sydney and others that, if .the Commonwealth took: over the debts of the States it should alsotake over the material assets representingthose debts is, as I have said, a fallaciousone, and seems to be simply a proposal; that we should work towards unification. We are gradually makorable member is in favour of unification ? We have to consider the last general election. considers that unification would be a good thing for Australia. I differ from that T h a t indirect benefit view, but cast no reproach upon him.

They have a perfect right to do so if they can induce the peopleto f a l l into line behind them, but theyshould make it clearly known that that is their Intention. The peopleas a whole do not realize that it is.

380,Mr Archer,"The honourable memberfinance who are much better able to deal with it than I am, and therefore I do not propose to discuss it. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that the right honourable member for Swan, and others on his side of the House who claim to be in favour of old-age'pensions, but refuse to vote for a Federal land tax, were hypocrites I interjected at the time, because I felt that, if the whip cut the right honourable member for Swan, it also cut me. I realize that a system of old-age pensions, to be effective, must necessarily be a Federal one, in order that the disability in respect of state residential qualifications, under which many deserving men and women labour, may be removed. ever, to say that the Federal Parliament should resort, at the present time, at all events, to direct taxation. Whilst it was absolutely right that the national Parliament should be given every power of taxation, since upon it was thrust the whole responsibility of the nation, at the same time it was distinctly stated at the different Conventions, and understood by the people, that the Commonwealth was to rely upon the Customs and Excise duties for its revenue, leaving direct taxation to the States. Sir PHILIPFYSH national emergency. said, in short, that direct taxation is a reserve of taxation. The States have already had to avail themselves of it. In Queensland we have an income tax, in addition to a land tax, imposed by the local governing authorities, and it seems to me that the State will yet have to resort more fully to that method of raising revenue. Commonwealth took over the debts of the States as at the inception of Federation, and had to pay the interest upon' them out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue 'now returned to the States, the States themselves would still have to contract further liabilities. well for the representatives of the smaller States, which are more densely populated than are the others, to talk of paying for new works out of revenue; but they should not lose sight of the fact that the larger States have a vast and a rich territory to open up by means of railways and other worksrailways which for a great many years will not pay interest. It is impossible to develop the country by the expenditure of revenue alone. Therefore, the States must borrow, and paying interest on the borrowed money and not having power to raise indirect taxation, must impose direct taxation. duplicate taxation. We have not proposed an income tax. that where there is a State land tax in operation a Commonwealth land tax wilt not be imposed ? The special object of the land tax suggested by the Labour Party is to provide for 'the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. large estates. I am not prepared, howfor Kalgoorlie connected the proposal for a land tax with the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, and charged with hypocrisy those who are opposed to the imposition of a land tax by the Commonwealth. In New South Wales the Government levies a land tax. Are we to understand that, therefore, no Commonwealth land tax would affect that State, and that it would be treated differently from Queensland, where a pnetty heavy tax is levied upon land-owners by the local authorities? their own properties. spent in maintaining roads. properties adjacent to the roads? of the kind improves property. But, in addition to providing the whole of the money required to keep up the roads of If the the State, Queensland land-owners have to contribute their share to meet the expenditure on railways and other public works. It seems to me that there would be anomalies under the proposal of the Labour Party. Furthermore, I think it unfair to make one section of the'community provide It is all very the money necessary for an old-age pensions fund. An income tax would be of wider effect, and would be based on ability to Paymember support a land tax for the purposes of defence? to pay must be considered in connection with taxation. But it must be remembered that there is a limit to the direct taxation which can be imposed, and we must be careful not to exhaust the reserves on which the States have to depend for revenue.",39,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With

There Is no proper ground for charging with hypocrisy those who object to the imposition of a land tax to raise money for this purpose. Reverting to the Tariff, to refer to a matter which I omitted to mention just now, I understood the Acting Prime Minister to say the other day that Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, the Sydney manufacturers of wire-netting gave a distinct understanding that they would not increase the price of their goods. that they made a statement to that effect; that they would not increase their prices as the result of the Tariff. made in writing? I am not sure. ness firm which has been placed in my hands, it is pointed out thatMessrs. Lysaght Bros., the principal Australian wire-netting manufacturers, were very fully employed prior to the new duties, and of late years it has been difficult to get any order executed within a shorter time than three or four weeks. Since the proposed Tariff they have advanced their price 2^ per cent., and we also received an advice on the 22nd inst. from their agents advising us that since the Tariff alterations Messrs.

That letter shows that they have broken their promise not to increase prices. cent, been placed on the wire with which, they make netting ? their raw material an endeavour should be made to remove it. against manufacturers. badly off without them. It isonly human for them not to make out too good a case for themselves. I know that if I wished for a lease of country I should not try to make the transaction appear too advantageous to myself. As for the new protection, of which we have heard so much, I ask if it is likely that persons with money to invest would put it into Australian industries if they are to be controlled, not only in regard to the wages to be paidwhich is right enough -bu t also as to the prices at which they must sell. If manufacturers are to be at the mercy of an irresponsible board, and to be interfered with at every turn, investors will put their money into industries' in other countries where the conditions are more favorable to a profitable return. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the need for making the proceedings of this Parliament more widely known to the people of tlw country. In places like the back country of Queensland and Western Australia the settlers are hardly in touch with the Federation. The only Commonwealth Department which affects them nearly is the Post Office. They elect a representative once in three years. He goes away to Melbourne, and they hear little Of him until he returns. Their newspapers contain practically no report of what is done here. I think, therefore, that the Government might well take into consideration the advisability of providing for the circulation of adequate reports. but it might be possible to subsidize press reports in some way. In Queensland, at one time, a gentleman of high literary attainments was employed to write a substantial account-no t a shorthand report-of the' proceedings of Parliament, with occasional interjections to give it spice and point, and this was handed free to the press, and posted throughout the country. The arrangement came to an end because it was thought that the State could not afford the expense. But I think that the Commonwealth would be justified in incurring it. proposal ? to some extent. I know from my experU If that is a duty on ence as an elector, before I became a member of this Parliament, how little the I have no feeling people are in touch with Federation. They We should be have more sympathy with the Government of their own State, although it may be sometimes wrong, than with the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, of whose .proceedings they know little: I think 'that what I propose would Tevive the national spirit, by bringing the people into closer touch with the Federal Parliament, and make Federation more of a success.

I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to what I have .said in this regard. a good deal of sympathy with the complaint made by the honourable member for Capricornia in the last part of his speech'. I think it would be in the interests of this Parliament and of the Commonwealth if we could arrange to obtain better press reports of our proceedings. But the suggestion of a subsidized press does not meet with my approval, because I think that it necessarily implies a censored press. dized press reports in the sense to which the honourable member refers. The suggestion that we should have our own man, and that we should print and distribute the sheets, is, I think, a very good one. is open to a good deal of objection. think that, perhaps, something might be done in the direction of cheapening the telegraph rates for press messages. In that way it may be possible to induce the newspapers, especially those in other States, to devote a little more space to the proceedings of this Parliament. To my mind, it is not a desirable thing that in all the States capitals the proceedings of the States Parliaments should occupy more space in the daily newspapers than is devoted to the proceedings of the national Parliament. But I rose chiefly.to add my voice to the warning which has been sounded by the honourable member for Flinders in regard to the want of financial policy on the part of the Government. I am willing to admit, with the honourable member for Gippsland, that under ordinary circumstances the Opposition would not be justified in asking the Government to outline their financial policy two years in advance. under the special circumstances which obtain-and knowing as we do the policy of honourable members who occupy the Labour corner-thi s Committee is warranted in asking the Government to give honourable members some indication of their position in regard to Federal and State finance. We must recollect that we have to face a steady increase in, Commonwealth expenditure. I do not say that there has been any extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth. But, irrespective of whether or not there has been extravagance, We ' do not read it we cannot ignore the fact that we have to face a steady increase of exI n a great many inpenditure, which the Government ought to tell us how they propose to finance. In every Department we find the same thing. In many instances I admit that this increased expenditure is necessary. Perhaps it is necessary in every case. Upon looking through the Budget, I confess that I cannot, at the moment, point to any instance in which I think the expenditure should be reduced. But the fact that the increased expenditure is necessary does not make the position less serious, and it certainly behoves the Government, who, I understand, are not in favour of direct taxation MrW . H . IRVINE -Some members of it are. 1 understand they are not. Certainly the Prime Minister, in his platform speeches, was absolutely opposed to a land tax. MrW . H .

I certain, as soon as possible, is whether the Acting Prime Minister or the Prime Minister is to be accepted , as the mouthpiece of the' Government. A t the end of 1910 we shall be face to face with the problem of whether the Braddon section shall be discontinued, and, if not, what shall be substituted for it. As a matter of fact, we are face to face with that problem now, because we must find the solution of it within the next two years. So long as the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government means a reduction in the amounts which the States Treasurers have to spend, so long will captious criticism be levelled at our expenditure-criticis m which is not in the best interests either of the .States or of the Federation. The honourable member for Gippsland criticised the proposals of the honourable member for Flinders in But regard to the reduction of our expenditure, but neglected to suggest anything better as a substitute. I do not agree with the suggestion that we should reduce the increments, which were practically promised by the Commonwealth, to the younger officers of our public service.

407,Mr Bowden,"W h a t we wish to asgood deal of talk about our declining birthrate, about the need which exists for increasing our population and for encouraging immigration, but, to my mind, there is a very serious state of affairs when we find that many of our financial institutions-in stead of encouraging their employees to settle down in life-ar e doing all that they can to prevent it. As a matter of fact, many-if not all-of the banks carrying, on business in Australia have inserted in the agreements with their employees a clause which forbids them to marry until they are in receipt of a salary of at least ,£200 per annum. take very' good care that it is a long time before their employees receive that salary. 'sert such a condition in I heir agreements with their employees, they ought to see that those who serve them faithfully shallwithin a reasonable time-be afforded an opportunity to get married. scarcely a bank carrying on business in Australia at the present time in which any employee"" in the ordinary course of events can get married before he has reached thirty years of age. Some employees are 'almost grey-haired men before they are in receipt of the salaries stipulated by their employers as the minimum. We do not want that condition of affairs to be reproduced in our Federal enterprises. to see that young men in the Commonwealth service who serve us faithfully are in a position to look forward, within a reasonable time, to settling down in life and acquiring homes of their own. The honourable, member for Riverina made a very peculiar suggestion in regard to the adjustment of the future relations of the Commonwealth to the States. Of course it is very easy-if we look only at one side of the picture-to suggest a remedy for the difficulty. But the remedy suggested by the honourable member would land every State of the Commonwealth in hopeless bankruptcy so far as its own finances are concerned. H is suggestion is that at the end of 1910 we shall quietly absorb the whole of the Customs and E xcise revenue without returning any to the States. He has pointed out that New South Wales possesses a very big surplus, and that the Government of that State propose to reduce taxation. He adds that the New South Wales Parliament can impose a little more taxation to make up the deficiency which would be caused by the Commonwealth appropriating the whole of -the Customs and Excise revenue. It might be possible, though I think it would be extremely difficult, for New South Wales, by a great stretch of her powers of taxation, to meet her financial necessities without any sum being returned to her by the Commonwealth. We must remember that, in 1906-7, the Commonwealth returned to New South Wales£ 3 , 0 2 2 , 3 5 1 , and out of that money, if we like to put it so, the State had a surplus of £ 1 , 4 9 3 , 3 2 2. But the proposal of the honourable member for Riverina would mean that New South Wales, instead of having a surplus of about £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, would have a deficiency And those institutions of about £500,000.. Last year, Victoria received from the Commonwealth £ 2 , 1 9 2 , 3 4 0, and that State had a surplus W h e n the banks inof £ 8 1 2 , 4 0 6 , but the proposal of the honourable member would mean that Victoria would have a deficiency of over £1,250,000. In Queensland, where £ 9 4 2 , 5 6 9 was received from the ComThere is monwealth, and where there was a surplus °f £3<)6> 5> the proposal would mean a II deficiency of at least £ 5 4 6 , 0 0 0 . In South Australia, where the amount received from the Commonwealth was £ 6 4 5 , 1 2 1 , and where there was a surplus . of about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 I have not the exact figuresthere would be, instead of a surplus, a deficiency of about £ 3 4 5 , 0 0 0 . In Tasmania, where £ 2 6 2 , 2 9 3 were received from We ought the Commonwealth, and there was a surplus of £ 7 0 , 0 6 0 , there would be a deficiency of about £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; while in Western Australia, where £ 7 5 5 , 8 4 6 was received from the Federation, and where there was a deficiency of £ 8 8 , 7 2 8 , the proposal would mean the still greater deficiency of over i£840,ooo. A proposal of the kind needs only to be stated in order to show its absolute impossibility. Another proposal is made by the Labour Party, who tell us straight out that they desire direct taxation-that if there be any deficiency it ought to be made up by resorting to that method of raising revenue. We can understand a proposal, of that sort, but what we wish to know is whether the proposal is endorsed by the Government. We desire to know, as I said before, whether the Government endorse the statement of the Acting Prime Minister -in favour of a land tax, or whether they endorse the statement.of the Prime Minister against a land tax, and, if the latter, what the Government propose to do with reference to the finances of the States and the Commonwealth.",42,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With

No one can deny the truth of that statement. that this phase of the question shall not be overlooked. The Labour Party have been very definite in their statement that they agree with the policy of settling the people on the land, and with that object in view they propose, by means of a graduated land tax, to burst up the big estates. seems to be a very simple way out of the difficulty, and if I could go with the Labour Party in that direction, I should do so. But the proposal to pile on taxation merely for the purpose of depreciating the value of any one's property seems to me to savour of class legislation. pose of the proposed tax. only just course to follow, to my mind, is for the States to buy back, at its fair market value, the alienated land. The States have been trending in the right direction, and, although the honourable member for South Sydney speaks of this as a paltry proposition, that which his party favours is absolutely unfair, and, to my mind, would amount to confiscation. Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7-45 p-m. stated, a graduated land tax would be an easy way of removing some of pur financial difficulties, if it were a fair way; but the fact that it has been proposed, not to obtain revenue, but, as has been said, to burst up the big estates, shows that it is wrong in principle. Eveni f , as is contended, the State has created the values which it is proposed to tax, it must be remembered that the owners of the land paid for the properties in respect to which those values exist, and to set about to depreciate them in order that they might be resumed for less than their' true market value would be confiscation. The honourable thing to do is what the Governments of the States have done-resum e at market values land needed for closer settlement, re-selling it to the people. actions of the New South Wales Government in connection with the resumption and sub-division of four large estates have been W o u l d not the honvery profitable, the profit running into a great . many pounds, and homes have been provided for a great many It would be of far people.

Within the last fifty years it has in many industries enabled employers to dispense with skilled artizans, and to engage women and children for what have become merely mechanical occupations. These difficulties extend over a larger sphere than is embraced by the fiscal problem. But the point .which T h a t is not the purI wish to emphasize is that protection accentuates rather than diminishes them. The proper and the While I am not attempting to depreciate the value of manufactures to a country, I feel bound to point out that it is becoming more and more recognised that a nation's strength and stability, its prosperity and happiness, depend more largely upon its rural than upon its urban population. The effect of the Tariff will be to bolster up secondary at the expense of primary industries. The honourable member for South Sydney and his followers claim to particularly reA s I have already present and have in charge the interest of the working classes. I deny that they have a monopoly of such workers. They are in no sense the mouthpiece of all workers, unless it be of such workers as are members of trades unions. The Tariff, instead of helping the working man, must injure him by decreasing the purchasing .power of his money. Lists which have been published in the newspapers show that the Tariff has had the effect of considerably reducing the purchasing power of money, so that what formerly could be bought for £ 1 now costs 23s. The difference may not seem much to some honourable members, but it is considerable to those who have only a small margin to live on.

Anthony Hordern and Sons, Sydney, shows that since the new Tariff was brought in there has been little or no increase in the cost of what are necessaries to the working men According to one statement which he made, there has been an increase only in regard to treacle. He forgot to point out that that firm, and others whose lists he quoted, are honorably fulfilling their promise not to increase their prices until the stocks which they laid in prior to the imposition of tlie Tariff are exhausted. The other day the Civil Service Co-operative Society of New South Wales published a new price slip, on which this note appearsThe new Federal Tariff, if passed in its preholders in that mill were assured that under sent form, will have the effect of altering the majority of prices in the catalogue recently issued, but shareholders and customers are assured that prices will not be advanced until it is commatter that we must not forget, namely, -pulsory to do so. That note was placed at the head of a list which they issued to their shareholders. Under this new Tariff, almost every article which the working man has to buy-hi s food and his clothes, for example-ar e taxed; consequently their price will be increased. proposed to bolster up by increased duties were doing very well under the old Tariff. The woollen industry was in a flourishing condition. The Acting Prime Minister chanced to make a reference to the Parramatta Woollen Mills a few days ber name a single industry in New South ago.

Victoria, at the time of the gold rush, increased by leaps and bounds. It was then that it exceeded the population of New South Wales. It was the gold rush in this State which was responsible for the enormous increase in its nopulation. of Victoria is not anything like equal to the wool and mineral production of New South Wales. lation caused by the development of the pastoral industry will necessarily be gradual, whereas the increa§e of population in Victoria, owing to the gold rush, ""was very sudden. However, this State is now losing population. New South Wales has a larger population at the present time, and Victoria will never be her equal again in that respect. I do not wish to discuss the various items of the Tariff schedule in detail, but there are one or two matters that I should like to mention. pioposed to. deal at some length with the surprising proposal of the Government to tax works of art. to be a fact that other nations, and particularly Italy, have passed laws absolutely prohibiting the export of works of art of a certain character, and only the other day we read that an American millionaire became very indignant because the Italian Government, becoming suspicious of his removing some art treasures, searched his yacht.

Yes . They leave Vicin the Tariff there are several items which have been transferred from an ad valorem duty to a measurement duty-to a duty of C a n the honourable memso much per cubic foot, outside measurement. Not being very well acquainted with the way in which these articles are imported, I made it my business to find out how the proposed duties will affect some The population of industries, and what they really represent. One item, which the women of Australia will require very shortly, is preserving jars. There are a few made in Australia, but the local supply is not equal to the demand, and, further, those that are made here are not satisfactory, because they are not abB u t the gold production solutely air-tight.

The new duty on lamp chimneys, which are used principally by the poorer classes, is 2s. 6d. per cubic foot, and this, on a consignment valued at I am merely pointing £ 6 13s. i o d . , amounts to £ 8 , as contrasted with the old duty of 20 per cent., or £ 1 6s. 7d.

Then waste-paper baskets per set are charged duties which equal respectively 242 per cent, and 322 per cent. There is only one other item in the Tariff to which I desire to rejfer, and that is the inexplicable duty of 7s, 6d. each on chairs. We know that the local manufacture of Vienna chairs, and of the cheaper lines of American chairs, is impossible, since we have not supplies of wood suitable for the purpose. Chairs were' already protected to the extent of between 35 per cent."" and 50 per cent, by the duty, freight, and charges under the old Tariff. The impost of 7s. 6d. per chair is absolutely prohibitive. I do not like Austrian chairs, and have very few in my house, but they are largely used by the favourite friends of the Postmaster-General, the working people. As an example of the magnitude of this burden I propose to quote figures supplied to me by Messrs. W . W . Campbell and Co. Ltd -, in reference to a certain shipment. They have now arriving 303 dozen of these chairs.

But I point out to the This is protection run m a d; there is noother way in which to describe it. T he proposal of the leader of the Labour Party, which he describes as the "" new protection,"" is, to my mind, an absolute acknowledgment that so far, at all events, as the workers are concerned, protection in itself is a failure. It fails to benefit them or to"" improve their conditions. It is a matter of No t of this kind. common history that although protection as a Of what kind are they? rule increases the wealth of the community, These are Japanese it puts that increased wealth into the pockets I am merely pointing out the of the few. We are told that such a state of affairs is not to continue; But the proposal to regulate prices seems to me fo be The poorer classes are not absolutely unworkable. It is by no means a new proposition. The experiment has The honourable member been tried in different forms from almost the commencement of civilization. In the days of one of the EdwardsI think it I have already pointed was EdwardI a law was passed to limit the charge for eggs to is . per dozen, and when we remember the difference between the purchasing power of money then and now, that was a fairly high rate to fix. The proposal put forward by the Labour Part} , however, is not likely, in my 7 opinion, to help the consumer. The honourable member for South Sydney, and the honourable member for Boothby, admitted that goods could not be followed until they reached the hands of the retailer with the object of insuring that the consumer should not be charged more than a reasonable rate for them. The honourable member for Boothby said he proposed to see that a fair charge was made for goods as they left the hands of the manufacturer. We can see at once how easy it would be to overcome such a scheme. It would be an easy matter to do what is done at the present time-to introduce a third party, or middleman, to whom",48,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With

They might sell at a reasonable price to the middleman, and take their -chief profit from his sales instead of from the sales of the factory. So far as I can see the proposal will not work. We admit that protection, if high enough, will create a certain quantity of work for a certain number of people. -could be grown at the South Pole if a demand could be created for them there, and a sufficiently high duty to bring up the prices could be imposed. The point that I wish to. emphasize is that under a protective policy we take much from the pockets of the multitude-fro m the consuming classes -for the sake of benefiting the few. In an effort to bolster up a few industries we are taxing the whole of the general community. There is another matter to which I desire to refer. So much has been said upon the subject of the Federal Capital, from which it might be inferred that the Premier of New South Wales is responsible for the present position, that I thought it might be of interest to the Committee, as well as to the public generally, to show the action of the present Government since the Bill dealing with this question was passed. I find' that on the 19th October, 1905, the honourable member for Parramatta asked the Prime Minister whether, he wasin a position to give the House information concerning the recent conference between the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of New South Wales 'in reference to the Federal Capital site ? He addedI should like to know generally what the Covernmcnt propose to do in regard to this matter ? The Prime Minister repliedI have no memorandum to lay before the House, but tlie Attorney-General has prepared a. letter in which is set forth our view of the legal questions raised during the conference between him and the. Attorney-General of New South Wales. It will be posted this afternoon, and will be delivered to-morrow morning. The -discussion narrowed the question at issue to such an extent that I think that this statement of our views, and the reply to it, will probably close the correspondence preparatory to the introduction of a B ill into this Chamber. On the 26th October, 1905, the honourable member for Parramatta again asked the Prime Minister if he were yet able to inform . the House of the course which the Government intended to take with regard to the Federal Capital Site question. The Prime Minister repliedThe letter laid on the table on Tuesday was a communication arranged to be sent by the Attorney-General to the Attorney-General of New South Wales. We have received a telegTam from the latter, saying that he has transferred the matter to the Premier, who will reply to our letter. His answer has not yet reached us. The probability is that we shall follow theprocedure suggested . . . introducing a B ill to permit of the survey referred to. Then the right honourable member for East Sydney interjected, almost prophetically, as subsequent events have provedThe settlement of the matter seems to me to be further away than ev.er. On 8th November, 1905, when speaking on the Appropriation Bill, the Prime Minister saidThe question of the site will be before the House within the next few days in a specific form, which will permit of its discussion from every aspect. Further on in the same speech, in referring to the present Acting Prime Minister, lie said that hehas taken up a strong attitude as to the site that ought to be selected. The Hansard report continuesTrade and Customs does not regard the selection of Dalgety as final? is absolutely absurd. On 8th December, 1905, the honourable member for Parramatta askedIs the Prime Minister able in the midst of the legislative auction he is conducting, to give a passing fragmentary thought to the keeping of the solemn constitutional compact with New South Wales with reference to the Federal Capital Site? W ill the matter be dealt with this session, and, if so, when? submit a proposal next week. the Government intend to deal definitely with the matter before the session closes?

After the plans, which were received only yesterday, have been laid on the table, and the House has been placed in possession of all other available information on the subject we shall be ready to proceed. On the n t h July, 1906, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie askedIs it the intention of the Government to introduce this session a B ill to more definitely determine the area of the future Seat of Government ? We went on from July until September, when the honourable member for Lang again became impatient, and put a question to the Prime MinisterI wish to know from the Prime Minister if he will afford the House an opportunity to deal with the Federal Capital question before the close of the session? He then referred to a proposed visit to another site. On the 12th of September, the honourable member for North Sydney said that as he could not obtain the information from the business-paper he wished to know what place the Capital Site question was to occupy in the business of the session. The Prime Minister, after referring to the intended visits to the sites saidPending these visits, it is uncertain when the House will be prepared to deal with the question. In October, the honourable member for Lang askedIf it is considered necessary to make visits of inspection to Federal Capital Sites which have not been visited, will the Government arrange for them, prior to the meeting of the new Parliament, so as to secure the greatest expedition in the final settlement of the question?

I would rather have that question settled, because I believe that it would do much to allay the irritation which is felt in New South Wales against this Government. The honourable member for Cook wanted to know my views upon the question of protecting the iron industry. I regard the iron industry from a stand-point quite other than that of a mere Tariff issue. The money we expend in establishing it will be spent, not for the advantage of any one individual, but as an insurance from a defence stand-point, A halfpenny change is a in order that we may have in the time of need those thing's which are absolutely essential for our defence. member be of that opinion if Lithgow was in Tasmania? One is ready to admit a certain amount of unconscious bias, but I have looked at the matter fairly and squarely,and the reasons I have given are those which have actuated me, and would still have actuated ""me if Lithgow had not been in the Nepean electorate. On the question of defence we are simply drifting we know not does not the where. We are living over what may be described as a live volcano. After the expiration of seven years, when the AngloJapanese 'Treaty will have expired, we do not know at what moment we may be called upon to fight for our national existence. That is the aspect from which I view this industry. It is absolutely essential that we should have somewhere in Australia a means of turning our native ores into iron in order that we may have the necessary means of defence. I do not understand the attitude of the Government. They have proposed a duty for every other industry. But in this case they defer the duty pending the payment I quoted just of a bounty. The only reason they could give for that attitude would be that they want to see the industry established first, but it has been {already established, so much so that it is able, if it gets the orders, to turn out enough pig-iron to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. There is no question as to the quality of the iron, which is admitted to. be equal, if not superior, to the best that we can import.

Dalli more Brothers,. ironfounders, of South Melbourne, who were asked to express their opinion about the Australian iron that they are now using. They 'had nothing but praise for it. They said. English iron, and at least equal to the Scotch, which is the best iron imported."" And the price? "" The Australian iron' i's cheaper than the English, which is'cheaper again than the Scotch.

That testimony comes .from Victoria, which cannot be., regarded as . biased in favour, of. any New South Wales industry. Recently the SouthAustralian Government called for tenders for 5,006 torts of pig-iron. Mr Sandford tendered for the contract. . We are face to face with the fact that since the successful inauguration of-the blast furnaces a t Lithgow the price of pig iron by one means and another has been brought down on the Australian market. We can see that it is to the interests of the outside manufacturers that they should crush the local industry.. other industries -as well as to the iron in-' dustry?"" -members my. reason for supporting this particular proposal.' We know that the Sydney market quite lately was flooded by a shipment of Bengal iron. point out, in connection with this matter, that the successful tenderers for the South Australian iron were a firm who have ""to do largely with shipping and importing, and who, during a certain season of 'the year, are able to import pig iron as stiffening and ballast at a very low freight indeed. I am told, though I have not been able absolutely to verify the statement, that there is a clause in the agreement to the effect that if this Parliament imposes the 12^ per cent, duty that is proposed in the Tariff, the South Australian Government, and not the importer, will bear the expense of the duty. It works out in this"" wav. that if the 12J per cent, duty ising should be "" A Lost Free-trader."" added to the price quoted by the successful tenderer for this iron, the 'Lithgow sub-heading. tender would be about 5s. per ton lessthan the tender of the other people. put in an extraordinarily low price to crush the local industry? "" It is of first-class quality; better than the very low, andMr Sandford also put in ai low price in order to secure the tender. I refer to the matter now in order that the Committee may bear it in mind when theiron duty comes up for consideration, and may consider it in connection with the ques? tion whether we should provide for a bounty or impose a duty. To my mind, the industry having been already established, and the Government having acknowledged that the bounty, of itself, wil l not support the industry under, existing conditions follow the bounty. The Government acknowledge that the duty will have to follow the bounty. But,.since we have established fhe industry, and are within £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 of the limit of our'expenditure, it seems to me that, in the circum-; stances, it might, perhaps, be better to imr pose the 12 J per cent, duty asked for in the first instance. In considering .this matter, we must remember that,' although in England a considerable number of women are employed at the lighter labour in iron work's, in Australia we have* not, and I hope never will have, any female labour employed in the industry.' It is , true that we .employ a few youths at-work of a very simple and light character, but the number is but a fraction of the-700 or 800 men employed in the industry These are the principalthings I wished to ask the I wish to Committee to remember in dealing with the iron duty. I repeat that it is the immediate and pressing nature of the question of de-> fence which has forced the consideration of this question upon me, and which compels me to support a proposal which the Prime Minister himself described as worth a considerable national sacrifice. the honourable member who has just resumed his seat should think it advisable to reprint his speech, I would suggest as an appropriate heading for it ' "" A Protectionist in the Making.""

And who gets the benefit of the work of such men? No one, in the long run, but the landowner. What is the effect of accretions of population here ? Is it not to increase the value of the lands? Who has increased the value of the land in Melbourne and the other cities of Australia?

Therefore, I say that the owners of those lands, and other wealthy people, ought to be taxed in order to pay old-age pensions'. The honourable member also referred-and I thought his reference most unhappy-to the epoch of 1893, which he said marked the first appearance of the Labour Party in Parliament, and the beginning of the growth of class strife and other evils which he contended had followed the advent of that party. The honourable member could not have been more unfortunate in his selection of the date, because it was in 1893 that for the first time in Australia an Australian Parliament said to the banks, "" You need not pay your debts."" This was done by the Victorian Parliament, in this very Chamber; arid payment was suspended by the banks for a whole week. ThisI can regard as no other .than legalized robbery of the depositors-amon g whom were many widows and children. The year 1893 has been burned into the minds of the thrifty people of Australia, who were forced by law to leave their money with the banks for periods ranging from three to ten years. The public at that time were robbed by the class which the honourable member for Fawkner represents-ban k directors and others. were robbed of £58,000,000. statement. Of course, the honourable member for Fawkner himself is a generous and kind-hearted man; he and others in the Opposition corner possibly have very kindly sentiments towards the working people of the country. I can quite believe that if the French aristocracy had shown a similar willingness to recognise the rights of the masses when Tom Paine wrote The Age of Reason, the French Revolution, with all its horrors, might not have occurred. But', as everybody knows, the aristocracy disregarded the advice of Paine. They read the first edition of his work and threw it aside with the utmost contempt; but it is said that their skins went to bind the third edition. Nothing of that sort, I hope, will occur in Australia. I wish to say to honourable members in the Opposition corner that, while I have every respect for them personally, I shall view with some suspicion proposals emanating from them, especially in reference to the Tariff. I think it was Daniel O'Connell who, on one occasion in the House of Commons, wher» asked whait course he proposed to take in regard to a certain proposal, replied, "" I shall wait until I see what the Times urges, and if I do the opposite I know I shall be right."" The honourable member for Fawkner said that 93 per cent, of the lands of Australia were still unalienated, leaving it to beinferred that there is ample room and scope for all who choose to come to the country. Anybody who has been in the interior of Australia, and knows that over vast areas the rainfall is only 5 or 6 inches per annum, will readily understand the absurdity of the honourable member's suggestion. The. real trouble is that the most fertile arid the richest portions of Australia are alreadyalienated and in the hands of a few; and what is required to promote settlement and increase the population is a stiff land tax that will render it unprofitable for the present holders to continue their policy of keeping the lands locked up. It is expected, I presume, of every honourable member that he should at this stage make some declaration in regard to the Tariff. I recognise that, for good or ill , the people of Australia have declared for protection. So far as I am personally concerned, while I do not believe in overloading the primary industries from which Australia derives the bulk of its wealth, I intend to recognise the will of the people. Where it is possible I shalt give my vote for duties, provided the interests of the workers are conserved, and! that some scheme is devised for the protection of the consumers. The objectionable features of protection will be largely removed if we are able to provide, on the one hand, that the workers shall receive fair wages under good conditions, and that the consumers shall not be swindled. Subject to these reservations, I intend toconsider every duty on its merits, and tovote in the direction which I think the people of Australia desire. I am sorry that the honourable member for Fremantle is not present, because I intended to endorse the remarks made by him as to the vast undeveloped wealth of the north-west portion of Western Australia. His speech was, on the whole, an excellent effort, though some of his arguments were scarcely consistent with his fiscal professions. Like that delivered by the honourable member for Nepean, it was the utterance of a free trader rather than of a protectionist, in which guise the honourable member for Fre-",58,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With
585,Mr Spence,The people at that time,59,Smith Tha T Is Not An Power Would Be Used Reasonably And With
586,Mr Mahon,"I can quite believe themantle was returned. I failed to recognise orthodox protectionist principles in his contentions. He seems to think that the primary industries only require that their machinery and appliances shall be unburdened by Tariff taxation. If he has studied the question he ought to know that machinery is but one factor of an industry. If taxes be levied on the cost-of. living and other factors of an industry, then that industry, from the honourable member's point of view, is not receiving fair play. I do not wish to make any further reference to .the honourable member's speech, but I trust that the Committee will give some attention to the complaints coming from Western Australia. part of Australia pies a unique position. The honourable member for Parramatta knows full well that no other State in the Union has derived less than she has from Federation. She depends mainly on four industries -mining , agricultural, pastoral, and timber getting-and not one of them, so far as I can see, is likely to be benefited by the Tariff. The position of the other States is altogether different. New South Wales has vast deposits of coal and iron, as well as an abundance of cheap labour, and she must be the seat of many flourishing industries. Wages prevailing in Western Australia, on the other hand, are higher than those paid in any other part of the Union, and the industries of that State must necessarily come down before the competition of the longer established manufactures of the eastern States. any sympathy with what is, after all, a foolish agitation for secession, I think this House might give attention to the special needs and requirements of Western Australia. I would remind honourable members that we shall have an opportunity, when the Navigation Bill is before us, to show some consideration for its well-being. It ought not to be forgotten that Western Australia is absolutely confined to sea communication with the east. Unlike the other States, she has no land communication with the rest of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that we shall impose as few restrictions-as possible on coastal vessels trading between the west and the east. I thought of referring to a number of Special advantages which the other States have received from the Union as contra-distinguishedfrom Western Australia, but since I desire to assist in bringing to a speedy termination what, after all, must have proved to the public a wearisome debate, I shall refrain from doing so. The Federal Government, to my mind, is not preserving its self-respect to a sufficient extent in its dealings with the States Premiers. Every year a Conference of the States Premiers meets in some Australian capital to discuss questions of Federal importance which this Parliament was created by the people to deal with. I am not singling out any one party for special censure. The present Prime Minister is as much to blame as is the leader of the Opposition. All have bent the knee to the States Premiers, with a view, apparently, of cultivating their good-will. I do not know why they should have done so. States Premiers say if we discussed States questions as they do Federal matters? terfere with the functions of the States, the Premiers would promptly resent our action. I propose to put before the Committee some figures which the Treasury officials have specially prepared for me as bearing on the question of States expenditure. I wish honourable members to understand that the States Governments, which are constantly girding at Federation, have enormously increased their expenditure, despite* the fact that the Commonwealth has relieved them of the cost of defence, and of the Post and Telegraph Department, the Customs Department, and other services which I shall enumerate later on. there appears a statement that Tasmania's expenditure, in two years, has increased by £43,000. the actual figures. Before doing so, I wish to explain that during the six years 1899-1900 to 1905-6 the expenditure of the States, after deducting the cost of defence and all other Federal Departments, has increased by £4,242,435. Some people may say that this increase is due to an enormous increase in population. I would point out, however, that . the population on the 31st March, 1900, was 3,775*355a s against 4,119,480 on 31st December, 1906, so that for the six years there was an increase of only 344,125.'

I should have men-, tioned, in connection with this return, The exthat the Treasury officials inform' me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the information that it contains. There is a line at the bottom of it which shows the difficulty experienced. As soon as it was ascertained-for what purpose the information was intended, obstacles were placed in I the way of the Treasury officials obtaining it. Surely it is a most extraordinary thing, that the Federal Government, which Omitting returns to the States more than three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled, does not receive In 1900 the various proper courtesv when it applies for information about the expenditure of the States. Regarding the final item, which is put underthe heading of "" a l l other expenditure, ' in 1900 it amounted to ,£4,438.625, and in 1906 to £4,879,637.

It should be remembered that it takes into account the fact that the cost of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs, and defence-the defence of Australia costing nearly £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum-ha s been deducted from the totals.

600,Mr Mahon,"1899, submitted a report in which he offered, on the basis of a stationary population, a forecast of "" the Tesults of Federation on the finances of Western Australia, as they affect the Colonial Treasurer."" He estimated .the total Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth at £7,181,000 of which Western Australia was to contribute £ 6 3 0 , 0 0 0 . In the first year of the uniform duties, he expected Western Australia to gain £ 9 , 5 0 0 , but in subsequent years he gives the losses to the local Treasury as follows:-secon d year, £ 1 5 0 , 8 0 0 ; third . £ 2 4 2 , 0 5 0 ; fifth year, £ 2 8 7 , 6 5 0 ; sixth and succeeding year's, ' £ 3 3 3 , 5°2 gentleman, who is now putting exaggerated statements before the people of Western Australia, and rousing their animosity against the Federation, was astray with regard to the Commonwealth revenue by no less than £1,500,000.

LYNE due to the decrease in the Western Australian Tariff. appearance of the sliding scale of duties. In the sixth year, when the sliding scale finally disappeared, the amount was £774,7.19. To put the matter in another form, this statistician calculated that the Western Australian Treasury in six years -of a uniform Tariff would lose £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , whereas it has gained in that period something like £2,440,000. the official on whose calculations the public in . the West are now building, and who is responsible for breeding a good deal of disaffection in Western Australia. whom the right honourable member for Swan followed before Federation. If he found it necessary some years ago to reassure Western Australia about the Kingston Tariff, a similar message is doubly necessary now in view of the effusions of this imaginative statistician. The right"" honorthe Western Australian Actuary able member mentioned that of the four great industries of Western Australia the pastoral and agricultural industries did not need protection, but he left it to be inferred that the interests of the other two principal occupations of the people-minin g and timber-getting-coul d -be served by the Tariff. I should like him to explain how protection can benefit the mining industry, for even here no protectionist has yet contended that you can add a shilling to the world value of an ounce of gold or silver by means of Customs duties. However, it is a gain year, £ 1 9 6 , 4 5 0 ; fourth year, to find the right honourable member admitting that certain industries do not need This protection, and, therefore, are not advantaged by it. The other representatives of Western Australia would have welcomed such a declaration in 1901 and 1902, but it was not forthcoming. We received no help at all from the honourable member when, in those days, we fought against the hampering shackles that were being placed on the great primary industries of our State. But he now complains, as a Western Australian member, that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has overshot the mark, and recommended excessive duties. He cites, as articles within that category, mining machinery, barbed wire, apparel and attire, piece goods, and galvanized iron, plain and corrugated. Will it be believed that the duties of which the right honourable gentleman now complains as exT h a t reduction was cessive are in the main identical with those proposed in the Kingston Tariff, as originally brought down, and for which the right honourable member was himself responsible. Here is a short list in proof of my statement. On mining machinery the original Kingston Tariff provided for a duty of 25 per cent.; the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff' Commission is a duty of 25 per cent, on the same item. I wish the Committee to bear in mind that the right honourable This is member for Swan, as one of the members of the Government that brought down the Kingston Tariff, was responsible for the duties it proposed: The duty on barbed . wire under the Kingston Tariff was 20 per This is the unreliable guide cent., and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is also 20 per cent. providing some bgrbed wire for the right honourable member for Swan just now. that the right honourable gentleman is not liere.

602,Mr Wilks,The honourable member is,64,Statementofstateexpenditureoutofrevenue Approximate ||
603,Mr Mahon,"It is to be regrettedto make these statements to his face. On piece goods the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 20 per cent., arid the Tariff Commission propose a similar duty. ston Tariff proposed a duty of 15s. per ton, whilst the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 10 per cent. On corrugated and galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 30s. per ton, and the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 15 per cent. I am not aware of anything that has recently transpired which would make a 25 per cent, duty more burdensome now than it would have been in 1902, when the right honourable gentleman advocated such a duty. When he voted for that high rate of duty on mining machinery, the right honourable gentleman knew, quite as well as he.knows now, the benefit which the primary industries derive from a free and open market in which to purchase their appliances. As a matter of fact, the right honourable gentleman's Government in Western Australia for years admitted such machinery at the nominal rate of 5 per cent, ad valorem. Yet we find him, a few years laterj through some occult influence that has not been explained, throwing to the winds all consideration for the industry which has lifted Western Australia into world-wide prominence and affluence. The other representatives of that State.found him-ranged against them in every crucial division, and if, ultimately, that. In order that I may not delay the ' a less onerous toll was levied upon the primary industries, the relief came not from the right honourable member for Swan. As I have said, I would much prefer that the right honourable gentleman were present to hear these observations, but, in view of his new-born zeal for the primary industries, I propose to show the Committee how he treated the primary industries in 1902, when, as a member of the Government, he might have exercised considerable ' influence and power in determining ' the duties to be submitted to Parliament. On the 16th January, 1902, an amendment was moved that engines, boilers, and pumps, which bore a duty of 25 per cent., should be admitted free. The right honor. able member paired against that. Another attempt was made to reduce the duty to 10 per cent., and he paired against that proposal also, as well as against a third proposal to reduce the duty to 15 per cent., which was lost by 25 votes to 23. He opposed amendments' moved to reduce the -duty on pumps from 25 to 15 per cent., and that on machines and machinery n.e.i. from 25 to 15 per cent. A reduction was moved on the duty of 25 per cent, on screws, and was carried by On galvanized iron the King23 to 19, but the right honourable mem : ber for Swan paired against it. An amendment to reduce the duty on axles from 25 to 10 per cent, was lost bytwo votes, and the right honourable member's vote was counted with the majority. It was proposed to reduce the duty on springs from 25 to 10 per cent., and the right hon? orable member paired against the amend 1 ment. On the 29th January of the same year a motion was moved to exempt all min 1 ingmachinery, and was lost with the assistance of the right honourable member for Swan. Another motion to exempt diamond drills was lost by twenty-two to nineteen; and the right honourable member .for Swari was opposed to any reduction. It will be seen that the articles to which I have re : ferred are used extensively in the mining industry. The right honourable member has always pretended to be a friend of. the agriculturist, and yet when on the 30th' June, 1902, the present Attorney-General carried an amendment for the abolition of the duty on threshing machines by twenty^ eight votes to twenty-two, the right honorable member for Swari voted with the : minority. Again, on manufactures of metals, n.e.i., an attempt was made to reduce the duty from 25 to 15 per cent., and the.right honourable member voted against Committee, I shall just read other items connected with the primary industries of Australia on which the right honourable niem 1 ber for Swan, as a member-of the Government of the day, voted for the retention of the highest duty. tleman is very rough on the right honourable member for Swan. of truth and consistency and proper par' liamentary conduct that what I am stating should be known. to be found at the bottom of a well. to do with the Ministerial conscience. right honourable member voted against reductions proposed from 20 .to 15 per cent on rolled iron and steel beams, and on bolts and nuts.

617,Mr Mahon,"Yes ; he has gone to aon matches at is. per gross, and on bananas at is. per central. That is a little list which I have pleasure in presenting to the right honourable gentleman.""' There are one or two other matters which I had intended to refer to. The other day the honourable gentleman said that he would be ashamed, to have his name associated with such a preferential trade proposal as the Government have submitted in the Tariff. But what did he have his name associated with ? A little while ago he was a member, of a Government which submitted a Bill to give to Great Britain a mere shadow of preference-o n less than £1,000,000 worth of imports-whic h would have been of hardly any value to her. The right honourable gentleman, as an Imperialist, possesses a great regard for the mother country. I think if I called myself an Imperialist I should be a more genuine preferential trader than that; I wculd be prepared to make some sacrifice by way of proving the genuine nature of mv Imperial spirit. But the ridvt honourable gentleman does not want to make any sacrifice. professes protectionist principles being a preferential trader at all. We heard him ma'ke some remarks on leaving office about the naval subsidy, which I think will be found at the"" bottom of his breaking with the Government. He is mainly responsible for, and is rather proud of, the fact that Australia is paying annually '-£200,000 ,'that is nearly one-fourth of our total outlay on defence to Great Britain as a naval subsidy. He complains of the Prime. Minister having expressed some dissatisfaction with the Naval Agreement. But he must know perfectly well that the original dissatisfaction with it was expressed by .the Admiral on the Australian station^Admiral Fanshawe -sometim e before the Prime Minister referred to the matter. If fhe right honourable gentleman makes this an excuse for leaving the Government I want to know why he did not challenge the Prime Minister when the honourable and learned gentleman, to his knowledge, wrote the following despatch on the 28th August, 1905, to the Secretary of StateThe 'Nav.il Commander-in-Chief, Sir A. Fanshawe, has recently criticised this Agreement on several public occasions in order to support his contention that our contribution, .is there fixed, is altogether insufficient. Since, as be distinctively of that character. vet, only three payments have been made . . . this appeal for an alteration of its terms might be deemed premature. But as it may indicate Mr Mahon. a dissatisfaction with the agreement shared by the Lords of the Admiralty, as well as by their official representativesThis is the passage on which I wish to lay stressand as a similar dissatisfaction, though upon other grounds, exists here, it may be advantageous to commence its reconsideration without delay. The paramount importance of the Navy to the British Empire and to Australia may be taken to be freely admitted. Nothing jn this despatch is intended to question it. Indeed, our obligations to share in the general defence of the Empire have been already recognised in practice and in principle. It the right honourable member for Swan was opposed to the discontinuance of the Naval Agreement he should have protested against the sending of this despatch to the old country. Here is another unequivocal sentence,Beyond this, the defence of Australia and of its coasts is accepted as a duty and as a necessity of our national self-respect. Yet even under these circumstances, the present Naval Agreement is not, and never has been, popular in the Commonwealth. I cannot understand a man who not to regard it as unpopular, because it has made provision on the Estimates for this year's contribution. believed to be unpopular. The document continuesIt has been approved only in default of a better means of indicating our acceptance of Imperial responsibilities. Whatever may be the assumed basis upon which our contribution is there determined, it is regarded as merely an arbitrary proportion of an existing expenditure. Whatever the intention may have been, this attempt at joint naval action has failed to enlist a fraction of the support that was spontaneously accorded in all the States to the despatch of military contingents to South Africa. On this account, the question why the Naval Agreement is coldly regarded here appears serious enough to merit careful scrutiny. There is much truth in the customary interpretation that its want of popularity is due to the fact that, except to the small extent permitted by ArticlesV . , VI . , and VII . , none of our grant is applied to any distinctively Australian purpose. That is pretty strong. Prime Minister of a' Government which proposed the Agreement with enthusiasm.

I thought I had made it clear to every honourable member that the Prime Minister himself wishes to deal with the question upon his return. But for that fact I should have made a statement on the subject. I am familiar with the matters to which the honourable member for Coolgardie has referred. . I know who was responsible for the partly private sittings of the Conference, and why they took place. If the honourable member knew the facts he would agree that it was right that certain statements should be made in private, and that the official report has not been manipulated in the sense in which that word may sometimes be used. There are occasions when the Imperial Government consider it unwise to give to the world their intentions in regard to certain matters. Hain obtained his information ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE porter in London, and every one knows how the press fossick out information. Some of his statements are not correct. member ought to make a statement on the subject. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am not going to be drawn into a discussion of the matter. I have told the House why I have refrained from dealing with the question, and I think that the majority of honourable members are satisfied. They know that the Prime Minister is at all times honest in his declarations, and it is not quite fair to hurl imputations at the Government for not having before dealt with this matter. I felt to-night, whilst listening to the remarks made by. the honourable member for Coolgardie, that certain criticisms were unfair to the Government, and to the Prime Minister, who, I am sorry to tendance here. Postmaster-General a statement contained in a letter placed in my hands to the effect that the wages of carpenters engaged in the telegraph pole yard, Sturt-street, South Melbourne, have been reduced from 10s. per day to 8s. per day. I understand that men engaged in performing the same class of work in Sydney are paid ns. per day. If the Public Service Commissioner has reduced, the wages of these carpenters, I think that he has ignored the desire of the House and of the community at large. Surely a carpenter, as an educated artisan, is worth more than 8s. a day? That, I understand, is the rate of pay received by labourers in the employ of the Commonwealth. I may add that, in bringing this matter under the notice of the Postmaster'General, I am acting in conjunction with the honourable member for Bourke. should like to know whether the Acting Prime Minister can give the House any information as to the condition of the Prime Minister's health, and whether we may hope soon to see the honourable gentleman, -completely restored, amongst us again ? I wish to suggest to the Acting Prime Minister the desirableness of reverting to the old hours of meeting. I think that until we have disposed of the Tariff we should meet COOK -Wher e has Mr as before, at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays, and should adjourn for dinner for only one He was a rehour instead of one hour and a quarter. .of an hour is appreciated by those who go home to dinner.",72,Forrest W H Y Attack Me Member Seems To Take A Real Pleasure In

But I have no control over that officer's classification, and he considers that his expert advice is of such a character that he cannot authorize the payment of more than 8s. per day. 'He is now calling for applications for permanent employees at that rate. I have told him that I do not consider that that is a fair wage for the work. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [11.6] I desire to make a personal explanation. I understand that, during my absence, as well as after I put in an appearance .toriight, the honourable member for CoolgarcTie referred to me and criticised me on account of several, votes which he said I gave upon the Tariff several years ago. He seemed to desire to prove that I shall be inconsistent if I do' not vote now exactly in the same way as I did more than five years ago It is a well-known rule that members of Parliament who join Governments have to sinktheir individual opinions in many respects-bu t not, of course, in matters affecting their consciences, or which are so F o r years, when grave as to necessitate their separating themselves from their colleagues. A member of. a Cabinet cannot, consistently with the loyal support which' he owes-to his colleagues, absent himself from divisions. But I-have no objection now to saying that, in regard to some of the excessive duties of the old Tariff, as well as in regard to some other minor .matters,. I held certain opinions not fully shared by my colleagues. Every one who has anything to do . with Governments, or with companies, or with business of any kind, knows, however, that every one has to sink his individual views to some extent. For the honourable member to parade votes which he states I gave as a subordinate member of the Government, in loyalty to my colleagues, who were in 'a majority in that Government, and to base upon those votes a ciiarge of inconsistency against me, was, I think, as unnecessary as it was unfair. . ist Government ? The Commissioner Sir JOHN FORREST Yes , certainly it was, but there are many grades of protection. I repeat that a man who joins a Government is compelled to be loyal to his colleagues, and may not always wholly approve of what is proposed. I have never, been an excessive protectionist. I am a good moderate protectionist, but not I have represented to a prohibitionist. I feel myself at liberty at the present time-fiv e years after the other Tariff was dealt with-to do what I consider, under the existing conditions of Australia, to be right and just to my State and' the Commonwealth, and not to be unduly bound by votes which, under other circumstances, I then gave in concert with those with whom I was associated. I very much regret that the right honourable member for Swan should regard my criticisms as unfair or unnecessary. I feel, sure that if he had been here and heard the whole of my speech he would have viewed it much more philosophically, and would have shown much less heat, if he had replied at all. member has often accused the party with which I am proud to be associated of being caucus dominated and iron bound.
