Wednesday, 23 May 2012 Maranoa Electorate: Royal Flying Doctor Service the wonderful contribution of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which they make and have made for such a long time across rural and remote parts of Australia. Earlier this month I had the great pleasure of opening the RFDS's dynamic new visitor information display at the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre in Longreach. The display will ensure that the RFDS story and its history will be conveyed to many thousands of people who visit the hall of fame, and will also add to the other stories of the history of the pioneers and the pioneering spirit of the people of the outback. The RFDS has provided a mantle of safety for travellers and the people of the outback for the past 84 years, and I know they will continue to do it for many, many decades to come. Many of these visitors and tourists are from our cities and overseas, and there are also those people who live in rural and remote parts of Australia. The Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame in Longreach is the perfect place to tell this magnificent and wonderful part of our history and the ongoing story. After the opening of the Royal Flying Doctor Service visitor information centre, which I was privileged to open, I spoke to one of the flight nurses about the sort of call that they are likely to receive when they are called to an emergency. She said that one went like this: the flight nurse asked the caller, 'What was the colour of the skin under the gash on the patient?' And the bushie said, 'Well, I'll ask me old mate because my foot's in the paddock. See, my foot's not with me.' From this, the nurse had to deal immediately with an emergency situation in a remote community. Of course, the Royal Flying Doctor Service was once again on its way to help that patient, but I think that it describes graphically the laid-back approach of many people of rural and remote Australia: 'I'll be right; there is someone always worse off.' It describes an emergency situation that can often come across the desk of the Royal Flying Doctor Service centre. The RFDS has come a long way since the early vision of the Reverend John Flynn. Flynn witnessed the daily struggle of pioneers living in remote areas, where just two doctors so often provided the only medical care for an area of almost two million square kilometres. Today, the RFDS owns a fleet of some 53 fully instrumented and medically equipped aircraft with the latest navigation technology. Flynn's vision to provide the mantle of safety for these people started on 15 May 1928, and his dream became a reality from that very humble beginning when they used a pedal radio to give medical advice to remote stations and communities across Australia. Today, the RFDS operates from 21 bases across Australia, and each year pilots fly the equivalent of 25 round trips to the moon. The RFDS doctors and their flight nurses are responsible for the care of over 270,000 patients each year. I commend the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame and the executive of the RFDS for the wonderful display that they now have(Time expired)",174,Adjournment Billion To The Gross State Product Over The Life

233,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Second Deputy Speaker) (09:30): I rise to acknowledgePage Electorate: Coal Seam Gas Ms SAFFIN (Page) (09:33): I want to raise the issue of coal seam gas and what is happening in my area. What issue would bring together a children's TV character-that is, dirtgirl from dirtgirlworld-the Presentation Sisters of Lismore diocese, the CWA, five local councils, environmental groups, farmers and thousands of residents across the Northern Rivers? This month, in Lismore, where I live, an estimated 7,000 people took part in a march and rally in the streets to make their voices heard in opposition to coal seam gas mining and exploration in the Northern Rivers region. This rally did not get media coverage on the national level but I wanted to bring this to the attention of the parliament because it was an incredible show of unity of purpose a very diverse group of people. The heading in the local paper, Northern Star, said, 'Community unites against CSG'. That is what we have in my area: a community, and a community united against CSG. Among them were the Presentation Sisters of Lismore. They marched under a banner which read, 'Presentation people say no to CSG'. As it said in the Northern Star, a directive from the International Presentation Association states that part of their mission is to confront personal and corporate greed: … which contribute to the present extremes of wealth and poverty and the degradation of Earth. One of the rally's organisers, Amanda Doran, said she got involved in the CSG action after hearing a Queensland farmer, Brian Monk, who has been travelling around giving talks on this. He was talking about his kids-or grandkids, I think it was-getting skin reactions from their bathwater, which had been polluted from CSG bore water. This is an issue that drew many people from the Northern Rivers to attend a rally in Sydney at the parliament, including members of the CWA both at state level and also locally. That was where dirtgirl from dirtgirlworld, a children's TV show, made her presence felt. As she said, she was making her first political stand on the issue of CSG. Since early last year, anti-CSG groups have been getting active right across the region and have been coming to see me to raise their concerns. There is the Clarence Valley Alliance Against Coal Seam Gas, the Group Against Gas Kyogle, the Keerrong Gas Squad, CSG Free Northern Rivers, and the umbrella group, which is Lock the Gate-there is that broader movement, but it is Lock the Gate Northern Rivers, a local chapter. Also, four of the five local councils in my Page electorate have declared some form of moratorium. They are saying that they are against it because we do not know what the impacts are and we are very concerned about what we do know, particularly with water. Richmond Valley Council approved a moratorium on all new coal seam gas projects on council-owned land until the state government adopts its new Strategic Regional Land Use Policy. Canning Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program project in my electorate, at Ocean Road Primary School. The expected completion date was before the end of 2010 for the new early learning centre with a playground. As we are now almost halfway through 2012, I was astounded to find out that the BER project at this school is yet to be completed some 1½ years later. The new BER classroom itself has been finished, but it is surrounded by builders' fences. The early learning centre playground is not started,",178,Constituency Statements
234,Mr Randall (Canning) (09:36,"I wish to raise the issue of an uncompleted BERlandscaping is not finished and there are still piles of sand and construction rubbish around the school. How did this shambolic state of affairs transpire? I have been to the school and examined this myself on a couple of occasions. Remember that this is a centre for children four or five years old. This is an area where they need play facilities as part of their education, and they need this project completed so that they can use it safely. I have not only visited the school, as I said, but been in contact with the principal, Dean Finlay, who is at his wit's end about how to try to get these works completed. I have tried for seven months now to get a resolution for the students, staff and parents of Ocean Road Primary School, yet we are still waiting for the project to be finished even though I have raised it in this place before. You would think that either state or federal education authorities would have contacted me about this issue, but no. On 27 October 2011 I wrote to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Peter Garrett. I outlined the issue. Five months later, after no reply from Minister Garrett, I received a response from Minister Brendan O'Connor stating that these projects were progressing and there were negotiations, and all the florid language you would expect from Minister O'Connor. SoI visited the school again to check these assurances from the minister that things were progressing well. This was over the school holidays. There was a large hole dug for the reticulation, four feet deep and 20 metres long, and consequently the school had problems watering the gardens. I then contacted Minister O'Connor's office, and he told me that it had been passed on to Jacinta Collins's office. IfI had not rung the Western Australian education department yesterday and spoken to Milan Trifunovic, who heads the BMA, I would not have found out that shade had been completed, curbing to the soft-fall area has now been completed and they expect that by 28 May they should have finished so that the children of this school might eventually get to use this worthwhile BER project. But why has it taken so long? Why the malaise and the delays? Finally we may have some action thanks to Milan Trifunovic and the WA education department. Braham, Mr William community advocate from my electorate of Hindmarsh who sadly passed away recently, Mr William Braham. He will be missed by all. He was a very good and a great man. He was born in 1920 and dedicated his working life and much of his retirement to community work and to the union movement. In particular, Bill worked tirelessly to improve workers' superannuation and took on leadership positions with SA Superannuants. Mr Braham successfully represented the template-makers in the Vehicle Builders Union in 1964, before Commissioner Murray Stewart. He also lobbied for an appeal board for daily paid workers and was appointed to the board when it was established. Between 1957 and 1978, Bill was a representative member to the Vehicle Builders Union Superannuation Federation. Subsequently he was transferred to the Railway Transport Officers Association and made a representative to the Australian Services Union, or the Federated Clerks Union as it was known back then. Bill Braham was also a member of local bowling clubs in my electorate for over 50 years, a remarkable achievement. He joined the Railways Bowling Club in 1955 and the Grange Bowling Club in 1968, where he became a life member. Grange Bowling Club had a",179,Constituency Statements
235,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (09:39,"It is an honour for me to pay tribute to a tirelessremarkable history of achievement with approximately 10 of its members having played for Australia. I was delighted to be asked by Bill, when I was first elected, to become the patron of the Grange Bowling Club and I have enjoyed visiting the club at each opportunity to share the members' sense of fun and community spirit. Bill would engage me in conversations about the union movement of the past, the labour movement and history. Bill was also a lifelong member of the Freemasons and was very active and committed in this role, making an enormous contribution. He held a number of positions within the Freemasons. When he moved to the Masonic Homes Somerton Park retirement village in my electorate he continued his service to the community, becoming an advocate for senior Australians. Many times he asked me to go to the Masonic Homes at Somerton Park to talk to residents who had issues or problems that we tried to solve. Even in his later life he was always advocating on behalf of other people. In the words of Doug Strain, CEO of Masonic Homes, 'Bill was one of the true believers, always acting in the best interests of the people who he represented.' This month would have marked Bill and Joyce Braham's 70th wedding anniversary. I extend my sincere condolences to Mrs Joyce Braham and her family on their loss. Bill will be sadly missed by many people in the Hindmarsh community, in the Masonic Homes, in the Freemasons and in the Grange Bowling Club. McPherson Electorate: Uniting Church electorate of McPherson and today I would like to acknowledge two very special people, George and Mildred Hohl. Mildred Hohl is 96 years old and George turned 101 on 21 April. On 20 March this year, George and Mildred celebrated 75 years of marriage. This is a remarkable achievement, and I congratulate them both on this very wonderful achievement. I first met George and Mildred about 16 years ago as they are members of the Burleigh Heads Uniting Church, where my father was an elder, and both George and Mildred were in the congregation on the day that my youngest daughter was christened. George and Mildred are two of the nicest people that you could ever meet. They are truly a very devoted couple, and I feel very privileged to know them. They have been a wonderful support over the years to my parents, especially to my mother over the last couple of years. I know that they have provided very wonderful support and friendship to many other members of the church. Both George and Mildred are held in very high regard by the congregation. They kept their 75th wedding anniversary fairly quietly amongst the church congregation. When this came up and it was mentioned to George, his reply was, 'I don't like to brag.' I think that says a lot about George and also about Mildred. They are both very humble people with very big hearts. They have nine children, 21 grandchildren and more than 40 greatgrandchildren. I am sure their anniversary party was one heck of a party with all of those family members joining in the celebration. The Burleigh Heads Uniting Church, where George and Mildred are part of the congregation, is also the base for the Never Alone friendship group that was founded by Neville and Dulcie Free. Both Neville and Dulcie received a McPherson Community Achiever Award last year for the work that they have done with this community group and",180,Constituency Statements

I congratulate Neville and Dulcie on the wonderful work that they do. The Never Alone friendship group meets once a week, generally on a Wednesday, and there are 40 members of that group. They come along and participate in a range of activities-they might play bingo, they might go on an outing-but basically the purpose of the group is to provide support, friendship and companionship to older members of our community. Neville and Dulcie Free set up the group specifically to help relieve the feeling of isolation that many people feel. The southern Gold Coast does have a significant number of older people, some of whom are on their own now and really need the support and friendship that is offered by the Never Alone friendship group. I thank Neville and Dulcie Free. I thank Reverend Colin Batt from the Burleigh Heads Uniting Church, and I thank the congregation for the work they do. Foreign Ownership Economy maintenance staff. We have a government in power in Australia that do not seem to have any interest whatsoever in the fact that Qantas is being hollowed out. The only remotely nice thing I could say about the federal government is that they would be extremely better than their opponents, who are the last of the great free traders. Well, you free trade and you hand your Qantas over to overseas interests-as you have handed your entire mining industry over to foreign interests. I see one gentleman over here with a grin on his face. Well, I would not have thought it was funny when the six great mining companies in Australia that accounted for 82 per cent of this nation's mining output under his government were handed over to foreign ownership. WouldI have been proud of that? As to the dairy industry-every single factory in Australia was owned by Australians. You people handed over four-fifths of those factories to foreign ownership, and then you deregulated us so they could pay what they felt like to us, to we poor farmers. You people do not listen to your constituents, but I would like you to have been on the telephone yesterday to one of my constituents and to have listened to the plight of the dairy farmers-the plight that you left them in in Australia. Within two years of your deregulation, there was a farmer committing suicide in this country every four days. Those are not my statistics-they are your statistics. And do you know what your leader on agriculture, your leader of the National Party said? He said, 'Your figures are wrong.' That was his reaction: 'Your figures are wrong.'

And if he thinks he is going to fly 40,000 miners into the Galilee Basin to mine those mines, taking Australian jobs away and undermining our pay, he can think again. Pond, Ms Kristy constituent in my electorate, Ms Kristy Pond. Born prematurely with cerebral palsy and other significant health issues requiring long-term, arduous treatment and surgery, Kristy and her family have faced numerous challenges over the past 15 years. Never expected to walk or talk, Kristy has defied the odds in an amazing way and excelled on the athletic field. Her passion for wheelchair athletics is inspirational and a wonderful testament to what can be achieved through a positive attitude, focus and commitment. Kristy's long list of sporting achievements, including setting Australian records and her many gold medals, is very impressive, but not as impressive as her tenacity and her respect for discipline in the demanding nature of her training. In the worlds of Carl Lewis, track and field champion worldwide, it is all about the journey and not about the outcome. I have had the privilege of meeting Kristy and getting to know her and her family. I can tell you that she is a dedicated young lady. She is a humble achiever. She is somebody who quietly enjoys her journey so far. In spite of her high profile in the sporting world and her dominance on the track, she remains a very fun-loving and committed 15-year-old. Her talent is highly sought after, and Kristy is invited to many local, national and international events. She has caught the eye of many on and off the track and has been nominated for a Pride of Australia medal in the Child of Courage category. The International Paralympic Committee has named her athlete of the month, the second youngest ever winner of the award. She has been named Parramatta Sportsperson of the Year and NewsLocal Junior Sports Star, and she ran the Queen's baton prior to the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This year Kristy has been named New South Wales Young Athlete with a Disability. In 2011, during the Oceania Paralympic Championships held in conjunction with the Arafura Games in Darwin, Kristy won an outstanding seven gold medals. She takes on all her competitors with courage and says that she loves the challenge and the journey. I am happy to report for the House that the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games will be the 15th Paralympics and will take place between 29 August and 9 September 2012 in London. It was fantastic to hear that Kristy has been chosen to represent Australia at the games. I know she is going to go on to do great things. I congratulate her for this great honour on behalf of my electorate and all members here. I wish her every success and a wonderful life experience that she will never forget. It would be remiss of me to overlook in all of this the dedication and selflessness of Kristy's mother, Jenny, who sacrificed so much to coach her daughter to reach her personal goals. Jenny and her family are the essence of parents and families who love their children and encourage and support their children's abilities and talents in achieving such great things,",182,Constituency Statements

Lindsay Electorate: Nepean Athletics Club (09:52): I recently had the pleasure of attending the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Nepean Athletics Club at St Marys Band Club. Nepean Athletics has a long and proud history in my local community. The club was first formed in 1961, with the assistance of St Marys Senior High School. Built on the efforts of its volunteers, the club has grown from strength to strength over the last 50 years, supported by donations, working bees and the skills of local seamstresses. Nepean Athletics has been a nursery for some fine athletes over the years, many going on to represent the Nepean region at a state and national level. By the late 1980s, Nepean had four athletes selected in the first World Juniors team: Mark Garner, Michelle Keys, Ian Garrett and Stephen Perry. Since then, Nepean Athletics has had at least one athlete in most of the World Juniors teams. Some of the strongest local competitors from our region over the years have included Linda Coffee, Susan Knapton, Michelle French, Stephen Hadfield, Brenda MacNaughton, Bekie Lee and Brook Keys. Nepean Athletics can also proudly claim three local athletes who went on to represent Australia in the Olympic Games: Ian Garrett, Nick A'Hern and Mark Garner. Ian and Mark also represented Australia at the Commonwealth Games, along with fellow local athlete Bev Hayman. The club was also proudly represented at the Paralympics by visually impaired local resident Ed Holicky. Local residents Amber Menzies, Greg Hunt and Jason Zabiello also went on to achieve success at the international level following their time at Nepean Athletics. These are fantastic achievements of which I know our local community is very proud. A strong team of veteran athletes currently represent our region through Nepean Athletics on a state, national and international level. These athletes include Heike Forth, Gabie Watts, Belinda Westcott, Annette Tillman, Michelle French, Robert Osborne, Ken Porter, Vanessa Beddie, Anthony Butt and Sally Agius. I congratulate these athletes on all their success in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dedicated volunteers have been the backbone of Nepean Athletics, doing everything from organising fun runs to staffing barbecues. In particular, I congratulate and thank secretary and fundraiser Evelyn Stark, who has committed 22 years to Nepean Athletics. Along with her husband Phil, now vice-president and fundraiser, Evelyn has made an invaluable contribution to our community through her involvement in Nepean Athletics. For many, Evelyn has long been the face of Nepean Athletics in the broader community. I also acknowledge and thank treasurer Ron Keys, who has devoted over 25 years to building the sport of athletics in our region. At the age of 80, Ron never misses a BBQ fundraiser or an opportunity to share his coaching skills. I congratulate Nepean Athletics on this fantastic 50-year milestone. Flynn Electorate: Telecommunications Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (09:55): TodayI want to talk about a looming problem with the telecommunications connections in my electorate, especially in the city of Gladstone.

243,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)on the radar. The radio airwaves are full of advertisements spruiking the virtues and the benefits of the NBN, but this money could now be better spent on fixing the problems. Rockhampton, 100 kilometres to the north, will be hooked up some time after the year 2015. Gladstone, on the other hand, is undergoing an industrial boom-there is $65 billion in gas projects underway at this very point, with new housing allotments and workers villages going up like mushrooms. A lot of these new greenfield housing sites have still to be constructed, in the future. Residents on these greenfield sites have already paid for the internal connections into the new homes for the NBN. This is where the problem is: there is no sign of the NBN being hooked up to the Gladstone area for years to come. So what are these people supposed to do? A new shopping centre opened on Kirkwood Road. It had no ability to hook up to EFTPOS, the internet or a landline. There was confusion between the NBN and Telstra footprints of the area. The powers that be then decided, 'We'll have to change the network from NBN to Telstra,' but no-one told Telstra. Meanwhile, these new businesses were expected to operate for the first three weeks without any EFTPOS and no internet or landline. You can see the confusion that it has created. There is a housing shortage in Flynn and Gladstone. Looking into the future, these greenfield sites are all dressed up with nowhere to go. National Heart Foundation Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (09:57): This morning the Parliamentary Heart Foundation and Stroke Foundation Friendship Group had a breakfast here in Parliament House. It was a very successful breakfast. Dr Lyn Roberts, the CEO of National Heart Foundation, addressed the breakfast, along with Juleen Cavanagh and Nicole Baxter. Juleen is a survivor of heart attack and Nicole Baxter is a cardiac nurse. It was a very interesting morning. The member for Hasluck and I are the joint conveners of that committee. It was good to look at heart attack with the Heart Foundation's this morning. There was emphasis placed on the Heart Foundation's Go Red for Women campaign. They reiterated the fact that there is no single cause of heart disease, but risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and family history increase your chances of developing it. Ninety per cent of Australian women have at least one risk factor for heart disease and 50 per cent have two or more. Nearly one in three women aged 30 to 65 have been told by a doctor that they have high blood pressure. That is 1.6 million women, but only one in 10 knows that it puts them at risk of heart disease-quite an alarming factor. Thirty per cent of women aged 30 to 65 have been told by a doctor they have high cholesterol, and there is no doubt whatsoever that high blood pressure or high cholesterol increases the risk of heart attack and heart disease. The Heart Foundation message is that women should know their personal risk factors and the factors that can lead to heart disease-and, of course, it is not only women who are at risk of heart disease. This week the absolute risk of heart disease factors was released. It is a calculation of the risk of a heart attack. Guidelines for the management of risk are being released this week, and this will allow an approach to the prevention of heart attack and strokes in Australia. Next Tuesday morning the member for Hasluck and I will be starting a walking group of members and senators. We are leaving from the House of Representatives on Tuesday at seven o'clock and we hope that we are joined by many members of this parliament, because we think we need to send out a positive message to the community that we need to address the issues of heart attack and enjoy a healthy lifestyle. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

Wayne Swan is a responsible budget and a fair budget. It is a budget which reflects good management of the Australian economy through some very difficult times-difficult times which many overseas countries are still grappling with. We are currently seeing that in the Greek elections-new elections are going to be held on 17 June. We saw it only a few days ago when Tomislav Nikolic was elected as the new President of Serbia. We saw it in France when Francois Hollande was elected as the new President of France, also not long ago. And we saw it in Italy, when Mario Monti replaced Silvio Berlusconi as Prime Minister of Italy. We are seeing it in many other countries, where the pressure of governments to cope with their struggling economies is causing them serious difficulties. More recently we saw it in the USA, when JP Morgan incurred a loss of some $2 billion; although, even that figure is still under scrutiny. These are indeed difficult times, which the Gillard government has steered the Australian economy successfully through with relatively minimal impact on Australian life. In some respects that has been a problem for the government, because many people who do not have the good fortune to be able to travel overseas have not been able to see for themselves just how difficult life has become over the past three years in many of the countries that in the past we thought were doing very well. Again that is also reflected in: unemployment rates in this country, which have dropped below five per cent-I believe the figure is around 4.9 per cent at the moment; interest rates",184,Constituency Statements

It is in that context that the budget was indeed framed. And it is a budget which ensures that all Australians share in Australia's mineral wealth; mineral wealth which most Australians do not share in and have not shared in for too long; and mineral wealth from which most of the profits end up offshore. This budget sets out to address this inequity; an inequity which has resulted in what some describe as a patchwork economy-an economy where some sectors are doing very well, others are doing okay and some are struggling. It is those sectors, the ones that are struggling, that this budget provides the greatest assistance to. I want to talk about some of that assistance and, in particular, how it relates to my own electorate of Makin. In Makin, 8,900 local families are expected to receive a total of $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school, totalling $9.4 million worth of assistance to those families as a result of the school kids bonus payment. That payment will replace the education tax refund. So it is not effectively a new payment; it is a payment that in my own local area some 1,600 families did not access last year. They did not access it either because they were not aware of their entitlement to it or they were not able to produce the receipts. For all the criticism that has been made of that particular payment by members opposite, say it is one measure that I not only strongly support but believe makes absolute sense. For anyone to suggest that you can send your child to school, whether it is to primary or high school, for less than $400 or $800 for the secondary school child is absolute nonsense. To suggest that you need to have receipts to prove that you have incurred that kind of expense is also a nonsense. Quite frankly, this is the way it should have been from the start, and I congratulate the government for in fact changing the process, which now means that everyone who should be entitled to those funds gets them. With respect to these benefits, more than 11,000 local families in Makin will receive an increase of up to $600 in their family tax benefit part A payments. That increase will flow from 1 July 2013. There will be a supplementary allowance to help with the cost of living for 7,921 local young people currently receiving allowances-single parents and unemployedby providing cash payments to help meet the costs of essential services like electricity, gas and water. Singles will receive a supplementary allowance of $210 while couples will receive $350. I am also pleased to see that only this morning legislation was introduced into the House establishing a National Children's Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. I think that is a good and very welcome move regarding our responsibility in ensuring that children are protected. Approximately 55,000 people in Makin will receive a tax cut as of 1 July. Around 46,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300 and, due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold, 4,000 local residents will pay no tax at all. Those numbers apply again to the electorate of Makin, which I represent. As a result of Labor's tax cuts for lowand middle-income earners, the average wage earner in Makin now pays approximately $1200 less in tax than in 2007-08. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 23,700 local workers earning up to $37,000. From October, local dads and other partners in Makin will be able to apply for Labor's new Dad and Partner Pay Scheme, which begins in January 2013 and is being debated in the House right now. I would now like to turn to small business. As a result of having been involved in small business, it is an area that I have not only had a long time personal interest in but one where this side of the House is often criticised by members opposite for not providing enough support. Nothing could be further from the truth. With respect to small business, having been a small business operator since the time. I left school prior to coming into this place, I understand the difficulties that small business operators face. I understand the sacrifices they make. I understand the risks they take, and I also understand how hard they work-often without any breaks, no paid holidays; without paid sick leave and without any form of work cover. In that respect, I very much welcome the announcements made by the Treasurer in respect of small business, where $6,500 will be provided as an instant asset write-off and up to $5,000 upfront motor vehicle depreciation allowance will also be provided. For companies earning under $2 million, the provision of up to $1 million of lost carry-back will also be a very welcome measure. Last month I had the privilege of formally opening the new premises of Savill Packaging in my electorate of Makin. Savill Packaging provides catering and packaging products. It is a family-owned business which was established 30 years ago in 1982. On 20 April, its new premises at Langford Street, Pooraka, were officially opened, although they had been operating there for some months. I was asked to participate in the official opening and to address those present. It was a terrific opportunity for me to speak not only to Geoff Phillips and his team, who run Savill Packaging, but also to numerous other local businesspeople who equally run small or medium-sized businesses. It has given me a tremendous insight into the things which are important to those businesses and how they are coping under the difficult economic circumstances which so many others face, and what they are doing to overcome the difficulties they confront. Savill Packaging ought to be commended in every sense of the word. It started 30 years ago employing two or three people and has now grown to employ 25 people, all of whom are locals. These kinds of companies keep local economies ticking over-locals who live, work and recreate in the area and who understand the area and depend on the 2.7 million small or medium-sized businesses around Australia for their employment. Small and medium-sized businesses in this country form the biggest individual employment sector and it is important that governments understand that. That is why the measures introduced by the government in the budget are going to be very welcome. I also acknowledge that Savill Packaging not only employ local people but also care about the future-many of their products are what we would now refer to as 'environmentally friendly'. They are a great example of people who work hard but care about the local community and the local people within it. I commend them for what they have done to date and wish them well for their future operations. There are a range of matters in this budget which are going to be important for communities around Australia. The one area on which I want to comment is the commitment of $1 billion over four years to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As has been said by others in this place, from the middle of next year select launch sites around the country will begin servicing people with disability. From the middle of 2014, some 20,000 people will be supported as a result of this program. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is long overdue and, I know, is supported by members on both sides of the House. Last month, along with members from both sides of the House, I attended a rally in Adelaide in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We heard and saw first hand the families and people who will benefit from the investment of money into this scheme. I believe that, if those of us who attended the rally were not convinced of the need for the scheme, we never will be. Quite frankly, not only is it long overdue but our neglect of people with disabilities has gone on for too long and it is time for governments at all levels to do whatever they can to ensure that the lives of people with a disability and their families are given greater assistance. I also welcome the $3.7 billion of funding towards aged care in Australia. Again, like disability, it is an area that has been neglected for far too long. It is an area where the demands on families have exceeded the ability of many families to cope with them. I frequently talk to people in this sector. It is an area that I am personally familiar with because my father spent the last few years of his life in a nursing home. I saw the care that he required during that period-care that my brothers and sister and I were able to support him with but which, in many cases, is simply not there. There may not be the family network support to assist the person in need, and so we rely on a system to provide that support, a system that has been straining under the weight of demands: financial demands and more general demands and, in many cases, not even having sufficient staff. The $3.7 billion of funding will not only provide better care for people in nursing homes; it will also ensure that more of those people remain in their own homes. Lastly, I want to comment on a matter that I was somewhat disappointed with: that we were not able to fund our overseas aid commitment that was committed to last year to the level that I would have liked. The total overseas aid budget has risen by $300 million, and I acknowledge that. It went from $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion. In dollar terms, that is the largest aid budget in Australia's history and, at 0.35 per cent of gross national income, the highest proportion since 1985. There is continued growth and, in three years, we will be the sixth largest donor in the OECD, up from 10th largest today. We are on track to reach $7.7 billion, or 0.5 per cent of gross national income, by 2016-17. WhilstI would like to have seen more money put into that area, I acknowledge the additional funds that have been committed. (Time expired) small words but their meaning represents values far greater. Hope reward and opportunity: this is what our country needs right now and this is what the coalition can deliver to the people of Australia. The Australia that I know is one with hope for every young person to be rewarded for their efforts with endless opportunities for their future, and an Australia that allows any young person with the desire to achieve and the hard work to go with it to enjoy a comfortable life. That is the Australian dream. To maintain this dream we need a nation not afraid to be bold in its vision and a government that can foster such a society. It is for this reason that I rise to speak today, because the coalition has a vision and a strong plan for Australia's future: a plan to restore hope, reward and opportunity. The coalition has a strong plan that will see Australians have confidence in their economy, confidence in their government and confidence in their futurea strong plan that will see the carbon tax and the mining tax abolished and swift action to reduce the overbearing cost of living and ease the burden on Australians. The coalition has a proven fiscal record. In my lifetime, the coalition has delivered 10 budget surpluses while Labor has delivered 10 budget deficits. We know that just as families need to live on their means so too do governments. In the coalition, we are governed by a belief that governments do not have any money of their own: they only have the people's money held in trust, and this money should be used wisely and sufficiently. We respect taxpayers' money, which is why a coalition government will eliminate government waste and mismanagement. We will boost productivity, deliver lower and simpler taxation and improve public finances. Our vision for the future is for an even better Australia: one with secure jobs and a healthy small business sector, and one which looks after its most vulnerable with a hand-up instead of a handout. The coalition will provide practical and real environmental action to protect our irreplaceable natural environment, in stark contrast to Labor's carbon tax, which is little more than socialism masquerading as environmentalism. We will implement real measures, sensible measures. We will take genuine action by introducing incentives to boost renewable energy use and reduce emissions from the oldest and most inefficient power stations. We will go about this in a way that protects jobs and energy security while keeping electricity prices in check. We will invest $100 million each year for one million solar energy homes by 2020 and will support initiatives to plant 20 million trees in available public spaces. We will establish an emissions reduction fund to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from business and industry. Through the fund, we will support 140 million tonnes of abatement per annum by 2020 to meet our target of a five per cent reduction. All of this will be done with carrots instead of a heavy-handed stick. As a nation we have a responsibility to provide a security net for our most vulnerable and in need. In this vein, a coalition government will make a strong investment in mental health. We will put forward $1.5 billion for a mental health plan that will establish 20 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres with 800 beds for acute and subacute care, as well as an additional 60 headspace sites providing young people with support and services for mental health and general well-being. The coalition will also build a strong future with a hand-up for Australian families. Our paid maternity plan will provide real support for families with 26 weeks of paid parental leave at full replacement wage. We recognise the need for a plan to tackle the challenges that lie ahead, to manage our population, productivity and workforce participation. The coalition's plan is about genuine assistance to enable women to remain in the workforce if they so choose. The coalition will also provide a hand-up for our health system. We will build a stronger health system by handing power back to communities. Australians do not want their money being wasted on layers of bureaucracy. Australians would be best served by those on the ground-the doctors and nurses who know our hospitals best-those professionals who are the ones best placed to make day-to-day decisions to maximise the responsiveness and efficiency of our hospitals. These professionals will be part of community boards filled with community representatives who have real financial, managerial and medical experience. The coalition will give a kick start to the future of infrastructure by declaring the coalition government's priorities publicly within 12 months of taking office and, in consultation with the states, announcing construction timetables. We will have the Productivity Commission examine possible means to get more private funding into high-priority infrastructure projects. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10:23 to10:35 Commission examine possible means to get more private funding into high-priority infrastructure projects and a coalition government will task Infrastructure Australia with preparing a rolling 15-year national infrastructure plan with designated priorities based on a publicised cost-benefit analysis. We believe in a stronger economy built on an efficient government, not on waste and mismanagement. This is why a coalition government would establish a once-in-a-generation commission of audit of all government-all arms of agencies of government-to ensure that there is no waste and no mismanagement, to ensure that taxpayers are getting the best value for their hard earned dollars. A coalition government would waste no time in getting started on the job ahead. On day one, we would order the carbon tax repealed. Within a month, the commission of audit would be making government more efficient. Within three months, the parliament would be dealing with the carbon tax, the mining tax and border protection legislation. It will take a coalition government, a government from this side of the chamber, with a proven track record on balancing budgets, to implement these programs. We on this side of the House will not simply wait around for this bad government to pass. Already the coalition has begun work. In fact, the coalition's deregulation task force has already started work to meet its goal of identifying $1 billion worth of red tape that can be cut per annum. We will restore hope and reward. Australians need hope. They need hope when they open their mail to find that their electricity costs have gone up again. They have gone up 66 per cent since Labor took office. They need hope when they see their gas prices have gone up 39 per cent and that their education and health costs have gone up 25 per cent since Labor took office. Seventy years ago yesterday, the forefather of this side of the House, Sir Robert Menzies, spoke of the forgotten people. I believe the people of Australia have once again been forgotten by a Labor government, and they have no hope that this Labor government is fighting for them. It is little wonder that Australians feel this way. Under this Labor government they have been hit with 26 new and increased taxes. The costs of living are increasing for everyday Australians. Home ownership is less affordable. Interest rates have been going up and wages have declined. Real household wealth has declined, net job availability has declined and productivity has stagnated. This does not paint a good picture for the future of Australia. Despite its 26 new grabs at families' back pockets, this Labor government has delivered the four biggest budget deficits in Australian history, with a $44 billion deficit this year alone. This is a government that has turned a $20 billion surplus into $174 billion of accumulated deficits. It has turned $70 billion of net assets into what is climbing to a record $144.9 billion of net debt. It has managed to tally up daily interest bills of $22 million. And now it wants to increase Australia's debt ceiling to $300 billion, almost four times higher than it was in 2008. This government wants to increase the limit on Australia's credit card so that it can continue to rack up an interest bill and a debt burden that will be carried across generations of Australians to come. Now we are looking down the barrel of the world's biggest carbon tax. On1 July this year the carbon tax will push up prices, including the costs of everyday essentials-electricity, groceries, and health care-for all Australian families. This great big new tax will push up electricity prices by 10 per cent immediately. How many Australian jobs will suffer because of this great big new tax? How many businesses will feel the pain as their overheads increase and their ability to employ, prosper and create wealth is once again diminished by this incompetent Labor government? There is a better way. We need a government that will scrap unnecessary taxes, cut wasteful spending and reduce the tax burden on business. We need a government that is guided by the belief that governments do not have any money of their own; they only have the people's money held in trust. We need a government that is prepared to restore hope, reward and opportunity. We need a government that understands that a hand up is better than a handout. We need a government that understands that opportunity is always better than subsidy. We need a government that understands that all Australians should have freedom of choice. We need a government that rewards hard work instead of penalising it. These are the fundamental principles that will always guide us as Liberals. They are the principles that the Labor Party will never understand. While we will always believe that Australians know how to spend their money better than anyone else, the Labor Party believes that the government knows better than the people. It will always be driven by a desire to spend more and more of Australian's hard earned tax dollars. Let us look at Labor's record. We have seen constant examples of waste and mismanagement from a government that refuses to rein in its spending on poorly planned and executed programs. Over the past four years we have seen a program giving away set-top boxes at $700 each-something that could have been purchased and installed commercially for less than half the price-we have seen $1 billion spent on installing pink batts in homes and another $1 billion to pull them out again, and we have seen the blatant disregard for taxpayers' money that was the school hall rip-offs. Now we are seeing broken promises from the Labor government. We have seen in this cook-the-books budget broken promises on foreign aid spending, broken promises on company tax cuts, broken promises on Defence Force funding and of course the biggest broken promise of them all: the carbon tax. Australians deserve better. The debt that this Labor government has accrued in just a few short years has a generation of Australians destined to spend their entire working lives repaying it. This Labor government has left my generation to carry the burden of its reckless decisions. We will carry that burden for the course of our working lives. It is clear that this Labor government has forgotten the people of Australia and what they want. The locals in my community have a fair expectation that their government should take the pressure off in budgets, that their government should facilitate a prosperous economy that has increasing job opportunities, that their government should live within its means as they have to-not on the credit card-and that their government should value their money and deliver better services and infrastructure. Australians want a government that can deliver an economic strategy that builds a stronger Australia, with a broad based economy that reduces cost-of-living pressures and creates secure jobs. A coalition government will do just this. A coalition government will value the hard earned dollars of the Australian people. Our country will face challenges in the future. My generation will carry the debt burden of Labor. My generation will see the challenges of an ageing population, where we will inevitably have a greater burden on government drawing from a smaller tax base. We will face the challenge of a post-mining-boom economy. As a nation we must meet these challenges from a position of strength. We must take advantage of the opportunities we have now. To meet these challenges we need to grow the productive capacity of the economy; we need to see more Australians earning higher real wages. It is here that we see the fundamental philosophical divide in our nation. While Labor still believes that it can tax a nation into prosperity, we Liberals know the exact opposite to be true. As the great forefather of the Liberal tradition in this country, Sir Robert Menzies, said, 'We are a tax reduction party'. Menzies understood, as the coalition does today, that 'tax reductions would be the best of all incentives to increase effort, earnings and production.' As I said in my first speech in this place, it is the Liberal side of politics that is the side of opportunity. We are the party based on encouragement rather than subsidy and on a hand up rather than a handout. It is because of these philosophical beliefs that we will always fight for lower taxes, smaller and more efficient government and the individual's right to choose. (Time expired) opposition, aided and abetted by the right-wing media and commentariat, have pursued an agenda of maliciously discrediting Labor's economic management. At times the nature and scale of the misinformation coming from the other side has been such as to make any independent observer wonder if they are actually talking about the same economy as the rest of us. Today, as we debate the current Treasurer's fifth budget, I want to take some time to set the record straight about the federal Labor Party's economic record. First let's look at some longer term trends. Since 1984 Australians have benefited from economic performance that has been better than that of most other major countries in the world. Using one very basic measure, according to the OECD, our gross domestic product increased 133 per cent between 1984 and 2011, compared to an average increase for the seven largest OECD economies of just 78 per cent. In 1983-84, again according to the OECD figures, our unemployment rate was 9.6 per cent, compared to an average for the seven major OECD countries of 7.3 per cent. By 2010-11, our rate had dropped substantially to 5.1 per cent, below the seven-country OECD average of 7.9 per cent. These are just a couple of indicators of an impressive economic performance over the past 28 years. Of course, for 17 of those 28 years Labor treasurers were custodians of our economy. During that time, two of those treasurers were independently recognised as the world's best, winning Euromoney magazine's prestigious Treasurer of the Year Award-Paul Keating in 1984 and the current Treasurer, the member for Lilley, in 2011. Those opposite like to designate the former member for Higgins as the greatest Treasurer this country has ever had. The trouble is that is only their opinion. It is clearly not one shared by Euromoney, which never saw fit to bestow its Treasurer of the Year Award on Mr Costello. As I have said,",186,Bills
246,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (10:44,"For the entire time we have been in government, thetwo Labor treasurers have been the recipients of this highly respected award, but no Liberal or coalition Treasurer has ever warranted this recognition by one of the world's leading financial journals. Those opposite also like to anoint Mr Costello as the longest-serving Treasurer in Australian history, but we all know longevity of service is not necessarily a measure of competence or ability. After all, Colonel Gaddafi was the longest serving Libyan head of state, Hosni Mubarak was the longest serving Egyptian head of state in 150 years and Robert Mugabe is the longest serving president of Zimbabwe and still in office. Mr Neville: They were all bad, though. Hinkler-not least the current member for Bendigo! But I digress from my main point, which is that the only two Australian treasurers who have been independently recognised for their achievements in managing this nation's economy are from the Labor Party. I turn now to some more recent comparisons. Despite all the claims from the opposition, real interest rates have been lower under Labor since 2007 than they were under the coalition. According to the analysis of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and figures from the Parliamentary Library, real housing interest rates averaged 4.6 per cent during the term of the Howard government, compared to 4.2 per cent since 2007 under Labor. Big business is paying less under Labor as well. The real interest rate for large business loans has fallen from 4.6 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The number of people unemployed increased during the 11 years of the former Howard government by an average of 6.3 per cent a year, but it has fallen by five per cent a year since Labor came to office in 2007. Within those figures, the increase in the number of long-term unemployed fell from 25.1 per cent a year to 17.3 per cent. Under Labor, the increase in the notoriously difficult categories of young and mature age unemployed has seen a modest but welcome slowing down. Teenage unemployment under the Howard government increased at an average of 22.8 per cent, and this has fallen to 21.6 per cent under Labor, while the increase in mature age unemployed has slowed from 4.1 per cent to 3.1 per cent. To be fair for a moment, there is no doubt that Australia's economy did improve in the latter years of the Howard government-indeed, dare I say it, while Mr Costello was Treasurer. But it is hard not to preside over a flourishing economy when you are riding on the back of a commodities boom. There is no escaping the fact that it was Paul Keating's stewardship of the economy that laid the foundation for the relatively good economic conditions Australia experienced under the latter half of the former Howard government. Speaking of commodities, what did the country's longest serving Treasurer do with the proceeds of the previous resources boom? He squandered them-he squandered them away on tax cuts and handouts that were so big that the International Monetary Fund warned him that his last budgets were fuelling inflation and the Reserve Bank of Australia had to raise interest rates 10 times to try to contain the damage. According to respected Australian economist Saul Eslake, the last four Costello budgets were a lost opportunity in nation building. Mr Eslake told the ABC in 2008: It also would have been possible to set funds aside for future tax reform, for rebuilding the nation's water supply, dealing with the Murray-Darling Basin problems, dealing with climate change and the like, as well as for spending on infrastructure and education and hospitals.",193,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
247,Mr Gibbons,"Yes. But of course there are exceptions, I remind the member forMr Costello likes to take personal credit for establishing Australia's Future Fund. We must of course acknowledge his hand in this, but the purpose of that fund has nothing to do with nation building. It is specifically earmarked to pay for the unfunded superannuation of federal civil servants that will become due in coming years. In fact there is an argument that the money to meet these superannuation liabilities should not be in the Future Fund at all but should have been invested through the various Australian government superannuation schemes that have the liabilities. Nonetheless Mr Costello did set up the Future Fund structured in 2006, but it took a Labor government and a Labor Treasurer to set aside money for future nation building. In 2008, in the midst of the developing global financial crisis, Labor Treasurer Wayne Swan established three funds which are now under the stewardship of the Future Fund: the Building Australia Fund to improve and develop major infrastructure such as roads, rail, ports and broadband; the Health and Hospitals Fund to provide increasing spending on hospitals, medical equipment and other health facilities; and the Education Investment Fund to provide capital investment in higher education and vocational education and training. At the end of March this year the values of these funds were $6.7 billion for the Building Australia Fund, $3.9 billion for the Health and Hospitals Fund and $4.6 billion for the Education Investment Fund. These funds represent a substantial allocation of current government income to investment in this country's future and its future infrastructure and it was a Labor government that followed the advice of economists like Saul Eslake in funding these nation building initiatives. When the worse economic crisis in more than 80 years hit in 2008, it was a Labor government that took early and decisive action to mitigate its worse effects. It was the unwillingness of governments to take effective action that contributed to the severity of the global recession in the 1930s, but the investment spending by Labor from 2008 stimulated economic activity and kept firms in business and people in jobs. The results are clear to see. We have the lowest debt and deficit of all major advanced economies; we have the lowest unemployment rate of all major advanced economies; we are the only major advanced economy to avoid a recession. Labor's response to the crisis was endorsed by international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and countless economic experts such as Nobel prize winning Professor Joseph Stiglitz. He told ABC's 7.30 Report : ... what your government did was exactly right. So Australia had the shortest and shallowest of the downturns of the advanced industrial countries. The opposition-aided and abetted by a partisan right-wing media-are still desperately trying to make out that Australia has a runaway debt problem. How much you can borrow responsibly can depend on how much you earn and your ability to pay the interest and repay the loan-just like when you take out a mortgage to buy your own home. Australia has borrowed a very small amount compared to its annual income and compared to major economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom-who are borrowing 60 to 70 per cent of their annual income-and Japan, who is borrowing even more. If there was any concern about Australia's level of debt, our credit rating would have been downgraded like that of Greece, France and other European countries. This has not happened and Australia is still a AAA-rated credit risk. After this year's budget statement all three major rating agencies reconfirmed our AAA status with a stable outlook for the future. We are now one of just eight countries in the world with such a rating. I would remind the House that the opposition voted against Labor's stimulus package and against virtually every other piece of economic legislation in the past five years. Let us recall some of the forecasts from the opposition's leadership team. In February 2009, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I think what we're going to get is massive debt and a deep recession.' In April 2009, the member for Goldstein said, 'The recession will be deeper and longer because of the misguided spending.' And Senator Joyce's prediction in March 2009, 'We're heading towards a recession,' was about as accurate as former IBM chairman Tom Watson's forecast: I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. There can be no doubt that, if the opposition had been in charge of Australia's economy over the past five years, we would have been in a downward spiral of lower incomes, lost jobs and reduced services. This year's budget will ensure Australia retains its status as one of the world's strongest economies; it embodies everything that I and many of my colleagues on this side of the House entered politics for. It will spread the benefits of the current resources boom by delivering much-needed new financial relief to families and businesses under pressure. It will return to a surplus, as promised, to provide a buffer in the face of uncertain global conditions, and it will give the Reserve Bank room to cut interest rates further if it needs to. It will protect lowand middle-income Australians and our community's most vulnerable with reforms like the historic first steps towards the National Disability Insurance Scheme, aged-care reform and a blitz on dental waiting lists. It delivers a surplus through targeted and responsible savings, while still protecting the front-line services Australians rely on, as well as helping less well off families with cost-of-living pressures. The budget will deliver much-needed cost-of-living relief to thousands of central Victorian households in my electorate of Bendigo. For many of my constituents-as in other areas of the country-electricity, rent, mortgages and the cost of groceries and petrol are putting serious pressure on household budgets. Among those to benefit are 12,000 local families who will receive an increase of up to $600 in family tax benefit part A payments from 1 July 2013. More than 10,000 families in central Victoria are expected to share automatically in a total of $10.6 million of assistance through the new schoolkids bonus payments, without the need to keep receipts and submit claims. And about 11,000 local young people, single parents and the unemployed who currently receive allowances to meet the costs of essential services like electricity, gas and water will receive a new supplementary allowance of $210 for singles and $350 for couples. In addition, from 2012-13, there will be tax cuts for all taxpayers earning up to $80,000, including a tripling of the tax-free threshold and increases in the pension. These new measures are good for families, for students and for low-income Australians because they will help them make ends meet and get ahead in their lives. They are good for the central Victorian economy because people will have more to spend on local retail, manufacturing and other businesses that risk being left behind because of the high dollar. In summary, this is yet another responsible budget from a first-class Labor Treasurer, and it follows the heritage of world-class, responsible economic management that the Labor Party has delivered to this country over the past three decades. I commend it to the House. his budget speech by saying that, over the next four years, Australia would enjoy surpluses and that they were: … a powerful endorsement of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies. I think that is a sweeping assertion that is unlikely to be fulfilled this year, much less in the following three years. Why do I say this? Because of the appalling performance of the government since it came to office. There is no certainty that any of its targets will be met. Just look at the deficits for the last four years alone. The blowout of this year's deficit from $23 billion to $44 billion means more borrowing and more debt for future generations to repay. All of this is despite the fact that in real terms the government is experiencing the fastest growth in revenue since the mid-eighties. It is not as though it is being constrained on the income earned. This is the fourth Labor deficit in four years, and those four deficits together now total $174 billion. As I said, this 2011-12 budget deficit has blown out in three stages-from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion to $44 billion-and the end of the year has not yet come. It may even go further. It simply proves the inability of the government to reach even modest targets. Why should we then believe that it is capable of delivering a $1.5 billion surplus next year? Worse than that, the surplus that is promised is contrived. It is a fudge. In fact, the overall 2012 budget is $26 billion worse off in cumulative terms than last year's budget. So, against this incredibly poor performance, we are asked to believe that everything is sweetness and light and we will come out into the Elysian fields of a surplus in 2012-13. Even if this surplus is legitimate, it is going to make precious little by way of a dent in the government's debt, which will reach $145 billion in 2013-14. In comparative terms that is as bad as the Keating debt of $96 billion which he left the Howard government. This government will probably leave an Abbott government somewhere in the order of $140 billion to $150 billion in debt. It took the Howard government eight years to pay it off. I imagine that $145 billion would take even longer. People reading or listening to this speech may say, 'How does that affect me?' It means that the government has to borrow to support this debt and that means it is spending $8 billion a year, or around $22 million a day in interest payments alone. Think what that $8 billion could do for hospitals, or the disabled, or improvements to our national highways, or pensioners on the breadline-and we have plenty of those at present. People tell me they are down to one meal a day. That really makes me angry. All these areas are constrained because of poor management and the profligate spending of the government. After all that, the so-called surplus still remains a mirage. I will explain a few examples of that. This financial year we will spend $6.2 billion on roads but next year, when you would think there would be at least the same sort of demand if not slightly more, we are only going to spend $2.6 billion. Obviously, the figures have been moved from one year into the other. Why would you not be spending around $4½ billion per year? Put yourself in the situation of a main roads planner or engineer, someone who works for the RTA or the main roads departments in the states. How do you think they plan with $6.2 billion in one year and $2.6 billion the next year and so on? It would be like being on a roller-coaster. Little wonder we have this stop-start mentality on roads like the Pacific Highway and the Bruce Highway.",194,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
248,Mr Neville (Hinkler,"The Nationals Deputy Whip) (10:58): The Treasurer's openedThere are other examples of this. With local government payments, $1.1 billion is being brought forward to this year and that will mean a lesser deficit, or this wafer-thin surplus that the government is planning for next year Queensland will also receive $1.4 billion in disaster relief this year. There will be allocations of $1.8 billion for infrastructure and $1.4 billion for compensation for pensioners and welfare beneficiaries as an offset for the carbon tax. Another example of doctoring the budget is in the coal sector. Payments will go from $220 million this year right down to $10 million next year and back up again to $250 million the next year. That is so blatant that it is farcical. It is obvious the government has resorted to these accountancy tricks and money shuffles to manufacture the appearance of a wafer-thin surplus of $1.5 billion for 2012-13. If the government really believed it could deliver a surplus, why is it moving to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion? That is four times the level of 2008, which was not that long ago. If the government genuinely expected a series of surpluses, why in heaven's name would that be necessary? In fact, it has buried this proposal in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013 to avoid any proper scrutiny and a specific vote on the debt limit. When the Treasurer was challenged about this, his glib throwaway line was, 'It's no big deal.' We are borrowing $50 billion and lifting our limit to $300 billion and it is no big deal. I think that is emblematic of the attitude of the government to financial control. It would seem that the government is embarrassed about its debt levels. It does not seem to care how much worse they get-so much so that the Treasurer did not even mention his plan to raise the debt limit in his budget speech. Why wouldn't you mention it? There was not even a mention. And so it was with the carbon tax, the tax that dares not speak its name, the tax that every one of the government's senior ministers assiduously avoids, a tax that is barely five weeks away. To soften the impact, we have had this cash splash, which many members on the other side have spoken about as if it was some great act of generosity to pensioners and low-income earners. It is not. It is an offset and it is a one-year offset, but those electricity bills, gas bills, transport bills and all the other things will be there to haunt them in subsequent years. Let me move to small business, because this is an incredibly important sector in my electorate of Hinkler. I know the government's negative attitude resonates strongly in my small businesses, amongst shopkeepers and in tourist attractions in Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Bargara. Shop closures are a testament to the fact that there is a weakness in the availability of the disposable dollar. When people will not go out for dinner or will not go out to coffee lounges, you know there is something seriously wrong in the community. It is also reflected in the fall in tourism. Some motels tell me these are the worse periods since the economic downturn, the GFC. In their worse years they have had occupancies as low as 30 per cent. So a lot of tourists have either shortened their holidays or deferred them. In a place like Hervey Bay or Bargara, that is the bread and butter of the community. The Prime Minister herself said on 14 March: If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs. Yet, two months after that statement, she reneged on the promise to drop one per cent off the company tax rate and saved herself a notional $4.8 billion. I would have liked to see some of that $4.8 billion in my electorate, to help businesses and to get industry to a vibrant level again. We should also recognise that, while there will be some compensation for pensioners and low-income earners, there will be no carbon tax concessions for small businesses, who are already seeing the effects of the carbon tax in their electricity, gas and transport costs. The councils in my area are deeply disturbed by the drop in business and the lack of opportunities for new business. This budget gives them very little hope. I was pleased to see one thing in today's media. The Cassowary Coast, which was going to be charged a carbon tax offset of $1 billion for cleaning up the rubbish in its local tip, will now have a 12-month period of concession, a window of opportunity, in which to do that. But, at the end of that time, councils who have rubbish tips that give rise to emissions will be penalised on an ongoing basis. In the minutes that remain for me to speak, I would like to talk about the Bruce Highway. Nothing could have more starkly demonstrated its vulnerability than the floods last year. It was cut off many times, in four, five, six or seven places. You cannot have that in the main artery from Brisbane to North Queensland and, in particular, the areas that have not been receiving attention, from Cooroy to Cairns. This lifeline connecting all the major provincial cities in the most decentralised state in the Commonwealth is a ramshackle roadway. Quite apart from the bodgie spending on roads in the current financial year and the next financial year-as I pointed out before, there is only $2.6 billion going into next year's funding-there is no new money going into the Bruce Highway in this budget. There is no new money. The neglect is there for all to see. When the state's Traveston dam was on the agenda, section B of the highway, from Cooroy to Curra, went ahead at a frenetic pace. But, when the dam was aborted, the whole thing slowed down. I want to see that picked up again. I want to see the road to Gympie completed, I want to see the Gympie bypass completed and then I want to see the road upgraded from Gympie all the way through to Apple Tree Creek near Childers. This is very important not just for the people who live in that area, not just for safety and not just for tourism but simply for commercial facilitation. No, this was not a good budget. No-one should be taking pride in it. (Time expired) Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer on the budget he delivered in the House two weeks ago. This budget is astoundingly good on so many levels and will help not only the nation but also communities like the ones I represent out in Western Sydney. Despite economic conditions that have seen government revenues fall by $150 billion, the Treasurer was able to put together a budget that delivered a surplus on time, as promised. Although the Treasurer faced an imperative to find savings in the budget, he managed to achieve this while continuing to share the benefits of Australia's mining boom. While there will be those who will paint a picture of the economic landscape as being worse than it actually is, draped in doom and gloom-arguing this mainly because of their political priorities rather than based on what the nation needs-the economic reality is somewhat different. The greatest economic challenge Australia is facing comes from the relative strength of the Australian dollar fuelled by the growth of the resources sector. The dollar's strength in recent times has dampened Australia's export earnings, increased the cost-of-living pressures and also made it difficult for",197,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
249,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (11:13): I would like to congratulate themanufacturing. Labor understands the pressure many families are facing and that is why it is important we delivered a budget that was both responsible and supportive. Returning the budget to surplus provides a buffer in uncertain global economic times and gives the Reserve Bank room to cut interest rates, a theme or an issue that I would like to come back to later in this contribution. It is worth bearing in mind that interest rates now are lower than at any time under the previous government and that a family on a $300,000 mortgage is paying around $3,000 a year less in repayments. Commenting on the merits of achieving a surplus, the International Monetary Fund said: In the case of Australia, we welcome the authorities’ commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2012-13 to rebuild fiscal buffers, putting Commonwealth government finances in a stronger position to deal with shocks and long-term pressures from an ageing population and rising health-care costs. With little evidence of inflationary pressure, the RBA cut its policy rate by 50 basis points last week to support demand. That was the IMF. While we are delivering a surplus through targeted and responsible savings, we are protecting the frontline services Australians rely on as well as helping families with cost-ofliving pressures. The budget ensures that the benefits to our strong economy of the mining boom are shared with all Australians to help them meet these cost-of-living pressures. I endorse the measures announced by the Treasurer in the budget aimed at helping families, understanding full well the relief it will provide to them. There are a great number of measures in the budget that will provide real assistance to families living in the Chifley electorate. Fifteen thousand, one hundred and fifty local families in Chifley are expected to receive a total of $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. The schoolkids bonus that has been announced as part of the budget will replace the education tax refund from 1 January 2013 and will be paid to families of about 26,650 local kids in school. Under the existing system, 2,450 families in Chifley have not been claiming what they are entitled to, mainly because they could not afford the upfront costs involved in educating their children or, in some cases, they have not had access to accountants who can help them with this type of refund. Under this new system, there is no need to keep receipts for vital education resources; it will be paid automatically into the bank accounts of eligible families. In my electorate I know that this money will be used where it is most needed. Representing one of the lowest SES electorates in the country, I was quite frankly offended at suggestions that families would waste this money on plasma TVs. It is an offensive suggestion that families that want the money to be able to help their children with their school costs would be frittering this money away, and I find it hard to believe that the Leader of the Opposition could really be so out of touch in making those statements. I can certainly tell him that there are many families, not only in the electorate that I am proud to represent but right around Australia, who are holding out for this payment. Changes to the family tax benefit part A, which will flow from 1 July next year, will provide families with much-needed relief, with more than 19,000 families in Chifley receiving up to a $600 increase in their family tax benefit payments. The cost pressures that affect most families in Chifley are the rising utility prices and, for those most vulnerable-the unemployed, students, parents on income support with young children-those pressures are hard to absorb. In Chifley, we are delivering vital assistance through this federal government to help with the cost of living and this will be provided to 17,240 local young people, single parents and the unemployed who are currently receiving allowances, and we will be doing this by providing cash payments to help them meet the cost of their essential services like electricity, gas and water. Singles will receive a supplementary allowance of $210 and couples will receive $350, with the first payment commencing March 2013. Chifley has a large number of vulnerable families and there are large numbers of children whose parents have never completed school. UnitingCare Burnside runs a tremendous program in Bidwell known as HIPPY, which stands for the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. I have had a chance to visit that program and I have seen with my own eyes the great benefits that this program provides. This two-year program helps parents and carers take an active role in their children's education and provides access to a tutor and practical learning activities and materials. In order that this program be expanded to assist additional families in need, the government committed a further $55.7 million to ensure that Australia's most vulnerable children are better prepared to start school. I was also delighted to see the government commit its share of funding to build a National Disability Insurance Scheme. I advocated for this scheme over the past two years and I applaud the Gillard government's investment of $1 billion over the next four years. From the middle of next year selected launch sites around the country will begin serving people with a disability, expected to number 20,000 by 2014. This is a significant social reform delivered by a Labor government in the same tradition as Medicare and paid parental leave. In my electorate of Chifley, groups like the Endeavour Foundation, which I have had the pleasure of visiting, have welcomed this NDIS initiative and they, along with a number of other groups, have been vocal champions of the NDIS. I thank Kathy Breen and Ed Mason from the Endeavour Foundation for their passionate advocacy in our local area for this initiative. Many families in Chifley will also welcome the $500 million boost to dental health. This will deliver a blitz to reduce public waiting lists where people are waiting for dental health care assistance. It will also tackle workforce shortages in dental health. I am disappointed, however, that more credit has not been given to the crucial reform the government has announced for aged care. A new $3.7 billion funding commitment towards aged-care reform will see more in-home care and support so that people can live independently longer and will not be forced to sell the family home to pay a bond. Again, when I speak about this with many residents in my electorate of Chifley, they welcome it. Most people, rightly, share a concern and a desire to see that their parents, as they age, have quality, accessible care for the years ahead. With an ageing population expected to increase enormously in the coming years and life expectancy continuing to increase, the existing agedcare system would not be able to cope with the demand. That is why it is important that we develop new support services to allow people to live at home for longer. While this budget has been unapologetically family focused, we have not forgotten that small business is feeling the pressure of a patchwork economy. The Treasurer announced a measure to allow companies to carry back tax losses by providing a tax benefit of up to $300,000 per year. Businesses are currently able to carry forward their tax losses to offset future profits and reduce future tax liabilities. About 110,000 small businesses across the country will be able to benefit from this and they will be able to carry back their losses, offset past profits and get a refund of tax previously paid on those profits. From1 July 2012 the 10,000 or so small businesses in Chifley can expect additional benefits. For example, the government will deliver tax breaks for small business such as an increase in the instant asset write-off threshold to $6,500. For those businesses seeking to purchase new vehicles-for example, tradies wanting to purchase a new ute-they will be able to write-off $5,000 from that purchase. Again, 10,000 businesses in Chifley will take advantage of these measures. Not only is this budget, as I have indicated before, family friendly but it is business friendly. The measures I referred to a few moments ago are quite obvious. The economic climate we are promoting has higher growth and is beating most advanced economies, with inflation contained and unemployment down to 4.9 per cent. By way of contrast I put this to the chamber: imagine the type of political discourse in this country if we were to be experiencing an unemployment rate equalling that of Spain right now-20 per cent unemployment compared to 4.9 per cent in Australia. Our unemployment rate is phenomenal. The economic conditions we have provided are tremendous. On top of that the assistance that I have mentioned earlier in this speech that is being provided to families provides a further important platform for economic growth and is of potential benefit to the retail sector. It is worth bearing in mind that, when the GFC hit, when the financial system froze, when mistrust and risk aversion began to choke our economy, this government provided vital economic stimulus through fiscal policy. With conditions exceptionally better, now is the time to pare back that spending. That is what this budget does. With the economy strong, especially relative to the subdued conditions affecting other economies, the time is now right for further investment and development-and it is right that we focus on monetary policy and what it can do to drive further growth. When we focus on monetary policy, we naturally need to focus on the actions of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I often have businesses, small and large, smaller businesses and major corporates, tell me that they are wanting to invest and that they are ready to invest but that finance is hard to come by and they believe interest rates are way higher than they should be. I have raised this previously and I say it again: my view is that the RBA effectively has a sleeper hold on the economy. They are moving too slowly on the issue of interest rates. They should be moving to reduce rates. Businesses of all sizes are saying that this is the right thing to do. This week I wrote in the Daily Telegraph that I thought it important the Reserve Bank recognises this demand. Given that our economy is strong relative to many parts of the world, this is, as I have said, the time for us to provide that interest rate cut for businesses, particularly those on the eastern seaboard of Australia, to enable them to take advantage of economic opportunities now. WhatI am most worried about is that the RBA will be slow on this issue of interest rates and only move when it is absolutely forced to. Inflation is contained, as I have said. The IMF recognises that as well. Why the Reserve Bank walks with clay feet on this issue astounds many, particularly in business. Cutting interest rates would provide a shot in the arm for confidence, it would provide a platform for investment and it would help the economy drive further growth. Why we would be holding back further cuts is a source of bewilderment for many. There have been calls for the Reserve Bank to broaden and balance out its view-rather than just having an absolute driving focus on inflation, it should look at employment too. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11:27 to 11:39 particularly when you compare what is happening overseas-Canada: interest rate one per cent; the UK and US: half and 0.25 per cent respectively. We certainly have the opportunity with our cash rate at 3.75 per cent to move below that and be able to provide the impetus and the confidence for business to invest further. We know we have $450 billion in the investment pipeline but, again, it is about both sides of our continent being able to flex their industrial muscle, for the benefit of the nation. This budget does ensure we go to surplus, does pare back fiscal policy at a time when the conditions warrant it and does provide support for business and for families. We will now ensure our focus on monetary policy remains there and, given that those other economic conditions are ripe, time is ripe too for further cuts in those rates to benefit business and drive further economic growth. I commend this budget to the House and certainly commend it to the residents and businesses of the Chifley electorate I am proud to represent. speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and associated bills. Governments are best judged by the relationship they build with the people they represent. Good governments are those that have earned the trust of the electorate. Good governments are those that do what they say. Good governments are those that put the interests of the nation ahead of politics of the day. On every available test, this government fails. This government has lost the trust of the Australian people. This government is pathologically incapable of implementing what it promises-and even when it tries it gets things wrong. If there is a choice between principle and short-term political advantage, this government will pick political expediency and spin every time. There is no better example of this government's failings than the budget that is before us today. Make no mistake, this is one of the worse budgets this nation has ever seen. Driven by cheap politics, this budget has been drafted like an advertising campaign for a discount warehouse. Forget the economics but find the 10-second grab. Forget the interests of the nation but find a simplistic plausible message-right or wrong. Lo and behold, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister have come up with 'a surplus'. Sounds good. The focus groups will like it. But they made it happen by creative accounting: bring forward handouts here; defer a submariner defence project there-and throw in some free steak knives for good measure. No messy principles to get in the way of this budget. Just focus groups and spin. This government has all the direction of a runaway train and all the integrity of a former HSU official. It would be entertaining from our side of Australia's political debate if not for the simple fact that it is our country we are talking about. I echo the words of the member for Goldstein: this federal budget has sunk like a stone with the people of Australia. For the people of Australia and the constituents of Ryan, this budget is one of cooked books, broken promises and direct attacks on the fiscal bottom line of all Australians. They are not bothering to",199,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity

251,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (11:40,"It gives me great pleasure to take this opportunity toinvestigate the details of this unbelievable budget because they do not want to know the extent to which this budget will impact upon them. Australians have disengaged with this budget because this Gillard Labor government stopped engaging with them many years ago. They stopped listening to Australians, and with the formation of the minority government in 2010 they stopped listening even to themselves. When the Prime Minister said: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' Australians took her words at face value. Unfortunately from 1 July 2012 Australians will be lumped with the world's biggest carbon tax, the world's only economy-wide carbon tax and a deceit of the highest magnitude. Apart from the many calls my office has received from constituents expressing their hopes of a replication of the Queensland election result at a federal level, my office has received only one call-one call-from someone inquiring about the actual details of a budget proposal announced on 8 May. The main issue with these appropriation bills is that the facts, figures and forecasts announced by the Treasurer are inexact. The current Gillard-Swan government has predicted a manufactured surplus out of thin air. As many members on this side of the House have noted, they have completely cooked the books and have created what many commentators have called the fudge-it budget. I ask the government: why is the true cost of what you plan not revealed in the budget estimates? Why has the government not truly accounted for the $50 billion-plus cost of the National Broadband Network? Why has the government not truly accounted for the $10 billion they plan to spend on the Clean Energy Fund? Where is the funding for the many billions of dollars they plan to spend on new submarines? Why, instead of truly cracking down on spending, have they merely deferred spending into the forward estimates, which will in turn increase the cost of these projects? The only way the Treasurer has been able to claim a budget surplus for next year is by omitting the accurate operational costs of the NBN and by bringing forward two programs into the 2011-12 year-the 'back to school' payments and Commonwealth grants to local government-which would cancel the Treasurer's $1.5 billion surplus completely. Similarly, if as Mr Swan claims this is to be his first budget surplus of many-a laughable claim-why did the Gillard government announce that it will increase Australia's debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion, a debt ceiling four times higher than it was in 2008, only four years ago? The government's estimated deficit for 2011-12 from 18 months ago has blown out from $12 billion to $44 billion-and, somehow, they expect Australians to believe that a government spending $100 billion more per year than it was four years ago, a government borrowing more than $100 million per day and a government that has accrued the highest ever net debt of $145 billion will magically achieve a forecast surplus for the 2012-13 year. These are the questions that must be answered openly and honestly by the Treasurer so that Australian families can be confident of the stability of the Australian economy and how it will affect their future. Australian families can rely on strong economic management from the coalition, unlike the bribes and deceitful creative accounting that we get from the Treasurer. Fundamentally, it is the individual that must make his own way while knowing that he is supported by the rest of his community and, indeed, supported by his government. This is why we have important safety nets to support those in need, from Medicare to free state education, and that is why we believe in vocational and tertiary education to support the long term Australian economy. The Labor Party try to claim that they are the friends and defenders of workers. They may claim that, but what they cannot claim is that they are the friends and defenders of the aspirational class. They do not support those Australians who dream of bigger and better things, of working hard at their job, of being successful and of one day achieving their dreams for themselves and their families. The coalition believes in a hand up, not a hand out. May I remind the Labor Party that it is the aspirational 'class' of Australians who are being attacked in this budget. If you are successful in the mining industry, you are slugged with a tax. If you are fortunate enough to be able to save the taxpayer money by taking out private health insurance, they are taking away your rebate. And, if you suffer from a disability, the government does not have the resolve or the empathy to support you. The Productivity Commission recommended that, over the forward estimates, the federal government should commit $4 billion to the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Instead, they have only allocated $1 billion, and they have not indicated where the bulk of those funds will come from. The coalition is a big supporter of the NDIS and we, like all Australians, understand that if you refuse to properly fund your promises it is as good as breaking your word. Sounds familiar! Every member of this House recognises that Australia has an ageing population and that we must devise an appropriate policy that deals with the consequences of such an ageing population. Australians will require more and more funds to ensure that they will have a comfortable retirement. Let me remind this government: Australians do not retire at 50; they do not stop planning for their retirement at 50. Yet this budget has no relief for seniors over 50 who do want to do the right thing and plan for their ultimate retirement. In particular, it will now be more difficult for self-funded retirees because this Labor government is reducing the higher tax concession for contributions of high-income earners and deferring higher concessional contributions caps for the over-50s with less than $500,000 in superannuation. Therefore, the cap for concession contributions will be $25,000 and there will be no relief given for seniors over 50. The Treasurer has been very quiet about the other ways this budget neglects older Australians. Not only does this budget penalise Australians who are in fact planning for their retirement; it also penalises seniors who are trying to get back into the workforce. Successive governments have identified the inherent discrimination against older Australians evident in the Australian labour market, yet this Gillard government is abandoning the mature age worker tax offset. This measure previously supported mature age workers to remain in the workforce in the form of a $500 tax offset, but unfortunately it is now being phased out from 1 July 2012. The Treasurer has also broken another election promise by abandoning More Help for Mature Age Workers and is transferring $66.9 million in lip-service funding. The government have tried to focus on the $1,000 that they plan to give to employers who take on a mature-age worker over 50 years of age for just three months, but they plan to give these funds to only 10,000 businesses, meaning only 10,000 employees and only a $10 million bandaid solution to endemic problems in the labour market. On the other hand, the coalition has a policy that is truly designed to move older Australians from welfare to work. The coalition will pay $3,250 to an employer who takes on a mature-age worker who is on an existing welfare payment so long as they employ that person for more than six months. With $10 million that is supposed to be directed at employing older Australians, how do the government propose to spend the other $56.9 million? Well, $4.7 million will be used to operate the Advisory Panel on Positive Ageing so that they are able to conduct another talkfest-another discussion about legislation. Clearly this money has been allocated to talking about the problem of discrimination, not fixing the problem. The Gillard government attempts to claim by evidencing policies including the carbon tax that it is a forward-looking government and that it is worried about devising policies for the benefit of future generations of Australians. Well, there is one elephant in the room that the government is not talking about and that demonstrates why this government is failing in this regard: the lack of commitment to research funding. Last year around this time the Treasurer tried to gauge the opinion of Australians about a $400 million cut to medical research before budget time. Australia was fortunate that the Gillard government, for the first time, listened to the incensed reaction from the medical community. I spoke in the House on 21 May of the enormous benefits that even a $26 million annual increase in funding for dementia research could have for the future health of Australians. This would be a small budget item. Australians need a government that takes responsible action. We do not need more taxes and we do not deserve more empty promises and political tricks. This budget for 2012-13 is one of the most heinous political tricks that Australian families have ever seen-a budget designed to cover up gross economic mismanagement and attempt to hide the disastrous effect of the many taxes they have introduced and plan to introduce in the future. The main message from the budget is: never, ever underestimate the incompetence of the Australian Labor Party. Nobel-Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman once said: Most of the energy of political work is devoted to correcting the effects of mismanagement of government. Should the coalition be elected by Australians at the next federal election, this will certainly ring true as we try to unravel the damage that the Labor Party has inflicted on Australians. The Australian people know that the coalition will leave them in a better position. They know which party will leave families better off. When it comes to sensible economic management and market reform, the coalition has a track record of achievement-a track record built upon by the shadow Treasurer and a track record which gives hope, reward and opportunity to Australian families who have been so badly let down by this sad and tired Labor government. Many, many Australians looked to this government with hope and expectation. Many, many Australians voted for the members opposite. Yet the tragedy for those people and for all Australians is that this government has let them down so badly. I am not someone who believes that this government deliberately lied during the last election. However, I do believe, as so many Australians believe, that this government sees promises as mere words. It sees integrity as an obstacle and the national interest as subservient to its political interest. Yet it seems genuinely at a loss to understand why Australians get angry when they are treated so shabbily. So is it too much to expect honesty and integrity from the government of this nation? journalists, Lenore Taylor, commented in the Sydney Morning Herald of 12-13 May:",203,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
252,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (11:54,"One of Australia's more serious… Abbott is so confident he delivered only generalities. He said his aim was to grow the economy, which is laudable, but the only policy he advanced to do this was the abolition of the carbon tax, and his criticism that the government had no plan for growth was a little undermined by the fact that the economy is forecast to grow by 3 per cent or more for the next three years. He said he would deliver bigger surpluses, which would also be a very good thing, but it's unclear how that fits with his support for new family payments which add at least $1 billion a year to the budget bottom line, while also abolishing the mining tax. She went on to say that his only positive idea was to encourage Asian languages and all he was going to do was talk to a few people in state governments. There was no estimate of the costs and no appraisal of how we would train the number of teachers required et cetera. Similarly, the Sydney Morning Herald in its editorial commented: The other negative was the opposition's reply to the budget. Tony Abbott continued the tactic he used last year, offering not a detailed alternative program but a comprehensive rubbishing of the Prime Minister. It then demolished again his concept in regard to language. We are fortunate that there are some independent commentators beyond the rhetoric that we have heard from those opposite in regard to the Australian economy and the budget. The IMF, while speaking of a fragile and vulnerable international picture, commended this government and the manner in which the economy as a whole is progressing. We have very timely comments from the OECD. Its Economic Outlook of May 2012 comments: Australia’s economic fundamentals remain strong, with our economy expected to grow more strongly than every single major advanced economy over the next two years. This is contrasted with a 'fragile recovery in many other advanced economies'. It went on to provide a litany of statistics to evidence that. Similarly the OECD's Better Life Index ranked the 34 member countries on categories like housing, jobs, education, health, environment and work balance, and Australia's cumulative rank rises to No. 1 according to the OECD website, even advancing in front of Norway, which by any standards, because of its oil and gas, has been a leader in economic advances in recent decades. So we have the OECD and the IMF commenting, and there are some statistics out there. From the parliamentary briefing paper on the budget we note that last year's averages for this country were GDP growth of three per cent, unemployment of 5.25 per cent throughout the whole year, and inflation of 1.25 per cent. These figures cannot be produced by any other advanced economy in the world. While the Labor government has been in power, 27 million jobs have disappeared internationally. What is the reality in this country? The creation of 800,000 jobs. I note the recent index in the Sydney Morning Herald of 69,100 extra jobs since April. We note that there are 22,000 a month to 13 May. These are the realities out there. We can contrast them with other situations around the world. We can look back to when Australia's unemployment rate was 5.2 per cent-as you know, it is lower now-and at that time the rate in the United States was 8.3 per cent, the UK 8.2 per cent, Canada 7.2 per cent, Germany 5.7 per cent et cetera. Whether you look at the most extreme examples in Europe-such as Spain, with 52 per cent of its under-25 population unemployed-or at countries that are regarded as reasonably well holding the line, Australia's picture is very strong. We have had those opposite say that the mining industry should not be taxed and that there is class warfare involved. I want to briefly digress to talk about some other realities in this country. I heard the member for Brisbane saying, 'Oh, how dreadful it is. They are starting to talk about class war. This hasn't happened for so long.' Perhaps it is worth putting on the record some realities that have occurred in this country. I refer to Dissent magazine of autumn/winter 2012. It notes: Over the five years from 2005 the net real worth of the household wealth of the lowest quintile increased by 4 per cent or $1,000, the third quintile increased by 11 per cent or $44,000 and the top quintile increased by $192,000. These are statistics that can be investigated, analysed and questioned but, quite frankly, they are correct. The same article continued: For Australia, the key finding was that the richest 1 per cent of Australians doubled their share of national income from 4.8 per cent in 1980 to 8.8 per cent in 2008. Furthermore, the incomes of ""the richest 0.1 per cent rose from 1 per cent to 3 per cent [of national income] …"" At the same time, the top marginal rates of income tax, of course, dropped. That was from an OECD report. In that same article, journalist Kenneth Davidson made the point on the ABS figures about the overall situation of the Australian people, that during the course of the government household net worth was $720,000 in 2010, up 14 per cent from 2005. So we have a picture of a very successful economy overall, but within that a degree of inequity growing in this country. I strongly support measures in this budget which go towards the question of reducing the tax concession for superannuation contributions, changes to the net medical expenses tax offset et cetera. These are measures which go to equity. And similarly with regard to the mining tax, when this was first suggested there was a degree of opposition in the electorate, but those opposite know that since then there has been an explanation of what it is doing for the Australian people. I will be very surprised if Clive Palmer is endorsed as a candidate in this next election, despite all the billboards and despite all the bucks. Quite frankly, they know that one of the things they are carrying very heavily in a climate that is largely going their way is their association with the big end of town. If we talk of what has happened in this country because of the mining boom, I note that Professor Gregory at the Centre of Economic Policy Research noted that it has been so important in the growth in living standards and terms of trade in this country, and that the overall living standards of Australians as compared to the United States between 1959 and 2003 were 92 per cent and are now 215 per cent-a 25 per cent improvement in the condition of the Australian people overall. Very importantly, I have heard some references to the question of interest rates now leading to a $3,000 reduction in people's payments per year on a loan of $300,000. We can contrast that with overseas patterns. In the United States, large numbers of people are going into negative mortgages. Their properties are now worth less than the mortgages that they hold. That is the reality internationally. We had to put this budget in context with regard to what is happening around the world. The opposition would like to say, 'Oh, some of you are not as happy as you should be, despite the latest survey by the OECD'. However, one would think that this economy was not affected by the international financial crisis. One would think that nothing had happened. One would think that revenues for the government with regard to taxation take had not been severely impacted upon. They do not think it happened! They think that either it did not happen or nothing should have been done. I have more respect, quite frankly, for Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve. He thinks that there was a financial crisis in this world. He thinks that Lehman Bros actually did collapse. In an article by James Macdonald in the London Review of Books, Paul Volcker said that incidents such as this existed: By the time Goldman itself went public in 1999 its capital had swelled to more than $6 billion, almost exclusively through internal growth. Going public allowed a further exponential leap in capital and profits. But such growth could not be fuelled simply through the traditional business of investment banking: it involved taking ever greater risks with the firm's own capital. In 1970 Goldman's assets were 6.5 times its capital. By the 2000s this had risen to 30 times, and like most other investment banks, Goldman was essentially operating as a hedge fund for its own account, while simultaneously providing services for its clients. In the real world there was an international economic crisis and there was a government in this country which decided that employing people was worthwhile, that it was beneficial that people went to work each day, that people who were doing traineeships and apprenticeships could finish them, that building supply companies could survive and that people could go into shops and try to keep retail surviving. They suggest that it is the end of Western civilisation that government debt has increased. It is still exponentially below all other First World developed countries, and yet this government has in that period made sure that people were in employment. And they do not seem to think that this is in important issue, that people keep jobs. On the other side, Volcker, in the New York Review of Books of 24 November last gave an analysis of what had happened with regard to the United States and what had caused this crisis. He was well cognisant of the impact it was having on Western economies. He said: It should be clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations, market efficiencies, and the techniques of modern finance. That faith was stoked in part by the huge financial rewards that enabled the extremes of borrowing, the economic imbalances, and the pretenses and assurances of the credit-rating agencies to persist so long. A relaxed approach by regulators and legislators reflected the new financial zeitgeist. This government has persevered to ensure that there is employment and that industry can still function. I said the other night that I feel some sorrow for the shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, the member for North Sydney, because we have seen from the opposition consistent calls for a balanced budget and consistent denunciation of government spending. I have heard only three speeches by those opposite during the course of this debate. The previous contribution from the member for Ryan, Mrs Prentice, went down the same road. She was advocating increased expenditure. She complained about the disability initiatives of this governmentlegendary, the first time this has happened, despite decades of talk-and that the Productivity Commission said we should have put $4 billion into the scheme. She said it was lamentable that we were putting only $1 billion in this year. So there is another $3 billion which Mr Hockey is going to have to find. She went on to complain that dementia research was not being supported strongly enough and that older Australians were not getting enough assistance with employment. That is the kind of pattern we have from those opposite. We know that the opposition leader and his shadow Treasurer have not enunciated any measures. Besides sacking public servants, their only other initiative is to increase spending; impliedly, by putting money into Asian education. The member for Brisbane was lamenting the fact that Co.As.It, the Italian welfare organisation in Brisbane, did not get money. And last night we had a very elucidating contribution from the member for Kalgoorlie about the need to fund cane toad restrictions. We are hearing from all of them how we can spend more money, how we can make sure that taxpayers are funding these kinds of proposals-because it is really nice to pretend we are going to fund all these things-while saying that government expenditure is too low. I want to talk about HIPPY, the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. I know that my electorate is well aware of the figures, the tens of thousands of people who are assisted by other government financial measures. HIPPY is a program which tries to ensure that parents who are disconnected from the education system can help their children get used to going to school. This government is devoting $56 million to that. I met last week with Macarthur Diversity Services, a defunded organisation operating in Claymore, an area with 86 per cent public housing, a median age of 20 and low educational accomplishments. They say very clearly that 56 per cent of their students have graduated, that 125 families were affected, that 11 of the parents became tutors-one of the concepts is that parents are helped and brought into the system to become tutors-and that 80 per cent of the tutors got jobs. I very much commend that government initiative in the budget. Overall, we know that large numbers of Australians are assisted by a variety of taxation measures, by the schoolkids bonus-and those opposite oppose that. They are hinting that they do not like this or that, but we really have not had any thorough comments from the shadow Treasurer as to where the reductions they are allegedly going to accomplish are to occur. third largest by size in New South Wales and the 14th biggest in Australia, has given me plenty of thinking time in recent months. This is because the mobile telephone coverage is not what it ought to be and certainly not even what it once was. I was once able to name all Riverina's mobile coverage black spots and they included but were not limited to Murrulebale north of Marrar, Tooma near Tumbarumba and pockets around Gundagai, Borambola, Grong Grong, Humula, Sebastopol, Tallimba and Tarcutta. Happily, a new tower has been erected at Mangoplah, which was one of the problem districts, and this will be officially opened on Wednesday, 6 June. Unfortunately, in recent months Riverina mobile coverage elsewhere has deteriorated to the extent that if you get just a few kilometres away from a built-up area you lose reception. Because of the drastic loss of coverage, instead of being able to use my hands-free phone whilst driving, I have to wait until I am in a town to retrieve messages and return calls. This is a great inconvenience. I say this because, at the same time, this government is pumping $37 billion of borrowed money into a broadband network we cannot afford. Mobile services across regional Australia are going from bad to worse. While it is merely an inconvenience for me, for many others it is a safety issue, and that is deeply concerning. Many of the calls of complaint to my office lately have suggested that country mobile services are being downgraded as part of a strategy for people to get on board the new technology rollout, which might be all right for those fortunate enough to be in the designated",206,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
253,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (12:09,"Driving around my electorate of Riverina, theareas for the first phase but is tough luck for those who are not. Telstra officials have admitted to me that the mobile coverage in the Riverina is not as good as it ought to be, and the corporation's commitment to my region has not, I feel, been strengthened by the fact that the general manager for Riverina-Murray, based in Albury-Wodonga, has been replaced by someone looking after a far bigger area and working out of Canberra. This has everything to do with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and related bills before the House because huge money is going into ripping out the copper wire network, which has served us well, to be replaced by optical fibre, when wireless technology would have done the job and funding could have-and I would argue, should have-been given to installing telecommunications towers to serve regional and remote communities. The government has resorted to accounting tricks and money shuffles to manufacture the appearance of a wafer-thin budget surplus of $1.5 billion in 2012-13. But the appearance of a surplus is really just an illusion. Whilst the Treasurer and Prime Minister tell us that budget 2012 was a tough budget, the reality is that Labor is spending money at an unprecedented rate and its economic malaise is hurting Australia, particularly regional Australia. It is hurting families and hurting Australian workers and it will continue to do so for generations to come. Indeed, it would take Labor 96 years to pay off $144 billion of net debt, based on the Treasurer's tiny surplus announced in his 8 May budget. Budget 2012 delivered Australia the world's biggest carbon tax, a record debt ceiling of $300 billion, a record net debt of $145 billion, higher unemployment and Labor's fourth massive deficit in four years. Labor inherited $70 billion of Commonwealth assets and a $20 billion surplus from sound fiscal management by the coalition yet has produced the four biggest deficits in Australia's history. In the past four years, Labor has delivered cumulative record deficits of $174 billion, and interest payments on Labor's debt alone are set to reach $8 billion per year by 2015-16, and that equates to $22 million a day on interest payments. As a fuel outlet proprietor from Narrandera said to me yesterday, 'Our great-grandchildren will still be paying off Labor's waste.' The blow-out in this year's deficit, from $23 billion to $44 billion, means more borrowing and more debt which future generations will have to pay. All of this is in spite of, in real terms, the government experiencing the fastest growth in revenue since the 1980s. Five days before the last election, the Prime Minister promised that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. Therefore, it is not surprising that this tax is not wanted by the Australian public. There was no need for the government to waste $1 million commissioning a report to be told this. It would have known this from the start if it was actually listening to the Australian people. But Labor has not listened to the people; instead it takes its cues from the Greens. The result is that people stopped listening to Labor a long time ago. An election cannot come soon enough. The carbon tax is going to send energy bills soaring. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal hearing into the draft increase of 16 per cent was told that the prices needed to go higher, with Australian Power& Gas wanting prices to increase by 25 per cent. Energy companies will need to increase prices to cover infrastructure upgrades, and the additional cost of the carbon tax is making things worse. It is natural that a company passes on its costs to the consumer, but in this case it is the government imposing the cost, unnecessarily, on the Australian public in the first place. Wagga Wagga City Council-and, moreover, the hard working residents, families and ratepayers of that fine city-has been declared among eight councils on Labor's hit list of the 248 so-called biggest polluters. How a regional council based in a city of 63,000 people, good people, can be considered a dirty polluter is beyond belief. That residents will be slugged with annual carbon tax bills of $660,000 plus-that is the amount in the first year, and it will only increase-just for taking their rubbish to the Gregadoo Waste Management Centre would be laughable if it were not so serious. That money would be far better spent on fixing potholes, buying library books or on maintaining the city's beautiful open parks and gardens than sending it offshore to Bolivia, Nigeria or Russia to buy carbon credits courtesy of some non-existent carbon sink. Now we find out from Senate estimates on Monday that Coolamon Shire Council and Griffith City Council are also in Labor's carbon-tax crosshairs. There are 112 councils in total in Labor's sights, 79 per cent of which are in regional Australia. There are eight that the Clean Energy Regulator wrote to last month and they are included in the initial list of 248 entities to pay the tax. There are also another 104 councils that may be liable to pay the tax. While the government is giving councils a 12-month reprieve and is assisting them to determine how much methane over 40 to 60 years is likely to be emitted from waste decomposition, it cannot give them any advice as to what the price of those emissions might be in 33 years time. The government does not even know what the price will be in three years time. The key thing here is that you get to charge for waste disposal only once, when it is dropped off, but the liability will be with you for 40 to 60 years. As the 7 May editorial in the Wagga Wagga newspaper, the Daily Advertiser, declared: Wagga City Council is being forced to pay $23 per tonne carbon tax. What a load of rot! This climate change nonsense is now totally out of control. … … … Really, there is no need for this tax. … … … For heaven's sake, just what is the federal government thinking? Well written! This government has also wasted money on the tangling bureaucracy which surrounds the set-top box program. Almost a quarter of the $308 million to put set-top boxes in pensioners' homes was spent on administration. The cost to the government of having a set-top box installed is about $350 per box. Harvey Norman in Wagga Wagga can do this for $99. It could install three boxes for less than the cost of one of the government's boxes. Disturbingly, the government also appears to be being charged for work that is not completed by contractors. I have a constituent who recently had a set-top box installed in his home by two contractors. On completing the installation they laid out equipment which they claimed was a safety check and then had him sign a job form. At the time his wife was gravely ill and he was in the process of taking her to the hospital, so he did not pay too much attention to what he was signing. He informed me that the contractors laid out an aerial and cable and took photos of these, and he was concerned that the government was being rorted by contractors who were charging for services and equipment which had never been supplied nor installed. My constituent was also concerned about the way in which the ease of installation and explanation is portrayed in the television advertisements yet when he asked to be shown how to use the new system he was told, 'You'll work it out'. Where is the accountability for these services being rendered? What safeguards are in place to ensure taxpayers are paying only for what is being carried out? Furthermore, my constituent felt too scared for me to name him in this speech for fear of having a brick thrown through his window. He believes that many elderly people feel they have no choice but to sign the forms, no matter what they say, as the contractors make them feel intimidated and if they do not sign they will take the set-top box away. However, it is not only the set-top box program that has been problematic for people in the Riverina. With the digital switchover, many residents who currently receive a perfect analogue signal will be left with a bad or no digital reception. One constituent, Marie Chilton from Book Book, is having a great deal of difficulty sorting out television for the digital switchover. She had a contractor come to install a set-top box but was advised that she had no signal whatsoever and would have to get a satellite dish. As there is no assistance for the purchase of a satellite dish Mrs Chilton will face the cost of this herself. Additionally, she rents the property and therefore cannot claim the tax back that homeowners can get. Her landlord refuses to pay to install the satellite dish. I have written to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy on Mrs Chilton's behalf and was advised by his staff that she may-and I reiterate 'may'-qualify for assistance with the installation of a satellite dish but will have to cover the cost of the dish herself. Mrs Chilton does not understand why the government would spend all this money switching over when she currently receives all the channels perfectly via analogue, yet she is facing so many hassles to switch to digital. This is another example of this Labor government not considering the impact of its actions on regional Australians and senior Australians. That said, Riverina secured nearly $17.5 million in health infrastructure funding despite what was a tough federal budget-the toughest federal budget in a quarter of a century. The Griffith Community Private Hospital development was allocated the $11.388 million it needed for the project and Hillston's multipurpose service redevelopment received $6 million. I know how much this will mean for those communities who worked so hard to ensure their submissions were successful. Having updated decent facilities in centres in the western Riverina also eases the pressure on Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, which gained $55.1 million in last year's budget as the major health facility in our region. I acknowledge the local health funding. However, the budget was not otherwise friendly for regional Australia. Labor has stripped $5.5 billion from defence, which, considering that Wagga Wagga is a tri-service city, is sure to have an impact. The cuts ensure that as a percentage of gross domestic product spending on defence is now at its lowest level since 1938-the year before World War II began. Twenty Army major capital facilities projects have been delayed by up to three years, including the construction of Kapooka's working accommodation. There is the removal of recreational leave travel for single members over the age of 21. They were entitled to go back to their next of kin once or twice a year but that has now been cut. They cannot travel back to see their next of kin, because Labor cannot stop spending. The gap year program for Air Force, Army and Navy, to give young people leaving year 12 the opportunity to go into the military for 12 months, has been axed. There is a 10 per cent reduction in Army Reserve training salaries-so 10 per cent of our Army Reserve is being cut. What will that do to our regional communities and to our men and women who do so much to help serve their nation? Labor has badly let down the disability sector, giving just $1 billion over four years to start the National Disability Insurance Scheme, when the Productivity Commission said $3.9 billion was needed. Whilst Labor members might say that Labor is doing everything it can and that the coalition is doing nothing, the National Disability Insurance Scheme does have bipartisan support. I was the first federal parliamentarian in New South Wales to sign up to the program. Ms Rishworth interjectingbipartisan support-and to go down that path of using the most vulnerable members in the community is absolutely shameful. These people absolutely need security on their funding and they will receive it, as there is bipartisan support. The government has deferred $941 million of vital Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure money to 2015-16. Yet money for buybacks is still very much on the table. I just had a group of schoolchildren from St Patrick's Primary School at Griffith visit, and one thing the adults accompanying those children wanted to know was what this government is going to do with the Murray-Darling Basin. I have to say that I do not know. This government does not recognise the fact that farmers grow the food to feed this nation. These people know how to use water very economically. They need the water to be able to grow the food to sustain our nation and other nations into the future, but they are being hit hard every which way they go. This government has not provided the sort of money it needs to for vital infrastructure which would put environmental water back into the system. But no-this government just continues to buy back water from the productive farmers and take money away, which is nothing short of theft. In this budget, spending on roads is the lowest it has been in a decade, and that is just shameful. Aged care will cost a whole lot more thanks to this budget-which, overall, is a figure-fixing exercise in order to produce an illusionary budget surplus. I question Labor's claim of achieving a surplus when Labor has increased the Commonwealth's borrowings limit by $50 billion to $300 billion. It is like a bank overdraft. Anyone in business and anyone who has ever run a small business knows that you should not spend beyond your capacity to pay back your debts. But, unfortunately, not many on the Labor side have actually ever run a business. They have never grasped that you need to actually make money to be able to pay your debts, because a lot of them are, unfortunately, people straight from the unions-union hacks-and they have no idea about how to run a business and therefore they have no idea as to how to end up with a black line on the bottom of their profit and loss statement. And that shows, because all we ever seem to get is a red line on the bottom of Labor's budget. There is no business acumen in this reckless and wasteful Labor government. This budget has badly let down regional Australia. It has badly let down Australia as a whole. Unfortunately, our defence and our security will be the poorer because of this budget, as will small business-and families certainly will be because of the impending carbon tax, which is only a little more than a month away. That is going to have a very harmful effect on people's ability to meet the high cost-of-living pressures into the future. the member for North Sydney, but I do speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20122013, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill",210,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity

255,Mr Symon (Deakin) (12:24,"I do not support the amendment to these bills moved by(No. 1) 2012-2013, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2011-2012, as moved by the Treasurer. These appropriation bills build on Labor's election commitments made at the 2010 election and provide much needed assistance and services not only to the constituents of Deakin but to everyone across our great nation of Australia. Since the last budget debate here in May last year I have opened 15 new Building the Education Revolution Primary Schools for the 21st Century projects in my electorate of Deakin. In addition to that, another two were opened with representation in the electorate and we have also opened a new trade training centre. For most of these schools, especially in the government and Catholic sectors, this was the first major spending on infrastructure for many decades-and for some of them the first since they were built. For anyone who doubts the benefits of the Building the Education Revolution I have a simple challenge: get out there and have a look. Have a chat to the school principal and to the teachers. Talk to the school community and see the difference that the $16 billion that we invested in education has made to our nation's primary schools. AlthoughI have often spoken about the opening of BER buildings at many schools in my electorate, I have not completed that task in full as yet, due to time limitations in this place. SoI will list for the House the schools that have opened their BER buildings in the last year in Deakin. We have Livingstone Primary School in Vermont South, Blackburn Lake Primary School, Rangeview Primary School in Mitcham, Antonio Park Primary School in Mitcham, Nunawading Christian College Primary School, Croydon Special Development School, Ringwood Heights Primary School, Weeden Heights Primary School in Vermont South, Dorset Primary School in Croydon, St Phillips School in Blackburn North, Heathmont East Primary School, St Timothy's School in Vermont, Tinternvale Primary School in Ringwood East, Vermont South Special School, Mullum Primary School in Ringwood, Vermont Primary School and Yarra Valley Grammar School. These local state government, Catholic and independent sector schools have built brand new functional buildings that have helped to bring their schools into the 21st century. Some have done absolute wonders with existing spaces and some have started from scratch. But, in particular, it must be noted that these buildings were done with thought-and that is a good thing. It meant that there were not mistakes made due to rushing headfirst into a new building project. Most of the problems, though not all, were sorted out at the design stage-and, of course, in construction there are always problems that come along that are unplanned for. But, in every case, these new learning and activity spaces have made the school better for students and their teachers, and I think they have helped to encourage a sense of pride and ownership in the wider school community-after all, it is an asset that they get to keep and use. These buildings utilise modern designs and have features such as passive heating and cooling and especially modern interiors. I am always particularly taken by the amount of light in these new BER buildings-which of course is natural and not artificial light. I think open teaching and meeting spaces certainly suit the way that our children are taught in schools these days-to the point where many old schools are knocking walls down between classrooms. I think that is certainly a change from the time that many of us were at that level of schooling. Three of these buildings were the local Maroondah template, which was designed specifically for schools in my area. That was designed for schools that did not qualify for the Victorian state government's full-size building template. It allowed schools to get a larger building and allowed schools to be able to do refurbishments on top of their building. Looking at recently built school halls already around the area and adapting the design to fit the BER guidelines, schools like Ringwood Heights, Rangeview Primary and Dorset Primary were able to get a full-size indoor facility. In the case of both Ringwood Heights and Dorset Primary that was instead of a half-size facility, and in the case of Rangeview and Dorset Primary, they both got to do extra works-whether that involved refurbishment of existing administration wings or classrooms. So they really got two projects for the price of one. There are only 10 such buildings in Victoria, with eight of them either in or near the electorate of Deakin. I think they are a great result. They show how work between the federal government and the state government and the community of those schools has achieved a fantastic result for those schools in the electorate. There are many more schools in Deakin that are awaiting their official openings. Last time. I counted, there were about 10 still to be officially opened. As far as I understand, they are all operating, with the exception of one which still has some planning issues. I look forward to informing the House of these openings in the near future. It should never be forgotten that the Liberal Party, and their partners the Nationals, opposed these wonderful local projects and voted against the funding in this very place in 2009. If the Liberal and National parties had had their way, these buildings would never have been built and schools in Deakin would have been worse off to the tune of $80 million in infrastructure. I have highlighted these BER projects, as they show how Labor in government has delivered and continues to deliver for our local community in Deakin. These projects have made a real difference to the quality of and access to education and training right across the electorate. This year we have continued our proud record of delivering better access to education for our community by introducing the schoolkids bonus, a payment made to families who receive Family Tax Benefit Part A. At $410 per year per primary student and $820 per year per secondary student, the schoolkids bonus will replace the education tax refund. Unlike the education tax refund, the schoolkids bonus does not require receipts for eligible items to be kept and then claimed at the end of the year on a tax return. The education tax refund was introduced by Labor as a key measure to help families nationwide cover the costs involved in educating their children. Although it was a great measure, it did not completely hit the mark. It is estimated that 1,150 families in my electorate of Deakin have not claimed the education tax refund for the 2010-11 financial year despite being qualified to do so and that a further 3,800 families have not claimed the full amount available. The schoolkids bonus extends the education tax refund concept and provides more money to families with children at school. It will help to cover the almost never-ending stream of expenses that arise from educational activities. Meanwhile, as good as this Labor initiative to introduce the schoolkids bonus is, in Victoria the Baillieu Liberal government, with no regard to the cost of starting a child at primary or secondary school, has just cut back the education maintenance allowance for local schools. So some parents might see what has been given with one hand being taken away by another. That is not under our control here in federal parliament, but I can say, from a federal government perspective, that we are doing a great thing for families with children in schoolnot only in Victoria but right across Australia. It is estimated that over one million Australian families will benefit from this change to the education tax refund and they can look forward to receiving their upfront payments from 20 June this year. Just as we saw with the BER program, the Liberal Party voted against the schoolkids bonus program in this parliament. I think that is because they do not care about the cost-of-living pressures that families across the country are facing-not only when it comes to education but with all the other day-to-day bills households accrue. This budget will also deliver, through Family Tax Benefit Part A, an increase of between $100 and $600 per year from July 2013 to further assist families with the costs of raising children. At least 1.1 million families will receive at least an extra $300 per year as a result of this increase to the maximum rate of the Family Tax Benefit Part A. Another 460,000 families across Australia will receive at least an extra $100 per year from this measure. This budget has many benefits for local families and it also has benefits for small business. As we in this place know, some of the proceeds of the government's minerals resource rent tax were going to provide a tax cut for businesses. But this could not happen without the support of either the Liberal and National parties or the Greens in this current parliament. I and many others still cannot believe that the Liberal Party would oppose a cut in company tax rates. I really do wonder who they actually represent-other than themselves. The Leader of the Opposition's company tax policy is to put a 1.7 per cent extra tax on the 3,000 biggest companies in Australia to fund paid maternity leave at a rate of up to $75,000 for six months. We hear a lot about the impact of carbon pricing, but that impact is nowhere near the magnitude, when it comes to its impact on business, of the opposition's proposed 1.7 per cent tax increase. That will have a huge impact. Whereas we proposed tax cuts, the Liberals were proposing tax increases on business. Because we were unable to get that measure through parliament, this budget introduces a loss carryback scheme in place of those company tax cuts that will allow companies to carry back losses of up to $1 million against tax that they have already paid. The instant asset write-off for small business for items up to $6,500 each commences on 1 July this year and can be accessed not only by those who have companies but also by sole traders, partnerships and trusts. In total, over 2.7 million small businesses Australia wide will be able to take advantage of this tax break. In the time remaining I must also mention the improvements that this government is making to superannuation for Australian workers. Superannuation is a subject. I have spoken about at length in this place, and I will continue to do so. Although superannuation is now taken as a workplace right, I am old enough to remember when it was a workplace privilege. When I started full-time work in 1982, superannuation was generally only for government employees or for management in private industry. Fortunately times have changed, but it took a lot of effort to get that change. If you were not in one of those groups, you generally got nothing in the way of super. AlthoughI was fortunate to be in an industry that started paying super in 1985, it was at a very low rate. The majority of the population had to wait until the Keating Labor government passed the Superannuation Guarantee Act in 1992. When that came in the standard was three percent, whereas now the standard is nine percent. It took an awful lot of incremental increases to finally build up to that nine percent. The Gillard government has now introduced measures to increase the superannuation rate from nine percent to 12 percent, again through incremental increases, over the next seven years. It will not be until 2019 that we get to the 12 percent super guarantee for workers in Australia. Another important change to super is that workers earning up to $37,000 per annum will effectively pay no tax on their super contributions from 1 July this year. This change will provide for higher retirement balances for full-time workers on or near the minimum wage and for many part-time and casual workers. It is often forgotten when we talk about super and the balances people might have at retirement and how they can use those funds that many people will never get to that satisfactory level, for all sorts of reasons. Some people spend many years out of the workforce; some people will miss out on super because they work in low-paying jobs; there is unemployment; and there are all sorts of reasons that mean that when a person hits retirement age they will not have what we regard as an average expected balance and therefore income from their super savings. The changes we are making now are long-term changes. They will take a long time to work through the system for the benefit of every working person in Australia. That is a great thing. As I say, it takes a long time but taking away the tax disincentive for the very lowest income earners is one of the best measures in this budget. It will certainly impact very positively on many people I know of in my electorate of Deakin who do part-time work, who do not have big incomes. I am sure it will make their lives in the future a whole lot better, as it will for low-income earners right across the country. I commend these bills-but not the second reading amendment-to the House. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) be read a second time. It is an incredibly important amendment because it goes to the heart of transparency in how the nation's finances are handled. We especially need transparency at the moment. BeforeI go into the specifics of the amendment, I would like to spend some time talking about the budget. We have global economic uncertainty, especially with the uncertainty of whether the Eurozone will hold together or not, and we have ongoing political turmoil, with changes of government and changes of view about how austerity measures should be dealt with. Here in Australia we needed in this budget an economic plan-some vision, some leadership, a way forward. We needed a demonstration that, in particular, the Treasurer knew what the hell he was doing. Sadly, what we got was no such statement, no such vision, no such leadership. We got a budget which offered no plan, more debt and continued on the path to delivering, come 1 July, the carbon tax. I would like to look first at what the budget did for my electorate of Wannon. The No. 1 issue at the moment in the electorate of Wannon-it has been for some time-is how we can get more money from federal, state and local governments into our road infrastructure. There has been a road infrastructure deficit now for some years, and we need to get funding to address that deficit. what did this budget do to help in that regard? Sadly, road funding will be cut from $6.2 billion in 2011-12 to $2.6 billion in 2012-13. That is a $3.6 billion shortfall. It is a key infrastructure demand-something which will drive productivity and help this nation deliver its goods and services to export markets to make sure that our domestic economy functions coherently and increases productivity, and what has the government done in this important area? It has cut its spending by $3.6 billion.",214,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
256,Mr Tehan (Wannon) ( 12:38,"I rise to support the amendment to the motion thatWe see that impact more specifically when it comes to how the Western Highway will be funded. The Western Highway will not get the full amount of funding that had been promised to it each year for the next four years. Instead the books have been cooked. I understand that there have been some environmental planning issues which have led to some delays, but that does not mean that the Treasurer should cook the books so he delivers less funding next year to deliver his surplus and then puts extra funding in the outlying two years to help him achieve his wafer-thin surplus. It demonstrates quite clearly that the Treasurer has cooked the books when it comes to delivering his surplus, and we are highly unlikely to see it. As a matter of fact, if history dictates anything, we are definitely not going to see it. As we saw with the blow-out in the deficit in the last budget, which totalled over $20 billion, it seems almost impossible that the Treasurer can hang on to this wafer-thin, $1.5 billion surplus which he has announced for the coming financial year. On that point, we also need to ask-and this is what the amendment we are debating today goes to the heart of: if the Treasurer is determined to deliver his wafer-slim surplus, why is he asking for an extra $50 billion credit limit to be placed on the nation's credit card? Why is he asking for that borrowing limit to be raised from $250 billion to $300 billion? It just does not pass the common sense test. It does not pass the pub test. If you are telling people you are going to deliver a surplus, why then would you be also saying, 'Oh, we need to sneak through this little increase in our credit card limit'? And this 'little increase' is $50 billion. Something just does not stack up, and I think we all know what does not stack up. It is the Treasurer's ability to deliver a budget which will achieve what it sets out to do and which shows any sort of vision for this country. We also see, despite the predicted growth rates, that unemployment is set to rise to 5.5 per cent. Last year's budget promised 500,000 new jobs over two years, but the government now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. So once again it is hard not to be just a little bit cynical. We have a commitment to achieving 500,000 new jobs in the last budget and yet already, one year later, that target is going to be missed by 300,000 jobs. It does make it hard to believe the Treasurer when he says that we will get a surplus out of the next financial year. It makes it extremely hard to believe. The other thing which makes the budget fairly dubious and raises a level of cynicism-that raises a level of mistrust, with how it has been cobbled together and what it sets out to achieve-is that we are assured that the carbon price-with no mention of the carbon tax, of course, but the carbon price-will only impact the 500 largest emitters. Yet, at the same time, it then goes on to explain what assistance would be offered to families to help them cope with the price increases from the tax that will not speak its name, the carbon tax-or the carbon price, whichever way we want to define it. So once again there is an inconsistency which has to raise a level of cynicism. It really has to make one wonder whether this Treasurer has any credibility whatsoever. Assistance to cope with the carbon price to families is clearly laid out within the budget yet the overarching statement is that the carbon tax will only impact on the 500 big emitters. If there is a message that comes out of this budget, and if I could very humbly provide some advice to the Treasurer, it is that you need to get a consistency in your messaging. Otherwise, people are going to grow more and more cynical about what you are trying to achieve. I think that has been clearly established. We have a budget where the government is saying, 'This is what we are saying, but this is what the result will be.' What is being said does not fit with what the results or the outcomes are. It is a real tragedy that that is the case, because at this time, more than at any time, at least since the GFC and before it, the Asian financial crisis, we needed a clear economic statement-a clear economic message-which showed the way forward for this nation. We have set out a vision as to how we would increase the productivity of our capital, how we would increase the productivity of our labour and how we would deal with the ongoing stormy seas which are surrounding us, especially the stormy seas surrounding Europe. But this budget does not do this. What does it do instead? It engrains the carbon tax. In my electorate of Wannon, that means extra cost to our dairy farmers; extra cost to our beef producers; extra cost to our land producers; extra cost to our manufacturers, large and small; extra cost to local government, especially when it comes to waste disposal. On that point, it adds not only extra cost but also extra confusion, because none of the people who manage waste fill in my electorate have been able to get a clear idea from this government as to how the carbon tax will work in this area. With this budget we get record debt. We get a ceiling of $300 billion-four times what it was in 2008. We also get a level of net debt which is increasing to $144.9 billion. It is important to pause and think about what this means. It means that the government will be spending over $8 billion a year, or around $22 million a day, on interest payments alone. Just stop for a minute and think what could be done with that $8 billion. We could make serious headway with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We could start to address the infrastructure deficit which is beginning to hurt regional and rural Australia in particular. Eight billion dollars is a lot of money. That is $22 million a day. That money could be put to productive use. Instead, it will be put towards paying off interest. Let us not forget that in 2007, when Kevin Rudd came to power, that level of debt was zero. The books were actually showing a positive position. That is the turnaround. Since 2007, $8 billion a year in interest payments has been incurred. In conclusion, I think that this budget showed once again that what this country needs is an election. We have a government which does not know how to run the government's finances. We have a parliament which is beset by issues and problems of its own making. What the Australian people need is an election, so that we can get on and decide what is the economic vision that this country needs and set about delivering that economic vision so that peopleespecially people in my communities-do not continue to have the worries and the economic concerns which this government is placing upon them.

258,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (15:57,"I rise to talk briefly on the Parliamentary Counsel andmerge two arms of the Parliamentary Counsel, which is part of the department that does legislative drafting and publishing on behalf of the parliament. Currently, responsibility for legislative drafting is split between the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing is a division within the department comprising 23 legislative drafters and 50 staff responsible for drafting subordinate legislation as well as the registration, editing, compilation and publication of all Commonwealth laws. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel is an independent statutory agency consisting of a First Parliamentary Counsel, two Second Parliamentary Counsel and 55 staff. Its responsibility is the drafting of government bills and amendments. Most other Australian jurisdictions combine the drafting of bills and subordinate legislation in one office. That recommendation for the Commonwealth to do so was contained within the strategic review of small and medium agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio, the inquiry which has recently been conducted, and a merger was recommended in order to realise efficiencies in the use of specialised technology and to achieve uniformity in drafting practice for principal and subordinate legislation. This review has not been made public and it is not clear to the opposition why it has not been released by the government. Clearly, when bills like this come up-although, on the face of it, it is pretty uncontroversial-it would be welcomed by the opposition if we did actually get a chance to have a look at the report. It is very difficult to see why a report of this nature would not be made publicly available and I would call upon the government to consider releasing it. Notwithstanding that, the coalition does welcome any move that identifies efficiencies within the drafting process and, as such, we will not be opposing this particular legislation. the Parliamentary Counsel and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Parliamentary Counsel Act 1970, the Acts Publication Act 1905, and the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 to enable the functions of the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing in the Attorney-General's Department to be transferred to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. As the Attorney-General went on to say, and as the previous speaker has already stated, the two functions are currently separate and, in effect, this legislation brings them together under the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Parliament could not function without the professionalism and competency of the people who work behind the scenes in support of the parliamentarians who are elected to this place. As parliamentarians, we come to this place with ideas and beliefs, ideas which may become policies. To give effect to those policies we then enact laws. In doing so, there are three important considerations that immediately come to my mind: firstly, that the laws enacted accurately reflect the intent of the policy; secondly, that the laws enacted can be clearly interpreted by the courts; and, thirdly, that the laws enacted are not in conflict with other laws. I will briefly speak to each of those three considerations. Firstly, as we all know, from time to time disputes arise with respect to laws of the land and, in handing down judgments it is not uncommon for judges of the day, or people who sit on the bench, to rely on the intent of the legislation when it has been passed in parliament, whether a federal or a state parliament. So the intent of the legislation becomes an important",220,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
259,Mr Zappia (Makin) (16:00,"As the Attorney-General said in her second reading speech,consideration. It is therefore important that the laws that are drafted and subsequently passed by the parliament accurately reflect the intent of the parliament. It is also in the public interest to clearly understand what that intent is, because whether you are a citizen of the land, a business operator or any community organisation for that matter, our laws govern the general conduct of yourself or the organisation and therefore to understand the clear intent of the law is important for everybody. The second issue relates to the courts and their role in disputes, and both the legal profession and the courts have an interest in this matter. The legal profession have an interest in advising their clients. The courts have an interest, because they try to interpret the laws and it greatly assists them if the laws are written up very clearly in a way that everybody can understand. If they are written clearly and without ambiguity, then it makes the job of both lawyers advising clients and the courts much, much easier-and certainly it makes the role of those people who seek the advice of the lawyers, who in turn then have to decide whether they will go to court, much easier also. The third issue is conflict. Again, this would be an incredibly difficult role for anybody: to ensure that any law that is passed is not in some way in conflict with another law of the land. I have to give credit to the people who advise this parliament and who draft our laws for the work that they do because it would be fair to say they do an excellent job in trying to ensure that that is not the case. If it is the case, again as we have seen from time to time, laws are then challenged because they are in conflict with another law of the land. For those reasons, this particular aspect of the support that is provided to parliamentarians is absolutely crucial. It does not affect just the parliamentarians who come to this place. It ultimately affects everyone throughout the country. By transferring the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, we have brought the two sections together. That, in my view, makes eminent sense because whether you are drafting primary or subordinate legislation it seems logical to me that both have to be compatible with one another. The best way to ensure that compatibility is to have the same department drafting the original law or subordinate legislation and regulations that flow from it. It makes sense. It ensures that the same person who understands and who has put the work into drafting the original legislation perhaps has a role in ensuring that the subordinate legislation is consistent with the primary legislation. It is also a much more efficient process, in my view, and that was clearly the outcome from the review carried out by the Attorney General. For those reasons, I believe that this legislation not only makes sense but also is good legislation for everyone concerned. I commend it to the House. Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. We are dealing with legislation that affects people's lives. For example, the explanatory memorandum makes the point that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel consists of 55 staff employed in both drafting and non-drafting roles, and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing consists of 23 legislative drafters and 50 staff responsible for the registration, editing, compilation and publication of legislation. When we say it is an office I want no-one to be under any illusions that we are drafting with quite significant statutory authorities or offices that are within the purview and remit of the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel is an independent agency-we know that-which is responsible for drafting all government bills. The Office of",221,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
260,Mr Neumann (Blair) (16:07,"I speak in support of the Parliamentary Counsel andLegislative Drafting and Publishing is a division within the department and has the responsibility of drafting legislative instruments. There is a recommendation that this takes place. I do not know why in the history of the Commonwealth there were two complete departments that merged and ended up involved in this legislative drafting process. Certainly, in other jurisdictions it is not the case-I am aware of that. There is a recommendation from the Skehill review of small and medium agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio that there be more efficient management and prioritisation of drafting functions. I imagine that style would be something that is likely to be more coherent and consistent if the same people are drafting both. This is important, as the member for Makin said, because laws affect people. We are a nation of laws. We do not rule by the gun; we do not rule by the bullet; we do not rule by the fist. We actually rule by laws. The preparation of subordinate legislation, of laws, is particularly important. It is a key element of any legal education that drafting is taught. I can recall vividly when I was at law schoolback at the University of Queensland-that there were people who aspired to do this type of work, and did it. They left the University of Queensland and came down here to Canberra to work. This is an important reform because laws affect people's lives and every community across the country. This is a reforming government in the area of law. The bill is a small part but an important part. We have seen, today, legislation introduced in relation to privacy law reforms. We are building our National Disability Insurance Scheme, which will have an impact on the laws of this country. We are passing legislation in relation to people trafficking and other areas such as consolidation of antidiscrimination laws, including a commitment to a truly national legal profession, which is important as we have to get rid of the dingo fences that have, in the past, meant that people had to register across different jurisdictions. This is a small piece of legislation. It affects dozens and dozens of public servants who toil away and make us look better and make the laws look good. It is important because it will improve efficiency in the legislative drafting process for better management of Commonwealth government resources and in the circumstances I commend the legislation to the House. and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (16:11): I thank the honourable members who have spoken on this bill for their contribution to the debate. The Parliamentary Counsel and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 enables the functions of the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing to be transferred to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel thereby increasing the flexible and efficient use of the Commonwealth's drafting resources. The proposed transfer of functions was recommended to the government as a means of enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the Commonwealth statute book and optimising its drafting resources. The government has accepted this recommendation and this bill gives effect to the reform. I take this opportunity to thank all those from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing who have assisted in the development of this bill and who are working to implement the transfer within a short time frame. As the Attorney-General noted when introducing this bill, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has a long, distinguished and central role in giving effect to government policy. I would like to",222,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
261,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Changecommend both drafting offices for their excellent work behind the scenes to enable the government to efficiently and effectively carry out its legislative program time and time again. These two offices have operated side by side over many years to draft high-quality acts and subordinate legislation and to ensure that our laws are continually advancing, accurately reflecting government policies and are easy to understand. By pooling the Commonwealth's specialist drafting functions into the one office the government will ensure that it makes the most effective use of both our highly skilled drafters and the specialist IT systems that support the drafting and publishing of Commonwealth legislation. This will improve drafting capacity, raise consistency across all forms of legislation and make our laws clearer and easier to understanding. I am aware that both offices have already begun working together to streamline drafting styles and practices and to work more closely on particular projects. I am confident that the transfer of functions will progress this work and ensure that all legislation, whether bills, regulations or other subordinate instruments, will be drafted at a high and consistent standard in the future. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

In my electorate of Reid, the budget will deliver a new cash payment to 6,850 families with kids in school. Parents will receive $410 for each child in primary school and $820 for each child in high school as part of the new schoolkids bonus. The budget will increase family",223,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
262,Mr Murphy (Reid) (16:14,"I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012-13. Thepayments by up to $600 for more than 10,000 families in my electorate. Starting in July next year, this extra support will be made to families currently receiving family tax benefit part A payments. The budget will provide extra money to help pay the bills to 11,000 young people-single parents and the unemployed-currently receiving allowances in my electorate of Reid. Singles will receive a $210 lump sum payment, while couples will receive $350. We are also returning the budget to surplus on time as promised. Returning to surplus gives the Reserve Bank maximum flexibility to cut interest rates again. Interest rates are now lower than at any time under the Howard government and a family on a $300,000 mortgage is now paying around $3,000 a year less in repayments. The federal Labor government is also delivering reforms which promote a stronger community and a fairer society. These are big reforms such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a great new investment in dental health and the fantastic aged-care package. In relation to the schoolkids bonus, I take this opportunity to expose the opposition's real intentions on this matter-that is, the opposition has confirmed that they will oppose the government's new schoolkids bonus. What does this mean? It means an Abbott government would take away the new schoolkids bonus from the 6,850 families of the 12,050 schoolchildren in my electorate of Reid. An Abbott government would also take away the automatic cash payment of $410 for each child in primary school and $820 for each child in high school. This would amount to more than $7 million being taken from my electorate. The government's new schoolkids bonus replaces the education tax refund. Under the education tax refund scheme, some 5,150 families in my electorate failed to get the full amount, including 1,100 families who made no ETR claim at all for the 2010-11 tax year. Our new payment will ensure that families are getting every cent they deserve upfront-when they need it. It makes it easier for families because there is no paperwork and no need to keep receipts, just a twice-yearly cash payment for every child at school. The opposition would like to deny families this money to pay for the cost of essentials, such as school books and uniforms, because they seem to think families cannot be trusted to spend this extra money on their kids. I will now look in some detail at what this budget does to help small businesses, because there are about 22,000 in my electorate. Small businesses have approached me for more information. It is no accident that most small business operators voted Labor in 2007 because they had suffered from years of neglect under the Howard government, which favoured the big end of town-as the opposition still do. The budget will help small business to invest by allowing companies to carry back tax losses to get a refund against tax paid in the previous year, providing a tax benefit of up to $300,000 per year. From1 July this year, the budget will deliver tax breaks for small business, such as increasing the instant asset write-off threshold to $6,500. The government will provide $8.3 million over four years to establish an Australian Small Business Commissioner to provide advocacy for and representation of small business interests and concerns to the Australian government. Funding will also be provided for a national information and referral service to allow small business owners to get access to information and advice and referral to external services such as dispute resolution. This measure will also extend to 2015-16 the existing Small Business Support Line, which provides advice to small businesses on issues such as obtaining finance, cash flow management, retail leasing, personal stress and hardship counselling, and promotion and marketing. The government will provide $27.5 billion over four years to continue the Small Business Advisory Services program and make it an ongoing program. The SBAS program will help small business to improve sustainability, productivity and growth through providing access to low-cost business advisory services and activities to enhance business management skills. Grants will be provided through a competitive merit based process to third-party service organisations to provide small businesses with access to general face-to-face business advisory services including information and referral services. The government's Small Business Advisory Committee will be expanded to strengthen its work on cutting red tape for small business. Australia's 2.7 million small businesses will be given a direct voice to the Australian government through the appointment today of the first national Small Business Commissioner. Labor understands how vital the small business sector is to the Australian economy, employing almost five million Australians and making up a third of the economy. The small business sector has been calling for better advocacy, advice and information at the federal level, and our government has taken notice. This new commissioner will provide small businesses with a voice to highlight their issues to the Australian government. The commissioner will also provide a one-stop shop for small business services and information. Furthermore, the commissioner will ensure the interests of small business remain at the forefront of government policy-making. Australia's more than two million small businesses are made up of hard working men and women who are putting in long hours to build better futures for their families. By acting as a one-stop shop for small business people the commission will be representing their concerns and interests directly to the government. Small-business owners will have access to information and advice, which I have alluded to, and have access to external services such as a dispute resolution service. The commission will also work with the minister for small business to ensure government agencies take into account the needs of small businesses, including ways in which we can better manage the regulation of small business. The commissioner will report directly to the minister, who will liaise directly with cabinet colleagues about issues important to small businesses. The commissioner will also be able to take up individual cases with relevant government agencies. The commissioner's office will work with state and territory small business commissioners to ensure services to small businesses are simple and easy to access and minimise duplication across jurisdictions. The office will also simplify advice to small businesses, including advice on dispute resolution, making the advice more readily available online and via the hotline. Labor has always taken the needs of small business seriously. We appointed the first ever small business minister, as I have alluded to, and we made that portfolio a cabinet appointment earlier this month. This announcement was in response to the Australian government's review of small business dispute resolution programs and options, which reported in 2011. I say again that Labor understands and supports the aspirations of working people who want to run a decent small business, and that is why we are also increasing the small business instant tax write-off from $1,000 to $6,500 and introducing a $5,000 tax break for motor vehicles. Both of those measures are opposed by the opposition. The budget also provides for improvements in infrastructure, both large and small. While the government is already providing $840 million to improve the main northern rail freight corridor from Strathfield in my electorate to Broadmeadow to remove bottlenecks and enhance freight capacity, availability, reliability and journey time, it is also providing muchneeded funding for local roads. Funding from the Roads to Recovery program is largely provided to local government authorities to assist them to maintain and upgrade their local roads. The Treasurer announced that the 2012-13 federal budget provides a further $350 million per annum from 2014-15 to 2018-19. The portion of this roads funding allocated to councils in my electorate of Reid for the next financial year is $668,630, and the amount for 2014-15 to 2018-19 is $3,984,000. I strongly welcome the government's commitment to maintaining funding of this important program for local roads in my electorate, and so do my constituents. The government has stated quite clearly that it is building a new Australian economy based on highly skilled workers, high-technology, fast broadband and clean energy. We are ensuring Australians possess the skills they need to get the jobs of tomorrow by reforming our vocational education and training system and building on our record investment in skills and training. In this budget, $18.1 million will be invested to establish three Australian skills centres of excellence, in partnership with industry and training organisations, to give Australian workers access to cutting-edge education to prepare for roles in emerging industries. There will also be a $35 million boost to the National Workforce Development Fund to help ensure more mature-age workers can reskill or upskill in areas of skill shortage. Employers will continue to work in partnership with the government to ensure training is targeted at skills demanded by industry. A further $19.4 million will provide training to newly qualified tradespeople to help them establish their own businesses. Business and finance training will also be funded for those completing their apprenticeship skills that are critical for running a successful small business. The Australian Skills Quality Authority will receive $4.2 million over four years to support high-quality training through the national regulator. More than $6 million will be invested for the continuing development and expansion of the My Skills website to be launched later this year. This one-stop shop will help people wanting to reskill and keep track of their training over the course of their working life. Labor's continuing record investment in skills and training is driving fundamental economic reform in this country. You can see it with the confidence expressed through the OECD. Labor is giving more Australians than ever before the chance to access high-skilled, high-paid jobs of tomorrow. My main concern is to get the best for my electorate. That is what we are all elected to do in this place. In addition to the measures I have already outlined, 1,309 local families in my electorate of Reid are benefiting from Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme delivered by Labor, a program I am very proud to be associated with. One thousand four hundred and twenty-three local families benefited from the baby bonus last year and many of these families received $500 more of their payment upfront to help pay for initial costs. Six thousand one hundred and seventy-one local families are now benefiting from Labor's increase in the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket costs and the increase in the maximum payment of $7,500 per child per year. These families now have the option of claiming their childcare rebate payment fortnightly rather than having to wait to the end of the year, so it is easier to make ends meet. Eighteen thousand eight hundred local pensioners are now benefiting from Labor's historic pension reforms, including the biggest increase to the pension in 100 years. Single pensioners on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $154 a fortnight and couples on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $156 a fortnight combined. With this budget the Labor government has delivered four years of surplus, despite big revenue losses, while also finding room to deliver reforms which make for a stronger community and a fairer society. We are delivering a surplus with targeted and responsible savings, while protecting the front-line services Australians rely on, as well as helping families with cost-of-living pressures. We have set in train the first historic steps towards the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We are reforming aged care to help senior Australians stay in their own homes. We have made a new big investment in dental health to deliver a blitz on waiting lists. The Labor government has made big investments in our health system with 76 major projects in regional Australia. This is all part of Labor's commitment to manage the economy responsibly in the interests of working Australians and not just for a fortunate few, which the coalition seem more intent on representing. I commend this bill to the House. Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (16:29): I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills. I oppose these bills. I rise to speak on certain aspects of the budget that affect industry, small business and jobs in my electorate of Flynn. How will this budget return confidence to the businesses and individuals which are so sadly lacking in Flynn and in the rest of Australia? The budget cannot be trusted. The surplus cannot be counted upon. Can we have faith in the budget papers? The answer is no. The budget is based on 3.25 per cent GDP growth in the first year, up from three per cent. WhyI query that is that commodity prices are down-coal prices are down, iron ore prices are down, and aluminium prices are down very much due to a glut in the world aluminium market. The strong Australian dollar is not helping our exports. The interest bill alone is already about $8 billion a year. The debt ceiling has been raised from $250 billion to $300 billion. Why is this happening if we are going into a surplus budget? I would like that explained. Australian companies are moving offshore. Overseas companies are investing in other parts of the world. The carbon tax and the MRRT will have negative effects on this budget. The car industry in Australia is in trouble, as is the steel industry, and big and small retailers are in trouble. Sadly, in the aluminium industry we heard the announcement yesterday of the closure of the Kurri Kurri smelter. These are issues that will affect the budget very much and that is why I do not think a budget surplus can be achieved. As I have said many times before, my electorate of Flynn is the carbon capital of Australia. Boy, everyone in my electorate knows what a carbon tax will do to their jobs, to their industries and to their businesses. Flynn is home to two aluminium refineries and one aluminium smelter, Australia's largest cement works, three coal-fired power stations, 20-plus coal mines-and still going up, if they can get their fundamentals right-and three major LNG plant developments, which are costing about $65 billion to construct. There are several new coal loading facilities going in at Gladstone. Our small to medium business sector is vibrant but, as is the case in all areas of Australia, there are streams where some sectors are doing well, others sectors are doing okay and other sectors are performing badly. Also in our electorate we have dairy, citrus, beef, pork and cropping, and many other industries. The carbon tax is the worse possible policy to bring in right now. The timing could not be worse, and $23 a tonne is too high when you compare it with other nations. Also, that $23 a tonne will grow in the next three years. The timing just could not be worse. We have got to remain competitive. We are on the world stage with a lot of our exports. Australia is also lagging behind in terms of productivity. The carbon tax is anti growth. AndI believe you cannot talk about an MRRT on its own, because companies have also got to face the carbon tax, the renewable energy tax, state royalties, staff superannuation increases, payroll tax, a GST on goods they purchase, workers' compensation and community projects, which actually should be funded by the governments, but as the governments are all broke the mining companies and resource companies get behind the communities in every way they can and do spend a lot of money on projects like parks, gardens and hospitals. They actually bring doctors into these towns, which helps their company employees but it also helps towns like Emerald, Blackwater and Biloela. I believe the budget did not address royalties for regions in any way, shape or form. In fact, when it comes to roads in my area, Panorama Creek at Rolleston, which blocks the inland highway up the centre of Queensland from north to south, was not addressed. The Yeppen flood plain, on the Bruce Highway at Rockhampton, cut the state in half again in 2010, and there is no funding for that. Fortunately, money has come out of the 2011-12 budget for the Gin Gin roadworks and Calliope crossroad projects. Hospitals and aged-care facilities-apart from Rockhampton and Bundaberg, to the north and south of Gladstone-did receive good funding. There was none for Gladstone. You must remember that Gladstone is the hub of all this new industry, yet it missed out. There are many small towns in my electorate that have low-key hospitals, but all of them have aged-care facilities and there was no funding for those. They are crying out for extra rooms in most facilities in my area. The superclinic at Emerald has been on the backburner for a long time now, at least four years, and there was no mention of that. With regard to the people of Flynn, full pensioners did okay. They are going to get some of the costs of the new carbon tax refunded. But self-funded retirees are going to miss out completely, as are workers. Workers in Flynn, who are generally high-paid workers-but they do work very hard for their money-are going to have certain benefits taken off them. I do not think this is fair to those workers. They work hard, they do shiftwork, they work around the clock, and it puts a lot of pressure on their families. Generally speaking, I am so proud of the workers in my electorate that I think they deserve every bit they get. They are on a higherthan-average income, I would imagine; they are well paid, but they do pay a lot of tax to the Australian government. They will be stripped of Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits et cetera. I want to talk a little bit about superannuation in the budget. The amount you can contribute on a yearly basis has been cut from $50,000 to $25,000. Now, this is a travesty, an injustice. The thing about putting money into one's superannuation fund is that it does not really happen very much until a person reaches the age where he has got rid of family commitments-the kids have come out of school or university and he has paid off the house. Then, finally, when he gets to the age of 50 or 55, he has a little bit of money left over to put in his superannuation fund, because he wants to get ready to retire in 10 to 15 or 20 years time. Cutting the maximum superannuation contribution from $50,000 back to $25,000 does not leave you much to retire on. Keep in mind that, since 2004 or 2005, superannuation funds have not been returning very good profits at all. In fact, my superannuation fund returned 1.7 per cent last year, which is pretty ordinary; the year before that, it returned a positive 15 per cent; but, the year before that, it returned minus 28 per cent. So you could say that, over the last three years, my superannuation fund and the superannuation funds of most people I have talked to have gone backwards at a rate of knots. That is why, if we want people to be able to afford their own retirement, we have to encourage them, by way of incentives, to keep their fund active and profitable. And we cannot keep changing the rules for superannuation; otherwise, people will lose confidence in the super funds and they will elect to invest their money elsewhere. I want to know where 'elsewhere' is, because I would be very interested in that! But, as I said, at the moment super funds are not returning good results. Even the hit we took last week gave another knock to the super funds. It gets over one hurdle and there is another. On small business, there was no reduction in taxation from 30 per cent to 29 per cent, which small business was promised. I know those opposite said that we did not support that. What we did not support was a mining tax. The reduction in tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent for small business was put into that one package. The coalition did not support the mining tax but we did support the drop in tax for small companies from 30 to 29 per cent. It is still very hard for small business to borrow money from banks. I do not think the banks at the moment are confident of Australia's future. When it comes to a small business borrowing from banks-as you know, any business generally always has to borrow to get going-now they must have a cash flow backed by assets. It is not that easy. A lot of people with assets but no cash flow go to banks and they get knocked back. When you see companies like Retravision and Reed Constructions-a big construction company in New South Wales and Queensland-go into receivership owing their workers and contractors a lot of money-over $100 million-then things are not right. I know that some small businesses are badly run but we are not helping them with 16,000 new regulations being introduced in the 43rd Parliament. As the previous speaker mentioned, we should have a war on red tape. I do not think that has been addressed properly. There has been a lot of hearsay but it has not been addressed properly at this stage. Big business faces a high Australian dollar, the carbon tax, the MRRT, uncertain global markets, high wages, poor productivity and increased input costs. Investments overseas are becoming more attractive to big industries. I know Vale and those big companies have set up shop in places like Mozambique. Our coal-fired power stations-there are three of them in Central Queensland-are under the hammer if the Greens get their way. Cement Australia cannot compete with a Chinese competitor coming in and our aluminium industry faces huge stockpiles around the world. The European and Chinese economies are very uncertain. We had a big hiccup last week in China. It is still very unstable. If things go really bad in Europe that will flow back to China and then flow on to Australia. Our exports to that part of the world will surely suffer. In conclusion, the very fact that I have raised concerns about a fair share for Flynn shows why a royalties for regions scheme is very important. We need people to come to those regions and work. A man or a woman will not bring their spouse to these country towns unless we have certain facilities for them. This is not happening. If a woman wants to come to Emerald or Blackwater, she needs proper care if she or her family gets sick. They want to see good schools, good hospitals and good roads. These are the issues that face my electorate and I do not think a lot of them were addressed in the budget. That is why I oppose it. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (16:43): I rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20122013 and related legislation before the House and to the budget. The areas that I will concentrate on are health-one of the big issues, as always, in my area and with some much needed services and funding-and some of the capital expenditure on schools, roads and the regions, and the NDIS. I will start with health. The Friday before the budget was a great day in the Northern Rivers region because I was able to announce that there would be $60 million in fully budgeted federal funding towards a decent start on the long awaited stage 3 of redevelopment of Lismore Base Hospital. It is a project that the community has lobbied for for a long time. I have been leading that lobbying. Really, some of these things should have happened at state level and they had not-other things had happened but not that. Under the Health and Hospitals Fund, $475 million was prioritised to the region. The Lismore Base Hospital redevelopment went forward as a project and got through on its merit and we were able to get $60 million. It means that the emergency department will be able to get started. There are a few other areas, but the emergency department is very important. I feel good at being able to announce it. It was a pleasure to host the federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek. She was with me at the Lismore Base Hospital. As well as thanking her I also thanked the previous health minister, Nicola Roxon, who recognised my efforts to keep this vital health infrastructure project on track. I have got many health services in my seat of Page but Lismore Base Hospital is a key referral hospital. From that perspective it can be seen as a national priority. So the redevelopment is a great win for the community, health planners, doctors, nurses, support staff and even our local newspaper, the Northern Star, who worked on that campaign as well. They all worked with me and with the community towards securing this funding breakthrough. I was also proud that, as a result of my strong lobbying for other things in the community, some additional money was granted, with $2.5 million in federal funding going to St Vincents Private Hospital in Lismore, a hospital that for a long time has sat alongside our public hospitals delivering complementary services. That money will go towards building two new operating theatres for general, neurological and ophthalmic surgery and relocating and refurbishing an existing endoscopy suite. The hospital also put in some money-it was a halfhalf situation. There was a trifecta of health announcements, with $4.3 million in federal funding to build a new community health centre in Yamba. That will offer outpatient clinics and facilities, and mental health and dental services. I want to pay special tribute in this place-I have done so publicly-to Yamba based health advocate Jim Agnew OAM. He has for many years led the community campaign for this much needed facility, which will be a base for community nurses working in the Lower Clarence. Since my election in 2007 I have had many meetings with Jim. I strongly lobbied both health ministers-firstly Minister Roxon and then Minister Plibersek-in order to keep the project on the radar for federal support. It had huge support locally. Bless Jim: he had even drawn up his own plans. I used to say, 'Jim, really, we need to leave that to the health experts,' but he drew up his own plans as well. I have to say he has done well. He has learned a lot about health over the years. He previously lobbied for the ambulance station. That was something he had turned his mind to. That went on for years and when we got it he turned his mind to the community health centre, and we worked together tirelessly on that. Minister Plibersek, our health minister, was in my electorate, so to make the most of the visit I took her to Grafton Base Hospital, where the redevelopment is going on. A lot of it is done but there is still some underway. Twenty-nine million dollars is going into that project, $4 million of which came from the previous state government. After that, the health minister officially opened the $5 million Grafton GP superclinic. Both of those projects were major election commitments of mine, so it was very pleasing and exciting, and it was just wonderful for the local community. In speaking on health, I also want to talk about the dental announcements that were in the budget. I was so pleased to see the money that was announced, the way it has been divvied up and the number of areas it is covering. First of all, there was $345.9 million for the public dental waiting list. According to the national dental advisory council, that will address the current 400,000 people on waiting lists around the country. Then there was the $10.5 million for oral health promotion, to develop a national oral health promotion plan, and funding of $35.7 million for expansion of the Voluntary Dental Graduate Year Program. That is a really good program, because that will offer up to 100 places per annum to increase the dental workforce to be able to deliver more dental services through a national scheme. Also, there is the funding available for the rural and remote infrastructure and relocation grants for dentists. That is an important project, because we have seen that work with local GP clinics in our areas. We have seen it all over Australia. There is no reason why that should not operate as well for dental practices. So it is good that that is in there. Then there was funding of $450,000 for non-government organisations to coordinate further pro bono work by dentists. There are a lot of dentists who are providing that wonderful work pro bono, but it does require administration. There is always a cost with administration, just to organise it and make sure it flows properly. So that money there to facilitate that is really helpful. It just means that that project can continue and those dentists who provide that pro bono work will be able to do that without that extra cost. It is good to see these things happening, particularly in my region. I see them in other regions in Australia, but obviously for me as the member for Page it is great to see them happening in my electorate. They are things that we work for and that I worked for-and worked with the community for, because when I work on these projects I do not do it singlehandedly; I do it with the community in a sense of community. It just demonstrates that it is a real need and has that widespread support. That is really important, as everybody knows. As every member in this place knows, when we are lobbying it is really important to show that that support is always there. I want to talk a little bit now about the investment in the schools through the BER project. In the Page electorate, there has been an investment in schools as capital investment in new libraries, classrooms and halls. Quite a large number of the schools were able to get what I call some of those extras. They were very clever in the way that they were able to design and build those new buildings, being able to incorporate other uses into halls, extra rooms, walkways and all sorts of things. It has been really pleasing as I go around to the opening ceremonies and also the recognition ceremonies to see how creatively some of them were done. Also, I have been involved in quite a lot of them as they were being done and have been giving some assistance. Last FridayI was at two: one in Nymboida in the Clarence Valley and the other at St Joseph's Primary School, two different schools of different sizes. Nymboida is a small country school and a beautiful school. They even have their own chooks, their own eggs and things like that, so it is a delightful school. I saw what a difference it made by having a new room, a library, an interactive whiteboard and things like that. When I am in the schools I always ask the children what they think. The children tell you very honestly and openly exactly what they think of everything, so it is always good to get their feedback. They rattle off a whole a lot of things: 'It is better to be in,' 'We can put our books down,' 'We've got more books,' 'We've got the interactive whiteboard,' and 'It's just a nice building to be in.' It is better for the teachers. I was also at St Joseph's Primary School in South Grafton and opened that. Often, when I open them in the Catholic schools, the bishop is there to do a blessing. I just want to read a little bit here. The Diocese of Lismore-that is the diocese that handles the buildings; it is the diocese that covers the area across the North Coast and organised the BER project across the North Coast-also produced a report. It is a great report, and they highlight how everything worked and cover each project in each school. The then Director of Catholic Schools was Dr Anne Wenham. With the report she sent a letter to the Prime Minister. It said: Dear Ms Gillard… … … It is my pleasure to enclose a copy of the Diocese of Lismore Building the Education Revolution 20092012 Report. She went on to say that: … this Report is an important record of the response of parish school communities to the opportunities presented through the Building the Education Revolution program. This unprecedented funding of schools throughout Australia was a strategic and much appreciated investment in schools as well as a significant support for the local economy through employment opportunities. That is exactly what is was designed to be. It was stimulus money. It was to get the money out there into the community for the local economy and for employment, and it was an investment in our schools which will last way beyond the GFC. It worked, and I talk about that when I am in the schools. I say that that is what it was designed to do and that is what it did. It is so pleasing to get around the schools and see the result. In the report there is a covering statement from the Bishop of Lismore, Geoffrey Jarrett, and I will quote a few things from it. He starts off with: Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,Then Bishop Geoffrey goes on to sayFrom the outset I stipulated that BER funds be applied in a considered and equitable manner; He talked about the common good for each decision and said: A management system was then developed that was robust yet flexible with clear policy in key operating areas. He also said: The Commonwealth Government can be assured that the BER funds provided to the Diocese of Lismore have been put to good use. I can attest to that, having seen the investment and also read a lot of the documentation. He went on to say: … the Building the Education Revolution program has succeeded in providing Australian families with much needed school facilities and stimulating business activity in local areas. He further said: To all involved ""congratulations on a job well done!"" I say the same to everybody who has been involved in the BER program in all the schools. I know there was a lot of commentary about it, particularly in the Australian newspaper. I was involved behind the scenes, and when I went to the schools I saw that everybody was happy with having that investment in their school. Sometimes I read about issues with the BER, but they are things that happened with building projects. I have never seen a building project where you did not have to get the builder, the plumber or somebody else back to do something. That happens when you do things at home. You had to differentiate between what was happening when some people were talking about issues in schools. I saw some of that. It was a great project. I only have 20 seconds left, so I mention the NDIS and the statement that Minister Crean put out for stronger regions and a stronger nation. I am pleased to see some of the funds flowing to the regions and, as the minister says, with some of that mining boom coming to the regions. Treasurer and his comment about this budget. This is, indeed, a very Labor budget. With an elaborate system of smoke and mirrors this Labor government has managed to create an illusion of a wafer-thin budget surplus-for a couple of hours, at least. But do not underestimate the Australian people. They know full well that Labor has cooked the books here. Costs have been shuffled out of next year, shuffled into this year and shuffled into the following year. In some cases, such as the NBN, they have shuffled clean off the deck. There has been more shuffling going on than with the three-card-trick hustler in Vegas. What the Australian people cottoned onto very quickly is that splashing money around in a blatant attempt to buy votes and to compensate for the carbon tax actually achieves nothing at all. They understand that cooking the books does not actually make anything better. I am no fan of cooking the books, but a guy as big as me is a fan of baking pies, and I know a fair bit about pies. No matter how you slice a pie, I know you are still going to run out of pie at some stage. The concept of creating a bigger pie so there is more to go around is lost on this government. For four years the government has tried to make a bigger pie by borrowing more pie from overseas, but sooner or later it has to be paid back. Already the interest is eating into our pie, and what this government has done is to commit the Australian people and their children to years of financial pain, as it will be they who have to pay it all back. If you dish out pie so you can collect pie just to dish out more pie, as this government is doing with",224,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
263,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (16:59,"Strangely, I find myself agreeing with thethe carbon tax, all you are actually doing is circulating the same pieces of pie, and every time it changes hands another piece of it falls on the floor. Labor is incapable of making the pie bigger, but it is truly world class when it comes to wasting it. Let us not forget the Greens' influence. If there is one thing that the Greens hate, it is anyone with a bigger slice of the pie. They do not care how they got the big piece. They do not care if they baked it themselves, worked long and hard, mortgaged their house to buy the oven and gave almost half their pie to the government; they still end up with a big piece, and the Greens absolutely hate it. Now it seems the Australian Labor Party hate it too. They want to take the big piece of pie from that hard worker and give it to everyone else, not because they want everyone else to have more pie but because they just do not want anyone to have a big piece of pie. That is not socialism; that is just pie envy. Taking the incentive away from the bakers of this country, most of whom are in regional Australia, is a recipe for a smaller pie. My constituents in Dawson can vouch for that, because they are the bakers. The Mackay region and the adjacent mining region around Mackay are the bakery of this economy-of this pie. But Labor is shredding their hope for the future. Labor is stealing their reward for hard work. Labor is robbing them of the opportunity to create wealth for the nation. Families in the Mackay region are paying the high price of creating that wealth. They pay exorbitant rent. They pay more for their fuel. They pay more for their groceries. They work long hours at shift work, often living away from home and the family. They have access to fewer services-health services, recreational services and things that capital city MPs in this place take for granted. Yet they are penalised because they have that bigger slice of the pie. What these people expect to see in the budget is funding for infrastructure and for those services that others take for granted-facilities like the Mackay Showgrounds, which have begun a long, arduous and expensive redevelopment into what we hope will become a regional entertainment precinct. It is being done with funds raised through the community and some funding from the Queensland government. In regional centres like Mackay, the showground is a critical piece of infrastructure because it is where the community comes together. It is where events like the major Queensland Mining and Engineering Exhibition connect people and organisations that help drive our economy. But we did not see specific funding for the show grounds in this budget. The people of my region do not deserve to be ignored and forgotten, as with the long-lost Labor promise of a GP superclinic. Labor promised it and Labor has not delivered it for the Mackay region. It is 20 months since the promise was made, and we have not heard a peep about funding for Mackay's GP superclinic. But I would like to talk briefly on another project that I and concerned locals will no doubt have to fight hard to see delivered. The Blacks Beach spit is an area of coastal land with important environmental qualities that will be destroyed if it is allowed to be developed. As a councillor on the Mackay Regional Council, I lobbied for the council to purchase the Blacks Beach spit to ensure that that area was protected. It is time for this Labor-Greens government to return some of the funds to the economy's engine room, the Mackay region, so it can make a genuine, real investment in the environment. So the Mackay community actually did not get much in this budget, especially when you compare it to the electorates of Lyne, New England and Denison. It is funny, that! It seems that to get any investment in our community of Mackay it takes the whole effort of the community. In that vein I would like to commend the team of people who helped fight for a headspace youth mental health centre for Mackay, a facility so badly needed in a town where social disadvantage adds further fuel to a suicide rate that is just so unacceptable. Mackay was promised a headspace, with the funding to happen sometime in 2013, and I want to put the government on notice here that I want to see those funds starting to flow from the first day in January. I fought very hard for this centre, so did our daily newspaper, the Daily Mercury, and so did Sandi Winner, then from the Mental Illness Fellowship of North Queensland. There was also a collaboration of other local mental health workers, GPs and youth organisations. What the people of Mackay find especially perplexing, though, is this government's reluctance to invest money back into other parts of the economy that are actually producing the money for the nation. Continued ignorance of this economic fundamental absolutely will result in a shrinking economy and a smaller pie for everyone. There is no point sending truckloads of money from Central Queensland and North Queensland to Canberra if there is no road for the trucks. This budget's neglect of the Bruce Highway is an absolute insult to Central Queenslanders and North Queenslanders who drive, or try to drive, on that highway on a daily basis. They know that congestion around Mackay is absolutely out of control. They know that they have never seen so many potholes before in their lives. They know that they had to pay a flood levy out of their own pockets to get repairs done on that road. During the recent Queensland election, the new premier, Campbell Newman, actually committed $1 billion to the state controlled but federally funded Bruce Highway. And what did Labor put in the budget for the Bruce Highway? What new thing did they put in this budget for the Bruce Highway? I can tell you: it was nothing. There was no new money for the Bruce. We did not need less investment in infrastructure, we needed more. We need funding for the duplication of local access streets into Mackay's industrial hub of Paget. A huge increase in heavy traffic servicing the resource sector has had such an impact on roads like Connors Road, Paradise Street and Milton Street, which are the main roads into the industrial centre, that the lacework of potholes actually joined up and the bitumen disappeared. Former Mackay Regional Council mayor, Col Meng, put a duplication of this road on his wish list to state and federal governments, and I am inclined to believe that such infrastructure is absolutely essential. I think we should be doing that for Connors Road, Milton Street and Paradise Street. And as much as this Labor government thinks it is spreading the wealth of the mining boom around by throwing money at people for no return, it is actually missing the point. Some of that wealth needs to be reinvested in future wealth and to creating that bigger pie. Just as importantly, if you want to talk about a two-speed economy, why are you not investing wealth poached from the mining sector into the sectors that actually are struggling? For instance, tourism in my electorate in the Whitsundays is on its knees. After weathering this barrage of natural disasters and associated damage to its image the industry actually faces now a high Australian dollar, and that drives tourists overseas. But in addition, this budget increases the passenger movement charge from $47 to $55 per passenger and it reduces Tourism Australia's budget by 6.2 per cent-or, in real terms, $8 million. It passed on the $118.1 million in costs related to the Australian Federal Police security in airports, which will actually go on to increase ticket costs. And on top of that, in just 39 days from today, I think, our tourism industry will be slugged with a carbon tax. I note that Cruise Whitsundays, which is an operator in my electorate, estimates additional costs of $770,000 over just three years as a direct result of the carbon tax and what it will do to marine diesel. Tourism is an export industry, and I note that the government has moved to compensate other export industries for the carbon tax. So why not the tourism industry? Why does the Labor-Greens government hate tourism? Why does it not extend the regional investment and innovation fund to the Whitsundays, or areas like Cairns, where tourism is vital to the local economy and employment? That fund currently operates in the Illawarra, the south-east of South Australia and in Tasmania-all good Labor heartlands. But why not the Whitsundays or Cairns, where tourism is weathering the perfect storm and people are actually losing jobs? From my perspective, I am actually not convinced the fund is the best means of assisting industry, but that is the Labor way. That is how Labor deals with regional downturns, so if they are doing it in the Illawarra then they can do it for the Whitsundays and Cairns. I prefer to advocate for a different method of help. One of the ideas that have been put to me is a domestic holiday tax break to encourage Australians to holiday at home. Costs would be incurred as a result of keeping money in Australia, which helps. Profits would be made as a result of keeping money in Australia, and that helps to offset the cost. But helping industry and encouraging growth, development and contribution are not in Labor's repertoire. Labor's modus operandi is industrial terrorism. While most Australians understand that our economic prosperity is underpinned by mining, Labor and the Greens have focused on undermining. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the Greens have undermined our future. They have undermined mining itself. They undermine the resources sector with the mining tax. They have undermined exporters with the carbon tax. They have undermined investment and productivity with red and green tape. We saw with the Abbot Point multicargo facility-which carried the hopes and dreams of so many North Queenslanders, families and residents of Bowen-that they stalled it for 17 months, with the application gathering dust on the Federal environment minister's desk. The extreme Greens, whose mission in life is to stop anyone from making money, enlisted the help of a herd of extreme left-wing organisations and rabid environmental groups, using deceitful tactics to prevent any kind of development they could. Their mission was to kill the very industry that creates the money that this government funds them with. It does fund them through the tax-deductibility status that a lot of them have. These are groups that were supporting and bankrolling a campaign to bring Abbot Point to its knees. It seems to me that this government is adept at shooting itself in the foot by aligning itself with these people, as it has in this parliament. It is time we reviewed the register of tax-deductibility for these extreme environmental groups and struck off any organisation whose operations are not in the best interests of the Australian people. This government continually says one thing and does something so completely different. It says it wants to protect the environment and invest in renewables. If that is the case, why is this government-especially the Greens-not backing a national ethanol mandate? They want us to use renewables, but they cannot afford to be seen to be adopting coalition policy like direct action. Ethanol is a known and proven technology. A national ethanol mandate would secure the future of the proposed ethanol plant in the Burdekin and also the operating plant we have in Sarina. Australia currently produces less than 50 per cent of the oil that it consumes, and dependency on exports is expected to reach 80 per cent by 2030. While I acknowledge the retention of the ethanol excise rebate, the problem is that there is no stability in terms of demand. It will no doubt come back to the state government to maintain diversity for sugar by bringing in a state-based mandate. I think an incremental introduction could be achieved by introducing a regional mandate from Bundaberg north. One area north of my electorate is Townsville. The government is determined to trash the Labor brand in that area. Townsville is actually home to the 3rd Brigade and the 11th Brigade at Lavarack Barracks, as well as 10 FSB and the RAAF base at Garbutt. On their behalf, I have a message for the Prime Minister. North Queensland is immensely proud of its Defence Force, as is the rest of the nation. Men and women in the armed forces devote their life to this country. They earn our respect and they always have, yet we have had almost $5½ billion cut from defence while our soldiers are overseas serving. It was disgraceful. The Prime Minister and the defence minister were in Townsville on the weekend. There was a welcome home parade, but they could not bring themselves to attend it, even though they were down the road waiting in a hangar for a plan to take off that afternoon. They could have attended it. The Prime Minister and this government have done nothing for our servicemen and servicewomen in the past. This Labor government is almost worse than the Taliban for the ADF, and the cuts are testament to that fact. (Time expired) Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (17:14): I rise to speak on Appropriations Bill (No. 1) 20122013 and related bills. As the member representing the electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast, I fully support this legislation and the budget it supports. It is a Labor budget that reveals Labor values. It is all about spreading the benefit of the boom to all corners of our country-to families and to small businesses in particular. It will return us to surplus and allow the Reserve Bank all the room needed to cut interest rates if they need to. This is a critical budget for Australia and it is a great thing that we have a Labor government right now making sure we continue the excellent work that was undertaken during the global financial crisis. I say that it is a Labor budget that reveals Labor values. There is considerable literature about what happens to people's values responses when they hit a crisis situation. It is very clear to the Australian public now that when the GFC hit Australia Labor reverted to our values. We kept Australia working. We kept Australians learning. In this budget, we have made sure that, while we have been extremely fiscally responsible and cut $33 billion to enable us to come back to that surplus, we have stayed true to the things that we believe in. We have continued to support jobs. We have continued to support and enable economic growth because we believe in Australia's capacity to innovate and be successful in industry and business in this sort of climate. We believe in families, we believe in education and we believe in health. All these things are in the budget and we are funding to support growth and the necessary development in those areas. One of the things that is very troubling at this time in politics in Australia is the incredible gap between what really happens here in Canberra and what gets reported in the gossipscandal cycle. Of course, we should shine a light on all elements of the parliament. But when we look at the budget, when we shine the light carefully on that, we see what the real things are that this Labor government is doing for Australia. There are so many good things to flow into the life of our community, to the families in my seat and to the families in the seats of the other members here in this chamber, to those who employ so many people, our small businesses, and to young people, who need education, support in to work and training. There is money in our budget to support the aged and infirm who need care and healing. All of these things are within the budget and vitally important to communities such as mine. Our Labor budget is a budget in globally uncertain economic times. It delivers essential infrastructure and services as well as help for families and households who need it because we understand the real lives of ordinary Australians. This is a budget that brings the benefits of the mining boom to the doorstep of the Central Coast. The resources sector is not a pillar of the Central Coast economy but, thanks to the Labor government, we in Robertson will reap the benefits of our nation's mining wealth. There will be benefits for locals from Kariong, Springfield and Erina who will access the wealth of this mining boom through Family Tax Benefit PartA payments which will see an increase of $600 for more than 10,000 families in the seat of Robertson alone. Benefits from the mining boom include a supplementary allowance for more than 9,100 young people, single parents and unemployed people in Robertson. This is real money for real people, delivered by a Labor government that accepts the responsibility of moving all Australians forward together and not leaving some behind. We understand that people who need a hand to pay for essential services like electricity, gas and water will benefit from money that is flowing to them from this budget not only because they need it to help them manage their lives but also because it is a sense of belief in their capacity. It is looking after those who might have fallen on hard times until they are able to pick themselves up and move on. Singles are going to receive a supplementary allowance of $210, while couples will receive $350. In addition, we are investing in our kids. The schoolkids bonus, which I can hardly believe the opposition voted against, will provide assistance to about 1.3 million Australian families, with about 2.2 million Australian children ready to be advantaged by this. This bonus, which we absolutely believe parents will be well and truly able to spend in their own child's interests, will pay for things such as uniforms, school shoes, textbooks, stationery and camps. As a former teacher, I can tell you what a relief it will be to teachers across this nation. The parents of children who once upon a time would have been coming to school looking for a little bit extra to be able to go on an excursion because their parents were so disadvantaged that they were unable to have the money in the bank to help their kids will now be able to allocate funds to ensure that their children do not miss out on the vital learning that happens when you take a school group of kids on an excursion. This is not a small amount of money, and it is a significant investment in parents, who are going to have $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in secondary school. Because the payment is made up-front and is automatic, it is quite different from the education tax refund. Parents do not need to keep receipts anymore. They will have this guaranteed payment up-front so that they can have the money and plan for spending it appropriately on their kids. Already, in schools in my electorate, principals are speaking with one another about how they might be able to provide some financial guidance to parents about the things that are on the horizon. Kids who once upon a time could never have thought of going on an overseas excursion with their class-to the Western Front, for example, to go and see where our soldiers died; an enrichment learning opportunity to understand their history and the history of the world-can begin to think that maybe it is possible for them. For the first time, this is going to happen for many, many young people. Parents will receive the full amount every time. So families will not miss out if they lose receipts, as has happened in the past. Importantly, this bonus, which will come to families as of 20 June this year, will continue in the new year, being paid in two amounts: at the beginning of the year, in term 1, and then again in the middle of the year, in term 3, which is usually when I find that the school shoes start to wear and the books start to look a little ratty, and when, if they have been working very hard, they need replacement texts to go on with. There are also changes of courses that happen for students in the middle of the year. I also think that the amount of $820 to help parents with bringing up a teenager is a really significant help in communicating to the kids the value of education-to say to them, 'The government believes in you; they believe in you so much that they are going to give us $820 to help you get through school.' If the kids are anything like my teenagers and the teenagers I have spent so much of my life teaching, I am pretty sure that they will be watching to make sure that they get their fair share of that $820 and directing the way in which it might go. As for other important efforts that have been made in this budget to make sure that all Australians move forward together, I turn now to the real infrastructure that we are supporting. We are really committed to making sure that communities such as mine are able to go on with developing things in the community. So, in my local area, key projects such as the Macmasters Beach surf club upgrade, the $2 million Ettalong Beach foreshore redevelopment project, the Umina surf club upgrade, and the refurbishment of the Coast Community Centre in Gosford, known to locals as Coast Shelter, were all funded in this budget. These are projects that I have worked hard alongside the community to deliver, and they have a commitment from this government that those funds will be paid. That will change the lives of all of the members of the community who interact with those services and places of gathering in the seat of Robertson. Through this budget, delivering on the commitments to my local community and extending them, community infrastructure support funds will be given to Gosford council in the amount of $1.808 million from the Gillard government through the Roads to Recovery program. This is an important grant for the council to assist with the maintenance and upgrade of local roads through the Roads to Recovery program. There is also the $5.5 million allocated to progressing the Gosford passing loops as part of the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor upgrade. Also, as we know, the delivery of a dedicated line for rail freight north of Sydney will certainly help improve the reliability of the passenger rail networks for Central Coast commuters. It is frustrating enough that workers travelling from the Central Coast to Sydney spend dozens of hours a week on trains supposedly running on time; they certainly do not need the added inconvenience of a freight train breaking down and causing delays on the passenger line. In relation to infrastructure, perhaps the most significant point in the budget for the Central Coast is the $150 million contribution by the Gillard government towards the F3-M2 missing link, as well as the offer to the NSW state government of $25 million to establish a special purpose vehicle which would bring financing of the F3-M2 project to the market. This project is long overdue, especially for the suffering Central Coast road users who travel to Sydney's west or beyond on a regular basis, either to places of employment or to do their business. The allocation by the government puts the ball squarely back in the court of Barry O'Farrell in the New South Wales state government. Barry O'Farrell and his Central Coast Liberal representatives have been extremely coy on this issue. If they are going to walk away from the federal government's money then they need to stand up and say that to the local community. They need to look the community in the eye and explain why, currently, they refuse to support the F3-M2 missing link. This is not just a project for road commuters; it is a project that will improve the productivity of the Central Coast business community and make the Central Coast so much more accessible to people who want to come for holidays. Any local business who moves goods or supplies in and out of Sydney or through Sydney to the south of the state has a huge stake in seeing this project delivered. Every time you see a truck bound for the Central Coast stuck in gridlock on Pennant Hills Road, all you see is productivity essentially washing down the drain. While the New South Wales Liberal government dithers on this issue, the Labor government is continuing to invest in business innovation. Over the coming years more than $1.2 billion in grants will be available for industry through clean technology programs for manufacturers to improve their efficiency and competitiveness. I am very pleased to inform the House that businesses in Robertson have received more than $3.8 million from Auslndustry since 2007. And, since 2007, Labor has supported 51 programs promoting business innovation in Robertson, totalling $1.87 million. A further five manufacturing programs have received assistance totalling more than $1.2 million. We had the most amazing innovation summit just last week, with my local community delighted that the NBN is rolling out in our area. That, again, is another transformer of the community-a sound, productive investment by this Labor government. More than 15,600 small businesses exist on the Central Coast. We put $27.5 million into business advisory services, and our local business advisory service will stay alive and active. We are also providing a $6,500 instant asset write-off for eligible small businesses to help with cash flow and promote investment in pieces of equipment that are essential to the success of small business and to improving their productivity. We have also put in a loss carry-back scheme. In 2012-13 companies will be able to carry back tax losses of up to $1 million so that they get a refund against the tax they have previously paid. From 2013-14 companies will be able to carry back tax losses for two years, and that will provide a tax benefit of up to $300,000. This will certainly help companies to finance the investment, training and restructuring that is needed to improve their competitiveness, and this will certainly support productivity and promote employment. At the core of this Labor budget is a budget for people, including support in the form of increased and improved health services, such as the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. In my electorate, 18.9 per cent of people are over the age of 60, and they stand to benefit from that. Labor will also deliver a $500 million blitz on dental care. The COAG agreements have seen $21 million go to the GP helpline. I have got a $28 million regional cancer clinic and a $21.5 million investment in bringing back the rehab unit. This budget is a proud Labor budget. It is a budget that will make a difference to the people of the Central Coast. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired) lost. Rather than promoting growth and providing opportunity, it has delivered savage cuts",234,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
264,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (17:29,"This budget can only be described as an opportunityand broken promises. It has failed to do much to improve productivity. Incredibly, the deficit has soared to $44 billion for this year, and $200 million will be cut from job service programs just when the economic outlook is so uncertain. Families are struggling with the rising costs of living and business confidence is at an all-time low. There are no coherent strategies to deliver economic growth and no agenda to tackle the structural problems that remove barriers to workforce participation. In workplace relations, the pendulum has now swung too far, with unions back in the driver's seat. Our national airline was crippled by protracted disputes going unresolved until the extraordinary shutdown of the airline propelled the government to take control. BHP has experienced 3,200 industrial episodes in the Bowen Basin alone and the union works on a threatening, stop-start process, where it begins an action and then calls it off. Historically, unions have been pivotal to improving the lot of workers, but we must be wary of allowing the pendulum to swing too far. Our collective concerns should rest primarily with the right of workers to a fair wage and decent and safe working conditions. We cannot allow our enterprises to be held to ransom and we cannot continue to sanction action which sees a doubling of the number of lost working days due to industrial disputes, as the ABS reported for the period of 2010-11. In these troubled financial times, we need people with clear heads and fair minds that can end the adversarial mindset between industry and unions. I noted the OECD's qualified confidence in the direction of Australia's financial management, which was reported in today's Australian. However, there are also warnings. There is an acknowledgement that Australia will rely mainly on the mining sector to meet its growth forecast. Personally, while as a member from Western Australia. I certainly recognise the mining sector's contribution, I believe we should be working harder to diversify our economy and concentrate on lifting our productivity. Lifting productivity requires a long-term strategy. The US economist Paul Krugman said: Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker. The key elements to lifting productivity are health and education. The average level of human capital, which refers to the skills and knowledge of individual workers and their ability to use them, is a critical element of productivity. Some earlier studies comparing Australia's low productivity to that of the United States suggest that it is due to the fact that the average level of schooling in the working age population in Australia is about half a year lower than that of the US. The conclusion is that, had Australia achieved similar average years of schooling to the United States over this period, Australia's gross domestic product might have been around two to three per cent higher than was recorded. While recently the government has spent big on overpriced school halls, we missed the opportunity to spend where it really counts. That is on the best teacher education money can buy, including continuing in-service training and the retention of students in the education and training system, with a strong emphasis on science and technology training and education. While I note that we have given massive handouts to businesses, including $275 million to General Motors, $100 million to BlueScope Steel and $64 million to OneSteel, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, DSTO, funding has again been cut despite an election promise in 2010 that they would receive an extra $138 million in the funding period between 2011-12 and 2012-13. Their budget will in fact be reduced by just over $22 million in that period up to 2013. Although $54 million has gone to encourage studies in maths and science, about $40 million of that will be clawed back in increased HECS fees for students of maths and science. It seems to me that this budget has a lot of pea and thimble tricks incorporated into it. While there has been a token increase the science and technology research, some of the very top science programs and organisations have been scrapped or had their funding scrapped. One of the key ways that we could lift productivity in this country is to remove the barriers to employment for those who are not working and who are currently relying on government pensions, so I was dismayed at the cruel result in the budget on single parentsand it is really cruel. I find it sickening. I heard the Treasurer, in his Press Club speech, talk about the difficult job of raising children and how it is the most important thing that most families do. So why does this government propose to move single parents from a social security pension to a Newstart allowance? They will have to somehow pay rent, food, utilities, fuel and schoolbooks on $265 a week, or $38 a day. I would like everyone in this place to try and live on that. Such a cruel and unjustified move was not enough to bring the budget into surplus, so the government is also cutting the extra payment designed to help people gain skills or support to study in order to improve their financial prospects and to gain employment. Cutting this benefit will consign single parents raising children to the lowest-paid jobs in society, as they simply cannot afford to upskill or to gain a university degree. Rather than supporting people to gain financial independence, the government is perpetuating the cycle of poverty and reliance on welfare so that it can claim it is delivering a surplus. It seems strange logic. This is a policy that is unjust beyond belief, and I will not support any legislation that seeks to enshrine these measures in legislation in this place. In the end it is not just single parents who are affected, because we all live together in society and this can only perpetuate cycles of poverty that give rise to many of the social problems we are all affected by today. As a parent I wholeheartedly agree that raising children is the most important mission that we have, and an incredibly difficult task. So why would the government take $60 a week off 100,000 single parents when their youngest child turns eight, when some of the most challenging years of child rearing lie ahead? I just listened to the member for Robertson talking about how schools might pool together and use the benefits that the government is now paying to families out in the community; that they might go to the Western Front with this money. I can say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these kids of single parents will not be having any holidays, and they will not be doing any school excursions because their parents will barely be able to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table and in their mouths and clothe them. That is a fact. Compounding the problem for those on low incomes in this country, particularly single parents, is the lack of affordable housing. I would draw the attention of this House to the rental affordability snapshot report by Anglicare, because it makes very sobering reading. The other component to a productive nation, though, is health. Very often this is also linked very strongly to those families who are on low incomes and who are struggling. They are struggling to eat healthy food and they are struggling to go to the doctor for a health check-up. So health is also very important to all of us, and last month I had the extraordinary privilege of being a guest of Novo Nordisk at the European Diabetes Leadership Forum. Australia was invited as a member of the OECD. Novo Nordisk is a world leader in diabetes care, and it employs some 30,000 people in 74 countries around the world, including Australia. Corporate social responsibility is at the foundation of all that it does, and in this respect no stone was left unturned to bring the world's leading researchers and clinicians to address this forum. I do thank the managing director in Australia, Petter Solberg, for affording me the opportunity to participate in this outstanding forum. The theme of the forum was 'Today, we can change tomorrow'. The outcomes of the forum are the subject of a draft document-the Copenhagen Roadmap. This builds on the United Nations Resolution 61/225 on diabetes, to which Australia was a signatory, as well as a recent political declaration of the 2011 UN high-level meeting on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. The concluding summary of the forum determined that good health equals wealth and that without a strong national policy to put diabetes and associated non-communicable diseases at the forefront, the increasing debt burden threatens to cripple both developed and developing countries. Diabetes is a silent killer which is a leading cause of major complications such as blindness, limb amputation, cardiovascular disease and renal failure, just to name a few of the complications. This can mean a person must retire prematurely from the workforce. It may mean that another member of the family must leave the workforce to care for them. There is a personal cost attached to the difficulties of people with diabetes as well as a national cost. Undetected and untreated, the malevolent march of diabetes will require a higher cost of intervention. It is important to note that the highest costs associated with diabetes are for the treatment of complications rather than the initial cost of medication that may help to keep a person well. As obesity is one of the key drivers of diabetes and indeed of non-communicable diseases, I refer members to the excellent paper presented by the OECD called Obesity update 2012. This paper highlights the costs associated with diabetes and the complications that may keep people out of the workforce and ultimately affect our national productivity. The clinical based evidence presented in the forum once again highlights the urgent need for Australia to restate its commitment to a national diabetes plan and for that plan to be properly resourced so that we can prevent the escalation of diabetes. Unchecked and untreated diabetes threatens individual quality of life, it threatens the financial stability of individuals and families and it becomes an increasing cost burden on the nation. It is a great concern to me that, although we have had over many years strong bipartisan support for making diabetes a national priority, that seems to have slipped in recent years. One of the programs that we worked hard to fund was the insulin pump program, particularly for children. That has gone through at least one review that I am aware of to make it more accessible. That program seems to have had cuts applied to it in the budget. I met today with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's national Chief Executive Officer, Mike Wilson. He tells me that currently they are providing about 15 pumps a month for children with type 1 diabetes. They are very important for people who have brittle diabetes-that is, diabetes that cannot be treated in the normal way. The government is going to severely limit the number of these pumps that can be provided on the subsidised program to about 50 or 60 a year. This in no way will meet the current demand and it certainly is not providing best practice medicine for children in this country who, sadly, live with the serious impact of type 1 diabetes in their lives. Finally, I would commend the House to read the full report on the Copenhagen Roadmap and to read the OECD report on obesity and diabetes. (Time expired) slinging and dirt, we should remind ourselves where we are as a nation. If any of you look at the two books that have been published on this subject at the moment, The Australian Moment by George Megalogenis or The Sweet Spot by Peter Hartcher, it is difficult to believe that Australia is in such strong circumstances, that we are so highly thought of all over the world, that we enjoy the best lifestyle, the most human rights and are some of the happiest people on the planet. Looking into the Australian parliament, that has descended into a pit of acrimony since the current Leader of the Opposition took over and since we have had the unfortunate circumstances of a hung parliament and a minority government, you would never understand that reality. I actually give those two books to foreign dignitaries, not just as a patriot but as a person who is very proud of the economic reforms that Australia has undertaken and the tolerant lifestyle that we have; the determination of people here to see that people of all backgrounds get on and, as the great Martin Luther King said, judge people by the content of their character, not by the colour of their skin. Australia is one of only four countries whose economy has grown since 2009. The others are South Korea, Poland and Israel. We have 4.8 per cent unemployment-the lowest unemployment rate in the industrialised world. Our interest rates are lower than at any time under the previous government. As the Treasurer said the other day, people are saving $1,300 a year compared to the interest rates under the last period of the previous government. Our growth rate is projected at 3.1 per cent. Our projected budget surplus is $1.5 billion due to measures that the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Expenditure Review Committee took-to cut very severely $44 billion to achieve it. We have 3.2 per cent economic growth, less than five per cent unemployment and a budget surplus-other countries would kill for these circumstances. When you look at the poor people of Greece or Spain-even our friends in the United States, with eight or nine per cent unemployment-they marvel at Australia. Of course we have been the beneficiaries of the mineral boom. But look at the sordid front page of any of the newspapers-and I have to agree with the Acting Speaker about the Murdoch press-you would never recognise the country that we live in. People overseas, as I say, just marvel at what a great country Australia is. The OECD report today-that Australia is set to grow at the fastest pace in the developed world and that the combined debt of Australia, state and federal, is the lowest of any member nation of the OECD-says that Australia is expected to grow more strongly than every single major developed advanced economy over the next two years. As the Treasurer announced in question time. I do not think any members of the opposition listened to it-we have 9.6 per cent of debt to GDP, again the lowest in the world. The Italians have 100 per cent and Japan 200 per cent of debt to GDP, yet we have all of these siren calls from the member for North Sydney and the member for Goldstein about the level of debt that Australia has. In 2008 this Labor government, like all governments at the time, was faced with a global financial crisis.",241,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
265,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (17:44,"Amid all of the political noise, rancour, mudThe crisis sent the share market crashing and caused 25 per cent unemployment in Spain-it is actually 50 per cent in some places in Spain, especially among young people. In Barcelona, 50 per cent of people under 30 are unemployed. It crippled the United States and caused growth to slow in Japan and South Korea-our strong trading partners. In short, no corner of the globe was spared from the crisis. Here in Australia, yes, we were left a surplus by the previous government, but armed with the right policy and the will to act, Labor ensured that the Australian people did not feel the adverse effects of the financial meltdown. The member for Lilley has been recognised by Euromoney magazine and virtually all serious financial commentators around the world as having done a splendid job in steering Australia through the GFC, continuing to run tight budgets, keeping the pressure on interest rates down and seeing that Australia continues to proposer through this period. If Australia had not done that, we would have faced a very different and stark economic reality here at home. Where government can help, it should. The budget delivered two weeks ago continues the tradition of ensuring everyone benefits from a strong and prosperous nation. I note the strong changes in public opinion on the mining tax, and that underlines the fact that everyone wants to benefit from a strong and prosperous nation, not just some of our oligarchs who are fortunate enough to be in charge of large empires that are involved in mining. This government has introduced historic pension reforms, the biggest in 100 years of the pension. We have passed and implemented a historic paid paternal leave scheme without increasing taxation. I do share the frustration expressed by Minister Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, on Insiders that the coalition, who now complain about the government not implementing the company tax legislation, said that they were going to oppose it in the Senate with the Greens. Of course we should be cutting the rate of taxation on companies in Australia to the levels of our neighbours in East Asia, but we cannot do that if a bloody-minded coalition wants to vote with the Greens. They are doing similar things with their hypocritical attitude on the so-called Malaysian option that we have. Here we have the coalition in bed with the Greens on opposing returning people to Malaysia who are asylum seekers but who may not qualify. They are again siding with the Greens on keeping the level of company tax up. On top of that they have got this absurd levy-a 1.7 per cent increase in company tax-that they are going to put through to fund a parental leave scheme that is principally designed to alter the attitude of women towards the Leader of the Opposition. He knows from polling that the female part of the population is critical in their attitude towards him. Even Blind Freddy could see that this scheme of his, funded by this absurd extra levy on business, is designed to affect his image. Labor has initiated the biggest infrastructure projects this country has ever seen: the National Broadband Network, sending engineers, construction workers and builders to work. We do this to ensure that the student living in the country can take his classes at home, online, without having to travel four hours to the nearest city, and to enable the entrepreneur to reach out to investors across the world with the touch of a button. The investment in school infrastructure was forgotten and neglected under previous Liberal governments. As we expand our population with our immigration program of 180,000 a year, of course we have got to do these kinds of things. I am sure every opposition member who has gone along to a BER opening that they decry so strongly in the House of Representatives has been happy to stand there at the opening. They understand that this is not a waste of money, that this has provided infrastructure that we absolutely need all around the country, because we have more children as a result not only of a natural increase in our population but above all by our strong immigration program, which I support. If the coalition were honest enough to continue their support of the program, they would be consistent and support the expenditure on the new facilities that the government has helped to build via the Building the Education Revolution program. This government has passed historic healthcare reform, including investment in dental health. This year's budget includes the good work of $3.7 billion investment into agedcare reform. I am particularly pleased to see aged-care reform and the impact it will have on benefiting residents in my electorate. We are implementing the first tranche of the National Disability Insurance Scheme-a first for Australia and a reform worthy of any government that has the appellation 'Labor' on it. In my electorate of Melbourne Ports, extra support has been given to lowand middleincome families. Four thousand local families will see increases in family payments of up to $600; 2,850 local families with kids at school will receive the schoolkids bonus, giving extra support to families who need it the most; and 6,331 young people-single parents and unemployed-who receive allowances will get extra support. We have seen the Clean Energy Bill aimed at reducing our carbon emissions, historic tax cuts to families and students, a further pension increase and assistance to single parents. The Liberal Party would see all of these increases ripped away. I know they love the term 'clawback'. They applaud it during question time when the minister uses that expression. They get very excited by it. But that is precisely what they would do. Their ridiculing of the schoolkids bonus was shameful in the sense that they said that parents would not use that money responsibly. Finally, I turn to one area of funding that I am particularly interested in, in my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and that is overseas representation and funding for DFAT. The budget announced the funding of a couple of new embassies and consul-generals in Senegal and China. That is a good development. In the past 20 years, our diplomatic corps has shrunk too much. We need to reresource DFAT. We have one of the lowest levels of overseas representation in the OECD. I know that the hate media of the Herald Sun, the Courier-Mail and the Daily Telegraph will denigrate this as 'tall poppies' wanting overseas trips. We are a big country; we are a confident country. We should have a proper level of representation overseas, befitting our size and our national interests, which are not simply those of Cabcharge journalists working for News Limited. Even with the two new embassies that have been put into the budget, we have only 97 missions. The OECD average is 150. We need to seriously look at assisting the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As my friend Dr Paul Monk has said, while the federal public service grew a whopping 25 per cent between 1996 and 2008, DFAT contracted by 11 per cent. Over the past 20 years, DFAT's diplomatic corps has shrunk by nearly 40 per cent, from 870 in 1989 to 537 in 2009. Although various amounts of money passed through DFAT for various purposes over the past decade, resourcing has shrunk from 0.43 per cent of the budget to 0.25 per cent of federal government spending. The most significant consequence of this reduction, both relative and absolute, is what the present Secretary of DFAT, Dennis Richardson, has described as the near incapacitation of our overseas representation. I think we should do more. The opening of the embassies in Dakar and Chengdu is a good measure. This year's budget ensures that Australia as a whole will benefit from a strong and prosperous economy. The government has a proud record of legislative reform, which I have outlined. All of these reforms have been achieved through the prism of a minority government. This should not be forgotten. Labor has been able to pass every single piece of legislation put to this parliament. (Time expired) to assure the member for Melbourne Ports that I acknowledge his references to the media in the early part of his speech and, later, his concern about the role of the media and the importance of that in our democracy. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (17:59): The Treasurer has introduced his fifth budget, which he is proud to say stays true to Labor ideals. The key ingredient of Labor policy is the idea that all of society's ills can be cured politically, but this outlook leaves the budget with no coherent economic strategy to drive growth in the economy, to lift productivity or to create jobs. The government vaunts stimulus as the reason that our economy avoided recession. Any analysis of the degree of economic recession and the amount of stimulus pumped into other nations' economies demonstrates that stimulus was not an important element in staving off recession. Indeed, how could this be the case when the last of the stimulus projects was only finished recently, nearly four years after the onset of the GFC? It was not stimulus that saved our economy but the fundamental strength created by the Howard years-with the improvement of prudential arrangements, prudent financial management and record surpluses-that took the brunt of the Rudd stimulus spending spree. We need to compare our economy with those in our region that we are engaged with, not with OECD economies. Compared with them, our economy is no standout. The government talks about its predicted surplus being good in terms of the Reserve Bank reducing interest rates. If a $1.5 billion surplus gives even a one-quarter per cent reduction in interest rates, surely the government can see that a $44 billion deficit in the last year and deficits for the past four years have put significant pressure on the economy the other way. The Treasurer is heavy on rhetoric about what he calls 'the big-spending Howard government', but, in all of his budget years, expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been well above that of the last year and the second last year of the Howard government. In each sector of the economy, the Prime Minister and her cabinet have offered a vision at odds with the core principles of economic freedom. This obsolete vision favours politically well-connected unions at the expense of workers and small competitors. It is a vision that creates inequality by favouring organisations with the best connections over those with the best ideas. It is a vision that inhibits growth by increasing the cost of complying with growing government regulation, instead of leaving business with more money and more freedom to hire staff, create jobs and foster our economy. This budget confirms that Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan have no plan to build a stronger economy, repay debt or create secure jobs. It is a blueprint for more borrowing, more taxes and record debt, with the world's biggest carbon tax and a record debt ceiling of $300 billion-raising the debt ceiling when you say you are going to get a surplus. Why do you need that? There has been a blow-out in this year's deficit, from $23 billion to $44 billion,",245,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
266,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Murphy,"BeforeI call the member for Tangney, I wantmeaning more debt left for future generations to repay. By 2015-16, the government will be spending over $8 billion a year, or $22 million a day, on interest payments alone. All of this is despite the fact that in real terms the government are experiencing the fastest growth in revenue since the mid-1980s. It is very hard for the government to ask Australians to live within their means while they refuse to live by their own gospel here in Canberra. This is Labor's legacy: waste and reckless spending. It is a tough argument to make that the spending priorities the Prime Minister is determined to protect are really so critical. In the business world-the real world, that is-few of the government's policies, programs, subsidies and handouts would pass an honest benefit-cost analysis. In this class-war budget, it is also a tough argument for the government to make that the wealthy do not pay their fair share, with the mining tax, the carbon tax, the cancellation of the cut to the company tax rate and a myriad other hits on business to redistribute income to those who seldom deserve it. Let me assure you: those who may be better off are paying more than their fair share. A wealth distribution bent is being manifested in all Gillard government policies: quick-fix tax-grabs to plug budget black holes and pay for idealistic-or, dare I say it, ideological-policies. The minerals resource rent tax, formulated without due consideration, is at the heart of this philosophy. 'Tax the rich to give to the poor,' says this government, 'and all of our problems will suddenly go away.' But, like any fairytale, it is not quite that simple. Mining accounts for nearly two-thirds of the value of Australia's exports of goods, and one-half of Australia's total exports of goods and services. Mining directly employs 224,000 Australians, and there are tens of thousands of additional workers, in manufacturing, mining services, construction and infrastructure, supporting the mining sector. That makes the sector a major driver of growth today, and investment in this sector will add to Australia's economic activity for many years to come. It is interesting: the government keeps hitting the middle and the big end of town with this budget, yet its fundamental success relies on the continued profitability of these taxpayers. The mining tax is not the cure-all the Treasury is searching for to bring the budget into surplus, and its inequities greatly impact on my home state of Western Australia. Australia has retired the sheep and is now riding on Western Australia's back. Western Australia's role in supporting the entire Australian economy with growth, jobs and investment has gone from important to critical in the federal budget. But, rather than rewarding a booming state carrying our nation, Western Australia's share of GST revenue has deteriorated beyond any worse-case scenario. This year, it will drop to 55c in the dollar-a loss of $662 million overnight, leaving Western Australia with the lowest share of GST of any state, ever. A GST slap in the face from the federal government means greater pressure is placed, unfairly, on all Western Australians to meet the costs of the national economy. Seventy per cent of all new jobs in the last year were created in Western Australia. In the year to February 2012, the only place where manufacturing employment grew was in Western Australia. Seven thousand manufacturing jobs were created in the last quarter alone. With just over 10 per cent of the nation's population, in the next year Western Australia will contribute 20 per cent of all company tax, around 60 per cent of the minerals resource rent tax and 40 per cent of Australia's total exports. Fair and equitable federal policy would at least allow the nation's most productive state to receive its fair share of revenue, of Commonwealth infrastructure spending and appropriate funding for key policy issues such as jobs and trades training. But this budget confirms that core Labor policy is to penalise success and subsidise inefficiency. Their decision to cancel a company tax rate cut informs this House that the life of the Gillard government has been placed before the fiscal interests of the nation. Gone are tax cuts, replaced by handouts and enticements towards a Labor brand that is growing more toxic by the day. It is yet another broken promise from the government. So is the Prime Minister engaging in class warfare? Definitely. Is she ignoring the waste of big government and idealistic social policy? Absolutely. Has she given up on reality? Certainly. To the detriment of all Australians, it is just political reality that now matters to the Gillard government. The first broken promise of this government, the world's biggest carbon tax, is about to hit families, jobs and investment. The budget papers confirm that, despite falling international prices, Labor's toxic tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years. The biggest problem with a carbon tax remains that it makes our most important everyday utilities like power, gas and water more expensive. I know from meeting with families and businesses in Tangney that they do everything that they can to minimise their utility usage to reduce costs and cannot be accused of being wasteful. Labor said it would make heroic cuts to government to reduce the burden on all Australians. Well, all the cuts are being made, but they are being made by families. They are going to have to pay this insidious tax. The list of problems inherent in this tax is quite literally endless. A threshold of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent as a cut-off for determining which companies should pay this tax is entirely arbitrary. It distorts the competitive playing field of a free market by heavily taxing one company that is just above threshold while giving a massive competitive advantage to another company that is just below. This act is a disincentive for companies to grow, create jobs and foster the economy. Of the 248 companies determined by the government's Clean Energy Regulator to pay this tax, 93 are mining operations that will suffer hits to their productivity that will flow to the prosperity of our national economy. Twenty-eight of the carbon tax companies are electricity providers and 39 are gas providers. These companies remain impervious to the carbon tax due to little competition in the energy sector. Any production price rises will be passed straight to households and businesses without a second thought. Australian households are set to suffer a 25 per cent increase in health costs, a 31 per cent increase in education costs, a 39 per cent increase in gas prices, a 59 per cent increase in water and sewerage prices and a 66 per cent increase in electricity prices-all with little or no difference to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. The coalition will continue to fight this insidious tax in opposition and repeal it in government. Julia Gillard has also broken her solemn promise, set out in the 2009 defence white paper, to increase defence spending by three per cent in real terms until 2017-18. Labor has cut a further $5.5 billion from Australia's defence budget on top of the $2.5 billion it cut last year. Defence spending has fallen below 1.6 per cent of nominal GDP-the lowest since pre World War II as a percentage of GDP. America is spending less on defence. China is spending more. There could not have been a better time for Australia to step up and be prepared to provide greater assistance to the US in stabilising our region. Labor has mothballed a substantial number of our armoured personnel carriers and tanks. Stage1 of the troubled Joint Strike Fighter program will be pushed back by another two years, and the new P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Land 400 combat vehicles will be pushed back by a year. This ludicrous compromise of Australia's national defence and security is an affront to our national sovereignty for the sake of a paper surplus that will never see the stamp of the Governor General. It is hardly surprising that these horrendous cuts have been subject to widespread criticism from nearly all major think tanks and policy institutes in the country. The federal government has a critical role to play in safeguarding free enterprise so that corruption is punished, success is rewarded and the impositions of government are not skewed against small business people, the innovator or the worker. The Prime Minister refuses to take responsibility for Labor's budget shortfalls and instead continues to introduce policies that have put us on this path of debt and deficit. The coalition rejects this government's broken policies. The Liberal charter outlines our beliefs on this side. We believe 'in government that nurtures and encourages its citizens through incentive, rather than putting limits on people through the punishing disincentives of burdensome taxes and bureaucratic red tape' and that 'businesses and individuals-not government-are the true creators of wealth and employment'. As MPs we must always ask: 'Is this something that needs to be done by government or are we contributing to a wider problem of government growth and private enterprise subversion?' We have a strong agenda to drive economic growth, productivity and employment. We have done it before and we will do it again. We will cut the waste, reduce the spending, pay down government sector debt and lower taxation to reward hard work and reduce the fiscal drag on the economy. A strong productivity agenda will drive higher labour force participation and reduce red tape. Australians want a government that can deliver an economic strategy to build a stronger Australia, reduce the cost-of-living pressures and create secure jobs. (Time expired) Ms KING (Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing) (18:14): I rise today in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and the other appropriation bills. This is a budget that Labor people can be very, very proud of. It is a budget that assists families with the costs of living; it is a budget that invests in skills and training across the nation; it is a budget that invests in health, in ageing and in vital infrastructure; and it is a budget that will return our budget to surplus. It is a Labor budget. It is what Labor governments do when they are in government. It stands in stark contrast to both the commentary and the actions of the federal Liberal Party, and it stands in stark contrast to the state budgets of the Liberal Party governments who are in Victoria and in New South Wales. This budget is squarely focused on assisting families and lowand middle-income earners. It is a budget that generates wealth, but it is also a budget that is fair. It is a budget that focuses squarely on helping families. It is a budget that focuses squarely on lowand middle-income earners and those that might be left behind in our economy. I want to focus on a few issues that to me are the crux of this budget and its assistance to families. The schoolkids bonus is one. Across the federal electorate of Ballarat, over 9,950 families are expected to receive $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. It equates to some $10.5 million going straight into the pockets of families who live in the electorate of Ballarat and who send their children to primary or secondary school. The payment replaces the education tax refund. It was estimated that in my electorate there are some 1,800 families who never claimed the education tax refund but who were entitled to do so. Structuring the schoolkids bonus in this way means that families do not have to keep receipts and do not have to claim; they will get this as an automatic payment. It is very important in my area-$10.5 million is being invested in local families, and that money will come into my economy. What we saw from the Liberal Party was that they opposed the schoolkids bonus. Apart from being a stunningly ridiculous political tactic, it just sends a very clear signal to all of those families in my electorate that the Liberal Party do not understand what is happening with families in the electorate of Ballarat. Their opposition to the schoolkids bonus stands in stark contrast to the federal government's proposal of the schoolkids bonus and the eventual passage of it through this parliament. The other area which I think is very important for families in my electorate is the family tax benefit part A. The federal budget is focused on spreading the wealth from the mining boom to those families that need it most. We acknowledge that mining is a very vital part of our economy, but we also acknowledge that wealth that has been generated is not being spread evenly. We want to be able to make sure that people in our economy are not left behind, and it is very important that families do not get left behind. As part of our budget we are increasing the family tax benefit part A payments to over 12,000 families in my electorate. That is an increase of over $600 which will start flowing from 1 July next year and will assist families with cost-of-living pressures. Very importantly, I was very pleased to see in the budget that we are investing $1.1 billion to establish a new supplementary allowance to assist those people who have been hit particularly hard in recent times by the rising costs of living, such as those Australians who are unemployed-and I think many of us in this place acknowledge how difficult it is for people who are on unemployment benefits. Students or single parents who are on income support will now have access to this new supplementary allowance. The allowance is $250 for singles and $350 for couples who will benefit, and that is some 11,000 families in my electorate of Ballarat. That allowance will assist people across my electorate with the costs of electricity, gas and water, to name just a few things. The other area that I think has been very important and widely well received is aged-care reform. Of course, it comes on the back of our historic increases to the pension. It was a Labor government that for the first time in 100 years increased the base rate of pension, because that is the sort of reform that Labor governments do. It was a historic reform and it has increased the pension by an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples as additional payments. The foundation for the government's sweeping reforms in aged care is also contained in the budget. To support our region's ageing population a new $3.7 billion funding commitment towards aged-care reform will see more in-home care support so people can live independently longer and will not be forced to sell the family home to pay for a bond in a nursing home. It will make access to aged care simpler from next year and will ensure that older Australians can receive care at home through a dramatic increase in home care packages. We have the circumstance in many cases across the country where people are assessed as eligible for community aged-care packages or dementia aged-care packages but are not able to receive them because there is a waiting list for those packages. By doubling the number of those in-home care packages we are making sure that there are more older people who can have the choice to stay at home for longer. Over the next 10 years the government's reforms will more than double that number of home care packages. The government is also funding its fair share of building a National Disability Insurance Scheme through an investment of $1 billion over four years to start the scheme. From the middle of next year selected launch sites across the country will begin serving people with a disability. Many of the 7,000 people who access a disability support pension across my own electorate will hopefully benefit from this investment. It is a historic announcement for our nation. The approaches we have had to disability services in this country, frankly, have been a disgrace. We all know it is time for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and I dearly hope that state governments will come to the party and pay their fair share of the National Disability Insurance Scheme as well. We have had the arguments about this and the time has come to actually deliver this to the many people who have disabilities in our country. Employment training and skills is something that, again, I am particularly proud of with the record of this government. I am particularly proud that in this budget we have continued our ongoing commitment to skills and training. It follows on, obviously, from our $3 billion over six years in the previous budget to skill Australia's future workforce. As part of this budget we have seen the investment of over $18 million to establish three Australian skills centres of excellence which are giving 21st century education to workers to prepare for the latest emerging industries. In addition the My Skills website will be improved to give greater detail on the quality and location of training providers. It will assist those looking for training and jobs on the ground with the greatest possible opportunities for their future. The National Workforce Development Fund is receiving a $35 million injection that will see mature-age workers upskilled to reskill across a number of areas where a shortage in skills is identified. In addition to this some $19.4 million has been allocated to tradespeople who have recently become qualified to start up their own businesses. This funding will be used to help those who are finishing their apprenticeships to train in business and finance. We are also providing some $4.2 million to the Australian Skills Quality Authority to support higher quality training. We are investing some $225.1 million over four years in the very successful and very important Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance Program. It helps parents on income support to receive the training and skills they need to re-enter the workforce. It is a very important program. The Gillard government have also offered the Victorian government more than $2.2 billion to support their reform of the training system, because we know the importance of investing in the skills and training of the Australian people. It is really important to emphasise that. The cuts to TAFE funding we have seen from the Victorian Liberal government are, frankly, unbelievable. It is politically unexplainable and counter to all of the work that we have been doing as a nation in developing skills and encouraging people to get into training. Last week the University of Ballarat-it is one of the few dual sector universities in the country; it has a university and a TAFE-announced that it will have to reduce its courses and jobs as a result of the cuts. It is a disastrous outcome and one which totally ignores the vital national drive to continue to develop the quality workforce which is being demanded by industry. The Victorian government needs to explain how TAFEs can retain courses and continue to deliver skills to industry, and support regions and communities like my own, in the face of these substantial cuts to funding. The TAFE network is an essential public institution and one which the Gillard government values very highly. We have invested some $224 million in TAFEs over the last four years through projects that have upgraded facilities and equipment in 39 campuses across Victoria, in addition to the $360 million in funding provided on average each year. Recently, this government provided $25 million to the University of Ballarat to lift education participation across the region. We are one of the regions that has a very low participation rate of postsecondary education. When you look up in the west of Victoria, past my electorate of Ballarat, into the Wimmera, into the member for Wannon's electorate, and on into the member for Mallee's electorate, the participation rates are even lower still. We have provided $25 million to the University of Ballarat to work with other TAFE providers to actually get TAFE education into these regions, but the state government, at the same time as we are investing $25 million in the University of Ballarat, has cut $20 million-40 per cent of the TAFE funding to the University of Ballarat. It is unsustainable and must be reversed. TAFE is absolutely at the front line when it comes to giving the people of Ballarat and the regions the skills that they need to get a job. The Victorian government is risking significant skills shortages with its budget cuts, when some of the state's biggest training providers, like the University of Ballarat, are forced to downsize and reduce their courses. I am advised that the Victorian government decision will see funding at the University of Ballarat decrease by around $20 million-around 40 per cent of total TAFE funding. In excess of 50 TAFE courses are going to close. Staff and students at the university are absolutely shocked by the decision, and I am particularly concerned that the decision is affecting some of the most vulnerable in our community, particularly those who have disabilities, who have learning difficulties and who are from low socioeconomic backgrounds. I know community leaders and the local business community have strongly condemned this decision. Not only will we not be developing people with the skills we need in this region, we will be putting quality trainers on the scrap heap. I urge families across my electorate to go along to the rally that is being held tomorrow at the University of Ballarat's SMB campus at 12:30. I know from Facebook that there are many, many people who have never been engaged in political rallies before who have been activated by this government's decision. To me, it is an absolutely perfect example of why you need to not just listen to some of the spin that comes from Liberal politicians about what they think is a good policy outcome but actually look at what they do. Have a look at what Liberal governments are doing in states like my own, Victoria. They have an ideological opposition to TAFE, they have had for a very long time period of time, and they want to kill it. You can see no better example than what is happening in Victoria at the moment. Frankly, I find it absolutely astounding and I think many National Party MPs in Victoria are dismayed at the decision. The minister in Victoria is dismayed at the decision that he has now had to go out and sell. I am sure it is not one he supports. But what I say very clearly is: have a look at what good Labor governments do-what we do in terms of helping families; what we do about making sure we support low and middle income Australians; what we do to develop education, health, infrastructure and skills. Then have a really good look at what Liberal governments do in the states of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. Have a look at what they actually do when they are in government, and have a good think about what that might mean federally. The Australian people should be under no illusion that, if the Leader of the Opposition became Prime Minister, then we would once again see a Liberal government that rips funding out of education, that rips funding out of training and skills, that rips funding out of health and, instead, looks after its mates at the big end of town. In conclusion, I want to say that the budget in my electorate has also invested significantly in health infrastructure. That has come on the back of the $42 million commitment to the Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre. We are also seeing $1.6 million go to Ballarat District Nursing and Healthcare, and $3.3 million to Ballan District Health and Care. I am very proud of the record that we have in my electorate of investment in infrastructure in health, and in roads, and in education, both within our TAFE and within our University of Ballarat. That is what good Labor governments do, and I am very proud to support this budget here in the appropriation bills. 13. When a Treasurer rises to give a budget night speech, it should be a great occasion and ceremony. Unfortunately, that has been trashed by this Treasurer. To have brought down a budget claiming austerity but presiding over spending of $370 billion and an increase in government revenue of some $39 billion, that is increased taxation. For all the spending that this government does, Townsville received nothing in this budget. We got nothing for the Bruce Highway and we got nothing for infrastructure. We saw Defence stripped bare. We need a government that 'gets' Townsville, that can see that we punch above our weight in our contribution to the economy. We need a government that is prepared to plan for the future of North Queensland and to give us our fair share. Instead, this Labor budget has dudded Townsville and left us in the lurch. Since he delivered the budget, the Treasurer has boasted about delivering the first of four years of surplus budgets-and he did it with a straight face; it was a credit to the rehearsal that he must have done-supposedly through tough budget cuts. The word 'productivity' to my reading was not mentioned once in his speech. Surely, we must look at the way we do things in this country and reward those who do them more efficiently, faster, with higher quality and better finish. We need to compete in a global market. I am also struggling to understand why a government that believes it is delivering a surplus also needs to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion in the same budget, leaving government debt at absolutely unprecedented levels. When you are making headway on your own mortgage and your home budget, and you are increasing your payments on your mortgage, the last thing you consider is to increase your mortgage limit. It just beggars belief. This will also be Australia's first carbon tax budget. The real impact of this year's budget on Townsville households and businesses will begin when the world's biggest carbon tax starts on 1 July. We have seen the cash bribes blatantly trying to distract voters. We have seen the $36 million ad campaign which talks up the compensation without mentioning the reason that families need to be compensated. But you cannot compensate for a cascading and compounding tax that will act as a wrecking ball across my local community and my local",248,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
267,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (18:29,"I rise to speak on the appropriation bills for 2012economy. We will all be paying for this through increased prices, higher energy bills and pressure on local businesses who are still not going to receive any compensation. The pain from this tax is only going to get worse. The budget papers have confirmed that despite falling international prices, Labor's toxic carbon tax will steadily rise for three years. This is all coming despite the Prime Minister's declaration that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads. Townsville's small businesses, some 9,000 in number, are the heart of our local economy and they are struggling at the moment, especially in retail. I regularly receive emails from business owners telling me that times are tough and they are having trouble getting their bills paid. They look to this government to inject much-needed confidence into the business community with this budget. Instead, it has all but ignored them. The only people in Townsville who are super busy are the liquidators. Small business owners are the ones who are prepared to take a chance, often risking their own home to start something new or take on another employee. We should be encouraging them, ensuring there is reward for these risks and opportunities to become more productive for the benefit of their business in the wider economy. Instead, this government is slapping them with the world's biggest carbon tax and offering only mirages of compensation. We drown them in red tape, regulations, fees and taxes. We just make it so hard for them to perform. This government has also abolished the entrepreneur's tax offset, designed to foster microbusinesses to assist them to get started. It seems as though the only place that this government is prepared to make big spending cuts is in defence. This budget saw the biggest cut in defence spending since the end of the Korean war. Defence spending now is at its lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1938. If you add the deferments and cancellations to the quoted $5.5 billion you will end up with defence copping it in the neck to the tune of $17.1 billion-and we have not even mentioned the submarine debacle. Australia is going to face critical capability gaps that will be felt for a whole generation simply because this Labor government cannot manage its finances. I represent a city within which exists the largest army base in Australia. Lavarack Barracks is the home of the 3rd Brigade and 11th Brigade. We also have RAAF Base Garbutt and 10FSB at Ross Island. We are home to some 5,000 defence personnel. My defence personnel are the ones who get deployed. Townsville's defence family is the one that trains all the time in preparation for emergencies all over the world. You cannot rip $5.5 billion out of defence without hurting Townsville as a whole, and our ADF personnel in particular. The Prime Minister and the defence minister have been at pains to tell us that no-one in uniform will be affected, but when you delay, defer and cancel things such as this, how can it not have an effect on the troops on the ground? In times of trouble we do not turn to the department in Canberra, we turn to the men and women who are part of the redeployed units of 3rd Brigade, 11 Brigade and RAAF Base Townsville. Those guys deserve first-class training and first-class facilities; it is that simple. I also worry about the relationship between the ADF and the government. I must be clear here and state that I have never heard a serving officer or member say a negative thing about the government. That is not their way; their way is to faithfully serve their country. We had a welcome home parade for some 1,100 soldiers and RAAF personnel. The Prime Minister and the defence minister had been to Townsville to meet the troops about to deploy. Their plane was grounded due to mechanical error. They could have made the parade for the returning men and women. That they chose to stay away speaks volumes, not about the Defence Force but about the respect in which the ADF is held by these two key politicians. This was also another Labor budget that ignored the need for fairness for veterans. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, the DFRDB, is not indexed in the same way that age and service pensions are. Every year DFRDB recipients become a little worse off than those on other pensions. After 40 years this has left the pensions of those who served our country in poor shape. It is time we finally did something about it. I am proud that, in March, Tony Abbott recommitted the coalition to fix this problem once and for all. Townsville has a large veteran population and they and their families deserve fair indexation. A coalition government will deliver it and I urge this government to stop giving veterans a raw deal. I was proud to be the first politician to support the NDIS in Townsville, but we must get it right. The fact that it has been politicised is beyond doubt. The way the funding was announced reminded me of the launch of the MSPT, the mining super profit tax. There were no discussions with the key players, the states. The Productivity Commission recommended that the Commonwealth fund 100 per cent of the scheme. The reasoning was that they are the only level of government capable of raising the expected $8 billion extra annually. To me that reasoning is sound. The announcement of a 78-22 split was made without any consultation with the states. The start of the scheme is underfunded by almost $3 billion. The government has three times refused to create a joint House committee on its establishment. That all this can happen as they raise hopes among the disability sector sounds exactly like that press conference in late May 2010 where the then Prime Minister and the current Treasurer launched the doomed mining super profit tax. If we do not deliver on this NDIS we will only have ourselves to blame. But we have to be straight up with the people and tell them why they need it and how it is going to be funded. We have to ask the community where the line will be drawn and what level of personal responsibility will be expected. We need to have the conversations with people not directly involved now and get them on board. What we have now is pure politics and it does none of us any good. Townsville is a great destination for visitors, but even after recovering from cyclone Yasi the local tourism industry is still struggling. This reality has fallen on deaf ears in the Labor government. Instead of helping the local tourism industry they have used this budget to cut $8 million from Tourism Australia's budget and have failed to provide the industry with any compensation for the carbon tax, which is threatening around 6,400 jobs in the tourism business alone. This budget increases passenger movement charges to the tune of $668 million and pushes the cost of Federal Police back to the airports. That will only increase the costs to our tourism sector. It surely sends a message that this government simply does not care about this vital sector of our economy. Add to that the carbon tax on domestic airfares and it is no wonder tourism operators have given up hope that this government will do something, anything, for them. The great disappointment for me in this budget is that there is next to nothing for Townsville and North Queensland. Townsville is a rapidly expanding city. Our population growth is more than double that of the rest of the country. In fact the member for Thuringowa, Sam Cox, in the state parliament said that Thuringowa is the second fastest growing area in Queensland. We need a government that will invest in the region to plan for the future now. Instead, we have a government that has completely ignored us. There is no new funding for the Bruce Highway. This is supposed to be the national highway and it has been in dire need of attention for decades to get more overtaking lanes and pull-over areas and to be floodproofed, yet this government could not find one cent to help North Queensland drivers and industries that rely on that highway. There was no funding for any road projects urgently needed in Townsville to support the increased traffic in growth corridors. The only reason Townsville residents will finally be able to rely on Blakey's Crossing next wet season is that Queensland's new Liberal National state government responded to the community's 'Fix Blakey's' campaign and saw the need. This was once the Bruce Highway and should have been fixed generations ago. There has also been nothing for the residents of the upper Ross, who are wondering when their main road, Riverway Drive, will be duplicated so that it can handle increased usage. Even beyond roads, this budget has offered no infrastructure for Townsville. The Northern Beaches is crying out for better services and facilities, as more and more families move to the new developments there. It needs a cyclone shelter, which would act as a large community centre, to give this growth corridor the facilities it needs and the region the heart and soul it is looking for. In Townsville over recent months we have seen a rise in crime rates, particularly youth crime. We must work together as a community if we are to tackle these problems. I call on the government to work with groups in the community like Neighbourhood Watch and groups that are looking at different initiatives to engage at-risk youth and get them off the streets and out of trouble. In looking to the future of Townsville as leader of the region we need to be looking beyond just North Queensland. The closest capital city to Townsville is Port Moresby, and its relationship with Papua New Guinea is a vital one, offering numerous opportunities to foster trade, education, aid and research to the benefit of both Townsville and PNG. We have already seen the importance of this connection. Local businesses are developing their trade links with PNG. Curtain Bros have been doing it for years. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry is very active, as are the North Queensland Cowboys. Youth WithA Mission provides a vital health service to remote parts of this country as well. It disappoints me that this country has ignored the opportunity to fund the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine at James Cook University. This research project, headquartered in Townsville and Cairns, will benefit people throughout the tropical world. JCU is highly respected for its tropical research. The AITHM creates the opportunity for the university to use this specialty with its school of medicine to lead the world in tropical health research. Once again, it took the new Queensland Liberal National state government to provide the funding and get this vital project off the ground that this federal government should have taken responsibility for during the 2010 election. The coalition remains committed to this vital health link and we will see that it happens. I call on this government to start planning for the future of Townsville. We need to be investing in infrastructure projects that will meet the needs not just of today but also of our population tomorrow. We need a government that cares about the future of Townsville and wants to work with the region to achieve the right outcomes. Townsville is a great city in a great state. We should be doing all we can to provide our residents and businesses with hope for the future and reward for their effort and opportunities, not just for us but also for our children. This budget does not address any of these things. We in Townsville are a positive and vibrant people. We will hold this Treasurer and this government to account for this budget. tragic news for families in the Hunter region, who had a sense of the future, a sense of opportunity and a sense that they could make through their work a pathway for their lives and their families with security. Yet we see that the heart of this budget is a $36 billion carbon tax. What was that carbon tax intended, designed and constructed to do? It was to destroy jobs and production in areas which are deemed to be high emission. Most particularly, the government's own Treasury modelling predicts that as a consequence of the carbon tax the aluminium sector will be 60 per cent smaller than it would otherwise have been. The variable there is the carbon tax. This is not the opposition confecting; this is not the opposition asserting; this is a direct finding within Treasury's own modelling based on a comparison between what would be the case without the carbon tax and what will be the case with the carbon tax. This day, Norsk Hydro-otherwise known as Pacific Hydro-made it absolutely clear that the Kurri Kurri plant in the Hunter would be wound down, at a cost of 344 jobs, and that one of the critical long-term factors was the carbon tax. In question time today, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Combet, denied that this was a factor in the company's decision-they denied that the carbon tax was a factor in the loss of 344 jobs today and 150 jobs earlier this year. I read directly, clearly and in an unedited form from Norsk Hydro's press release of today: Following a thorough review, it is clear that the plant will not be profitable in the short term with current market prices, while long-term viability will be negatively affected by a number of factors including increasing energy costs and the carbon tax. Let us unpick that. Dr Jensen: Explicit. equivocation and no doubt; there is an express, clear, explicit reference to the carbon tax as one of only two long-term factors. This should not be a surprise, because the nature, the purpose, the operation, the being, the meaning, the structure, the approach of the carbon tax is to close down heavy-emitting businesses and to send them offshore. That is its design and its intent. Dr Jensen interjectinghistorical work that I make that assertion. SoI say to the members of the Labor Party-to the members of the government that brought this $36 billion tax into being: face the consequences of the policy you bring to this House. When you look at what the company said, you see that they acknowledge that there are short-term difficulties. We have never denied that-the dollar and the metals price are critical issues. But, most significantly, what they say is, 'We may have been able to ride through these",255,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
268,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (18:43,"In addressing the budget, let me begin today with what is",259,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
269,Mr Hunt,"What we see, as the member for Tangney said, is explicitness. There is no",259,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
270,Mr Hunt,"This is exactly what it is intended to do, and it is precisely because of myissues; but then there are fundamental long-term issues around viability, all relating to electricity prices.' These are the elements: the carbon tax is first and foremost an electricity tax; it is also a tax on additional emissions where they occur outside of the electricity cost process. The government has tried to say, 'It is only a minor impost on the aluminium sector.' That is false, because these businesses have to plan for the capital costs and the return on capital over a period of decades, and a carbon tax, as the Aluminium Council has indicated, will quadruple its impact on the aluminium sector over a decade. This is not some minor erosion or decay of permits or some incremental increase in price; it is the combination of those two factors, which, as the aluminium sector's own work shows, will result in a quadrupling of the burden on that sector. There are only six aluminium plants in Australia. We have Boyne Smelters in Queensland; we have Kurri Kurri, which, as of today, is gone; we have Tomago, which shed jobs in the Hunter earlier this year; we have Point Henry in Victoria, which is under review; we have Portland in Victoria; and we have Bell Bay. What we see is this: there is a difficult international environment, and the worse possible thing you could do is impose a unilateral hit on the competitiveness of that sector in Australia. There are real pressures on each of these six plants. What the aluminium association warned me of earlier this year is a fear that three of them could have announced a pathway to retirement and closure by the end of this year in the light of the carbon tax. The warnings were expressed and the government was notified. Then, when that of which it was notified, that of which it was warned, came to pass it denied the causation. It denied the link. This day we begin to see the real and profound impact of the central measure of the budget. The government tried to present this as some redistributive budget. The central measure of the budget was the carbon tax. The single biggest change between last year's budget and this year's was the $36 billion of revenue included in the forward estimates from the carbon tax. That is an enormous burden on Australian industry and Australian families. It is an enormous burden on Australian councils. That brings me to the second great deception we have witnessed today. We have seen this view that councils will not have to pay. Yesterday the then Acting Prime Minister said councils will not have to pay the carbon tax next year on their landfill. Let me go to something which was received by 104 councils. This letter was sent to the Chief Executive Officer of the Gold Coast City Council. It is a letter from the regulatory implementation branch of the Clean Energy Regulator, dated 17 May, 2012: I am writing to you as we have identified your council as possibly operating a significant landfill which potentially could mean that you will be liable under the Clean Energy Act 2011. You may also operate other facilities such as water treatment plants that could mean you are a liable entity. If you consider that you will be a liable entity please advise us in writing by 31 May 2012. It then went on: Under section 184 of the Clean Energy Act, where the Clean Energy Regulator has reasonable grounds to believe that a legal person, including trusts, local governing bodies, corporations sole and bodies corporate is or is likely to be a liable entity for the 2012-13 financial year that entity will be recorded in the liable entities public information database. What does it mean? It means that councils are about to be hit. The government's pretence that these councils are not about to be hit is that they will not have to pay anything immediately. But councils have to start collecting with higher landfill fees immediately. That is why a senior official from the City of Manningham publicly declared that the city will be raising its landfill fees on the advice of the Commonwealth Department of the Treasury. That is why the City of Wyndham, in the Prime Minister's own electorate of Lalor, has put in place a contingency revenue raising through higher landfill fees of $13.02 million for the financial year commencing on 1 July 2012. That is why 104 councils around Australia have just received 'please show' letters from the Clean Energy Regulator to say whether they will or will not be in for the coming year. These councils will have a liability for all waste contributed after 1 July 2012 if they fall within the system-and the vast majority of them will. And that liability could be for up to 40 years. They must start collecting now, otherwise they will never be able to recover the costs because they will never know who will have deposited that waste. That is why, around Australia, 104 councils are now trying to determine two things: what will their actual waste, landfill and gas liability beMr Stephen Jones interjectingfor Throsby has said that most councils will have a zero liability for their waste landfill gas when 104 councils have just received show-cause notices from the Clean Energy Regulator as to why they should not be included on the list of liable entities, and it is absolutely certain that they will all have obligations if they are included on that list. What we see here is that the councils are next in line to be hit. Around Australia, in smalltown newspapers, these stories are being recorded, that a government which had indicated this was about the top 500 polluters has deceived them. People are discovering that their waste-tip fees are going up as of 1 July this year. The biggest problem for councils is to understand what their liability is. With five weeks to go, they still do not know for certain whether they are on the list and they still do not know for certain how much they will pay. That is the essence of this carbon-tax budget. We see the impact on workers and we see the impact on families. Electricity is the third great limb. It will go up on the government's estimates by 10 per cent and on the Electricity Supply Association estimates by 20 per cent. The great deception in what the government is saying is the pretence that the first bill is the only rise. The Electricity Supply Association is expecting a second 10 per cent rise in early 2014 when, under the government's own system, companies are going to have to buy forward permits to hedge their prices. That is what the Electricity Supply Association estimate. They were right about part 1 and they will be right about part 2, so we are talking about a 20 per cent price rise. We have already seen one firm talking about a 25 per cent price rise. Those are the elements of the budget, the carbon-tax budget, and its central features. Jobs for working Australians; council tip fees as an example of the deception for 104 councils trying to deal with the letter that is a week old which warns them that suddenly they will be hit with this liability on 1 July. Then there is the cost of living for families through electricity price rises of up to 20 per cent in two main stages. Then we go to other failures that have been identified in this legislation. I want to single out two of these failures. Firstly, the solar hot water industry was deceived out of $44.7",259,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
271,Mr Hunt,"Actually that is completely false. I want to put on the record that the membermillion. On 21 March 2012, just after the government had cancelled the solar hot water rebate, the Parliamentary Secretary for Energy Efficiency wrote to the Greens that the government never intended to make any savings from the closure of this program. What we found once this year's budget papers came out, of course, is that and there was a saving of $44.7 million. That money was taken directly from the industry in direct contravention of a public pledge. It is an example of what the government said would never happen. The second is that the Home Insulation Program, the most disastrous of all programs, has costs which amount to almost $2 billion. We had a cost blow-out last year of $59 million compared with what was pledged a year ago was the cost of fixing the roofs. This government cannot fix the roofs, cannot be trusted on solar and its members are the last people you would want to put in charge of an economy. (Time expired) environment, who highlighted the challenges faced by many councils. Later in my speech I will particularly highlight the challenge facing the Blue Mountains City Council, who have estimated that the cost through to 2034 will be up to $11 million. TodayI rise to speak about the federal Labor government's appropriation bills. This budget confirms the incompetence of the Gillard government, a government that has established a reputation for broken promises. Despite Julia Gillard saying five days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' budget 2012 is Australia's first carbon tax budget-the first of many broken promises from this government. This government have removed themselves so far from the local community, from everyday Australians, that they have lost all understanding of the genuine concerns of hard working Australian families and businesses. Quite simply, this government have lost their way. There is no clearer example of this than the government's rationale that a family who earns a combined income of $150,000 per year is wealthy. When was the last time the Treasurer spoke to one of these families? If he had done so recently, he would know that these families are struggling to meet the rising costs of living. A combined income of $150,000 means a police officer and nurse raising their young children, a teacher and truck driver, possibly supporting their children at university while struggling to pay their mortgage. These people are not rich. They are working hard to pay their bills with the hope of getting ahead. If the federal Labor government were in touch with the Australian community, they would understand that these families are struggling with the rising costs of living. Since Labor took office in 2007, electricity prices have increased by 66 per cent. Gas prices have increased by 39 per cent. Health costs have gone up 25 per cent. The price of education has increased by 31 per cent. And now we are staring down the barrel of the world's largest price on carbon-a tax that will hit families, jobs and businesses at the toughest time. Why won't Labor give Australian families, Australian children, Australian single parents and seniors a break? Why does the government want to put unnecessary pressure on hard working people? This comes after years of broken promises-the carbon tax, the company tax, the promise to increase defence spending by three per cent. The list goes on and on and the Australian people are quite simply fed up. We are fed up with the broken promises and the government's failure to deliver on its policy promises and its budget projections. Because of this government's record, the Australian community do not trust the Treasurer's ability to deliver a surplus of $1.5 billion. And why should they? The record speaks for itself. In 18 months its",261,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
272,Mrs Markus (Macquarie) (18:59,"I commend the words of the shadow minister for theestimated deficit for 2011-12 blew out from the Treasurer's projected $12 billion to $44 billion, and it may blow out even further. The year is not over. Why should we expect this budget to be any different? If further proof is needed, one only needs to look at Appropriation Bill (No. 2), part 5. If the federal Labor government really believed it could deliver a surplus, why is it moving to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion? It is an extra $50 billion-for what? How will it be spent? Is this going to be spent leading up to an election? Australians are right to be concerned about handing Wayne Swan yet another increase in our nation's credit card limit. If the Treasurer and the federal Labor government have no faith in their ability to achieve and manage this supposed surplus, why should the Australian people? Speaking of increasing the Commonwealth debt limit, why did the Treasurer bury this proposal in Appropriation Bill (No. 2)? To avoid proper scrutiny and a specific vote on the debt limit? It could only be because the Treasurer and the government are embarrassed that government debt levels are at absolutely unprecedented levels. This year the government interest payments on Labor's debt alone are set to reach an alarming $8 billion over the next financial year-$8 billion. What a waste. This money would be better spent on providing better services throughout our local community, protecting our borders, supporting defence programs, providing additional funding to the National Disability Insurance Scheme and maintaining and protecting the Australian lifestyle. In addition to the waste, this year's budget demonstrates no plan to build a stronger economy, repay debt or create secure jobs. I am genuinely concerned about the impact that this budget and the carbon tax will have on Australians, specifically the impact on the people I represent within the electorate of Macquarie, who work, live and endeavour to build a future. I was at Blaxland Explorers Day only recently, and throughout the day people came up to me where I was working to express their concerns about this budget and this unnecessary carbon tax. Seniors, young families, young couples and single parents are all concerned about the rising cost of living and the lack of support and services provided to local communities by this budget. What is clear is that the Treasurer believes that the government can compensate for the larger cost and impact of this budget and the carbon tax that is set to hit families, small businesses and every aspect of the Australian economy. No-one will be spared, especially not by the token handouts provided by the government to compensate for a dramatic increase in the cost of living. One such token gesture is the $657,000 within the budget allocated to Blue Mountains City Council to maintain and upgrade local roads. While this may seem like a large sum of money and a boost to the local council, it is not sufficient. I recall in 2007 when a local road, Racecourse Road in Clarendon, was resurfaced. This road is 3½ kilometres long. The resurfacing of this road cost more than $700,000. That was $700,000 to repair 3.4 kilometres. There is more than 717 kilometres of road managed by the Blue Mountains City Council. It is fair to say that the $657,000 in this budget allocated to the Blue Mountains City Council for the repair of local roads will not go very far. In addition to this, Blue Mountains City Council and Hawkesbury City Council are both set to be hit by the carbon tax, with little compensation from the Treasurer's budget. A report in April to a Blue Mountains City Council meeting stated that the council was liable for emissions generated from its operational landfill at Blaxland under clean energy legislation passed by the Senate in November last year. A review commissioned by the council predicted the Blaxland facility would exceed 25,000 tonnes per year in 2013 to 2014 based on current landfill patterns and would remain above the threshold until 2033-34. According to the report the 'absolute minimum liability' for emissions in 2014 was predicted to be $307,434, rising to $390,284 in 2014 and to a projected $11.3 million by 2034. Julia Gillard's carbon tax will mean these local councils have to lift their own fees and charges, raise their council rates, cut services or some combination of these hits, all of which will mean more pain for Australians at the local level. Where is the compensation for local city councils within this budget now that they have to accommodate these price hikes as a direct result of the carbon tax? This means councils will have less money to allocate to vital local services such as libraries, parks, youth services, the arts and cultural initiatives. These make up such an important part of our communities and it is a disaster for local councils that they will have to make these sacrifices to pay this tax. The first priority of a coalition government would be to abolish this carbon tax and reduce the cost-of-living pressures which are soaring under Labor. Along with the concerns that I have regarding the rising costs of living I am also troubled by the government's ability to stimulate tourism. The tourism industry is an important part of the local and regional economy for both Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains. Tourism's contribution to Australia's gross domestic product was $73.3 billion or a 5.2 per cent share of the Australian community. In Australia, tourism directly and indirectly employs 907,100 persons, representing 7.9 per cent of total Australian employment-and this is shrinking. Although the sector is already stressed, this budget delivered by the Treasurer reduces the tourism budget by 6.2 per cent or $8 million. Not only has the Labor government cut funding to the sector but it has failed to provide adequate carbon tax compensation for the tourism sector . As a result, according to the Tourism and Transport Forum submission on the carbon tax, the tourism industry stands to lose 6,400 jobs and a cut of 10 per cent from industry profits. What is the government's plan to secure the jobs of those in the tourism industry? Does the government have a plan to stimulate tourism growth, particularly for those regions like the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury where tourism operators are keen to see growth in their sector? Another important component of the economies of both the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury regions is the contribution made by our wonderful small business owners: 4,515 across the electorate. Under the 2012-13 budget, the Labor government provide no compensation to small businesses for the carbon tax. Small business people who put their houses on the line to create jobs deserve support from government, not broken promises. The coalition government would give small business operators more time to focus on growing their business by cutting red tape and reducing their regulatory burden by at least $1 billion per year. The coalition will also support small businesses by simplifying the administration of compulsory employee superannuation contributions by allowing small businesses to remit their contribution in one payment directly to the ATO with the PAYG payments. The coalition have always supported small business owners in the Australia. We believe they are a vital part of our economy. The desperate attempt by the Gillard Labor government to bring the budget to surplus also comes at a heavy price for the Australian Defence Force. The government has cut $5.5 billion from the 2012-13 budget, making a total of $17 billion over the last three years. I would like to know why the Gillard government has broken the commitment it made to increase defence spending by three per cent until 2017-18 that was set out in the 2009 defence white paper. As a result of this broken promise and the budgetary cuts, defence spending will be at its lowest level since 1938 as a percentage of GDP. The federal Labor government needs to explain what impact these budget cuts will have on Australia's ability to respond to disasters or emergencies in the nation and the border regions. It clearly demonstrates that Australia's borders are more vulnerable than ever under this Gillard government and its 2012-13 budget. Paul Howes, National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, confirmed that as a result of these spending cuts the federal government has jeopardised the jobs of 250 aircraft specialist workers at RAAF Base Richmond. This will have a significant impact on the people of Macquarie and particularly the Hawkesbury as Richmond RAAF is a vital source of employment. Labor says that this budget is about creating jobs and economic growth, but the budgetary impact is that a projected 250 specialist aviation maintenance jobs are potentially under threat when the C130H Hercules aircraft are retired. What will happen to that local expertise? What will happen to those 250 workers and their families? The Minister for Defence needs to explain. How does the government justify the loss of these jobs and the impact that this will have on the Hawkesbury community? This government claims to be for Australian workers. It claims to be creating Australian jobs, but again its record shows otherwise. In last year's budget the federal government promised 500,000 new jobs over two years and now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to five per cent, while the government is cutting $200 million out of jobs service programs. The coalition would invest over $2 billion to support Australians. This would include, for example, in the area of mental health, an additional 60 Headspace sites. The coalition is committed to working with the states to improve health care and provide added funding towards these fundamental services. The coalition government would ensure access to affordable, world-class health care for all Australians when they need it most by protecting Australia's public health benefits and restoring the private health insurance rebate. Unlike the current federal Labor government, the coalition is committed to bringing hope, reward and opportunity back to all Australians. This budget and the incompetent government is slowly stripping the nation of these vital qualities. It is time we put a stop to it. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (19:14): I speak today in support of the appropriation bills that underpin the Gillard Labor government's return to surplus budget. At the outset I want to congratulate the Treasurer, his staff and his department for the extremely significant, and yet still underrated, achievement of delivering a surplus so soon after the global economic wreckage that began in 2008 and of putting Australia on a path to surplus budgets in the years to come, while continuing this government's steadfast pursuit of necessary and innovative reform, especially with regard to the introduction of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is right to focus on the return to surplus as the key characteristic of this budget and to recognise the difficult decisions that have been made in order to get us to this position when there has been such a large contraction in the revenue side of the equation. Through these appropriation bills we take a number of further critical steps in improving the provision of public goods and the foundation of economic fairness of this country. I will speak in more detail of these steps in due course but first I will consider the quite remarkable core details of Australia's macroeconomic position. The OECD has confirmed overnight that Australia has the best-performing economy in the developed world, with stable economic growth of around three per cent this year and projected to be closer to four per cent next year, at a time when the majority of the world's major economies have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, recession. Unemployment in Australia remains around five per cent-in historically low territory-as a direct result of this government's actions to protect the Australian economy during the GFC. We have created more than 800,000 jobs since taking office and we have done that while returning Australia to a fair system of workplace regulation. I recall that when the Labor government got rid of Work Choices we did so in the face of a scaremongering campaign conducted by the coalition and supported by many in the business community and some in the press, who said that the abolition of Work Choices would cost jobs. That was plainly wrong. It is one of the government's great achievements that we have restored a fair and sensible framework of workplace regulation and at the same time grown the Australian workforce and the opportunities for Australians to have the benefit of fair and safe work. Inflation in this country is stable and low, not least as a result of this government's fiscal discipline, with our peak net debt one-tenth of that of comparable economies. Interest rates are also at historically low levels and certainly are lower than at any point under the Howard government. As the Treasurer has pointed out, Australia now has a AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies for the first time in our history. That is not surprising when we consider the basic statistics I have outlined: steady growth at three per cent, unemployment at five per cent, inflation under three per cent and the RBA cash rate at 3.75 per cent. The significance of these economic achievements, which speak clearly to the quality and consistency of this government's economic management over the last 4½ turbulent years, is felt right across the country, especially with respect to employment but also in the form of low, stable interest rates and inflation. What is more, the fundamental strength of the Australian economy is not just an end in itself-at least not for a Labor government-because we recognise that a strong economy ought to be the foundation of positive reform. We are seized by the fact that there is always work to be done in improving the public goods we share like health, education, environment and of course in preparing ourselves properly for the future. In that way this budget, our fifth budget in government, continues to add steadily to the changes we have introduced and funded for the long-term benefit of all Australians. It builds on the investment we have made in schools and trade training centres, like the Maritime Trades Training Centre at South Fremantle High School, and by offering nearly $1 billion to the WA government for reforms under the auspices of the National Workforce Development Fund, one object of which is the creation of a HECS-style system of loans to support TAFE students. In terms of university education we are making an investment of $38.8 million over the next four years, with the cap on university places, with a particular emphasis on raising the participation of lower-SES students. On that point, it is worth noting that since 2009 our setting of targets to improve the participation of students whose economic circumstances create an inequality of opportunity has resulted in a 49.3 per cent increase in the number of offers to lower-SES students to attend Curtin University, a 9.7 per cent increase at Murdoch and an 11.2 per cent increase at the University of Western Australia. That is an emphatic improvement and it is resulting in better and fairer opportunities for young Western Australians, a number of whom, like myself many years ago, will come from outside the Perth metro area for their chance of a university education. In this coming financial year we will see the introduction of the mining tax and the staged introduction of compulsory superannuation towards a super guarantee of 12 per cent by 2020, with the twin benefits for the individual and for Australia as a whole of much higher personal savings in retirement for millions of Australians. In this coming year we will also see a tripling of the tax-free threshold and reform of the tax treatment of superannuation that is fairer at both ends of the scale. It is fairer by virtue of the fact that it ensures some 3.6 million low-income Australians will effectively pay no tax on their super guarantee contributions and it is fairer at the other end of the scale by ensuring that the top one per cent of income earners receive a smaller tax concession-one that is more in line with the concession that most wage earners receive. In considering how a government is able to make savings and fund new commitments at the same time, it is clear that the difficult work tends to be in removing payments, subsidies or revenue concessions that are not equitable or effective. This government has been prepared to grasp that nettle and we have done so in a climate of unrelenting negativity-and we have been prepared to take the political consequences. We have done so in being prepared to make changes to the private health insurance rebate, we have done so when it comes to better means-testing of family support payments and we have done so in the area of tax concessions on superannuation. When we took government, something like $17 billion of the $21 billion in annual tax concessions on super was going to the top 5 per cent of all income earners. That was not a sound policy outcome by any measure. It is by making these eminently fair and prudent reforms, however difficult they might be politically, that this government has been in a position to run the strongest economy in the OECD and embark on one of the steadiest, most far-sighted reform programs in Australia's history. That is why this budget is able to build on one of our previous substantial reforms, matched funding in the area of health, by beginning to tackle one of the great blind spots in our public health framework-namely, the public funding of dental healthcare. This budget provides $515 million to address urgent dental care needs. It does so, firstly, through a $346 million blitz to tackle the long waiting lists for public dental services; secondly, through $78 million to support the relocation of dentists to rural, regional, and remote areas, the three Rs of geographic health inequality in Australia; and, thirdly, through an $81 million boost to training for graduate dentists and therapists. I congratulate the Minister for Health, who referred to dental health in her first speech as health minister. We are already starting to see that commitment turned into reality. I am also incredibly pleased to see the extension of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, with $49.3 million allocated to include screening for people turning 60 years of age in 2013 and those turning 70 years of age in 2015. This has the potential to make screening freely available to around 12 per of the people in my electorate over the next few years. It is yet another important preventative health measure from a government that has made preventative health one of its key focuses. I thank the Cancer Council of Australia for its strong campaign on this important issue. Above all else, I am absolutely delighted that in this budget a Labor government is providing $1 billion over four years to fund the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme in order to cover 10,000 people from 2013-14 and 20,000 people from 2014-15. Yet again, when it comes to the NDIS, this government shows its commitment to good policy process and to following through on that process with real reform and real funding. In 2011 we tasked the Productivity Commission with the job of considering the best way to provide better and fairer support for Australians with disability. Through that process it was brought home to all of us in government and to the wider community that people with disability face circumstances that vary wildly depending on which part of Australia they live in and on the cause of their disability, and that the funding and mechanisms currently in place to ensure a basic quality of life are at best patchy and are in some cases abominably inadequate. This is a long-awaited and long-overdue first step-and it is only a first step-but, as the representative of a community that is strongly engaged on the need to do much better in caring for people with disability and enabling them to live their lives as fully as everyone else and to lighten the sometimes unbearable weight that our current system places on carers and families, I can say that the arrival of the NDIS is hugely welcome. While of course I understand the effort and discipline required to make real reductions in government expenditure for the sake of returning the budget to surplus, that does not mean that I agree with all the measures through which this has been achieved. Like others, I have my own view on where savings should be made and my own sense of those programs and priorities that should not have been asked to provide reductions. I am glad that Australia's contributions in the areas of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance will increase by $300 million in 2012-13 and that we remain committed to reaching a level of contribution of 0.5 per cent of GNI. But I do not believe we should have delayed our progress towards reaching that level of foreign aid. Australia is in a very strong economic position and I do not see the justification for lessening, or slowing the rate of growth in our contribution to relieving the hardship and suffering of those of our fellow human beings who live not in relative poverty, like many in Australia, but in absolute poverty-those for whom rising electricity and fuel prices do not matter because they have no houses or appliances or cars. They are struggling just to find food and water to survive each day. To borrow the words of UK Prime Minister David Cameron, 'We cannot balance the budget on the backs of the world's poor.' As a representative from Western Australia, I want to conclude by addressing what seems to have become an entrenched myth about the role and place that my home state has within the federation. It is a myth that runs in a couple of different directions-and it is a myth that to a large extent is being perpetrated by a very small number of self-interested state politicians and mining magnates. The first aspect of the myth is the idea that Western Australia's resource sector is running so strongly that everyone in WA is basking in the economic glow. This is just wrong-and it comes as a shock to some people when they learn that the resources sector is only responsible for employing something like four percent of the Western Australian workforce. Yes, there are indirect benefits of the resources industry-but there are matching indirect costs, including the cost of housing and other goods and services. This means that those not directly or indirectly involved are actually living in a higher-cost environment, and this is particularly difficult for those on low and fixed incomes. The second aspect of the myth is the idea perpetrated up hill and down dale by the WA government, and by the WA coalition representatives in this place, that Western Australia is somehow being short-changed by the Commonwealth. That is absolute rubbish, and it is rubbish based entirely on a very narrow, selective, distorted and hypocritical view of the GST arrangements-which of course were put in place by the Howard government. CanI say how glad I was to read a fine piece of analysis in the West Australian on Monday pointing out that the expected reduction in direct government-to-government payments from the Commonwealth to WA over the next four years is $700 million, whereas the increase in mining royalties is double that, at $1.4 billion dollars in the next two years alone. As Shane Wright, the economics editor of the West Australian rightly points out: While certainly more GST would make their job easier, life isn't too bad when you're billions of dollars in front of where you thought you'd be just a couple of years ago. People who live in WA-including the coalition members in this place-should perhaps ask how it is that the WA government can only manage the barest real surplus of $26 million dollars in 2012-13 when its annual revenue has jumped $4.8 billion from last year? The fact is that the Barnett government continues to blame the federal government for its own failure to provide good economic management in Western Australia. While this federal government has delivered an unprecedented and transformative capital investment in schools right across WA, and a mining tax that will return a fair share of WA's resource development to Western Australians in the form of increased superannuation and new infrastructure, the Barnett government has presided over a 60 per cent explosion in electricity costs and the occasional colour picture of a poorly conceived waterfront development. The reality is that this federal Labor government has nearly doubled annual infrastructure spending in WA from $154 to $261 per Western Australian; it has provided the largest increase in payments for WA pensioners in Australia's history, with the addition of a higherpaying method of indexation for those pensions; and it has made a greater investment in public transport and road projects and school buildings in WA than any previous federal government. These transport projects include the Perth Link rail project and the widening of the Kwinana Freeway between the Leach and Roe highways, and of course the lion's share of the Gateway WA project, involving a major upgrade of the roads around Perth Airport. I am a proud and passionate Western Australian, and as such I am strongly conscious of the fact that there has been throughout Australia's history a gravitational pull that has centred on Canberra and the larger eastern states, with the effect that those of us who represent WA and South Australia, and who represent Queensland and Tasmania and the Northern Territory, need to keep our voices loud and clear about what goes on outside the Canberra-SydneyMelbourne triangle. It is precisely because I hold this perspective that I find the self-interested and baseless parochialism of some politicians and some businesspeople so disappointing. I have fought and will continue to fight for my constituents in Fremantle, and for my state, but I will always do so as a thoughtful and responsible member of the Australian parliament-and with a fundamental sense of belonging to this nation as a whole; a nation whose collective long-term interests we all share and from which we all benefit. This budget sits well in the sequence of economic blueprints that the Labor government have designed and implemented and that we will continue to implement in the provision of stable economic management, which in turn allows us to deliver on our ethos of a fairer and more forward-looking Australia. Debate adjourned. Federation Chamber adjourned at 19:29. Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Disability Reform, Housing and Homelessness: Credit Card Breaches (Question Nos 915, 916, 921 and 922) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform, and the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, in writing, on 20 March 2012: In respect of departmental credit card use in (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, and (c) 2010-11, (i) how many times has the use of a credit card breached departmental guidelines, (ii) what was the dollar value of each breach, and what sum was repaid in each instance, and (iii) were any employees disciplined for such breaches. Ms Macklin: The Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness and I provide the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) to (c)(i) The number of times the use of corporate credit cards breached departmental guidelines in the years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 is set out in the following table: Financial Year 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 Number of Breaches 79 72 64 (ii) The total dollar value of the breaches and repayment amounts for the years 2008–09, 2009-10 and 2010–11 is set out in the following table: Financial Year 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 Dollar value of breaches $8225.40 $4542.42 $4399.80 Amount repaid $8225.40 $4542.42 $4399.80 Amount not recovered NIL NIL NIL (iii) Most credit card breaches of departmental guidelines occur by mistake and are generally fixed by the card holder as soon as the mistake is realised. In all instances of breaches of the departmental guidelines, the offending officers were reminded of their obligations when using a corporate credit card. In addition, every instance of misuse of corporate credit card is reviewed and, where doubts exist, referred for further investigation. Such investigations resulted in the preparation of one brief for prosecution in 2009-10. Such action was not necessary in the other years.",262,Wyatt Roy As I Was Saying A Coalition Government Will Have The Productivity
