66,Mr Watt (Balaclava,"Treasurer)putting aside a certain sum to provide a sinking fund in connection with loans locally floated, we ought to do the same in regard to loans on British credit. This Bill will be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st July, 1916, the object being to validate something that # was done in that year. ""With the exception of a 5 per cent, contribution which was specially provided by Parliament for certain works, it seeks to establish a uniform sinking fund of J per cent, per annum. In the year 1916-17 a sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum was established by the Government of the day, but this appljed only to loans for war purposes. We think it time that all loans should be placed on the same footing, and that instead of putting by irregular amounts applicable to portions of our indebtedness, we ought to establish a sinking fund of 4 per cent, in regard to all loans floated by the Commonwealth in connection with the war. provisions relating to the uses to which , such moneys may be put. They may be used only for the purpose of re-purchasing, purchasing, or redeeming any security issued under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-15, repaying any moneys borrowed from the Government of the United Kingdom,. and paying any expenses incurred in connection therewith. No purchased, re-purchased, or redeemed stock is to be re-issued. There is another provision which entitles the Treasurer, in accordance with established State practice, to invest any moneys standing to the credit of the sinking fund in the purchase of any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Government of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, or any Australian State, and he may at any time sell such securities. The proceeds of all such sales are to be paid into the sinking fund. All moneys standing to the credit of the Stock Redemption Pund are to be transferred to the credit of the Loan Sinking Pund. Those, broadly, are the purposes of the measure, and honourable members will, I think, on careful examination find this proposal a healthier and more regular way of doing ""business than we have adopted in connection with our loans in the past. journed.

The main object of the Bill is to supply a deficiency in the Inscribed Stock Act caused entirely by the last war loan. When the Government decided to invite the banks to enter into a closer partnership with them in connection with the loan, and to consider the advisability of encouraging their clients, by special advances at low rates of interest, to lend money to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the loan, a new question arose. All the Inscribed Stock Acts of Great Britain, the Commonwealth, and the States have prevented a lien being registered against an inscribed stock registration. That is to say, nobody can pawn, or in any way hypothecate, the stock or interest. Yeti t became plain that if the banks were to advance 90 per cent, of the war loan offerings of every customer, they had to be sure that the customercould not l if t and sell his stock without paying the debt he had incurred to the bank on account of a special advance. In order that the banks might be protected when they gave favorable consideration to the Government's proposals, I took the responsibility of advising the Government to issue a regulation under the War Precautions Act giving the banks temporary power to register such a lien with the consent of their client. The purpose of this Bill is to substitute for that regulation a direct legislative enact-",24,Second Reading

When an employee has paid the f u l l amount they distribute in his name the number for which' he has paid. That has been done to my own knowledge by a large number of companies and associations -whic h w ill be known as section 5 1 G I propose to briefly explain the provisions of the B ill . Clause2 is a mere drafting amendment to remedy a technical defect in the principal Act. Clause3 is vital. It is to enable certificates of Hen to be accepted by the Registrar of Stock, in respect of moneys advanced by banks for the purpose of assisting the war loans. The banks naturally expect a continuation of this protection, ancl this w ill give it legislative and binding effect. Clause4 deals with the interest on war savings certificates, which are here referred to by their technical name as "" Treasury bonds."" The interest on. these war savings certificates, or Treasury bonds, as honourable members are aware, is payable at the end of a definite time, namely, three years. The purchaser of a £ 1 certificate pays for it 17s. 6cl. in cash, and it is worth f l at the end of the three years' period. The Treasury w ill pay that f l at fhe period of maturity, but there is not in our law any provision to enable the Treasury to set aside every year the interest payable on these war .savings certificates. Thus, when a certificate matures at the end of 'three years, the whole of the interest payable in respect of it falls on that particular year. proposing to spread the interest payable transactions. If , for instance, a holder of over the three years' period, so that at any of these certificates has f a m i l y the end of that term, when the interest troubles, or suffers great losses, and does becomes payable, the money w ill be availnot want to wait for the period of redempable for it? vides for the payment of the interest demption. into a Trust Pundi n three stages instead of one.

The second part of this clause gives the Treasurer power to repurchase these certificates out of the proceeds of war loans. There are only two ways in which such certificates can be redeemed.

We ask the Parliament to authorize us to set aside on the 1st of every month £ per cent, per annum of the whole of the war loans in Australia. That will not apply to the British war loan, because that stock is not on the market. It represents a loan between the two Governments, and there are no transactions in connection with it . The setting aside on the 1st of each month of $ per cent, means l-£ per cent, per annum, and on our present indebtedness it w ill amount to over £2,000,000 per annum. The further condition that is attached in the B ill to the exercise of this power is that when the f u n d to be created under it amounts to £1,000,000, no more money can pass into it until it falls to £900,000. That means that if further payments into the fund are not necessary to keep the loans active, and the price satisfactory, the f u n d will be stationary; it will remain at £1,000,000, or between £1,000,000 and £900,000. But if the Treasurer and his advisers should consider it necessary to keep building up a loan, this £ per cent, may go out as fast as it is coming in . If that should be necessary, and no one can quite t e l l ' how far it will be necessaryample opportunites for operations in respect of the several loans will be afforded by this B ill . essential provision that the Treasurer shall uot pay above par for the stock.

We shall be buying back our indebtedness at below par, and we sliall be performing a double service in affording a market to those stockholders who for any reason feel compelled to sell.

It will impose a penalty on people wbo err in this direction quite innocently, and will place persons who are desirous of complying with the law, and have no intention of evading it, in a very invidious position. A case in point would be that of a member of Parliament who included his election expenses as a deduction, on the ground that they are expenses incurred in earning his income. In my opinion, election expenses are a perfectly fair deduction to include in one's income tax return, but they are not allowed as such, and if an honourable member should include them in his return he would be liable to a penalty under this proposed new paragraph. The provision goes altogether too far, and is not a reasonable one. It is not a party matter. Honourable members are endeavouring to do all they possibly can to provide efficient machinery for the purpose of enabling the Commissioner of Taxation to collect the income tax. It should be our endeavour to rectify any blemishes that we find in the measure before us, and. to effect any improvements in it. As I consider that paragraph c is a blemish to the Bill, I move That paragraph c he left ont.

There are many which and just man, but he cannot possibly hope people may believe to be legitimate, but to deal with every case, and the taxpayer which the Commissioner may not allow. Honourable members have been very sympathetic in their attitude towards the Commissioner. They have allowed him a very generous latitude in order that he may collect the income tax, and reduce to a minimum losses which his office should not be called upon to bear, but it is asking the Committee to go too far to ask it to render a taxpayer liable to a penalty for including in a return as a deduction an amount which is not lawfully allowable. Nothing in this Bill will incite opposition on the part of the taxpayer more than this particular paragraph. I hope that the Treasurer, with whom I have already discussed the matter, will see his way to eliminate the first portion of it. [1-2.10] -Honorabl e members have recognised, with a great deal of sympathy, the. difficulty that the Commissioner encounters in performance of his duty, and they have permitted very drastic provisions to be inserted in this Bill regarding the furnishing of returns, because the object has been to prevent obvious leakage, and to throw on the taxpayers the burden and obligation of making returns. To do so was very necessary, because it is a notorious fact that there have been, considerable leakages in that direction. But the first j * ^ 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 paragraph c goes far beyond what the Committee should consider fair o$ reasonable.

I am pleased that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has agreed to limit his amendment to the words, "" an amount which is not lawfully allowable "" ; but paragraph b"" Fails to include any assessable income in any return.""-is also subject to very much doubt. However,, if we give the Commissioner the benefit of the doubt, and allow him to have the drastic powers for which he asks in. that respect, we should certainly not render any taxpayer. liable to. a penalty for including in. his return as a deduction an amount which is not lawfully allowable. I hope that the Treasurer will, agree to the amendment. In my last TeturnI included an amount, which I thought was permissible, by way of deduction. However, it was not allowed. I paid the amount at which I was assessed, and afterwards en"" tered my protest, only to find that the amount was allowable. Very few honourable members understand what is legally disallowable under the Act. It is such a complicated measure. One return which I have seen included an amount set down for repairs to the whole of a man's property, but that deduction was disallowed. It appears that under the Aot'a deduction in this respect cannot be made mare than once in three years. I do not think that this provision will be of any real assistance to the Commissioner of Taxation. It may rJbssibly have the effect of preventing people including in their returns expenses which should be allowed, in the fear that if they do so they may be penalized. It is not necessarily a crime to claim a deduction which is not legally allowable. The ofiicers of the Department must scrutinize every return, and it is an easy matter for them to disallow claims incorrectly made. In my view the Committee will be wise to accept the amendment. I believe that the whole of paragraph c of the proposed new sub-section should be omitted. It seems to me that the object of the paragraph is rather ""to reduce the clerical work of the Taxation Department than to prevent the undue inflation of deductions by taxpayers. In the preceding clause of this Bill, which has already been agreed to by the Committee, it is made an offence to send in a return which is false in any particular. It must be admitted that the undue inflation of expenditure to increase, a claim for deduction would render a return false in that particular and bring the taxpayer under the previous clause. There is therefore, no necessity at all events for the latter portion of paragraph c. I can give an instance to show how its operation would result in hardship to the taxpayer. I had the management of a trading concern, for which I sent in the income tax return. The whole of our expense for postage, was, connected with the conduct of the business, in sending out invoices, credit notes, and so on. I naturally thought that tlie postage would be a fair item for deduction, and so included it in the income tax return. It was disallowed by the Commissioner of Taxation. I am of opinion to this day it was fair to claim deduction for postage in that case. Under this paragraph that trading company would be liable for making a return of an amount in excess of that actually expended or incurred by the taxpayer. I do not think that an innocent mistake in the compilation of a return should be punishable. I agree that where there is a wilful attempt to evade taxation the provisions of the Act should, be as rigid as possible, and, as I have already said, I think that, the previous clause is made sufficiently tight to catch any one who makes a false return. There are many thousands of' people in Australia who find it difficult to make out income tax returns. Thousands are spent every year in their preparation. It costs some people an amount almost equal to the tax they have to pay to cover the expense of making out their returns. If an item is included in the deductions which ought not to be so included it will be an easy matter for the officer of the Taxation Department to disallow it. I hope that the honourable member for Hunter will not agree to amend his amendment, but will insist upon the omission of the whole of paragraph c. . I ask leave of the Committee to amend my amendment and to move the omission only of the wordsAn amount which iB not lawfuly allowable, or, Amendment, by leave, amended, accordingly.

We cannot get at that unless under the terms of the latter part of paragraph c of the proposed new sub-section. Cases of the kind to which I refer are fairly frequent, and many taxpayers take their chance, and in tliis way make claims which are not allowable. I , however, quite agree with honourable members that there are probably many cases in which taxpayers, owing to an imperfect knowledge of the law, include in their returns in quite a bond fide way items which are not allowable. culty in making up these returns. Thc compilation of State and Commonwealth income tax returns is on a different footing, and so it is an easy matter for a taxpayer to make a mistake. A missioner of Taxation that I should state there have been cases in which frauds have occurred through the absence of such words in tlie Act as are .included in the paragraph under consideration. In all the circumstances I think that it is, perhaps, better that I should aecept the amendment. Amendment, as amended, agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.' Clauses 42 to 45 agreed to. Clause 46Where it is shown to the satisfaction of tlie Commissioner that any person who was assessed to pay income tax under sub-section 2 of section fifteen of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1015 has paid the tax out of his own moneys, and has not been able to recover the amount of the tax from his principal, the Commissioner may refund to the person assessed thc amount of the tax so paid. Sir [12.25] I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to give further consideration to this clause. Under section 15 of the Act of 1915, agents carrying on operations on behalf of principals abroad were made personally liable, on and after the 30th June, 1916, for all business operations of their principals which took place in Australia. It was discovered later that this section seriously interfered with the business of British manufacturers, and practically gave a preference to the foreigner. In some cases a In an amending Act that section was repealed. It so happens that whilst the section was in operation many British merchants regarded it as their duty to obey the law, though they most strongly protested against it, and they paid the taxation levied under that particular section. There were others who resisted very strongly and never paid any taxation under it. Clause 46 of this Bill seeks to remedy, to some extent, the hardship created under section 35 of the Act of 1915. It provides that where an agent has paid on behalf of his principals any income tax incurred under the section which has been repealed, if the principal has refused to refund the taxation to the agent, the Government may refund it. There are a considerable number of cases in which the .British manufacturers have actually repaid the income tax paid on their behalf by the agents. These men were honest, prompt, and fair, but they will be penalized under this clause by being placed in a position of disadvantage as compared with the men who refused to refund the taxation paid by their agents. ber desires that the taxation paid under the repealed section shall be refunded whetlier it was paid by principal or agent? that the money paid by way of income tax under the repealed section by honest business men abroad should be refunded. I know that it is a difficult operation to take revenue from the Treasury once it has been collected, but it seems to me to be a serious hardship to British manufacturers, who promptly paid income taxation instead of disputing it, that they should be made to suffer under this clause as against those who protested against the taxation and refused to pay it, and whoMinister in charge of the Bill to give the case of .these men sympathetic and generous consideration. The contention urged by the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) is a sound one, and I hope that the Government will see tiheir way to accord equitable treatment to those men who recognised their obligations by paying the tax.

128,Sir Robert Best,"The Minister is at4. Except as provided in this section, the amendments of the principal Act made by this Act shall apply to assessments for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, and all subsequent years. Sir [12.39] I suppose that this is the most important provision of the Bill-important from the stand-point that it provides for retrospective operation of certain clauses which are enumerated in it. Under it we are asked to sanction the retrospective operation of the Act so far as those provisions aire concerned. As I have previously pointed out, it is a vicious principle for Parliament to sanction retrospective legislation. most important clause that will be affected by this provision is pretty bad is, but the money has already been collected. Probably section S is the most important provision in the Act which will be made retrospective. The provision has been inserted because of certain cases that have been decided by the Court-case s involving some very difficult and technical questions. Under the old law, all accumulations outside of the profit and los3 account, prior to the 1st July, 1914, were exempted from taxation. Buti t appears that a Mr Meares, who carried on a pastoralist's business, had appropriated the sum of £26,000 to what was called an appropriation accoimt. The Taxation Department ruled that this account was practically a profit and loss account. It is only fair to the Department to say that when the case went before the primary Oourt, Mr Justice Barton agreed witih that view. Subsequently, however, an appeal was made to the Full Court of the High Court, which decided that the account was not a profit and loss account, and that, therefore, the money standing to its credit was not liable to taxation. This decision, of course, completely altered the view of the Taxation Department, and the clause which we aTe now discussing has been introduced for the purpose of authorizing the collection of the tax in accordance with the former practice. Although the words aTe wide enough, I take it that the clause cannot possibly apply to the case of Mr Meares, who has already obtained a judgment in his favour. lutely certain, but I know the practice of short of an outrage if , after a judgment had been obtained from the High Court, an attempt was made by legislation to disregard that judgment. MT. BOYD -""We ought to have an assurance on the matter. Then there were two other cases which came before the Court-on e that of the Commercial Bank, Sydney, and the other Probably the that of the Bank of Few South Walesrelating to the question of what were accumulations, and therefore what amounts were free of taxation prior to the 1st July, 1914. In both these cases the system adopted by the Department .was challenged. In my judgment, the interpretation put upon the law by, the Commissioner of Taxation was entirely in accordance with the intention of Parliament, and whilst Mr Meares obtained a judgment, it must be recollected that he secured it, to some extent, upon technical grounds. I know that this question involves the sacrifice of a revenue of upwards of half-a-million sterling already paid into revenue, and consequently we need to be very careful as to how we deal with it. I am not prepared to accept the responsibility of opposing the clause for three reasonsfirst, because I believe that the interpretation placed upon the law by the Commissioner of Taxes, which was supported by Mr Justice Barton, was really in accordance with the intention of Parliament; secondly, because Mr Meares has practically succeeded on wihat was regarded as a technical point; and thirdly, that something lite £500,000 of revenue is involved. Of course, we cannot lightly attempt to deal with the matter under those circumstances, but at the same time we should register a protest against this vicious principle of retrospective legislation. I am in sympathy with the Commissioner in this regard, but I hold that the Bill should have been introduced immediately after the decision in the action to which I have referred.

I am sorry to be obliged again to ask the Minister for an assurance with regard to the position of co-operative societies, ahout which there seems to be some misunderstanding. I have had an assurance from the Minister that the method of taxation with respect to such bodies will not be altered by this amending Bill, hut I am still receiving letters to the effect that those associated with co-operative societies doubt very much if this is so. I think it would be very much better if , in addition to giving the Committee an assurance, the Minister could, by means of the press, remove any doubt in connection with this matter. Home and Territories) [2.16] I have already told the honourable member that the Bill will not make any alteration with reference to co-operative societies, and I shall be only too pleased to draw attention to the fact in order to remove any misconception in the minds of those concerned. should like a clearer definition of a "" club, society, or other similar association."" When I brought this matter up before, I do not think the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) gave the Committee a very definite reply. I pointed out that there were a number of associations outside the clubs to which the Treasurer alluded, and which, apparently, will be liable to taxation under this provision. I think the Minister in charge of « « « « # # the Bill should be in a position to say definitely whether the organizations I mentioned will come within the scope of this Australia. measure. Home and .Territories) [2.18] -The consisting of earnings, position of clubs is set out in the dewages, commission, fees, cision in the Bohemian Club case, realported in the Argus Law Reports of 16th retiring allowances and April. In that case it was decided that the annual subscriptions of members of social clubs were not regarded as income within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915-16. I think the Chief Justice decided that the subscriptions of members were to be regarded in the same light as if a single man had paid a sum of money for a certain benefit. # * # * * # That is to say, if one man, by paying a certain amount of money, could get certain social benefits, he would not be liable ' to be taxed upon that payment as such, and if the persons making the payment were multiplied by 100 or 500, the position would not be altered. ment went further, and stated that subscriptions were not revenue, but capital. That is practically what it said. well if I read the remarks of the Chief Justice on this pointThe argument is, indeed, founded upon a complete misconception of the nature of a club, which is a voluntary association of persons, who agree to maintain for the common personal benefit, and not for profit, an establishment, the expenses of which are to he defrayed by equal contribution of an amount estimated to he sufficient to defray those expenses, and the management of which is intrusted to a conunittee chosen by themselves. On principle it is quite immaterial whether the contributors are 2 or 300. If there were two or three only it would not occur to any one to say that the two or three are collectively in receipt of income from the individual.

Amendments made in the clause have necessitated a re-drafting, and I move, thereforeThat all the words after the words "" Principal Act,"" line I , be omitted with a view to the insertion of the following words in place thereof:""made by paragraphs (e) and (7i) of""sec-* ' tion 2, section 5, paragraph (d) of section S, and paragraph (b) of section 10 of this Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the date of the commencement of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915. 2.

The substituted clause w ill cover the amendments, that have been already made, and w ill involve no alteration in prin ciple, except that it w ill bring the clauses dealing with penalties into force as soon as the B ill is passed. As the B ill has been drafted, the enforcement of those penalties might have been postponed to a period which was not intended. guarantee that no honourable member understands the effect of the clause which the Minister proposes to substitute. this legislation retrospective to the commencement of the Act in 1915. We have already passed clauses which, we were told,, would relate only to subsequent collections, but we find that, according to the substituted clause, those provisions are to be retrospective. If we are making legislation retrospective, every honourable member should have an opportunity of knowing the exact effect of what we are doing. The proposed amendment should be circulated amongst 4LOIIorable members, and, in the meantime, the clause should be postponed. The Minister has promised to recommit the B ill , and I think it would be wiser to include this proposed substituted clause in the recommittal. Then the amendment he desires to make can be placed on the notice-paper, and honourable members w ill have an opportunity of seeing its effect. I protest strongly against an amendment such as the Minister has read being pushed through the Committee without a copy of it being in the hands of honourable members.

It contains about 5 acres of park land. I understand that it is the intention of tlie Government to resume another 5 acres which will increase the area to 10 acres. The land borders on the Leichhardt Canal. recreation purposes. Dr. for children ? suggestion p u t forward by the honourable member for Dalley because I realize that the site chosen by the municipal council is f a r more suitable as a playground for children. The area to be acquired is not more than 300 yards from the Leichhardt Canal, and is right at the extreme end of the suburb, whereas the cemetery which it is suggested should be taken in exchange is situated exactly in the centre, and is far more accessible to the children and residents of the district. I sincerely trust that the Government will see their way clear to give effect to the transfer, because if it be carried out, not only will residents of Leichhardt not be deprived of park lands, but they will also be benefited by-it.

The Defence Department have purchased in the different States very considerable areas of land as manoeuvre areas. In New South .Wales they have spent a considerable sum of money in the purchase of hundreds of acres at Liverpool Plains. They have also purchased a large area of land at Broadmeadows, about 10 miles outside of Melbourne. One of the reasons given for the purchase of the land at Broadmeadows was that later on the Department would be able to devote a portion of the land to the establishment of military stores. frontage is wanted. not say. tary men never, do say why they want a .particular thing.

220,Mr Fenton,"There is a railwaywould appear that a different policy is to be adopted for New South Wales from that followed in Victoria, and land for Ordnance Stores is to be purchased at considerable expense in Sydney, although the Government are already in possession of land suitable for the purpose of the erection of permanent Ordnance Stores. Stores to be erected at Leichhardt are to be permanent, according to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr is characteristic of the age, which is disWatt). have been told that the Camp at Liverpool is to be permanent. I want to know why it should be necessary to encroach upon park lands within 4 miles of the Sydney General Post Office, in order to secure a site for the erection of Ordnance Stores. the erection of the stores at the Leichhardt site would save hundreds of pounds in transport charges. that this should be a matter of bargaining between the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) and the Government. If this proposal is agreed to we shall have the Naval and Military authorities seeking to invade other public parks to suit their personal convenience, when the purpose to be served might be just as wel'l met by the acquisition of sites outside city areas. inquiries by the Public Works Committee it was found that big firms in Sydney and other places were adopting the policy of purchasing land in suburban areas, where sites could be obtained cheaply, for the erection of their large store houses. That is a commercial policy now being adopted in all the large cities of the Commonwealth. viduals see their way to save money by the adoption of that policy we may safely take a leaf out of their book. I had no opportunity to speak on the Other stages of this Bill, so I enter my protest [3.44] I should like to say that I also at this stage. I stand up to protect the am totally opposed to any public parks few park lands we have in close proximity being acquired by the Government or any to our large cities from the invasion of one else if the lands set apart for the the Naval and Military authorities, especially when the Defence Department already has land better suited for the purpose of military establishments. also desire to utter a final protest against the passing of this Bill. I deplore the tendency of modern times to encroach upon park lands dedicated to the public. Wherever we go we find business men taking the most direct and easy way to obtain their ends. They appear to find it the' easiest way to encroach upon public parks for commercial purposes. It tinctly a commercial one. Thirty years ago it would have been impossible for any Government to take lands which had been set apart for the use of the public. I have no doubt that you, sir, have taken part in agitations against the use of public parks for improper purposes. I can remember the time when the people of Sydney used to take up the .fences put round lands there, and I believe that the name of Mr Speaker (the Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) was associated with an agitation of that kind. We appoint medical commissions to inquire into the best means of maintaining the public health. ""How to save the babies?"" is a question that is now frequently asked, and we have doctors appointed to take the height and weight, and examine the eyes, ears, and teeth of children in our State schools, with a view to securing a standard of health amongst them which will ensure a virile race of people. In spite of this we neglect one of the best means of keeping children in good health In the course of the by failing to supply them with sufficient playgrounds attached to their schools and sufficient public areas-in which they may play. I do not happen to know the particular site referred to in this Bill, but it is quite sufficient for me that the Government of New South Wales thought it good enough to proclaim it as a public park. AlthoughI may not go so far as If private indito call for a division on the third reading of the Bill, I shall be prepared, if it goes to a division, to vote against it.",43,Maloney N O T Fo R A Playground Venience Of Transport

Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has made an extraordinary suggestion. At a time when we should be anxious to make every saving possible he suggests that these Ordnance Stores should be established at Liverpool, that the stores should be taken all the way to that place and then taken back to Sydney for distribution. interest upon the sums which we pay for freight at present would go a long way towards defraying interest upon the cost of constructing these buildings. I am of opinion fihat the erection of the proposed Ordnance Stores in the park will not constitute a menace to the locality, but will, on the contrary, improve it by securing the utilization of land which is not suitable for recreation purposes. protest against the resumption of this land for the erection of Ordnance Stores. In other suburbs of Sydney ample areas, eminently suited for that purpose, are available, and any of these areas might be utilized without encroaching upon park lands in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis. foreshores of Port Jackson have already been alienated to'such' an extent that the public can scarcely gain access to them. This is a deplorable condition of affairs, and one which evidences great short sightedness on the part of those responsible for it. It is true that the suburb of Leichhardt has a population of only about 30,000, but it must be remembered -that this particular park serves as a reundertaking in writing to me, and deficreation ground for at least 100,000 people. I am glad that in 1906 this Parliament, in its wisdom, decreed that no public reserves should be resumed by the Oommonwealth. It evidently recognised that the time would come when the House On making inwould contain a number of park butchers. I protest against the resumption of this land, which is situated in the most densely populated portion of .Sydney. As a matter of fact, it provides the people of the suburbs immediately adjacent to it with their only outlet to the water, to The present park at Leichwhich the State Government have provided a tramway to convey the people. For proposing such a rascally move, a vote of no-confidence in the Government is I have been informed that two abundantly warranted.

Originally it was stated by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) -and I now repeat it-that no proclamation would be issued for the taking over of this land unless some arrangement was first made with the Government of New South Wales to obtain a park in lieu of the acreage secured. The honourable member has suggested a way of doing that, in the letter he has placed before me, which indicates that there is a cemetery in the centre of the district that could be used as a play-ground after necessary work upon it. The Federal Government could not interfere with the State in its relation to cemetery matters. We could only promise to make representations to the New South Wales authorities. I hope that what was proposed in the telegram which Everybody knows that the I read out from the representatives of the Commonwealth in Sydney, namely, that the council was favorable to the transfer on the assumption that the State would apply the money to secure another park, will be carried out. All we can do, however, is to ask that the purchase amount be applied for that purpose. nitely state that the proclamation will not be issued unless what you have indicated is done? accordance with the promise of the Acting Prime Minister.

I have quite a vivid recollection of allegations, levelled more than once against the Labour party by supporters of my honourable friends opposite, to the effect that the Labour party was the party, of aU. others, whioh had no respect for the sanctity of the home, and I cannot imagine anything more calculated to break down family life than this proposal of the Governmenb to deliberately offer a premium to the youths of this country of eighteen years of age to disregard the wishes; of thoir parentsi n respect of this important matter of enlistment. ber say that a premium is being offered because the young men desire to serve their country? in the fulness of their manhood-and a n i mated, aa they would have us believe, by a burning patriotism, themselves ref r a in from enlisting, and refrain also from raising the maximum age to enable strong, able-bodied men to enlist and serve their country-see k to induce youths to disregard the wishes of their parents in this matter, I cannot help thinking that this Government and the party thafc stands behind them desire to fight tiheir battles with children in the f r o n t rank, and men in the area of safety. The war has been in progress for nearly four years, and the proposal of the Government now affects a class of persons wh'o All new members make were under fifteen years of age when the war was declared, while at the same time there remain exempt from service men My friends, including who, when this war broke out, were well under 45 years of age-men ; in fact, who told us that, at a later stage, they would I enlist.
