National Security Act was passed in 1939, and was expressed to endure not longer than what was described as ""the That reference was to the war between the K in g and Germany. middle of 1940, after It a l y hacl entered the war, the relevant section was amended to provide that the act might endure for the period of any war in which the K in g is or might be engaged and six months thereafter. The intention was to cover not only the period of the war with Italy, but also any other,development or extension of the war, such as that which subsequently occurred upon the outbreak of hostilities with Japan. The view then entertained by the Menzies Government and by the Curtin Government subsequently, and their legal advisers, was that the period of time in which the K in g might be engaged in any war marked A t the Central Coal the period which ended, not with the cessation of hostilities with any country, but"" with the cessation of the war. The view taken was that the cessation of war with a country was when a state of peace came about between the K in g on the one Consehand and that country on the other. Of course, the determination of this point is not a matter for the Parliament or for the executive government, but ultiAs this mately for the courts of law. It is proper to say, however, appropos the facts mentioned by the honourable member, that the machinery of government in the Commonwealth has always been operated on the assumption that the armistice of the 3r.d' September last was not the period mentioned in the National Security Act'as the date of the cessation of war, but only the date of the cessation of hostilities. The 3rd March is not the terminal point of the National Security Act. The time, when it w ill cease to operate has not yet been reached. Mr. Gregory Forster should not have quoted me as an authority for his reported statement, because what I am now saying at greater length is what I have already said in the House on several occasions. The decision on the matter is not for the Executive Government. by leaveThe honorJudge Drake-Brockman w ill no doubt give his decision in due time, but the final decision w ill rest w it h the courts The subsequently. of unconditional surrender. I do not wish to discuss that point at this stage. The date of the About the armistice in the first world war was the l l t h November, 1918, but that was not the date of the cessation of the war with Germany. The peace treaty was signed in June, 1919, and the 10th January, 1920, was proclaimed as the date of the termination of the war with Germany. the 3rd September taken as the commencing date of the soldiers' preference?

59,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-Genera lthe National Parliament could spend for any all-Australian purpose the money that it raises. In 1944, I warned the House and the country that, under the -Constitution as it stands, the legal foundations for even the most urgent modern social service legislation were doubtful and insecure. The High Court's decision last year in the pharmaceutical benefits case has shown that these doubts were only too well founded. The object of this bill is to place Australian social service legislation on a sound legal footing. Not only in Australia, but also throughout the world, there has been a marked development, in the present generation, in the realization that it is the community's duty to provide for its members benefits of a social service character. When the Constitution was adopted in 1900, the idea of even invalid and old-age pensions was new. But the framers of the Constitution recognized that such a matter could be dealt with more satisfactorily on an Australia-wide basis than by piecemeal and varied action on the part of separate States. This is just as true of other social services, such as, for example, child endowment, widows' pensions or medical benefits, which we realize to-day must be provided. Indeed, the argument for action by this Parliament is much Stronger to-day. Half a century of living together as a nation has made it repugnant to Australians that the measure of their social security should depend on the accident of their residence in one State or in another. I turn next to remind the House and the country what provision the Constitution, as it stands, makes for social service legislation by the National Parliament. The Commonwealth has power to make laws for "" invalid and old-age pensions"" : section 51 (xxii). It also has power in relation to "" insurance "", other than State insurance"": section 51 (xiv). Any other social service payments made by the Commonwealth must, therefore, rest on some other foundation. The only one available is the power implied by section SI, to appropriate money by law, from the Consolidated Bevenue, for the purposes of the Commonwealth. Por many years there have been two schools of legal thought on the meaning, iu this section, of the words "" the purposes of the Commonwealth "". The'wider view was that any purpose for which the Parliament chose to make an appropriation of money thereby became a "" purpose of the Commonwealth"". On this view, there were no limits to the purposes for which the Parliament could authorize the expenditure of money. Another, and narrower, view was that "" the purposes of the Commonwealth"" in section SI must be purposes indicated elsewhere in the Constitution as coming within the Commonwealth's legislative, executive and judicial powers. The Parliament, as I have said, has consistently acted on the wider view of its appropriation power. Until recently, the High Oourt had not been called upon to pronounce formally on the validity of this practice, although the matter was discussed by the court in 1935. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944 provided' for certain pharmaceutical benefits, payable out of the trust account established under the National Welfare' Fund Act 1943. The moneys which form this fund are derived from the Consolidated Bevenue Fund. The High Court, with one dissentient, held that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944 was beyond the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and therefore invalid. Without going into technical details of the reasonsgiven by the various justices, it may be stated that a majority of the court clearly rejected what I have called the wider view of the meaning of the words "" the purposes of the Commonwealth "" in section 8.1 of the Constitution. This decision throws serious doubt on the validity of a number of acts on the Commonwealthstatute-book, including several acts that provide for what are commonly referred, to as ""social services "". In considering the effect upon 'other Commonwealth acts of the principles laid down by the High Court in the pharmaceutical benefits case, the Government obtained opinions from Sir Robert Garran, K . C , of Canberra; from Messrs. Maughan, K . C , and Barwick, KC , of Sydney; and from Mr Ham, K . C , and Dr. Coppel, K . C , of Melbourne.

That is the object of this bill. I emphasize that the bill does no.t seek to extend the appropriation power in any other respect. The proposed alteration embodied in the bill is, therefore, limited to benefits of a social service character and, in the main, to benefits of a type provided for by legislation already on the. statute-book.

I answer the question at the moment by saying that, if the Constitution were altered to enable the Parliament to make provision for medical and dental services, that would authorize the Commonwealth to do everything incidental to providing those services. In other words, the Commonwealth could obtain the services of medical and dental practitioners, nurses and the like for that purpose; but the proposed alteration would not enable the Commonwealth to say, "" We shall make all practitioners , in the medical and",17,Second Reading

This proposal would not affect that, nor would it affect the right of a doctor or a dentist as an individual to practise his profession. wealtli law override State laws? Commonwealth to make use of the services of doctors and dentists to provide national medical and dental services. Under the power sought, no authority will be vested in tiie Commonwealth to control health generally or the general practice of medicine or dentistry, or to abrogate the right of the States to lay down the qualifications that must be held by those who wish to practise in those professions. I was saying that the proposed alteration is limited to benefits of a social service character and in the main to benefits of a kind already provided for by statute. The exceptions, or partial exceptions, are medical and dental services, and family allowances. Medical services had, to some extent, been provided for by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act itself, and dental services are so closely analogous to medical services that the Government considers that it would be illogical to enable the Parliament to provide for the one and not for the other. Tbe power to grant "" family allowances"" is probably wide enough to cover some of the other powers enumerated in the proposed paragraph, but it is intended to cover also analogous benefits which may fall outside the precise, wording of those other powers. It may be said that the Commonwealtli should, under the Constitution as it stands, make provision for social service benefits by conditional grants of money to the States. But the Governinent feels strongly that the effective and harmonious administration of such benefits is best -showed that at various income levels the ensured by a Commonwealth-wide administrative organization, and that the Commonwealth should have the power to carry out directly, and in its own way, the social services schemes on which tlie Parliament decides. The proposed powers will not deprive the States of power to make laws on the same subject-matters, so long as those laws are not inconsistent with Commonwealth law. As I have already shown, the constitutional alteration proposed by this bill is absolutely necessary if even fhe existing -Commonwealth social service measures are to be continued, let alone extended. adjourned. (OBGANIZED MAEKETING OE and Minister for External Affairs) [3.19] I move That thc hill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to alter the Constitution so that this National Parliament can deal effectively with what has become one of Australia's most urgent national problems-the organized marketing of primary products. The Commonwealth has done so during the war. Many primary producers are apprehensive of the future if the Parliament cannot continue to do so during the years of peace, and particularly during the difficult years that lie immediately ahead. In particular I instance organizations of growers of wheat, barley and potatoes. During the war, under the defence power, the responsibility for organizing the marketing of primary products has fallen squarely upon the Commonwealth. Despite the war-time dislocation of markets, the results have been highly beneficial to the producers. As long ago as 1944, it was estimated that the .mortgages and bank overdrafts owed by primary producers had been reduced by over £60,000,000 since the war began.

Australia's war-time marketing experience clearly shows the great advantage to primary producers of enabling ' a single national authority to lay down a plan for the marketing of primary products. history of Australian attempts to organize the marketing of primary products stretches back for at least twenty years before the war. The general object has always been to bring about price stability in the primary industries, to assist them to bear the heavy burdens of climatic ancercainty and'world competition, and to ensure for primary producers a reasonable standard of living and adequate economic security. The methods used have included "" pooling "", compulsory or voluntary; ""orderly marketing"" by means of zoning, quotas and the like; and arrangements to ensure better grading, parking, advertising and so forth. With the exception of the war years, attempts by this Parliament to give effective assistance to primary producers by organizing the marketing of primary products have encountered two constitutional difficulties. One is the fact that while the Parliament may make laws with respect only to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States, it may not make laws with respect to trade and commerce within a single State. The second difficulty is the requirement laid down in section 92 of the Constitution, that trade, commerce and intercourse among the States shall be "" absolutely free"". The present bill is designed to Range inobviate both these difficulties. Increase. 1943-44.

No effective plan can be worked out for the organized marketing of primary products which does not embrace all three types of transactions. In the second place, the new provision which the bill proposes to add at the end of section 51. will release from the requirements of section 92 any laws made for the organized marketing of primary products. The Something further should be said about section 92. It has heen the subject of judicial consideration in the High Court on 'many occasions, and also in the Privy Council. The exact effect of the decisions is exceedingly difficult to state. On many occasions, I have explained my view that section 92 does not altogether prohibit organized marketing. Some marketing schemes have been upheld, notwithstanding section 92, on the ground that they were directed not to the mere restriction of interstate commercial transactions but to the achievement of such objectives as the preservation' of standards of purity and quality, and the maintenance of supplies for consumers. Each marketing sclieme has to be examined in the light of its own particular facts and circumstances.

73,200 500 150 Dr. Evatt,"Yes, and has been intercommodities to tlie possibility of overthrow by the courts.. Our own experience with marketing legislation in the years between the two wars has shown how important it is that those responsible for the welfare of the primary industries should be in a position to formulate their plans with the certainty that they will not be upset on constitutional' grounds. Two decisions given by the High Oourt last year with regard to the effect of section 92, though not directly related to marketing legislation, have further illustrated the difficulty of advising what is and what is not permitted under that section. Government of the day, thought, in 1936, that marketing legislation ought not to be subject to section 92, and proposed a constitution alteration with that object in view. Subsequent decisions have shown that section 92 does not make all marketing plans impossible. But the section does make all marketing plans to some extent uncertain. The position in fact is still one of such doubt that action should certainly be taken now to clear it up for the future. This is one of the objects of the present bill. The bill extends not to the organized marketing of all commodities, but only to that of primary products. This is the field in which the need for extending the power of the National Parliament is greatest aud most urgent. The future of Australia's primary industries constitutes a special problem of such vital importance to the whole community that the existence pf national power to protect them is essential. ' The expression "" primary products"" is not a technical term, with a fixed legal meaning. But the phrase is in such general use that there will seldom be any doubt as to whether or not a particular commodity belongs to the category of "" primary products "". In the ordinary popular sense, "" primary products "" are understood to include not only the immediate products of such occupations as the agricultural, dairying and pastoral industries, but also certain processed goods derived directly from those products. All Australians, for instance, would immediately recognize butter, cheese, flour and dried fruits as "" primary products"", though not cakes or bread. There may, of course, be borderline cases. But there are dangers in attempting to define in advance the categories of constitutional power. The exceptional cases, if they arise, can safely be left for decision by the courts. If this Parliament is endowed with the power now sought, it will be able to deal effectively with a problem which transcends State boundaries. The marketing of primary products has ramifications which are Australia-wide, and the national interest demands that the Commonwealth should be free to take measures to regulate marketing in a This Parliament, and the manner that will serve not only the interests of producers but also those of the people of Australia as a whole. adjourned.

The object of this bill is to alter the Constitution so that this Parliament will be able, like the legislature of every State in Australia, to regulate, either directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employment in industry. The intention is to fill a gap which has been recognized by governments of all parties as one of the greatest .anomalies in our constitutiona] system. But in proposing to give this essentia] power to the National Parliament, the bill also imposes a restriction, ih order that Australians may never be made subject, in time of peace, to that most unpopular of war-time necessities, industrial conscription. During the war years, the industrialization of Australia, has made unprecedented strides. Old industries expanded, new industries were set up. Australia became for the first time an exporter of secondary products. A major problem of the peace will be to maintain and even increase this high level of industrial production.

75,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-Genera lDuring the war years, the defence power of the Commonwealth enabled this Parliament, and under its authority, the Government, not only to improve and extend tha existing machinery for conciliation and arbitration but also to deal directly, as occasion required, with almost every phase of the terms and conditions of employment. Wages, hours, holidays, and working conditions were regulated, in some cases for industry generally, and in some cases for particular classes such ns seamen, or women. These, wider national powers have been exercised with marked success. That is shown by the great expansion of industrial production that has taken place. You cannot secure and sustain increased production unless you can secure terms and conditions upon which employers and employees alike are willing to work. Broadly, this is what the war-time national powers achieved. What will be the position when the defence power has.shrunk to its normal peace-time scope? TJnder the -present Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in time of peace, this Parliament has no direct power to regulate terms and conditions of industrial employment in general. Under section 51 (xxxv) it can maintain, and, of course, modify and improve, the existing machinery for conciliation and arbitration-bu t only in relation to disputes, and interstate disputes at that. It could perhaps directly regulate the terms and conditions of employment of those engaged in interstate commence-that is, if they could effectively be isolated and defined as a distinct class. ' But that is all. It is not enough. The new power which the bill proposes to give to this Parliament will not in any way abrogate or curtail thc existing industrial powers given by section 51 (xxxv.). will supplement the present' conciliation and arbitration power in two vital respects. Eirs! , as I have already said, the existing powers of industrial regulation are indirect. It is an extraordinary anomaly that although this Parliament has exclusive authority over such matters as customs and excise, it cannot take direct responsibility for regulating wages and hours and industrial which are in actual practice linked inseparably with tariff questions.. The Or. Fivatl. problem of ensuring that employees shall get their proper share.of the benefits of a protective tariff system has always existed in Australia. The billwould enable this Parliament to deal with it effectively. Industry is entering a phase in which new conceptions of living standards, of welfare, and of leisure must be worked out. Under Commonwealth leadership during the war, Australia made striking progress in many of these directions. National leadership will be necessary if this progress is to be maintained in the different conditions in time of peace. Secondly, it is another extraordinary fact that only through processes originating in industrial disputes can there be any fixation under Commonwealth authority, in time of peace, of wages, hours and conditions of employment. The bill would enable Australia to lay aside the confused and technical system of regulating industrial relations in which the present Constitution has resulted. The peace-time powers of the Commonwealtli are insufficient to enable the Australian Parliament to tackle on a national basis thc problem of fixing standard working conditions in such a national industry as coal, which is the life-blood of the. industries of this country. Just the same must be said of industrial conditions in othcr basic industries. Since World War II . began, Australia has made important advances in organizing industrial peace. Exaggerated attention is often given to the industrial disputes that have taken place. I have said before in this House, and say again without fear of contradiction, that despite the unprecedented strain which the waging of total war placed upon industry, industrial relations have been incomparably better in World AVar II . than tbey T'he new power, however, were in World WarI . I do not suggest for amoment that the war-time, expedients in industrial regulation are fhe last word on the subject. I do suggest that the problem of improving industrial relations in Australia, cannot be tackled radically or fundamentally so long as the present Constitution stands. The bill lays clown that the proposed conditions, new power of the Parliament to make laws witli respect to terms and conditions in industry shall not be exercised so as to authorize ""auy form of industrial conscription"". In Australia, this, phrase originated in the National Security Act 1939, which imposed exactly the same restriction as the present bill contains. In view of the desperate position in which the British Commonwealth found itself in 1940,. this prohibition Was in elTect repealed. By virtue of the amending National Security Act 1940> the manpower system was established, under whicli men ancl women were directed into the service of specific employers, and were {ivevented from leaving tiieir employment. Jnder the present bill, such a system would not be possible in time of peace. The most important, aspect of this bill, however, is the positive powers it will confer. It will enable this Parliament to fix standard hours in any industry, though not in occupations that are not industrial in character, in accordance with the distinction betAveen industrial and other types of employment drawn by the decisions of the High Court under section 51 (xxxv.). It will enable disputes to be'arbitrated upon if they are industrial in character. Employment of many types does not fall within that category. It will enable this Parliament to fix the basic wage, in accordance with the requirements of the present day, or to fix the principles on which it shouid be assessed-rwhic h probably woulcl be the sounder method of approach. It will also enable the Parliament to fix the maximum weekly liours of labour that may be worked in industry throughout the Commonwealtli. It will enable this Parliament to continue the important work formerly carried out by the Women's Employment Board. The National Parliament wili thus be in a position to deal effectively with one of the great industrial problems that have grown out of war conditions-the entry into industry of many thousands of women workers. In short, the bill will enable this Australian Parliament to discharge all the normal responsibilities of governinent in nn advanced industrial democracy. those powers in each of the States are possessed by the respective State Parliaments. adjourned. 653 Debate resumed from the 20th March (vide page 431), on motion by Mr ClIIELEYThat the bill be now read a second time. Leader of the Australian 'Country party) [3.38] -The direct effect of this bill is i:o define, within fairly strict, limits, thc quantum of tax revenue which each State sliall have annually' to carry out ifcs sovereign functions. State borrowing is already rigidly controlled through the Loan Council^ and consequently the annual expenditure of each State for the future will be largely within Commonwealth control. As money is the lifeblood of any legislature, this bill completes what is without doubt the widest and most important transfer of sovereign powers froin the States to the Commonwealth since the financial agreements were reached about fifteen years a.go The agreements both then ; and now have been ushered in by extra'ordinary emergencies. On the first occasion, the determining factor with regard to the agreement which limited the States' control over loan finance was a worldwide depression. On this occasion the opportunity for control of the States' finances in the direction I have indicated was provided by war. The system formerly introduced is now perpetuated, not so much because it makes a. desirable redistribution of sovereignty, but because it is an established fact whereby the taxpayer is saved the trouble of making more than one taxation return. Consequently, there are debits and credits in the system, depending' on whether it is viewed from an individual, a State or a Commonwealth angle. Simplicity appeals to the individual, for there is freedom from the worry of filling in more than the minimum number of forms. Viewed from a broader angle, however, the provisions All of of this bill could prevent the States from obtaining the revenue increases naturally resulting from development within their borders.

77,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"money are not felt until years after the expenditure has been incurred. The measures we are now considering need to be sufficiently flexible to meet the changing conditions, in order to give to a State such as Queensland the benefits of capital expenditure over the years. A formula is often an unsuccessful attempt to standardize things which are irreconcilable. For instance, the financial requirements of a growing youth, a reformed' spendthrift and a successful middle-aged business man are subject to entirely different factors. Put Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria in the place of the examples which' I have just given, and we realize that this bill contains the germs of future friction between State and State and between Commonwealth and State. It is beyond the art of man to devise a formula providing an overall satisfactory .compromise between State productivity, development and capacity to pay, on the one hand, and adequate taxation return through Commonwealth instrumentalities on the other. Difficulties in this direction could quite reasonably cause one or more States to have a legitimate grievance on the ground of the unfairness of their treatment under the scheme. Perhaps some adjustment could be made in future by a more flexible formula, or by the incorporation of machinery quicker adjustment anomalies which will inevitably arise as a result of experience. Just as the future holds different destinies for. the Australian States, depending on their natural productivity and the diversity of raw materials contained within (heir boun^ claries, so have their historical backgrounds been different. It is much easier to have a standardized tax for the Commonwealth than it is to establish standardized taxation systems in all of the six States. There are bound to be occasions when one State can legitimately claim that its inhabitants are, in fact, subsidizing the residents of other States, even though individual taxpayers are all taxed on the same basis. However, arguments pro and con about uniform taxation are beside the point at this stage. We are now presented with an accomplished fact. The Commonwealth Government has decided that it will brook no Mr Fadden. interference. It called the Premiers of the various States together, and they agreed on a formula which we are now asked to ratify. No doubt the premiers found themselves somewhat restricted in their choice. Indeed, they were in the position of a man who has either to compound with his creditors or go bankrupt. Thus, we have an opportunity now to ratify or reject an agreement reached, reluctantly it may be, by the State premiers. If this bill be not passed, the States will get nothing. If it be passed, they will receive the amount to which they have agreed. In view of this, I do not intend to oppose the passage of the bill. This bill purports to continue indefinitely the uniform taxation legislation passed by this Parliament some time ago. As has been pointed out, the financial control exercised by the Commonwealth through t.he Loan Council, and through this legisreticulated lation, will limit for all time the amount of money which each State may receive for State purposes by way of either revenue or loan. It seems to me that the bill is wrong in principle, not because it proposes to continue uniform taxation-honora'bl e members will recall that I supported the principle of uniform taxation when the general providing legislation was before Parliamentto correct the but because it lays down for all time a formula which must be wholly em-, pirical. AlthoughI am in favour of the indefinite continuance of uniform taxation, I believe that it would be wiser to continue the system under a formula which woulcl have application for a limited number of years only, and to provide for reviewing the position at the end of that period. When the review took place, it would not be with the idea of possibly returning to the system of dual taxation, bnt in order to see whether the formula was just as between the parties. It should not be forgotten that things are, at this time, iu a state of flux. To-day, notice was given of three bills, the purpose of which is to make provision for the alteration of the Constitution. It may be that some of the proposals will receive the support of the people. Perhaps other proposals will, in",24,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading
78,Mr Spender. (Warringah) [3.48],"time, be agreed to for tbe alteration of tbe Constitution. N'o one can predict what the future may hold in this regard; but if additional powers are transferred from the States to the Commonwealth then, to that degree, nnancial burdens will be removed from the States and laid upon the Commonwealth; yet the formula laid down in this bill makes no provision for changes of that kind. Let us suppose, for instance, that all social services are ultimately transferred'from the. States to the Commonwealth. The present formula provides for an adjustment of payments on the basis only of variations of population and of the living wage. If . however, social services are' transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, the States will be relieved of heavy expenditure, and the claims upon the Commonwealth will be consequently increased. As I have said, no provision is made in the bill for such a contingency. For that reason, I suggest that the proposed arrangement should be extended for a period of only four or five years, and tliat it should then be reviewed. Another objection is that the formula for the distribution of revenue has been based on the amount of revenue which the States were receiving just prior to the commencement of uniform taxation. It is well known that Victoria, for example; expended on social services and education substantially less per capita than did New South Wales. Thus, Victoria will be limited in its expenditure on education ' and social services to the standard existing when uniform taxation was first introduced. Wben we consider the basi.s of distribution for the financial years 1.946-47 and 1947-48, added point is given to my argnment. The amount allotted to New South Wales is £16,477,000 and to Victoria £8,860,000. This allocation bears no relation whatever to the population of the States concerned, or to problems existent, or likely to arise in the future. It is based entirely upon what the States were expected to receive in revenue during the base years. This is another reason why the formula should be reviewed from time to time. I am net seeking to qualify anything which I -previously said in support of uniform taxation. Indeed, I take this opportunity to endorse it. But, when we have before us legislation which is to operate indefinitely, it is most important to bear in mind the two points which I have mentioned. Both those factors are arguments, not against the principles embodied in the bill, but against the bill in its present form. I urge the Government to withdraw the bill and redraft it to provide for its operation during a definitely limited period.

It does not folloAv that the field of operation and the status of the States will remain stationary, and therefore I urge that the matter be reconsidered from that aspect. opposed to the continuation of uniform taxation, but I realize that it is futile to advance arguments against the bill, because the Government has made up its mind to bring about unification, and Avhen the division bells ring, its supporters will enter the chamber and vote as directed. A decision in regard to this measure Avill be made by Aveight of numbers, not necessarily by Aveight of argument. I oppose the bill because it is one of the greatest steps tOAvards unification that has ever been proposed in this Parliament. It has been said Avith some justification that "" Government is finance, and finance is government"". This bill is definitely aimed at the unification of finance, because it takes aAvay the sovereignty of the States.

This measure, if passed into laAv, Avill render the States financially impotent; it will reduce them to the status of vasaals and mendicants.

Less than a year ago the people spoke in no uncertain voice against the centralization of powers, but unfortunately, the State Premiers at the recent conference were bluffed and. bamboozled into signing away the b i r t h right of their .States.

The financial! In some degree, thar is A bad feature of uniform taxation is; that the spending of money by the States is divorced from its collection. Taxpayers haye only a remote control over State expenditure. A principle which permits one governnient to raise money to be expended by another is unsound, and is likely to induce a feeling of irresponsibility on the part of the expending authority. The refusal of the Commonwealth octopus to relax its hold and restore State control of income tax, drastically affects the powers, functions and responsibilities of the States as instruments of government. I shall vote.against the nieasure. Although the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has said that if this measure be not passed tbe States will receive n'o nioney, and if it be passed they will receive what is tantamount to a dole, and for that reason he would not oppose it, I shall take the risk of opposing it on behalf of Victoria, although I have not any lively expectation of securing the defeat of the nieasure. The people of Victoria are irrevocably opposed to this proposal, and they will suffer permanently if it be passed. They will lose the advantages that they had gained for themselves Over the years through good management which has made low taxation possible. services? any Victorian who is less well cared for, or less intelligent, than the average citizen of any other State. The point is this: Victoria by implementing a low taxation policy, encouraged industrial development, which in turn facilitated decentralization. It was solely because of taxation advantages that industries such as General MotorsHoldens Limited, Ford Company Limited, thc International Harvester Company and thc Phosphate Co-operati ve Company of Victoria were established in thai State. Despite its low taxation, Victoria suffered nothing in contrast with the advantages enjoyed in' other States. I oppose this measure because it seeks to make permanent a provision which was imposed originally for the duration of the war. The act is very specific on that point. Section8 statesThis Act shall continue iu operation until the last day of the first financial year, to commence after the date on which His Majesty ceases to be engaged in the present war, and no longer. Thc Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) supported that provision in later statements. PerhapsI am somewhat old fashioned, but I still believe in the sanctity of contracts. If the Commonwealth wished to retain its uniform tax powers for a longer period than was specified in thc act, section S should have been repealed, and a new approach made to the States. AlthoughI agree that the aftermath of war may create conditions that necessitate the continuance of special measures such as this, I believe that the Commonwealth should have, approached the matter in a different way. The Prime Minister, apparently, had that in view when he called the Premiers of the States together to discuss the future, of uniform taxation. No doubt he expected that because five out of the six Premiers were of the same political complexion as the Commonwealth Government, there would not be any difficulty in securing agreement; but to theconsternation of the Prime Minister and his colleagues, every State Premier opposed the Commonwealth's proposal. Mr 'CONELAN -They all agreed ultimately, opposed tbe proposal and were not backward in expressing their opposition. However, they were listened to patiently by the financial arbiter of their destinies, and when he thought that they had played around for long enough, he curbed their enthusiasm by telling them that they were talking a lot of "" coloured"" nonsense. I know that subsequently it was claimed that the Premiers had reached a unanimous agreement; but actually the only unanimity shown was in the acceptance of the alternative formula offered by the Prime Minister. In that regard their ""unanimous agreement"" was very much like that of Ned Kelly's victims when he pointed his gun at them and said-, ""Hands up"". They just had to agree.

Section 51 of the relate financial resources to requirements in Constitution providesever-changing circumstances. That simply means, I take it, that any static revenue in the periods of fluctuating expenditure which all governments must face, will defeat the efforts of a government to meet the demands for the development of its State. It means also that State development will not be determined by the will of the government of a State, but by the amount of ""dole"" that any future Commonwealth Treasurer cares to allow to it. I have no doubt that this meets with the wishes of those who claim to be unificationists', but I doubt if many of them have ever studied its implications. I am not a unificationist: I believe in State rights. I represent a province which industrially could be one of the greatest in Australia. Whether or not that province shall be developed depends to-day upon the voice of Victoria. If the unificationists had their way it would depend On the voice of the whole of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, if authority were more equitably distributed, and Gippsland became a State in its own right, its development would be determined only by the people of Gippsland. That, of course, applies equally to every other province in Australia. Only by this wider distribution of power can there ever be full development of the resources of the Commonwealth in this connection. The word ""unification"" is a synonym for ""stultification "". The people who prate' about unification do not know its implications, particularly in a country of Australia's Australia's vastness it decidely does Only then did I the right to develop itself, isolated as it Western Australia.

I do not claim . discrimination in the collection of the tax, but there is discrimination in the disbursement, and that, I think, conflicts very definitely with that provision. Victoria is the most heavily taxed State of all under uniform taxation. Whereas in 1940-41 federal income tax collected in Victoria amounted to £9,100,000, and S,tate income tax to £6,600,000, the uniform tax collected by the Federal Government in 1944-45 amounted to £52,000,000, an increase of 231 per cent. The next worse off State under the uniform tax is South Australia, where the increase is 198 per cent. I impress upon honourable"" members that that represents income tax only. Of the £70,000,000 collected in New South Wales last year the Commonwealth Government refunded 21^ per cent, to the State Government for its purposes, but Victoria received back only 12| per cent, of the tax is collected in that State. How can that be called uniform? How can that be described as not discriminatory. I do not know on what' the formula for 1946-47 is based. It has never been made clear.

Millions of pounds is to be taken from Victoria and given to New South Wales. Victoria does not mind giving New South Wales a helping hand; it is normally capable of doing so; but I am concerned about the fairness of the system. That should appeal to the Minister. The unfairness of the Government's proposal cannot be denied. This measure will be placed on the statute-book by sheer weight of numbers. Buti f the Minister will ' guarantee that the constitution of this House at this very moment will not be altered within tlie next twenty minuses, I shall call for a division now, and I think I shall be able to havo this measure thrown out. My State opposes it with good reason. 14.19j -This measure cannot be called a party one. It is an attempt by the Commonwealth Governmeut to continue in peace-time the uniform tax applied in war-time with suoh advantage to all. Much can be said in favour of the bill, and something against it. From the people's point of view, one advantage is that some limit ean be placed on the taxing powers of States that prior to the introduction 'of the uniform tax overtaxed their peonle. Another advantage derived from uniform tax is the elimination of multiple returns and assessments and different tax acts and regulations. Some of the States did go beyond reasonable limits in levying, taxes. The imposts were so severe that they were a deterrent to progress. As a Queenslander, I welcome this provision because, before the introduction of the uniform tax, Queensland was the highest taxed State in the Commonwealth, and consequently was unable to compete with States not so heavily taxed' in the development of new industries. As a Victorian, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) naturally feels some disappointment, but my disappointment is differently based. I am disappointed because the Priine Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) saw fit to buy the concurrence of the State Premiers in the continuance of uniform taxation. At a> time when the Australian people were looking for a reduction of taxes, the Commonwealth Government limited its capacity to reduce the income tax by increasing the amount to be reimbursed to the States by £5,74/5,000. Apparently, the Commonwealth did not want that money, but, instead of handing it back to the taxpayers, it will hand that sum to the States. Victoria in 1946-47 is to receive £S,860,000, as compared with its present reimbursement of £6,890,000, an increase of just on £2,000,000. The reimbursement to New South Wales has been increased by £960,000 to £16,477,000. Some' honourable members have complained that the reimbursement to New South Wales is disproportionately high compared with the payment to Victoria, but the scheme provided that the reimbursement should be calculated on -a population basis, and general and social services commitments of each State before the introduction of uniform taxation. Beimbursernent to meet the cost of widows' pensions and other social. services was the first charge on tax collections. For many years, New South Wales provided more generous social services than did Victoria, and for that, reason the reimbursement to it is higher proportionately to the payment to Victoria. However, the existing basis of payment is not rigid and permanent. If the Commonwealth's Constitution alteration proposals be endorsed by the people, Victoria will achieve equality with New South Wales in the treatment of its widows and other recipients of pensions.",29,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

92,Mr Been Ard Corser (Wide Bay),"Sir FRED.EI5J.CIC STEWART -Tii e Commonwealth has relieved New South Wales -of most of its social service commitments since the passing of the original act. less the Commonwealth will ultimately assume responsibility for all social services, but tiie necessary money will still be provided by Australian taxpayers. As the representative of a Queensland electorate. I do not desire to be parochial, t am gratified that the uniform taxation has not only abolished the old system of dual taxation, but also provided more money for developmental purposes in -Queensland. Unlike New South Wales, Queensland did iiot embark upon great irrigation schemes. For years, the northern State wasted millions of pounds, and failed to provide many social service people. Queensland expanded its railway system, and embarked upon certain other works which were expected to yield .a return to thc Treasury. Some of their -operations resulted in losses. As I have indicated, the basis of tlie reimbursements is not rigid. The bill provides for their. review. .Either party has the right to request an adjustment of the present basis of distribution if a niajor change i i i the rela* tions between the Oommonwealth and any 'State affects the finances of that State. That change may occur-whetlier hy reason of a substantial alteration in the powers, functions or responsibilities of general financial system. the Commonwealth or of any State or StiitoS or otherwise. If the States assume any new responsibilities, either party shall have tlie right, at the end of seven years, to request a review of the general basis of reimbursement. I hope that under this legislation the States will have an adequate amount for their purposes, but 1 also hope that the agreement will ultimately enable the Commonwealth to reduce taxation in -order to relieve the people of the great financial burden which is . crushing them to-day. Earlier, I complained that the Commonwealth Government, in continuing uniform taxation, had handed to the States £5,745,000. In my opinion, that'money should have been utilized for the reduction of war expenditure. Honourable members should debate this bill, not from a State or party standpoint, but from the national standpoint. At thc same time, the State view must be considered. Honourable members should not oppose the bill, because it contains a provision for t.he calculation of payments to the States, not only oil a population basis,, but also by taking into account the social services commitments of each State to relieve poverty and distress, and help the sick and maimed, and widows. -No honourable meniber will contest the necessity for the introduction of uniform taxation in war-time. When the seheiiio was introduced, the Government proposed tliat the operation of uniform, taxation should be. limited to the duration of the war. That was reasonable. In order to meet rapidly-mounting war expenditure, benefits for its indigent the Commonwealth was obliged steeply to increase taxation, aiid ' Commonwealth taxes, of course, were superimposed on the already high taxes levied by the Stat,p.*. Tf uniform taxation had not been introduced, the combined rates of Commonwealth and 'State taxes oii the higher incomes would have exceeded 20s. in the £J.

WhilstI admit that for a long time the Commonwealth will have heavy commitments, we should not regard uniform taxation as a permanent measure in out However, honourable members were not left in. doubt as to the intentions of the Government. At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held last January, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) saidThe States hacl surrendered no powers of taxation to the Government, as it was clear from the decision of thc High Court that they had no powers wliatever to surrender. By that Statement, the Prime Minister made it perfectly clear that he was opposed to any attempt by the States to recover their right, to impose taxation. Now, the State Governments have a responsibility to administer and develop their territories arid while we retain thc present federal system, we must recognize their sovereignty. If we fail lo do so, we must adopt without hesitation the policy of unification. If that sys'tem is to be",30,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

94,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [4.32].,"perpetuated, this is a unification measure; but it does uot offer any of the advantages claimed for unification. Undei uniform taxation the Commonwealth Government is not responsible for the development of the States. Each State is granted a sum of money agreed upon at a conference of Oommonwealth .and State Ministers; and the CommonAvealth will increase, or decrease, that dole ing this country? just as party political considerations in the various States dictate. That is not a scientific approach to this problem. It, is simply bargaining at conferences. Under this system the States will be enabled to disclaim responsibility for development, or, indeed, responsibility to .obtain the best value for expenditure of this money. That system encourages a trend already noticeable in government financial policy. It will tend to perpetuate wastage in governmental expenditure, because State governments will not be directly accountable to the people for the use of this money. The principle of State responsibility for thc raising and expenditure of State revenue is completely destroyed under this system. Let us look at the developmental problems confronting the States. N'o one would say for a. moment that the resources of the Commonwealth have been fully developed. Having regard to this proposal, who is to take the responsibility for the further development? This system means that State governments which have no responsibility for collecting revenue, but which will merely be given a grant by the Commonwealth for developmental purposes, will, with, the disappearance of direct responsibility, tend to expend the money primarily to gain party political advantages. That is bound to occur. The result will be. fhat essential developmental work which will return no party political advantage will not be undertaken. Will the Commonwealth Government ensure that this money will be expended on wi --c developmental projects? Of course -not. The re-imbursements to the States will be determined as tbe result of bargaining at conferences. Increases will be granted as sops to the States, or in order to prevent the State premiers from ""ganging up"" with the object of asserting their responsibility within their respective spheres. Under uniform taxation neither the States nor the Commonwealth will be responsible for development. The Commonwealtli will "" pass the buck"" by saying that it has made millions of pounds available to the States for. developmental purposes. Which authority will then have the responsibility of developUnder genuine unification that responsibility would rest upon the central government; but this measure, whilst being unificationist in form, is not unificationist in fact. Eor that reason the measure should be rejected. If we are to recognize the federal principle, the Government sliould put a term to the continuance of uniform taxation, and undertake to restore to the States the right to collect and expend revenue required for essential developmental works. Such responsibility is fundamental to sound government within the States; and by depriving the States of that right we shall strike a blow at their sovereigntyI f that be the intention of the Government, it should adopt unification immediately in a form in which the central government will accept direct responsibility for the development of the Commonwealth. I repeat that under the system to be perpetuated under the measure neither the central government nor the State Government will have that responsibility. We are not-now at war, and the Commonwealth Government does not need to continue to collect its huge war-time revenue Ihrough high taxation. Admittedly, the Commonwealth is responsible for developing territories which it directly controls. At thc same tinze, the States have a definite responsibility jo carry out, developmental projects in their own spheres; and the consummation of such projects is now a clamant need. However, because of party political exigencies the system embodied in the measure will encourage "" buckpassing "" and "" duck-shoving"" by the various governments in order to escape responsibility for developmental projects. The States will adopt Ihe line of least resistence, being content to appeal to the Commonwealth from time to time to increase their doles. Let us examine how the reimbursements were increased at the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. were: New South Wales, £960,000; Victoria, £780,000; South Australia, £1,000,000; Western Australia, £740,000; and Tasmania., £295,000, making a total increase to the States of £5,745,000, from £34,255,000 to £40,000,000. Honourable members know that the States have never had so much money and such little responsibility as they have at present. Honourable members know that the States themselves have no fixed plan of developmental works of any importance. Certainly, the States have had much to say about long-range plans; but those plans will not be brought to fruition under a system under which State governments will lend to expend these moneys in order to gain party political advantages. At present, the governments of a number of States are politically akin to the Governliberal approach to the-problem, we speak ment 'in power in this Naturally, the central government will tend to pay regard to the representations of governments of like colour in the States. The central government will be disposed to give to its political relations "" hand-outs "" sufficient to help them carry out particular strengthen their party political influence in the States concerned, and, at the same time, provide the central government with opportunities to increase its numerical. strength in this Parliament. other hand, the central government will, be disposed to cut down the dole to State governments which are not of its political colour, and by thus, preventing them from carrying out, essential works, discredit them. I cannot see one good reason why the system of uniform taxation should be perpetuated. During the war that system served a good purpose. 1 believe that it-will continue to serve a good purpose for the next three or four years. However, it should be terminated as soon as it has served that, purpose, so that the States will have the responsibility of carrying out their great developa protest against the continuance of mental schemes. We on this side of the House adopt exactly the same attitude now as we did when uniform taxation was introduced. This is not a party measure, and we insist on exercising the right to express our opinions freely. It is signifiamounts of money from the State of cant that Ministers and their supporters Mr Harrison. The increases have not yet announced their views. on this measure, although six or seven mem£1,970,000; Queensland, bers of the Opposition have done so. Perhaps the party "" steam roller"" has been run over them again. I should like to know their real thoughts on the matter. What does the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha), for instance, think of it? He is usually a fearless speaker, and I should like, to hear his views, as a representative of Tasmania. What does the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost), another Tasmanian, think of the bill, which is of great importance to the smaller States? It seems to me that this issue causes a. great deal of embarrassment to Government supporters, and that therefore fhey remain silent. We on this side of the chamber are fearless in expressing our opinions, and are not bound by party rulings. Having a naturally Parliament. either for or against the measure as we see its advantages or disadvantages to the system of federation and the sovereignty of the States. Certain members on this, side of the chamber gave to the Government all the support that it required when it introduced uniform taxation in order to meet war-time reprojects which will sponsibilities, and some of us will again do so because we realize that, for the next three or four years, there will be a severe demand upon the resources of the Commonwealth Government. However, unOn the less the Commonwealth Government restores to the States the right to collect their due revenues ancl the power t.o discharge their inherent responsibilities for developmental and administrative purposes, it will not be carrying out in' entirety the principle of federation to which we subscribe. It has been said that the. passing of this bill is a foregone conclusion; therefore, what I have to say will probably carry little weight. Nevertheless, as a representative of Victorian electors, I enter uniform taxation. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) has cited facts ancl figures which I need not repeat. He said that the method adopted by the Commonwealth in taking large Victoria under the uniform taxation",31,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading
95,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [4.47],"sclieme is reminiscent»of Ned Kelly's tactics. gentlemanly ""in comparison with the Commonwealth Government's action. It is the unfairness of the system to which I object. It is evident from the tone of speeches which have been made this afternoon, that opinions of memibers within the different political parties vary. My colleague, the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) said that the continuance of uniform taxation' would be beneficial to Queensland. I have no doubt about that. He also said that he doubted the fairness of the scheme. That is the point which worries me, because the scheme is unfair to Victoria. The honourable member said that millions of pounds of money had been wasted in Queensland. Is it fair that Victorian taxpayers' money should go to a State which has wasted millions of pounds? Victoria has been very enter-prising under sound governments. It seems that the more sound the government, the more enterprising the statesmen, and the more efficient the workmen, then ' the more will a State lose from its revenues ""under this system. For this reason, I am definitely opposed to the continuance of uniform taxation. Certain acts are necessary in war time, and uniform taxation was intended to be a wartime measure. Its continuance would not be in the best interests of Australia generally. It is wrong to make Victoria suffer on account of the high standards of governmental administration which it has established. The interests of other States would be better served by increasing their standards to those established in Victoria. Uniform taxation filches from the taxpayers of that progressive State revenue which could be used for further development, and hands it over to another State which-has been less.industrious. I would not be a proper representative of a Victorian constituency if I failed to protest against this measure, and I do so very definitely. This measure for increasing reimbursements from the Commonwealth to the States is both necessary and sensible. I was surprised to bear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) assert that the States had never had so much money as they have received under the Ned Kelly's methods were uniform tax system, and that they did not know what to do with what they had. That statement was an outrageous. generalization. One of the divisions of the Constitution-whic h has been a weakness in the Constitution-assign s to the States expenditure departments, such as those dealing with health and education, whereas revenue producing departments, such as those dealing with posts and telegraphs, and trade and customs, are assigned to the Commonwealth. The States are committed to enormous expenditure under their social service schemes, for instance* merely in adjusting to the changed cost of living wage payments to employees in social services departments. There is no doubt that, when wage-pegging ends, as it will have to end ultimately, the permanent change which the war has made in the cost of living will make it necessary for the States to pay liigher wages to teachers and civil servants. The honorbull) asserted that Victoria's low taxation level was due to the progressive policy of that State. On the contrary, it is due in the main to the fact that Victoria, in spite of its industrialization and its great wealtli by comparison with Western Australia, has thoroughly backward standards of social services, teacher training, and civil service generally. Honourable members opposite contend that uniform taxation should not continue after the war. The honourable member for Wimmera, amongst others, seems to be subject to the delusion that war finance ends on the day that war ends. It is obvious that the Government must pay troops while they are waiting for demobilization. It must also be obvious that certain new costs of government have arisen as the result of the war. For instance, the budget must include £75,000,000 for war gratuities, £54,000,000 for deferred pay, and £62,000,000 to pay off a debt t'o Great Britain. representing a total of £191,000,000 of new costs. I do not believe that any of these provisions are opposed by honourable members opposite. They have expressed their approval of them in general terms, and yet now they say that, since the war has ended, the Government no longer has to meet problems of war-time finance, and therefore",33,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

97,Able Member For Wimmera ( Mr Turn,"uniform taxation and the system of reimbursing the States should end. Nobody can sustain such a proposition. We all recognize that the interest burden and the special temporary costs associated with rehabilitation necessitate the continuance of war-time finance, and hence the continuance temporarily of uniform taxation. The Commonwealth Government has increased by approximately £5,745,000 the amount of money to be paid to the States. I do not believe that that increase reimbursement does very much more for the States than off-set the c decline of the purchasing power of money which has taken place during and since the war. That is my answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who contended that the bill proposes an increased grant. Having regai'd to the purpose behind the measure, all honourable members must support it in principle. matta) [4.56] -When the uniform tax legislation was introduced in 1942, I endorsed it in principle, chiefly on the ground that, in order to raise the money necessary to conduct the war to a successful conclusion it was essential to level up some of the ""inequalities resulting from the differential rates of State taxation then in vogue. It woulcl obviously have been impossible to impose an extremely high Commonwealth tax and at the same time maintain State taxes at their then existing level, as this woulcl have brought the total contributions of many taxpayers to a rate in excess of 20s. in the £1. Because of that overriding consideration I believe there was then universal acceptance of the principle of the proposal. However, I was not unmindful of the fact that there were other desirable features in the uniform, tax measure, namely, that it would bring about the removal of dual income tax returns and simplify the multiplicity of irritating and confusing regulations and provisos relative to deductions which imposed a heavy burden on taxpayers generally. For these reasons most of us were pleased to accord our support to the measure in 1942. It is true that in the incidence of its application, this legislation has revealed many anomalies and has operated unfairly in many way?. During this debate reference has been made to the inequitable allocation of the proceeds of the uniform fax among the States. It has been stressed that this has resulted in lack of opportunity by the States to carry out their normal developmental policies. I believe that it should bepossible to remove all these disabilitiesmerely by adopting a more scientific, and equitable formula for the distribution of. the moneys collected by the central taxation office. It is on record that when the uniform tax bill was being debated in. this Parliament in 1942 I drew attention, as honourable members have done to-day, to the proposed unfair distribution of the moneys as between the StatesStrange as it may appear, my complaintwas that New South Wales, the State ini which I have the honour to represent an. important constituency, was being toogenerously treated. As honourable members will recall, the formula adopted for determining the reimbursement to the States in 1942 was based on the amount of taxation collected in the two base years1939-40 and 1940-41. It was assumed by the framers of the original measure ""that State revenues and expenditures in thebase years would bc continued throughout the period of operation of the uniform tax legislation. If that assumption had been correct the formula itself would have beens correct; but it was not, and its incorrectness was obvious at the time the bill wa* before us. In the interregnum between, the base years and the passage of the legislation in 1942 a very considerablevolume of the financial responsibilities of the States hacl been taken over by the Commonwealth' Treasury. For instance, in the base years the New South Wales Government was responsible for child endowment and widows' pensions and had? to meet very heavy expenditure on unemployment relief. By 1942, responsibility for both child endowment and widows'"" pensions had been assumed by the Comnionwealth. Again, whereas in the baseyears the New South Wales Treasuryhad to find approximately £3,000,000 forunemployment relief, in 1942, owing to the complete absorption of our man-powerfor war purposes, expenditure on unemployment relief had dwindled to aninsignificant figure. Despite that, ani amount equal to the full amount whichi",34,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading
98,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"the New South Wales Treasury had collected in the two base years, partly to meet the cost of social services of the kind I have mentioned, was allotted to that State. It was obvious that the Oommonwealth Government was anxious to secure the agreement of the State Premiers to the proposed unified tax and was willing to pay such a high price for the support of the Premier of New South Wales. If there is any doubt in the minds of honourable members as to the force of my remarks, I refer them to the recent references by the Auditor General of New South Wales relative to what he described as the irregular and illegal setting aside of reserves in the New South Wales Railways accounts. What has happened in New South Wales may well be happening in other States. WhilstI approve of the measure in principle I believe it coxild be improved. I trust that the Government will give consideration to the representations made by honourable members on this side of the House during this debate, and make the uniform tax legislation more accept-able to the people by adopting a more -equitable formula for the distribution to the States of the moneys raised by the Commonwealth on their behalf. support the measure and, for once, am .glad to find the honourable member for Parramatta ""( Sir Frederick Stewart) in agreement with me. This measure does not call for a great deal of debate. As Australians we are amply justified in endorsing the principle that the citizens of Australia, wherever they .may reside and whatever may be their occupation, should pay a uniform tax for the services of the Commonwealth and of the State in accordance with, tlieir ability to pay. Most taxpayers have been delighted at the simplicity of a single incoine tax return. One might draw a parallel between the benefits derived from the uniform tax and those resulting from the operations of the Loan Council. monwealth and State Governments in their wisdom saw fit to enter an agreement under which all loans required for public works in Australia, whether' of the Commonwealth or of a State, should be raised only after consultation and agreement between the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States in the Loan Council. That system has worked well, and I believe that the system of uniform taxation is also working well ahd will continue to do so. It is true that at the inception of schemes such as this some difficulties and inequalities are inevitable. Originally, uniform tax disbursements were made under a formula laid down by the Commonwealth Government. In the amending bill a clause has been inserted which differs slightly from the old formula and will determine future disbursements to the States. There is no reason to believe that, with the passage of time and with the experience gained from actual practice, this Parliament and the Premiers of the States will not be able to devise further improvements in the formula for the disbursement of . revenue. I was sorry to observe the newly elected honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Turnbull) working the parish pump. He complained that Victoria has raised more revenue than it is receiving under the present formula. I remind him,' 1 that during the war, the great wealth of Victoria had to be poured out in the Northern Territory, in Western Australia, ancl in Queensland, not in order to protect the lives and property of the people of those places only, but to protect, as well the lives and property of the people of Australia, including those of Victoria. Victorian money was spent in places other than Victoria, and the expenditure conferred benefits on Victorian .taxpayers. The same principle holds good regarding the sending of soldiers enlisted in Victoria to serve in the Northern Territory or Western Australia. Perhaps the honourable member for Wimmera woulcl not argue that those men should not be sent to serve outside Victoria. Of course, no one objects to sending Victorians to serve in places outside Victoria; but when it comes to a matter of money, some Many years ago the Comlionorable members are disposed to work the parish pump. I maintain that if some of the revenue raised in Victoria is expended on social services or developmental work in other States, the Victorian taxpayer is, indirectly, conferring a",35,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

We should develop a national spirit, and not concern ourselves with whether Victoria contributes to the general revenue £2,000,000' more than does some other State. When I hear some of the arguments advanced hy honourable members opposite, I cannot but believe that they have been influenced by the wealthyThose observations by Alfred Deakin taxpayers of Victoria who are more concerned about their money than about Australia, and are displeased because they now have to pay a higher rate of tax than they used to pay under the old system.

102,Mr Menzies,"I wish the honorableof tlie Braddon clause. Another one was that the Commonwealth should take over from the States certain spending departments. A third was that the States, which to-day have no access whatever to indirect taxation, should be given access to some form or forms of indirect taxation. Of course, all these matters were discussed, as I do not need to remind honourable members, long before the weight of taxation was anything like what it is to-day. Not one of them would, be regarded as a very practical or complete solution of the problem at this moment. At that time, I had the privilege of putting forward proposals of that kind-for consideration. I still consider that they are based on what is ultimately a true analysis of this problem; but I do not regard them as being appropnate or satisfactory at the present time and in the present circumstances. When the Uniform Tax Bill came before this HouseI opposed it. I am still opposed to it in principle. But I should regard the repeal of uniform taxation at this moment as not practical politics. The' dominating factor on the practical side is that the burden of taxation on the individual income is necessarily so large that it is not .practical to put the Commonwealth tax on one side, to hand back taxing authority to the States, and then suppose that you are going to get a total tax burden that will be in any way equitable throughout Australia. In other words, the argument referred to in the second reading speech of the Treasurer ( Mr a progressive variation of it over a term Chifley) is a sound practical argument in relation to the problem at present, and will continue to be a sound practical argumust aim at getting back to a state of ment in the next three, four or five years, or whatever time may elapse before the tax burden is sensibly reduced. But it is still necessary for us to see what-the matter of principle is, it is not enough merely to fob off this problem for a few years. We must face, up to the question of principle. To my. mind, the vital mater of principle is this: If we are to have a federal system, with a central parliament and government, and with State parliaments and governments, and their powers are to be in. truth independent powers, and not, as one might say, hierarchial powers, then it is essential that their financial power also should be independent. You cannot have independent legislative authority with dependent financial power. Consequently, as a broad matter of principle, I believe that after this emergency has diminished we must aim ultimately at restoring independent financial powers to governments which exercise independent authorities and assume independent responsibilities. How important that is can be seen at a. glance if we consider one matter for which the States have responsibility. The State parliaments undertake public education in Australia. On that subject. I have already had the privilege of addressing this House. I do not propose to repeat what I then said. In any civilized and progressive community, more and more' nioney must be spent if we are to have an effective educational system, an adequate teaching profession, and all the things that go to make up a sound system of mental training. But how can the -States provide more money for education, how can there be any real forward policy on the part of Statesi f , however progressively-minded their Governments may be, they find that their financial resources are either fixed or diminishing? It is quite idle for State Governments to talk about the expansion that they propose to have if , in fact, their resources in terms of money are contracting resources, or are fixed. The Prime Minister has given some recognition to that matter by varying the existing formula and by providing for of years. But I want to emphasize that, so long as we have a federal system, we affairs in which independent resources will be available to the States; because I believe that any Governnient that exercises real authority will exercise that authority wisely, only if it accepts in the face of its electors complete responsibility for the raising of the. money that it proposes to spend. I do not need ""to labour that; it is a question of principle which everybody will perceive and with which many persons will agree. I turn to the next problem. Is it possible to apply that principle to perfection in a federation? Again the answer is "" No"" ; it is not possible to apply it to perfection unless you alter the present taxing powers by admitting the States to indirect taxes. So long as the States depend only upon direct taxes, then while the demands of the Gommonwealth for direct taxes are necessarily great, it will not be possible to restore full responsible autonomy to the States. Therefore, it becomes necessary to say: ""Is this scheme now put forward the best, and the most 3ust and practical scheme for providing reimbursement for the States out of the' money that the Commonwealth raises ?"" Let us assume ""that we cannot apply our principle of independent raising a t this stage. Is this the best method of distribution? risk of being wearisome, I want to repeat in a few sentences something that I have said before to this House on the States Grants Bill. I believe it to be a thorough fallacy in this Commonwealth of ours to treat the three States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania as though they were three special mendicant communities to whom special grants have to be made. I do not believe in that at all. Hearing these matters discussed, anybody would think that Western Australia, for example-to take the most distant State-is States, through the Commonwealth, to be kind to it. Nothing of the sort. should it have to ask any other State to be kind to it? I agree for once with my friend the honourable member for Ballarat that we pay taxes as Australians. There is no particular virtue in the fact that a taxpayer lives in Victoria, when we pay money in this country for the use and benefit of the community as a whole. I believe that if you are going to pool your resources, as in uniform taxation, the total pool ought to be available for distribution in the Commonwealth and each of the six States, not to three of them in particular; not putting any States in the position of asking for a favour, but having a distribution between all seven governments as a pure matter of justice. Of course, that involves a new conception of this problem. It involves this: that having determined how much money shall be raised in one year, it becomes necessary to say what will be the requirements of the .Commonwealth, having regard to its programme, and what will be the requireMr Menzies. ments of Queensland, Victoria or any other State. Let us assess them in order to determine whatfinancial adjustments have to be macle, so that all of them may give effect to their programmes. Let us assume that all of them have progressive, civilized, decent programmes for the benefit of their people. Why should one programme be preferred to another? Why should the Commonwealth and Victorian programmes be taken in full, and the programme of another State only in part ? I believe that we have a great opportunity here. We have a Commonwealth Grants Commission, which over a term of years has acquired an immense experience. 1 On that point, at thc believe that its reports are regarded with great respect on both sides of this House. It has a staff which has accustomed itself on the expert level to discussions between the Commonwealth and the States concerned. It has acquired a skilled technique ancl vast experience in examining budgets and estimates, in working out the results of financial years, and in bringing in its recommendations. If we had such a body which, year by year, month by month, could constantly keep under examination tbe demands of the Commonwealth and each of .the six States, so that asking the eastern in clue course it might recommend to us what was to be the reimbursement for Why every governinent in Australia, and not merely"" the two or three making special applications, then I believe that we would have a better prospect of making all those governments feel that, if they cannot at present liave independent financial resources, at least their resources will be calculated on some basis of adequacy and will be determined not on some political bargaining around a taible but by a cold abjective examination by expert people from each government and each public service concerned, so that in the long run the Parliament may, as in respect of States grants, havebefore it something upon which it canact with complete security. I still believe that this legislation cuts across a first-class principle. I am prepared to concede for the purpose of this argument that in present circumstances and for some limited time to come the cutting across of that principle is probably unavoidable. I believe there ought to be a time limit still to this legislation, but I believe above all things for Wimmera to talk of how badly Victhat we ought not to imagine for a moment that this basic ""problem in a federation, the financial relations between the central and State governments, is solved by what we do on this occasion. We should regard this as only one step on thc road, and the Government ought to give serious consideration to my suggestions and to the, no doubt, better suggestions which will be offered. In the long run the States will either die of inanition or the Commonwealth will face up to the problem of preserving them and equipping them with financial resources, and doing its best to solve it. for Im.migration ancl Minister for In formation) [5.27] -What the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has said about the independence of State governments and the necessity to allow them to control the raising of their own revenues means Ihat the matter of the taxes to be levied in the States should be handed back for decision in five of the States by the non-elective Legislative Councils. Four of the States are plagued with Legismember for Wimmera does not know, or lative Councils electedon a property franchise, and in some of the States some members of those councils are required to own freehold property that is unencumbered. The grant which the Commonwealth proposes to make to Victoria, in particular, is far in excess of any sum which the Legislative Council in that State woulcl sanction for expenditure on social services. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) does not speak for Victoria when he repeats in this House the request of the late Dunstan Government for the repeal of this legislation. It is well to remember that'the act was based on the report of a committee consisting of Professor Mills, as chairman, and two honourable members of this House, one the then honourable member for Eobertson, Mr Spooner, and the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr would expect, by the Liberal party. The Scullin). The former honourable member for Robertson, speaking for the Opposition parties in the House, agreed to the principle of uniform taxation. "" It may be argued that it is desirable to place a limit upon its operation, but at any rate the principle was conceded, and it is too late for the honourable member toria has allegedly been treated under the scheme. The basis on whioh the scheme was laid was the animal net expenditure on social services for the two financial years 1939-40 and 1940-41. total collections of income tax. tion, but the taxation was related to the expenditure. In essence the payment to Victoria was based on the amount of money which that State expended on social services. wrong. right. At any rate, New South Wales, which had expended £14,000,000 on social services and had other commitments in prospect, was granted £15,000,000 in the first year of the operation of the scheme. Victoria, which expended only £6,000,000, was compelled by uniform taxation to pay £10,000,000 annually. The honourable has forgotten, that there was a provision in fhe legislation which enabled any State government which had increased its expenditure on social services to go to the authority created under the act and secure an increased annual grant. here, but T know that the scheme is unfair. ber has arrived for what I believe will be a very brief stay. He only believes that the arrangement is unfair. When he has listened to the story he will find that it is perfectly fair. The Dunstan Government was in control in Victoria for a long time, and it was supported for a period by the Labour party. It was supported in its declining days, as one latter party became a participant in the Government and eventually wrecked it. The Dunstan Government could have made application to the Commonwealth Grants Commission at any time for an increased grant, but it did not increase its expenditure on social security.

There was ample opportunity for the Victorian Parliament to devote more money to the purpose of social security, provided the reactionary Legislative Council known in Victoria as the "" legislative abattoirs "" had passed the requisite enactments. But it would be hopeless to expect that expenditure on social security measures would be sanctioned by the Legislative Council of Victoria. It is my view that the money should be raised and allocated by the democratically elected Commonwealth Parliament. This is indeed a democratically elected Parliament. House. between the Upper House of this Parliament and the Upper House of the Parliament of Victoria is that our Upper House is elected on the same franchise as the House of Representatives, which is adult suffrage, universal and equal, whereas the Legislative Council of Victoria is very far from being in that desirable position. house has the vote in Victoria, not the owner of it. property qualification; but however honourable members opposite like to put it, the fact is that only one-third of. the Legislative Assembly voters in Victoria are entitled to vote at Legislative Council elections. Moreover, only last year, every member of the Liberal party and the Legislative Council in Victoria voted against a bill designed to give all returned soldiers a vote in Legislative Council elections. Honourable gentlemen opposite ( talk about preference for soldiers, but the fact is that these soldiers cannot get rid of a lot of old reactionaries in the Legislative Council of Victoria, with whom it is a case of ""Safety first; preference last"". I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that this bill makes provision for increased distributions to the States for' 1946-47 and 1947-4S as follows:£ New South Wales .. 900,000 Victoria ... ..' 1,070.000 Queensland ..

That provision will do justice to the States with big populations ancl the States with small populations. It is, I believe, as fair a scheme as can be devised. The difference between the results obtained from the attendance at Premiers conferences and Loan Councils of Mr Dunstan, the former Premier of Victoria, and those obtained from the attendance of Mr Cain, the present Premier of the State, is that whereas Mr Dunstan refused to co-operate with the Commonwealth and. got nothing, Mr Cain agreed to co-operate with the Commonwealth and the other State Premiers and",40,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

Dame ENID LYONS-The Minister gave such a splendid description of unification that I could not help feeling that it was connected with the purposes of this bill. No further comment is needed by me on that point.' A few arguments have been advanced by honourable gentlemen opposite in support of this bill, and I believe that it can be said that it has some technical advantages, and some conveniences, particularly at present. My view on the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States is well known in this Parliament. I have spoken on the subject several times. I did so, in particular, during last session when the States Grants Bill was under consideration. With the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), I believe that some means must be found to stabilize and equalize the development of all the States within the Commonwealtli. I believe that in the Commonwealth Grants Commission we have the nucleus of an organization which could stimulate such development. I desire, now, however, to get back to first principles.

123,Mr Calwell,"I said nothing of the-would remain in operation only for the -duration of the war and one year .afterwards. Dame ENID LYONS A great deal of evidence can be adduced to support my statement. It cannot be denied that Jit the recent Premiers Conference, at which this subject was discussed, almost every Sfcate objected to the continuation of this method of taxation on that'ground, but because the Commonwealth Govern. ment had been reinforced by a judgment of the High Court, Commonwealth Ministers were able to wield a big stick. It is all very well to say that the States agreed to the proposal. They agreed only under coercion. What we must consider more than anything else is the moral principle underlying the obligation of a government to live up to its promise. This is not the first time that the present Government has laid itself open to a charge of breaking faith. I have spent«about 30 years of my life defending politicians -the Lord help me! I have said over, .and over again that most of the accusations of broken promises and faithlessness cannot be sustained-that promises and policies put before the people at election time are general statements setting out aims and goals which are not always possible of achievement. But when we find a definite agreement between parties being set aside without any compunction whatever, when a distinct promise that no legislation of a specific character will' be introduced during the life of a parliament is broken, we have a clear case of breach of faith. That, it seems to me, is the Strongest possible argument against this measure. I , for one, could not go back to Tasmania without having said that, in my opinion, the moral principle underlying the Government's action is the most important thing. We must remember,, too, that the principle must be maintained that the person or the authority which spends -money should also be responsible for raising it. In the power to tax lies the power of life and death. Unless that power be restored to the States-unles s the promise made four years ago be kept now-the Government will have to answer for something which is of far greater importance than mere considerations of expediency. The Government will have to bring forward some other argument if it is to convince the electors at election time that it is worthy to be trusted when it gives a definite promise to the people. How the electors can have confidence in a government which does not keep faith with them. I do not know. I shall await with interest the reaction of the people' to the introduction of this bill. honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has entirely misinterpreted the decision of the recent conference of Commonwealtli and State Ministers in regard to uniform taxation. It is true, as he said, that a proposal was presented to the Premiers that the States should transfer tlieir taxing powers to the Commonwealth for a limited period. The Premiers did not agree to that proposal, but they made some arrangement in respect of entertainment tax, and that agreement is being honoured. It is not included in the Government's proposal in respect of uniform taxation. After the . Commonwealth Government had intimated that it would continue the uniform taxation scheme, four State Premiers joined with the then Premier of Victoria( Mr Dunstan) in taking the matter to the High Court. The decision of that body was not in their favour, and therefore the point taken' by the honourable member for Darwin has no substance at all in fact. Tasmania and New South Wales were not parties to the case before the High Court. It is all very well for the honourable member for Darwin to become heated and disturbed about an alleged breach of faith. It is not a fact that the Governinent broke its pledges. The honourable member makes thaf charge because she thinks that it will help the Opposition parties at the elections. I am glad that some members of the Opposition are prepared to support this measure. T'he honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir' Frederick ' Stewart) frankly admitted that he had supported the principle of uniform taxation when it was first introduced.

No one suggests that the present scheme is without anomalies, but whatever its weaknesses, the scheme has many advantages. There is nothing to be said against the principle of uniform taxation. As the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) said, we all are Australians. Men and women from every State served iu the various theatres of war to preserve this country's freedom. We, therefore, ought to he prepared to make equal contributions to the revenue so that the goods and. services required by the community may bc provided. tion? able member for Wentworth lives in New South Wales, and I live in Tasmania, but our earnings are taxed on exactly the same scale. Queensland or any other State make the same contribution. so before, the advent of uniform tatation. In Queensland, for instance, taxpayers in the higher income groups were taxed on a high rate, whereas in Viotoria high taxes were levied on comparatively low incomes, and relatively low taxes on high incomes. That anomaly does not now exist in our taxation legislation. The scale of tax applies equally throughout the Commonwealth.' Another advantage is that taxpayers liave to fill in only one income tax form. The procedure is simplified. Already we have been able to straighten out some of the anomalies that have become apparent since the introduction of uniform taxation. We have before us a most complex document setting outfcheaggregate grantto be made by Commonwealth to the States, and the individual allocations. An explanatory memorandum has been prepared for the information of honourable members. To the layman taxation procedure is not simple,but this document has been prepared by experts whose task it is to advise the Government. The uniform tax system has already been considerably improved; No doubt more anomalies will appear ancl will be straightened out in the future. It is all [24] very well for the Leader of the Opposition to talk of the sovereign rights of States; but there is much to be said in favour of the point made by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) about the control exercised by State legislative councils which are not elected on a democratic franchise. Por instance, most, members of the Legislative Council of Tasmania cannot see beyond the boundary fences of their own paddocks. good land, why should they ? provided they have no desire to distu. guish themselves in the legislative halm of this country. Many of them believe that because they are on good paddocks and are prosperous, everybody else is prosperous, and nothing should be clone to alter existing conditions. They are against progress.

But generally a uniform tax has meant for the taxpayer considerable saving of time, trouble and thought in thefilling in of returns, which, although this is not the time to deal with them, could be simplified. This bill arises from a decision of a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. It is strange that in this country, where State and Commonwealth responsibilities are defined, decisions should be made by an unconstitutional body which is not mentioned in any State or Federal documents of any constitutional standing; but British countries have the tendency, indeed the faculty, of arriving at sensible decisions by unorthodox means. By means of the conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers decisions are reached. The CommonAvealth may be able to get the States to agree to its view or the State Premiers may combine, regardless of party affiliations, to get Avhat they believe provide for the payment of that lina-ncial to be their rights. We ought to recognize the axiom of "" no taxation Avithout representation"", although Ave do not, especially in the territories under our control. But Ave must recognize that it is bad that State Parliaments should have tlie spending of huge sums they do not have the responsibility of raising. I , therefore, foresee difficulties arising from the fact that State Parliaments Avill be able to expend money that they have not had the responsibility of raising. There is a pronounced tendency in Australian politics, a tendency Avhich Avas given expression to by the lionorable member for Ballarat( Mr that he has not made up his mind about Pollard). He spoke about unification, as did the Minister for Information ( Mr ment took over the collection of income Calwell), although he denied that he used the Avord, notwithstanding that what he described as Australia's future must be unification, whether he used the word or not. The tendency is for the States to look to the Commonwealth for financial support, indeed resources. We have even had from the States requests' for subventions for education. I look at these things someAvhat differently from other honourable members on my side of the House, although I cannot be distinguished from them in the mob. taken. Mr Archie Cameron. times, unfortunately, I have been. The right honourable gentleman may remember that as he remembered some of my other statements to-day at question time. I have a strong feeling that when the Labour party goes out of office and Ave return to power the financial position will be similar to to-day's, and that the financial conditions Avill be extremely stringent. So, if the Commonwealth Government really believes in unification the sooner it puts it to the test, by the only means possible, by reference to the people, the better. It is interesting to refer to what the Treasurer said when the original liniform tax legislation was brought down in 1942. He saidTlie Government rloes not seelc to' take away from the States their power to impose taxes upon incomes, but proposes to make a payment of iinancial assistance to any State which agrees to suspend that power in the interests of the national defence. Another bill wil l assistance. We have gone a long way from that. The act of 1942 concluded with a section AA'hich readThis act shall continue in operation until the last day of the first financial year to commence after tlie date on which His Majesty ceases to be engaged in the present Avar, and no longer. That reads like the astronomical means by which the date of Easter is fixed. That section is as clear as what is in the mind of the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) about the actual date of the end of the Avar, for his ansAvers to questions show that. When the CommonAvealth Governtax and tbe entertainments tax, the'latter of AA'hich it is UOAV surrendering, apparently, in my innocence I expected it to take OA'er the land tax, but I discovered that the people of New South Wales have no State land tax. So it would be too bad if they Avere asked to contribute to land tax as do people in every other State. Much Avas said to-day about Tory Legislative Councils.

The bill now before the House contains no time limit whatever. It reminds me of what was known in the early Blot"", although that arrangement for the repayment of customs collections to the States had to cease at the expiration of ten yeai's. It was one of the subterfuges to which the national convention resorted in order to persuade the Australian colonies, as they then were, to agree to federation. The ""Braddon Blot"" ceased after ten years of federation. Anyone who studies t'he history of federation will agree that it was an excellent thing when the "" Braddon Blot"" did terminate. Unfortunately, no time limit has been imposed upon the operation of this legislation. Certain arrangements are prescribed under which there will be a change-over from a method which is fo operate for the first two years to a method which will operate after the termination of that period. I put this to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), and to some of his friends who appear to think that they are legislating for all eternity, that it has been proved time and again that all legislative enactments must contain a certain measure of flexibility. Proper But methods must be incorporated in them to enable changes to take place automatically. The moment we begin to introduce rigidity, the whole scheme is liable to collapse.

147,Mr Archie Camebon,"I amcondition of affairs under which the Commonwealth Government, with the hacking of the High Court, would be told that it was entitled to collect 100 per cent, of the income tax of Australia, if it so desired. It stands to reason that if a power is granted to the Oommonwealth, as the collection of income tax obviously is granted, and some limit is not imposed upon it, the Commonwealth is entitled to tax fully the source of income. In war-time the States were jammed in the way that the right honourable gentleman who is now Prime Minister and Treasurer described. whether they like it or not, to agree to the best possible terms that they can get from the Oommonwealth. If they are not prepared to accept those terms, certain penalties will automatically be imposed upon them. Another matter which is extremely interesting ih relation to the bill is a comparison of the rates of reimbursement to the six States with those contained in the existing act. A good deal of controversy arose in this House-in fact, on one or two occasions the debate became almost bitter-as the result of the particularly preferential treatment of New South Wales, which always appears to be not only the biggest but also the hungriest and best spender of all the States. If honourable members will compare the proposed new schedule with the schedule in the act, they will see that the proposed increases of reimbursements to the States are as follows:Increase. which certain people, who have been £ New South Wales Victoria .. . . 2,343,000 Queensland South Australia Western Australia .. 83'S.OOO TasmaniaI give those figures because of certain statements that have been made publicly. I believe that the Prime Minister himself made one in the recent by-election in Victoria. It lends definite colour to what I am about to say. The right honourable gentleman was reported as having said that the return of a Labour government in Victoria would assist smooth working between the Commonwealth and the State. The two States which have been given large increases Mr Archie Cameron. under this arrangement were those which did not have Labour governments at the time of the introduction of uniform income taxation. In other words, it would appear to any impartial observer studying these two columns of figures that Victoria and South Australia paid a heavy penalty in 1942 simply because they did not have Labour governments. That is the only conclusion which ' I can draw from the figures. I am a party manI admit it -rbu t there are certain things which ought to be above-party, and in a federaThey are obliged, tion like this, each State should be placed on the same footing in the eyes of the Commonwealth regardless of the political colour of the government which it happens to have in office at the time. The introduction into Commonwealth administration of a system under which a State may be penalized on account of the policy of its government is a dangerous practice. will recall that the committee which made the recommendations included a representative of the Opposition. representative was never selected by the Opposition. It is a matter of history now, but he was chosen by the Government, just as certain representatives of the Opposition who went overseas last yeai' were chosen not by honourable members on this side of the House but by the Governon ent.

The Prime Minister claimed that the Opposition had a representative on the .committee which recommended the introduction of uniform taxation. I have a strong suspicion that if the Opposition had been consulted about the ma'.ter in 1942, the administrathrough the Senate like a jet-propelled tive history of Australia would have been very different from what it is. able member three years to repudiate him. my job to comment on everything that is done on this side; but when honourable members opposite raise certain matters I shall make my comments thereon. I am quite sure that this measure, together with certain other measures which have been passed by this Parliament, will require a lot of overhaul before fore, provision was made to enable certain we go very much further. Let me take one point. Last year, South Australia was badly stricken by drought for the third year in succession; but when I made representations in this matter how was I treated? Honorahle members opposite, if. they are allowed to speak their minds, will bear out what I have to say In September last I put in a petition to the Commonwealth, bnt it was not until this month that I could get any decision about what the Commonwealth proposed to do about drought relief; and I am then told that this is a matter of Cabinet policy which is within the financial competence of South Australia. Before long a special bill will be passed by South Australia, and I shall then be able to ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) what he proposes to do about the matter. If this arrangement between . the Commonwealth and the States is to succeed, the Commonwealth must show more consideration towards the States than it has shown towards them in the past. The Commonwealth now receives the total collections from income tax. Whatever the conditions of any industry may be it is no longer a question of what the State must do to help that industry, because that industry's contribution is now made not to the .State but the Commonwealth Treasury. No industry contributes to State funds except, indirectly, or, in the case of four or five of the States, in a small degree through the medium, of land tax. Therefore, as we proceed, thc Treasurer will have occasion to make a few alterations to this measure. I have no doubt that the bill will have a speedy passage in this chamber, and will go aircraft. At the inception of federation certain powers were left with the States, whilst others were vested in the Commonwealth, but the .framers of the Constitution did not contemplate that the States would ever be subservient to the Commonwealth. Australia is a large country. Its development to date has depended to a great degree upon local authorities spread throughout the length and breadth of the land, and therepowers to be conferred upon those authorities. At the same time, the framers of the Constitution were sufficiently far-seeing to realize that at some future date circumstances might arise which would necessitate the Commonwealth having almost complete control over income taxation. As time went on, only the States levied income tax, whilst excise and customs duty, for obvious reasons, were handed to the Commonwealth. But even out of the collections of excise and customs duty the Commonwealth paid certain sums to the States. It was not until the first world war that the Commonwealth imposed income tax. It did so for obvious reasons; but when that war ended the Commonwealth continued to levy income tax. Then eame the depression, and once again when added burdens were thrown upon the finances of not only the States but also the Commonwealth, additional taxes of various kinds were levied. Many of those taxes were reduced during the regime of the Lyons Government. Then came the second world war-, and we reached the point when the Commonwealth was obliged to raise revenue amounting to from £500,000,000 to over £600,000,000 annually. However, the Commonwealtb was faced with the fact that the",47,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

157,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [8.23],"States liad differing systems of levying incoine tax, embodying different rates, and, therefore, it was impossible for tbe Commonwealth to levy income tax to a degree sufficient to meet its war expenditure on a basis that would be fair as between different States. because of the exigencies of war, the Commonwealth adopted uniform and that system met with general approbation with the exception that many of us objected to the basis of reimbursements to the different States. It was clear that whilst extravagance on the part of one State was rewarded, thrift and frugality on the part of another State were penalized. That is borne out by an examination of the operation of uniform taxation as it affects New South Wales and Victoria. In 1940-41, the year before a uniform tax was imposed, the Commonwealth collected in Commonwealth income tax £12,100,000in New South Wales whilst the State Government collected £16,700,000 in State income tax, making a total of £28,800,000. Under a uniform income tax the amount collected in New South Wales has increased by 143 per cent, to £70,000,000, that being the amount of income tax collected in that State in 1944-45, and of that sum the Commonwealth refunded to the State 21i per cent. But what is the position so far as Victoria is concerned ? In 1940-41 the Commonwealth collected in Oommonwealth income tax £9,100,000 in that State, whilst the State Government collected £6,600,000 in State income tax, a total of £15,700,000. Income tax collections in Victoria in 1944-45 under a uniform income tax increased by £36,300,000, or an increase of no less than 231 per cent., but of the £52,000,000 collected in Victoria in that year, only 124 per cent, was refunded to the State. I am as much an Australian as any other honourable member. I agree Avith the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and, to some degree, with the honourable member forBallarat( Mr Pollard), that no individual, no matter in.which State he lives, can escape his obligations to the nation as a whole, because he gains through the progress of the nation. But the difference between the allocations of income tax collections to New South Wales and Victoria cannot be justified on Afr. fJitlcltinson. any ground whatsoever; and it seems that these allocations will be made on this basis for some time to' come. At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers every State Premier opposed the continuance of a uniform income tax. Therefore, Having regard to the fundamental policy of the Labour party, the viewpoint of taxation; the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) is somewhat remarkable. I have always understood the Labour party to stand for unification,'that is one parliament which alone should rule the country. Obviously, differences of opinion now exist within the Labour party with respect to a uniform income tax -Every State Premier-and the majority of them led Labour governments-oppose d the continuance of this tax, and they left the conference feeling that they had been up against .a brick wall of opposition by the Commonwealth in their endeavour to terminate the present system, but sweetened by the knowledge that more nioney would be allotted to the States which they represented. Victoria, for instance, got an extra £2,000,000. But what was the explanation offered to this House to-night as to why the allotment to Victoria was increased? The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) told us that additional money was allocated to Victoria only to make up for the depreciation of the Australian £1, a depreciation which, I remind honourable members, had been brought about as the result of the inflationary policy of the Labour Government. If this is so, then the allocation to the States has been on the same basis, namely, a basis of rewarding the extravagant and penalizing the thrifty. The subject of social services has been raised frequently during this debate, as it has on other occasions, by no less a person than the Prime Minister and Treasurer himself when addressing the House on the question of the desirability of continuing the uniform tax. When dealing with this subject honourable members opposite invariably quote figures showing the amount per capita expended by the States on social services. Honourable members opposite appear to be under the impression that a high per capita expenditure on social services is indicative of the real standards of health and well-being of the people. They conveniently forget that the money provided for such services must first be obtained by the imposition of exceedingly high rates of taxation. High rates of taxation in turn affect production, and the volume and value of our production affects the national income; and unless production is increased in volume and value, the whole basis of social services in this country must be endangered. Ten years ago when I was in RussiaI sought to ascertain some facts about the standard of living of the Russian people as it was then, and' as it existed in pre-revolution days. While there I met an English gentleman who had been in that country for many years. His knowledge of Russian affairs, which extended back to pre-revolution days, was perhaps more extensive because of the fact that he had married a Russian woman. He had been in Moscow for many years ancl it was part of his business to study economic trends iand to pass on information which came to him by reason of his high position there to others in a very much higher position in his homeland. He told me that Russia had greatly liberalized its social services in the years immediately preceding my visit, as, indeed, had -every other country. But he said, "" Erom the point of view of warm clothing, a full stomach, and boots on their feet, the people of Russia are definitely worse off than they were prior to the revolution"". shoulders he said, "" Which would you prefer, extensive provision of social services on the statute-book, or a full stomach and a good pair of boots on your feet on a cold winter's day?"" So much for the relation of social services to real standards, of comfort! Mr Maloney, Australian Minister to Russia given the honourable member ample opportunity to relate his Russian story to the bill before the House.

I am endeavouring to emphasize that standards of living are not determined by the amount provided by a government for social services. years I have travelled extensively in all States of the Commonwealth, and I have invariably found the general standards of health and well-being, including housing, better in Victoria than in any other State. The general prosperity of Victoria was well exemplified in the depression days by its ready response to appeals for contribution to Commonwealth loans, particularly to the loan raised in 1930-31 when contributions from other States were lagging far behind the quotas fixed. This is indicative of Victoria's sound economy and the general well-being of its people. While in Detroit, in the United States of America, I went through the famous River Rouge works the honourable member to confine his remarks to the bill. for two people to purchase articles of the same kind but the value of one may be infinitely better than that of the other. The clap-trap which we have listened to from honourable members opposite regarding social services and uniform taxation in relation to standards of living is utter nonsense. Example after example Shrugging his of tbe fallacy of their arguments could be given by any honourable member on this side of the House. The' Minister for Information raised the question of education. Statistics prove that Victoria was almost on a par with the other States and its per capita expenditure on education Victoria the average expenditure per head of the population on this account has been much below that of the other States. slightly below that of the other States, the greatest difference in one instance being only 5s. per head.

165,Mr Hutchinson,"It was onlyprovincial centre and many country towns in Victoria private secondary schools cater more extensively for the education of children than is the case in any other State. If the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of pounds provided for private secondary and primary education be aclded, the figures might show Victoria to be on the credit side. I do not believe that any other State has provided for private education on a scale equal to that of Victoria. This is an indication of the sound well-being of the people of that State. They have not relied on the public purse for the education of their children. About two years ago, I was present at the opening of a small school, the State expenditure on which was possibly a few hundred pounds. To-day one would value the school and grounds at £1.500 or £2,000. has converted it from a mere shell into a. thing of beauty. It is well equipped. lines only when its components are free to I do not deny for a moment that education is privately assisted in other States. The point that I make is that the mere recital of amounts spent by governments on social services is of no real value in assessing the standards of life. said in regard to hospitals. The idea is growing in this country that real well-being exists because of expenditure by the State. Of course it does not. Seal enterprise and well-being are evidenced in the individuality of the people, their self-reliance, and their determined efforts to make provision for a rainy day, not in a mere recital of figures relating to expenditure upon social services, or in the legislation that is passed and the regulations that are made. Under the bill, the allocation of moneys to. the States is apparently to be made much on the old basis. I object to that. Desiring to do my share in promoting the development of this country as a whole, and not merely the portion of the State which I represent, I am prepared to make an equitable contribution. I am, however, opposed to a basis of allocation which I believe to be dastardly. basis has been incorporated in this measure, which apparently is not to .be a temporary one. I am not blind to the large financial obligations which this country may have to undertake in the itr. Hutchinson. next few years. I know that obligations arising out of the war will add millions of pounds to the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government. If this measure was intended to operate only for a certain number of years, as was the measure „ originally introduced, which the Treasurer said at the time would last only for the period of the war and twelve montlis after, and provided for a fair allocation as between States, having regard to the enormous obligations arising in the immediate post-war period, I should be inclined to vote for it. But it does none of those things. This system of taxation is to be applied in perpetuity. The real autonomy of the components of the Commonwealth are to be denied the right to impose income tax, and in consequence their right to selfVoluntary effort development. I believe that this country will develop along sound raise money and to determine in the light of sound, local knowledge the directions in which their development shall proceed. On tliat principle, I conclude my remarks. I consider that this system has a fallacious basis. The proposed allocation is one with which I do not believe any fairThe. same can be minded person could agree. Fortunately for himself, the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson), early in his speech, informed the House that he was an Australian with an Australian outlook. Had he not volunteered that information, we would have believed him. to be a narrow, parochially minded, little Victorian, because he based the whole of his argument on the assumption that uniform income taxation is wrong, on the ground that it increases the taxes of certain individuals in Victoria. That, to my mind, is entirely erroneous. I am acquainted with all the arguments that have beeu advanced since 1942 in regard to the extra taxation imposed on Victorian citizens. I remind the honourable member that, as an Australian,, he must expect to pay the same rate of tax as That every other Australian. If he is not prepared to stand up to that test, he cannot describe himself as an Australian. The States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942 did not give as much per capita to Victoria as it gave to",50,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading
166,Mr Bryson (Bourke) [8.45],"other States. The reasons are obvious. The lionorable member has advanced some of them. Describing social services in Victoria, he characterized the Government of that Stale as t h r if t y and frugal. Frugality exactly describes the social services of Victoriai n recent years. By way of illustration, referred to the opening of a small country school which he visited some years ago. I have had some experience of State schools in Victoria. The Government of that State has always claimed that schooling was free, secular, and compulsory, with emphasis upon "" free "". The honourable member has said that the Government provided a new school building. It. may have provided the land, or the local residents may have made-a g if t of it . The Governinent built a school on the land, and to the parents of the children attending the school was left the responsibility of providing all the necessary amenities for the teachers, in order that the children might be taught. No school books, sporting requisites, or shelter sheds were provided. That represented the taxation of a small section of people in order to ensure that the children would have reasonable amenities during the period of their education. It is the worse form of taxation, because it taxes only a small section in order to provide education for the children. I am acquainted witli other social services in Victoria. governments in that State have failed lamentably to provide reasonable hospital accommodation. The people have not been taxed so that the sick poor might receive Appeals have been made to the charitable instincts of the people for that purpose. The charitable people have furnished the necessary funds, and the uncharitable have kept their money in their pockets. I'hat has meant heavy taxatiou of the charitably-minded, and low taxation of those who were not prepared to make donations. While Mr Dunstan was Premier of Victoria, he always claimed that it was the ideal State in regard to taxation. He was able to prove that per capita, taxation in Victoria was lower limn in any other State. Nevertheless, ihe man on a low income' in Victoria paid as much if not more income tax than his counterpart in any other State. When uniform income taxation was introduced by this Parliament a large number of taxpayers in Victoria were called upon tb pay less than they had paid before the introduction of the system. That was because the State Government had imposed high taxes on persons with low incomes and comparatively low taxes on the honourable member people with high incomes. An examination of taxation assessments in Victoria will prove the correctness of my assertion. The honourable member for Deakin also had a grievance regarding the right of this Parliament to impose income taxes. He said, in effect, that the Commonwealth Constitution does not empower the Parliament to do sOj or, if it does, the Constitution should be altered. lionorable member did not listen to my speech. his claim, but the H i g h Court of Australia has ruled that the introduction of uniform income taxation was within the constitutional powers of this Parliament. beginning of my remarks. ber then claimed that the framers of the Constitution did not intend that the Commonwealth Parliament should have such powers, and that the States should not be subservient to the Commonwealth Successive in any respect. He said that by the introduction of this system of taxation certain powers had been taken from the States. I believe that additional powers should be granted to this Parliament. proper hospital treatment. The people of Australia are one nation, and should be governed through a national parliament. I should be quite happy if additional sovereign powers were taken from the States. I hope that in the near future the States w ill be deprived of some of the powers now enjoyed by them. An opportunity to enable this to be done will be afforded to the electors at thc referendum which is to be held shortly, and T trust that on that occasion the people will display a true Australian outlook by favouring a system of government through a national parliament.

170,Mr Beyson,"The honourable mempurpose of a national parliament. I welcome tliis measure, and, unlike the honourable member for Deakin, I hope that the uniform taxation scheme will be a permanent arrangement. Much -stress has been laid on the fact that under this measure' Victoria and South Australia will receive a larger allocation than was granted in 1942. The honourable member for Barker( Mr the additional £4,000,000 a year which Archie Cameron) said that a penalty was imposed on those States at that time, because they were not controlled by Labour governments. I disagree with him entirely. Those States got as much money under the scheme as they required in 1942. The honourable member for Barker is asking that South Australia should be much more of a mendicant State than it has ever been in the past, because' he has mentioned to-night the subject of drought relief, and has said that the Commonwealth should provide money for that purpose. He is such an ardent supporter of State rights that he sliould go to the right place, if the people Treasurer, Victoria, with the other States, of.South Australia, are entitled to drought relief; but he comes here, cap-in-hand, and asks the Commonwealth to grant that relief. Victoria is said to have been robbed of about £4,000,000 a year since 1942. honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr have long been denied by successive antiBowden) should try to be a big Australian, but he is only a little Victorian. In a national cause he should be prepared to support the same rate of income tax in the £1 for Victorians as for residents of New South Wales or South Australia. meinber agree to the allocation made to Victoria? provided for that State, in 1942, because it was proved conclusively that that amount was far more than sufficient for the State's requirements at that time. A glance at any Victorian budget since 1942 will show that its allocations were fair, because they provided sufficient to pay for all it3 services and leave a surplus at the end of each year. When a Government can close its financial year with a surplus its revenue must be sufficient. ciation ? was made for depreciation in every direction. There is a large sum waiting to'be expended on the railways of that State as soon as it can be expended. Had certain members of the Opposition say should have been paid to Victoria been made, available, its surpluses would have been so great that the government of the day would not have known what to do with the money. Had Victoria been prepared to disburse money on social services and in other directions in the same manner as that in which other States have used it, I should say that the allocation was not sufficient, but it was only necessary to grant to that State sufficient funds to cover its annual commitments. Under the agreement now reached by the State premiers and the Commonwealth is now to get a reasonable grant. Whilst this is approximately £2,300,000 more than was allocated when the Dunstan Government was in office, I have no doubt that, as a progressive Labour government is now in power in that State, that money will be expended wisely and well, and the people of Victoria will receive the benefits of social services w.hich they Labour administrations in that State. bers of the Opposition realize that, in speaking to this bill, they are, in effect, beating the air, because this is one of those measures to which the Labour Government has accustomed us. It provides for the ratification of an agreement already reached, and, therefore, it Gannot be altered by this Parliament. ber seems to be quite satisfied with the situation.

We bave here a bill designed for the raising and distribution of revenue for government purposes, but we are told that we cannot amend it in any particular. bers of thc Parliament has accepted it. by a majority of the Labour caucus because the members of that body have not sumcient backbone to exercise any judgment. fore caucus, and was approved. mark is indicative of a cynical attitude towards our democratic institutions. He points out that the measure was accepted by caucus, and he suggests, therefore, that it should be accepted without question by this Parliament, but I point out that it has not been accepted by the representatives of a very large section of the people. Honourable members opposite are always protesting their loyalty to the principles of democracy, but they are far' from practising such loyalty. The first point to consider in connection with this legislation is that it represents a breach of faith by the Government. Other honourable members have quoted the words of a former Prime Minister and of the present Prime Minister( Mr be two sets of autonomous authoritiesChifley), who was then Treasurer, in whicli they gave an assurance when the original legislation was introduced in 1942, that the system of uniform income taxation would last only for the duration of the war. The behaviour of the Labour Government in connection with this matter is typical of its cynical attitude towards the promises of its leaders. Provided the promises serve their purpose at the time, they can be broken without a qualm when it becomes'convenient to do so. It is a serious state of affairs that it should be accepted as the normal thing that assurances by the Prime Mmister and a senior Minister should be thus carelessly broken. Attempts have been made by honourable members opposite to-charge those on this side of the House with lacking an Australian spirit. Such allegations drip so'readily from the tongues of honourable members opposite that we do not take them seriously. Australia has achieved nationhood, and no one could approve a state of affairs in which there was serious discrimination between citizens simply because they happened to live in this State or that. The present system of uniform taxation and distribution has been criticized by both the Labour and non-Labour parties of the Victorian Parliament, but neither has asserted that Victoria should be regarded as a separate entity free toestablish its own standards. Both parties, however, have demanded that Victoria should receive equitable treatment under the scheme. The greater part of the revenue collected by the Victorian Government is derived from the City of Melbourne, but no Victorian parliament has ever suggested that it should be all expended in the metropolitan area. There has always been a readiness to recognize the principle that, revenue should be collected where possible, and expended where needed. However, when we are confronted with a proposal whioh. will result in discrimination against a section of the people there is ground for criticism. The legislation which we are now considering will unquestionably effect a fundamental alteration of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. The federal system envisaged a situation in which there would the States on one hand, and the Commonwealth on the other, each having certain responsibilities to discharge, and each empowered to raise revenue for that purpose. Now, at a single swoop, it is proposed to withdraw almost entirely from the hitherto sovereign States their power to collect revenue by means of an income tax, although their responsibilities still remain. constitutional. again found a way around the Constitution. Time and again the Labour party has, in pursuing its course towards unification, and as part of its plan to destroy the federal system, asked the people for such increased power as would result in the destruction of that system.

185,Mr Mcewen,"The Labour party has: No "". However, there are in the ranks of the Labour party persons sufEciently ingenious and politically unscrupulous to explore ways of circumventing the expressed will of the people so that a uniform system of governinent may be established, contrary to their wishes. And so, when I criticize this proposal and say that it will alter the whole, federal system, the Minister for Information says "" It is constitutional "". In other words, he says that the lawyers have found a way around it. The circumventing of the oft-expressed will of the people is a poor purpose to which to apply the skill of lawyers, yet that is the cynical admission of the Minister. I challenge the proposal on that ground-that it is improper to employ such devious means to attack the -federal system which is our cliosen form of constitutional government. However, Such matters present no difficulty to a Labour government which has as its aim the centralization of authority, the abolition of houses of review, and the introduction of caucus rule, which practically amounts to a totalitarian form of' government. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) referred to the ex-Premier of Victoria, Mr Dunstan, as an obstacle to the attainment of Labour's aims. He told us that when Mr Dunstan came to Canberra to negotiate with the Commonwealth authorities about uniform income taxation, he was "" difncult""; and so he got nothing. Later, there was a change in the political scene in Victoria: Mr Cain succeeded Mr Dunstan as Premier. In due course, Mr Cain, too, came to Canberra, and we are told by the Minister that he was "" co-operative "". He went away with an additional £2,500,000. meant that Mr Cain was submissive. of a sovereign State, submitted to the wealth -Government could not tell thc authority of his seniors in the Labour country that Victoria received an addiparty-.

Nevertheless, haggling by State premiers resulted in the amount to be paid to the States being raised to £40,000,000. It is wrong in principle to fix arbitrarily the amount to be paid to the States for a number of years. We do not know what the future has in store for Australia, and cannot say whether tbe amount decided on will or will not be adequate in the years to come. We do know, however, that the Commonwealth Government is engaged in a constant endeavour to deprive the States of some of their functions, and to centralize all governmental activities in Canberra. Undoubtedly, those, tactics succeed in some measure. Every function which is transferred to tlie Commonwealth from the States results in the States requiring less money for their remaining functions, although they still get the same amount. That cuts across the principle which should apply to taxation. We all look fonvard to a. reduction of taxes; but here a peg is driven in at a point which prevents any such reduction because fhe revenue apportioned to certain activities is fixed. Such a. policy disregards any transfer of authority and the economic development of Australia.

The inclusion of a reference to the price of butter fat might not enable us to understand the document any better, but possibly some of us would be a little happier about it. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the national government of Australia, Menzies) hit the nail on the head when ho said that if we were to have one collecting authority seven zones of governmental responsibility, the amount of money to be apportioned to the six States should not be determined by haggling conferences, negotiations behind locked' doors, and caucus discussions. If the federal system is not to be destroyed at its very roots by this proposal, it is essential that the apportionment of money to the States should be the task of a skilled authority. Leader of the Opposition has aptly suggested the Commonwealth Grants Commission which over the years has not only gained great knowledge of State problems and disabilities, but also has devised formulas that are understandable to human beings and acceptable to the States. The acceptability of the amounts, of money to be apportioned is an important factor. I am entirely in agreement with the Leader of the Opposition that if uniform income taxation is to continue there should be established a skilled, competent, tial tribunal to examine the facts, and assess the needs of the States in the light of existing conditions and prospective developments. I have not the slightest doubt that the net result of the Government's approach to this problem, will be this: State parliaments, State governments, and State parliamentarians of all kinds will soon realize that to-day we are presenting them with a perpetual ancl permanent alibi.

AndI remind the House that provincial government has been always a part of the Labour party's policy. I do not think everyth ng should be centralized at Canberra, and I do not think my colleagues do. do. sible for what they think. It is extraordinary that if any one wants to know what happens in the caucus or what the Labour party's policy is he must ask honourable members opposite. I hope they know as much about their own policy as they dfp'm to knnw about ours. D r . GAHA T h a t is why they concentrate on ours. It is necessary to think in terms of a central government and State covernmenfs, notwithstanding that, as I have been told by those, who should know t.h'-it the objective was uni cation. p T do not know what that riKans. Nor do I know whether anv one has ever de^ri^d it. Neither have I heard it advocated, except in this chamber, that all powers should be centralized in this Parliament. I do no; think any one wants thatAbsolute centralization of authority at Canberra is vastly different fro m centraT be bonorable memlization of certain functions essential to the good government of Australia. It was because of a H i g h Court decision that I am stating facts. Tbe the Commonwealth Government ascertained its power to centralize income taxation. The State Premiers who attended honourable member for Wentlhe Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers at Canberrai n January rebelled against such centralization, notwithstanding the sovereign powers they still possess. Tben, having agreed, reluctantly or otherwise, to a central taxing authority, they were left to decide the allocation of the money. No one else I have taken the trouble has emphasized that fact in this debate. The States decided the allocation, not the Commonwealth, because after they had agreed to a uniform income tax the Commonwealth asked them to get together on that subject. Thisb i ll represents what Order ! they agreed to. I understand that that is T h a t is fact. The States' the eorrect statement of the position. circumstances, a banker at Jerilderie agreed. was. It sounds to me like something out of the Bible. ; the honourable member knew more about bushranging than that. D r . GAHA -There is another interesting point about this matter. After a long and wordy battle, the PremiersW e l l , I am not responagreed to uniform income taxation. They had appealed to the H i g h Court, which had ruled that the Commonwealth had autliority to centralize the collection of income taxes. Therefore, the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy) cannot properly object to the Commonwealth taking that authority. The Premiers agreed reluctantly to uniform income taxation and the Commonwealth said to them, "" He r e is £40,000,000. Y ou agree among yourselves as to how it should be distributed "" . The distribution is the result of thc decision of the Premiers. wm-k out the formula?",57,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

216,Mr Lazzarini,"Yes.member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has given me a thought. I do not often get one. In polities, one does not want thoughts. But I have an idea. Ever since I became a member of this chamber, I have heard everybody sayI have said it myself-that , ""The time has arrived when we must evolve an equitable formula to distribute money between the Commonwealth and the States"".. But no one has ever got beyond that point. As to the how, when, where or why of the formula we have not heard a word. In the last three years, the Leader of the Opposition( Mr Mienzies) has made the same, speech twenty -times in relation to the distribution of Commonwealth grants to the States, but he has never got beyond saying that, "" The time has arrived when we must have a new formula"". Although he himself has never prescribed a formula, he is the first person to criticize the formula of any competent authority. So he has it both ways. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber know that a formula providing a more equitable distribution should be evolved, bnt what it should be, the Lord only knows! That is my conclusion. I believe that some one should prescribe a new formula, but when we examine all the ramifications, the problem becomes impossible. The Premiers themselves recognized that, and tliey soon harmoniously agreed upon this allocation. Sufficient stress has not been laid upon another provision in the bill, and I direct attention to it. Clause 10 providesI f , at any time(«) after the thirtieth day of June, One ber of a State Parliament and he never thousand nine hundred and fiftythroe; tlic Government of any State so requests, the Government of the Commonwealth shall enter iu.to consultation with t.he Governments of 1 lie States with a view to determining whether any rliiitige is desirable in the method provided by this Act for calculating tlie aggregate grant and the distribution thereof amongst the States, and to submitting fco the Vnrlianu'iit legislation to give effect to sucli changes and sound. I. shall be very interested to (if any) whicli, as a result of thai consultation, tlic Governinent of tinConnnomvi'altli considers to bo desirable. it is not an inflexible decision. 1958, the States consider that they are receiving inequitable treatment under uniform income taxation, they may approach the Commonwealtli for a new allocation. get the necessary legislation before the Commonwealth Parliament only if the Commonwealth considered that it, was desirable. Should the bill provide that if tbe States consider it to be desirable, the Commonwealth must introduce the legislation? Wha.t kind of a situation would that be? It would be the antithesis of what the honourable member for Wentworth said to-day, namely, that no control would be exercised over the moneys that had been allocated. What a silly situation it would be if the Parliament, of the Oommonwealth had to obey the behests of the States! The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has had some experience of State politics, but, obviously, that was a long while ago, or Le did not realize what was happening. This bill has regard for the changing face of State politics. I have already said that of the total revenue of New South Wales, only one-fifth is derived from this .Com inonwealth reim bu rsemen t. member set off the expenditure of the railways and the like, which show losses? revenue. A State has many sources of revenue of which the honourable member for Wentworth has not the slightest conception, because he has not been a memwill know about them. After 1953, when,. T earnestly hope, we shall have reached some 3tate of permanent peace, States which are dissatisfied with Commonwealth reimbursements will be at liberty to request a review of the allocations. I suggest, that the Commonwealth would considersympathetically such H request.

223,Dr. Gaha,"I am now referring toPremiers wlio evolved the present formula did a good job. After they had reluctantly agreed to uniform income taxation, they proceeded without delay to distribute the Commonwealth grant among themselves. All things considered, the bill is lhe best that we can expect. I believe that we in this House should recognize more fully the contributions of State policies to the development and -expansion of this country. ment, I am not chiding honourable members on this side of the chamber. Whilst they may have strong federal views, they fully appreciate the contributions of the States to our development. But the States do not fully appreciate uhe Commonwealth's contributions. T. consider that this bill is an excellent preamble to better relations between the ('ommonwealth and the States. have listened with remarkable interest to the apologies of the honourable meinber for Denison (Dr. Gaha). He tried to please the many people in Tasmania who arc opposed to uniform income taxation, and at the same time he endeavoured to satisfy the Labour caucus and Ministers. As an ex-member of the Legislative Council of Tasmania he should know that it is impossible to please everybody. I know the honourable gentleman very well, nnd I have a high regard for him. In view of his previous record in this chamber, I am sorry that ho .should attempt to make an apology for ihe vote which he will soon cast in support of the measure. If the honourable gentleman believes in these proposals, let him say so frankly, and support them; but if he does not agree with them, let him tell caucus what he really does believe. Dr. G AHA I did tell caucus. gentleman has been walking the tightrope for so long that I thought that hew as certain to fall and break his political to Queensland. Now secondary industries neck. H i ; apology has not satisfied any one in this chamber, not even himself. I remind the House thrtt it was only after very protracted negotiations with il'c States, and'a thorough examination of the matter by an all-party committee in 1942, that uniform income tnxation was proposed and accepted reluctantly by the Parliament as a war measure. not represented on that committee. our party sat on that committee, but he was not elected hy us as our representative. I repeat that Parliament reluctantly accepted uniform income taxation as a war measure four years ago. In the interim the State governments have carried on as best they could under that system. However, at the Conference of the Commonwealth and State Ministers every Premier protested vehemently against the continuation of uniform income taxation. In view of that fact, how was agreement reached at that conference? Agreement was achieved only:because the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) stepped up his bid, as in a Dutch auction, offering more and more money to the"" States, until he committed the Commonwealth to an increase of total reimbursement to the States of £5,500,000 above his original ""offer. I am not unmindful of the fact that uniform income taxation has proved of distinct advantage to Queensland.' Unfortunately, Labour governments have been in office in that State for 25 years, for which period their policy has been one of borrow, boom and burst. Prior to the adoption of uniform income taxation, Queensland was the highest: taxed State in the Commonwealth, and under such conditions hacl no hope of developing secondary industries; but to-day, undeithe present system Queensland is on the same footing as the other States. Consequently, its great resources are attracting numbers of companies which will develop the raw materials of the State. Uniform incoine taxation offers protection to tbose companies which previously declined, to set up in business in Queensland when the rate of company tax in that State was four times as high the rate of company tax in Victoria. Therefor* , I am uot unmindful of the 1 advantages of uniform income taxation arc being established in. that State; and we must rely npon the expansion of secondary industry to provide employment for our people.

229,Mr Francis,"A representative ofunderstanding that it would continue only for the duration of the war' and twelve months thereafter. ment proposes to perpetuate the system. I support its continuance for a definite period, say, for another three or four years, because for that period the Commonwealth will be committed to heavy expenditure as the result of the war, including respect of the rehabilitation of ex-service personnel, soldier land settlement, war gratuity, deferred pay and other liabilities. Therefore, I support the continuance of uniform income taxation for the immediate post-war period; but I strongly object to any proposal to perpetuate it. I reiterate that a uniform income tax was agreed to only after the most protracted negotiations at a Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers which achieved the distinction of lasting longer than any other previous conference; and even then the Commonwealth's proposals were accepted by the Premiers under the strongest possible protests. The perpetuation of the present system will hamstring the development of the States. It is a sound principle that the Government which incurs expenditure should be responsible for the imposition of the taxes imposed to meet such expen? diture. Any departure from that principle wiil. encourageextravagance on the part of State administrations. TJnder this system we shall find the States continually wrangling in their endeavours to have their reimbursement increased. As extravagance on their part will be encouraged owing to absence of responsibility for the imposition and collection of taxes they will no doubt keep coming to the Commonwealth for move and more money. The result will be that the Commonwealth it possible to reduce income taxes. However, this country cannot be developed unless the present high rates of income tax are reduced. Crippling taxation hinders trade and commerce and reduces the standard of living of the community. Under such conditions no one suffers more than the workers whom, along with other honourable members, I represent in this chamber. In addition, development must be seriously retarded if the States are obliged to approach the Commonwealth again and again asking for more and Mr Francis. more money to enable them to undertake developmental works. That is a prospect Now, the Governvvhich we cannot view lightly, particularly in large States like Queensland and ""Western Australia Provision must be made for essential public works, particularly irrigation schemes, roads, new settlements, harbours and various other undertakings essential to open up expenditure in virgin country. However, it will be utterly impossible for the States to undertake these works if they are obliged to remain dependent upon the Commonwealth for hand-outs, and to come periodically to the Commonwealth to haggle over-increases of their reimbursements. Development must be steadily carried out; but systematic'development will be impossible under this system. Eor instance, should the States, after initiating essential works, find themselves unable to obtain the necessary funds to oomplete such works, which in many cases will take from three to four years, considerable expenditure will be completely wasted. No State can hope to develop its industrial resources if it is not able to raise its own revenue for that purpose. ""The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) said, in effect, that because a Labour government is in office in Victoria, the Premier of that State, Mr Cain, was able to obtain a much larger reimbursement for Victoria than his predecessor, Mr Dunstan, who was the leader of a non-Labour government in that State. If that principle, or lack of principle, is to' determine the amount of reimbursement to the States, thi.s country will not be developed. Such a policy will undoubtedly cause widespread unemployment. Uniform income taxation was placed on the will not find statute-book as a war emergency measure and it is being continued to-day, if for no other purpose, to meet the costs of the rehabilitation of the country and its ex-servicemen, and to finance all the .obligations and commitments that have come with the peace. When rehabilitation has been completed, and once again we get back to normal peace-time conditions, uniform-income taxation should be promptly abandoned. I support the bill for the sole i'eason that I regard it as necessary for immediate past-war reconstruction and the development of this country; but I oppose its continuance for a day longer than is necessary. Tbose honourable members who would have legislation of this kind placed on the statute-book in perpetuity have but one purpose, namely, unification. federal system, I believe also in the sovereignty of the States, and cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in all spheres. As the States develop, more and greater powers should be given to the Commonwealth by consent of' the people. It is a fallacy to believe that we can develop the Commonwealth whilst allowing the State governments to remain entirely dependent upon the National Parliament for ""hand-outs "" as circumstances permit. Such a policy could only result in retardhind the scenes, and reading between the ing the national development of this country. Por the reasons I have given I support the bill. have listened to some amazingly contradictory statements from honourable members opposite in connection with this bill. At thc beginning of his speech the member for Moreton( Mr Francis) told us that by the large contributions we had given to the States, we had ensured the continuance of high taxation, and that by this proposal we have made certain that the States will be extravagant. Later, the honourable gentleman said that, because of financial restrictions resulting from the continuance of a uniform tax the States would not be able to carry on their ordinary works programme or perform fhe normal functions of government which fall within their sphere. All of the contradictious we have heard from honourable members opposite, and they have been many and varied, have been repeated by the honourable gentleman in the space of a single speech. It is neceshistory to realize that the financial resary to be clear as to what is involved in this measure, whether it is desired by the people, and what form of financial adjustment should be instituted to settle the vexed problems of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. We have heard repeated from time to time with monotonous regularity the statement that the State premiers came to a conference of Commonwealth. and State Ministers determined to end the present system, and that they were bitter in their opposition to its continuance. But as we travel around our electorates and move about thc country, we cannot help but form the ""WhilstI believe in the opinion that the bulk of the Australian people in all walks of life, from"" the businessman and the highest executive tc the smallest ' and least-interested tax-payer, would demand, if given the opportunity, that the uniform tax should continue and that instead of a variety of tax returns, one applicable throughout the length and breadth of Australia should be sufficient. Companies operating in different States would be certain to ask for the continuance of the present system. Looking belines of the case presented by the Premiers it is obvious that they came to the conference knowing they were going to accede to the continuance of a uniform tax, but determined to ""wrest from the Coimmonwealth the best financial treatment possible in the circumstances. That was not an unreasonable attitude. They were given a measure of financial assistance that was rather more than they formerly enjoyed in what were perhaps two abnormal years, and, in addition, an improved formula for determining the amounts to be allocated to them. They have gone back with sufficient money for the. time being to meet the ordinary commitments of their Governments. They have a sliding scale of adjustments which wil] enable them to expand the services which they give to the people, and to plan ahead with certain knowledge that a specific sum will be allocated to them for disbursement, by their Treasuries. Honourable members opposite have insisted that this arrangement is inflexible for all time. We have only to study lations of the Commonwealth and the States have never been inflexible and that it has always been necessary to provide for them to be adjusted from time to time as circumstances required, and the needs of the various State governments demanded. I give .my unqualified support to this measure. I do not pretend that the proposed financial adjustments are absolutely equitable. That rould",60,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading
230,Mr Burke (Perth) [10.3],"Wescarcely be so, having regard to differing conditions in the various States; but they probably represent the best and fairest measure' of agreement that eould be arrived at in the interests of the Commonwealth and the State Governments alike. I turn now to the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the State in a worse position than under Menzies) affid so warmly supported by the Deputy Leader of the Australian true, as he stated, that uniform taxation does to some degree restrict the activities of the State, and that they have not the sovereignty which they.formerly enjoyed when they were free to control their own revenues, but if We accepted the proposition suggested by the Leader of the OppositiotE we woiild limit sovereignty fair more than has been don'e by the existing legislation. TOKlay,the States obtain from the Commonwealth a certain., allocationof the' proceeds of a uniform, tax based on their former tax collections. They are entitled to' expend their allocation iii any way they choose, an'd to plan ahead in the certain knowledge that specific amounts will be placed m their Treasuries. The Leader of the Opposition suggested tlta't we should have an enlarged Commonwealth Grants Commission which should examine the budgets of not only the claimant States but also what are regarded as the standard States. easy for the Commonwealth Grants Commission to'examine the budgets of the ,-tandard States in order to ascertain what might be regarded as an Australian standard under certain heads of expenditureIt is also comparatively easy to analyse the expenditure of the claimant States, and to recommend what grants should' be given to them to enable them to be placed on the agreed level of Australian expenditure; but with a Commonwealth Grants Comniission with enlarged powers-and increased budgets 'of all S'.ates, it must inevitably reach the position when it will say, after examining the budgets of all six S'tates, that certain things should not be allowed or that certain works which the States regard as essential should not be carried out, and to enforce its decisions by lower.!/;-. Hurhe. ing the grant. I claim that that argument is incontrovertible. Assessing the relative expenditure per head of the population as between the"" standard and the claimant States is entirely different from saying what money shall be given to carry o'iit works Or to undertake services. By such a proposal we would definitely place this measure I share the view of those who have given consideration to It is these matters, that the financial relations of the Commonwealth ancl the Slates have not been satisfactory over the years! We have developed only because of the stress of the times through which we have passed. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, the expenditure of money cannot properly their be divorced from its collection, because that would lead to irresponsibility in finance. At the same time, there cannot be a multiplicity of tax collections in the one field of taxation. The only solution, taking the long-range view, is a reference of power by the States to the Com-' monwealth authority, with an expanded local autonomy in the administration of departments that are local in character. I believe that the bill will be warmly welcomedthroughout the country, ancl that there would be a far greater outcry if it, were intended to return to separate State and Commonwealth income tax collections. In the circumstances, the alloIt is comparatively cation as between the 'States, if not completely equitable, is probably the best that eould' be devised. not necessary, for two very good reasons, for me to speak at any length at this late stage of the' debate. The first reason is' that,when the original measure was introduced in 1942,1 went into the matter in some detail, and the views that I then expressed are on record. The second reason is that my leader ( Mr Menzies)' has stated admirably the principles whicli, presumably with in his opinion, should be brought to the personnel-examining the consideration of this legislation. But one or two observations should be placed on record before the debate concludes. I refer at the outset to one of the most obvious matters that should be mentioned.

232,Mr Holt (Fa Wkner),"£10.12] -It isside of the House, repeatedly referred to the scheme as one relating to uniform taxation.. The phrase "" uniform taxation;"" has patently great attractiveness, it conjures up in our minds a mental picture of fairness, national unity and simplicity. But insofar as the debate has proceeded on the assumption that we are dealing with uniform taxation, it has proceeded upon an utterly false assumption. The scheme presented to the Parliament is not one for uniform taxation; it does not deal with taxation in the States otheitban income taxation. In order to give some force to the difference which, I assure the House, is a very substantial one, I make this comment: Prior to the scheme coming into operation, the States financed their activities in a variety of ways. Some States, 'including'the State of Victoria, believed 1 that a substantial proportion of their revenues should be raised by indirect taxation.. Other States-for example, New Soutih Walesrelied' upon income tax for the bulk of their revenues. I believe, from recollection, thatbefore the scheme came into effect approximately one-half of the revenues of Victoria was raised by indirect taxes, whereasin New South Wales les3 than one-third came from that source.. That' fact has a very important bearing'on tliis discussion, and 1 shall deal with it in some' detail directly. should not expect that in the undeveloped Tn passing, may I refer to what was said by the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha), who tried to minimize the consequences of this legislation by -saying that it represents only a very small proportion of the revenues of the States. Tie, of course, was trying to pull the wool over the eyes of honourable members on this side who had not studied exactly what the revenues of the States amount to. 'Quite clearly, if you bring into your revenue picture tlie public -undertakings of the State governments, and do not bother to set off against those public undertakings the expenditures involved in -them, you get a very distorted picture. Bevenue from taxation may appear to bc a very small fraction of the total revenue. Reverting to Victoria, of which I have particular knowledge: An examination of its revenue will disclose that, of a total amount of approximately £35,000,000 for this year, about £17,000,000 is attributable to railway activities. Against that revenue must be set off ail expenditure of approximately £16,000,000. I believe that there was a surplus of less than £50f),000 on the twoaccounts. Therefore, if you try to minimize the significance of taxation payments as far as State activities are concerned, you are apt to get an unbalanced picture. Reverting to the difference between uniform taxation', at which so much of this debate has been directed, and uniform income taxation, I again poiut to the difference between the two principal States. Victoria was largely dependent upon indirect taxation prior to the 1942 act, whereas New South Wales was very much less dependent upon it. Consequently, if there is to be Uniformity of taxation in the f u l l sense of that phrase, it must run rigJlrt through the indirect, taxes which the States collect; otherwise, you will have the same degree of taxation by way of income tax applying throughout the Commonwealth, and very much heavier indirect taxes operating in some States thanin others. That is an aspect which,, so far as I am aware, has not bean referred' to in the course of this debate. My leader made a point in principle' with which one should find general agreement; that is, that we should not take » parochial view of this matter. We States.tliere should be the same severity of taxation' as might be imposed in the more closely settled and older States of the Commonwealth. That proposition, of course, was put in answer to fhe claim whichvery properly has been made from time to time by representatives of Victoria, that the original scheme was inequitable insofar as the distribution of tax moneys was concerned, in its incidence on Victoria. As an offset to that argument, we have the contention that it is necessary to finance more heavily the undeveloped States. That would be an admirable principle for the Government to adopt had it not itself departed from it in what I suggest, was the clumsiest and most inequitable piece of taxation legislation ever introduced in this Parliament. I refer to the scheme initiated last year, which divided Australia into a number of zones. ZoneA was supposed to embrace the least developed and congenial parts of the Commonwealth. The people who live in that zone are now able to claim tax deductions, which are supposed to offset the difficulties that they undergo. Coming a little closer to the areas in which there has 'been development, and comfort is to he found, we have Zone B. Those who live in that zone are entitled to claim a deduction on a lower scale. Finally, we come to the haven of rest and enjoyment-the southern States -in which no tax deductions are permitted. In that legislation, the Government departed from the principle of uniformity, even on the restricted basis of uniformity of incoine taxation. Having done that, I find less force in the argument for giving less than a uniform per capita redistribution of taxes to the That is a criticism in itself of the present legislation, but it is by no means the most serious of the criticisms one could offer. The most serious feature is the weakening effect on the autliority and usefulness of the States themselves. One can understand the danger of being charged here with being a reactionary, if one advocates retention of the authority ancl usefulness of the States. We are told that as Australia approaches, its full nationhood, the States pass more into the background, and that by the ideal of unification we can reach a stage where Australia can be managed most efficiently by a central government at Canberra. That, too, has a certain siiperficial attractiveness, particularly for those people who in their ordinary avocations are not required to look beneath the surface of political slogans. I confess that, when I first' entered this Parliament, unification seemed .to me to be a desirable ideal. As recently as 1942, when speaking on the original bill, I pointed out that, as part of its effect, it would be a strong step forward towards unification. At that time. I did not find that an unwelcome aspect of the measure. I say to-day that, having regard to -my own experience of what has happened in this Parliament and in this country since 1942, when we saw just what could happen to Australia, when we endeavoured to centralize at Canberra practically all of the functions of Government, so far as they affect the individual, my own mind has gone completely in reverse Mr TTnlt. on this issue. Having recalled something of the abuse of the authority in those years, tbe repression of the individual, the flagrant handing out of favours to party supporters and the servile "" toadying to sectional groups by the authorities at Canberra, I contend that if the liberty of the individual means anything the safest course is to decentralize the administration. ments ? ments in Australia at present. If we gave sufficient authority to State governments and municipal bodies, as well as to the central governments, we should conduct the business of this country in a more highly-developed States. much better way than if we endeavoured to manage the detailed affairs of the whole Commonwealth from Canberra. The latter is what we have been trying to do during the war years. In a period of war that was unavoidable, but I take exception to the attitude of the Government in retaining as long as possible certain features of the National Security Act and the regulations framed under it. The argument frequently advanced by those who would advocate this progress towards unification is that it works very well in Great Britain and New Zealand. I have no doubt that in both those countries it does Work well. Most honourable members opposite would be surprised to learn just how much decentralization of activities has occurred in Great Britain in respect of so many of the matters which we regard as being within the province of either the State or the national government. The important distinction to have in mind in advancing that argument is thc geographical character of those countries as contrasted with that of Australia. They are comparatively limited in area and can be administered comparatively easily from a central source. If we wish to get nearer to a parallel with the Australian situation we should consider what happens in the United States of America and Canada, two countries with vast areas to administer.

235,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"PrimeHolt) that that bill was passed through this House, and through the Senate, at a time when the Government did not have a majority in either chamber, so that his remarks in opposition to the principle of uniform income taxation ought to be addressed to his own supporters and quasi-supporters. It was generally recognized that the Commonwealth having such heavy commitments to meet, and being unable to collect sumcient revenue becau.se of tlie varying taxaif this bill is passed that particular act tion methods of the States, was compelled to do what it could to bring about a measure of uniformity, and thus raise the revenue which was so urgently needed. States benefited directly from the new system, and 70 per cent, of all taxpayers gained an immediate reduction of taxes. To illustrate my point about the varying rates of State taxation, let me say that in Queensland the rate began at 6d. in the £1 on an income of over £150, and went as high as 100.8d. in the £1 on higher incomes. South Australia was taxing incomes over £100 at the rate of ls. 3d. in the £1, with an allowance of 3d. for those with dependants, while the rate on higher incomes was 63d. in the £1. A previous government, of whioh the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) wa3 Treasurer for some time, tried very hard, before Japan entered the war, to induce the States to agree to a system of uniform income taxation. He was unsuccessful because of the recalcitrance of the States, ancl their determination not to yield what they regarded as their sovereign rights in the matter of taxation. .As I have said, when the present Government"" eventually passed legislation providing for uniform income taxation, the States applied to the High Court for a declaration that it was invalid. In that, they made a great, tactical mistake, because the judgment of the High Court made it clear that the Commonwealth did not have to depend on its defence powers in order to pass legislation, providing for uniform income taxation, or to obtain priority in the matter of tbe collection of income tax. It became clear that the CommonAvealth could impose whatever taxes it chose, and enjoyed priority over the States in the collection of those taxes. I mention those matters because there has been talk about broken pledges, and T want to make it clear that no pledges have been broken at all. The honourable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron) said it was stipulated that a uniform income tax act should last only for a certain time. That is true, and will not remain in force even as long as \va3 stipulated. I do not want to go into the point about when peace may be regarded as officially existing, but the fact remains that the present act could continue in force until after the lst Julynext. Some States, including Victoria, will get a greater amount next year under this legislation than they could have, hoped for had the Commonwealth Government not decided to introduce new legislation. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) spoke of the difficulties associated with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Those difficulties have always existed; .and they will continue in the future. It isextremely difficult to get six States toagree on a common policy in regard tomatters submitted to them by the Commonwealth. It is said that Victoria hasfaired badly under the uniform incometax scheme. If .that be so, it is due to the fact thaf the reimbursements were based on what the States themselves hacl budgeted to collect over an average of two years prior to the entry of Japan into the war. It is true, as the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) said this afternoon, that because the Parliament: of Victoria desired to keep taxes low on higher incomes and profits of wealthycompanies,, the people of Victoria weredenied certain social benefits which peoplein the other States enjoyed. It suited 1 tlie interests represented by the Government of Victoria to allow the wealthiersections of the community to be taxed at lower rates than in Queensland wheresocial services were provided on a betterscale. The Commouwealth took the viewthat, if the States had budgeted in peacetime on a certain basis, they could not expect better treatment from the Corn-monwealth in time of war. when it had]",66,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

237,Mr Chifley,"I think that is true.to accept responsibility for the conduct of the war. Time has proved that that responsibility did rest on the Commonwealth Government; its indebtedness increased enormously because of the war, whereas the indebtedness of the States was reduced. Some States, including Victoria, accumulated big surpluses largely because of moneys expended within tbeir borders by the Commonwealth. The three major States made substantial financial profits out of the war. profits were re-invested in war loans. -Queensland. Victoria could have done the same, because that State also made substantial profits as the result of heavy time, but I remind him that this legislawar expenditure within its borders by the Commonwealth. The three major States are in a better financial position to-day than when the war started. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Fawkner expressed the view that the reimbursements should be determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The recommendations of that body have never been rejected by any government. Generally, when such a body is set up its advice is accepted, either completely or with some modifications. If the Commonwealth Grants Commission were to be the deciding authority in this matter, the Government would be charged with accepting dictation by a body outside the Parliament. I pay my tribute to the work of the Commonwealth Grants Commission; it has done a remarkable job notwithstanding that the Government of Tasmania has protested rather violently regarding its methods. The commission's reports contain more information regarding State finances than is to be found in any other document tabled in this Parliament. The three major"" States would scorn the idea of asking the commission to determine what reimbursement they should get. They would regard such action as humiliating. did. not object to the Commonwealth taking over their responsibility for State debts. Leader of the Opposition overlooked that fact when he said that the States could borrow and expend money with greater freedom than if this legislation were passed. It is not true that the States are entirely responsible for their own finances inasmuch as the Financial Agreement makes provision for the Commonwealth to contribute to the sinking funds of the States. I remind those who speak on behalf of the States that the States tie down their local governing bodies very severely; in three States such bodies may strike a rate above a certain amount only with the approval of the State Government. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) said that there should be an opportunity for a review of the formula within a certain tion does not seek to ratify a contract entered into between the Commonwealtli and the States. It says that if the States do certain things moneys will be paid to them. There has been agreement between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to the entertainments tax. But uniform income tax was at no time the subject of an agreement. It is true that conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers have no legislative power and are not officially recognized by the Parliament. Nevertheless, they do play an important part in tbe legislative life of this country. No contract has been entered into, but an understanding has been reached with the States, under which the uniform income tax legislation will be reviewed after seven years. Of course that binds only this Governinent. Any other Commonwealth Government could repeal this legislation. It is not irrevocable. Any Commonwealth Parliament could revert to t.he old system, but I shall be very much surprised if any future Commonwealth government does so honourable gentleman does, not believe that any government intends to -commit political suicide. as follows:A review of the method of determining tlie aggregate grant and its distribution may be sought at any time after the expiration of seven years from the 1st July, 1940, by either the Commonwealth or a State government...",67,States Grants Tax Reimbursement Bill 1946 Second Reading

I do not to-day, Mr CMfleij. believe, though, that, if the Opposition regained the treasury' bench, it .would do that we have placed on the statute-book. When that legislation was brought down, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) talked about it as being "" phoney "", but I do not hear much talk Any one is in ensuring their protection. It is a great We have instituted of the Opposition spoke and fluently some time ago, about tbe need for tbe Commonwealtb to enter tbe field of education. This is tbe only Commonwealth Government which has made a move in that direction. vided assistance for higher education, including university training and is making extensive provision for the re-establishment of ex-servicemen, technical training, tbe provision of equipment, and even the capital expenditure of universities. If members of the Opposition are sincere, they w ill never reject the policy which this Government has adopted of assisting education. Therefore, this Parliament is responsible not only for the social security of the people but also for the physical security of Australia from the standpoint of defence. We shall have important obligations in the Pacific, and shall co-operate bers of the British Commonwealth of Nations to defend the Empire. We Parliament has ever gone in the past and must play our part to preserve peace. The conference of the United Nations at San Francisco formulated proposals for preventing aggression in the future, and those proposals impose obligations upon Australia, this Parliament and the government of the day. Those responsibilities must be paid for, and every citizen of the Commonwealth, regardless of whether he lives nnWestern Australia or Queensland, should be making some contribution to the cost. The Government believes that this legislation is in the best interests of the country, and I am confident that many of the political supporters of the Opposition would not forgo what they regard the benefits of uniform income taxation. The system of Commonwealth and State taxation, which operated before the introduction of uniform income taxation, was all right when rates of tax were low, but the financial responsibilities of this Parliament w ill never permit them to return to the level of 1920. The only simple and equitable method of collecting income tax is by a uniform system. I rose to deal with one or two principal points which honourable members have raised regarding the relations between tbe Oommonwealth and the States. I know that they are difficult. There w ill always be difficulties. I do not pretend that this legislation represents the last word in the financial relations between the Commonwealth and States, because as circumThis Government has prostances change, the scheme w ill have to be reviewed; but I believe that, regardless of the government in office, the main principle enunciated in this legislation has come to stay.

[11.6] I again direct the attention of the Minister for the A r my ( Mr Forde) to the necessity for releasing men who are urgently required for the production of food. I have here letters which I shall send to the Ministeri n due course, but I raise the matter to-night because of the importance of the principle involved. For the purposes of my argument I refer specifically to the plight of those engaged in the production of honey in South Australia. Because of the summer rains, many trees and shrubs are now in bloom, and large quantities of honey should be available. Men are required urgently to handle the bees. All honourable members may not be aware that",68,Cameron Th E States Standing Reached With The Premiers Was

245,Motion (By Mr Chiele T) Proposed,,70,Adjournment Honey Fencin G Wiee Fa T Stock Sales In Melboubne Nationa L Security Act Duratio N
246,Mr Akchie Cameron (Barker),"men require some experience in handling bees and transporting them from place to place. Some men with this experience are still in the Army. They are doing absolutely nothing; but the authorities liave laid down the principle that these men may be released only in accordance with the points systemThe position of primary production in Australia is .nich that in circumstances like these, the points system should be discarded, and when a man has had experience of handling bees and gathering honey he should be permitted to return to this work. I raise that as a specific instance whicli, in my opinion, justifies the Gcvemm'Mit. in departing from the points system so that the maximum production of food may be secured. The secretary of the South Australian Honey Producers Co-operative Society informed me that apiarists have large orders not only from the United Kingdom, India Islands but also from Denmark and Sweden. This co-operative concern can place every pound of-honey that South Australia can produce. For the information of the Government, I point out that the produetion of honey in South Australia is not confined to orchards. The great bulk of the honey is produced as the result of apiarists taking their bees on motor lorries through many miles of mallee scrub. The mallee tree produces the blossom from which the bees gather the honey. It is only when the rains occur at certain periods of the year that the inallee bursts into blossom, and the honey must be gathered without delay. If the honey is not gathered during the next three or four weeks, the apiarists will not have another opportunity for a year. It is high time that the Minister for the Army told his department the exact policy of the Government regarding the discharge of servicemen to engage in a production of food. Many of us have a strong suspicion that the Army is telling Ihe Minister what its policy is. [11.10] I have just received the"" following urgent telegram:Flood Mary Valley swept away 40 miles fences. No wire any kind available Queensland. Can you help hasten supplies. Mary Valley Dairymen's .lSxecutiVc -JAC K AHEBN, Conondalc, Queensland. That telegram speaks for itself. Honourable members are aware of the destructive floods which occurred recently in the Mary Valley. Much damage has been done at Conondale which is south of Gympie. The district is a very rich agricultural and pastoral area, and is closely settled by dairy-farmers,the average holding being comparatively small. Therefore, the destruction of 40 miles of fencing in such an area is a serious loss. Until the fences are restored, crops cannot be planted, whilst existing crops will be menaced by stock. These fences must also be restored as soon as possible for the protection of cattle. The district is noted for its stud stock, being in that respect one of the outstanding districts in Queensland. The 'dairy-farmers affected appeal urgently for assistance from the Commonwealth Government. They do not ask for financial aid, but simply that and the Pacific supplies of fencing wire be made available as soon as possible. Only a week ago I appealed in this House to the Minister for Commerce ancl Agriculture ( Mr Scully) to make available adequate supplies of fencing wire, galvanized iron and other galvanized products urgently required by primary producers in Queensland. On this occasion I urge the Minister, in view of the serious loss suffered by these farmers, to treat the matter urgently. I request him to contact representative farmers in the district first thing to-morrow to ascertain their requirements and to make such requirements available immediately. These farmers require fencing wire not only in the interests of themselves and their families, but also in order to be able to resume production of urgently needed products. bring to the notice of the Government the deplorable condition still existing in respect of meat supplies in Victoria, particularly in Melbourne. For weeks past, thousands. of consumers have not been able to obtain any meat at all. Last week a so-called settlement was announced by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), who expressed the hope that the settlement would prove effective -",70,Adjournment Honey Fencin G Wiee Fa T Stock Sales In Melboubne Nationa L Security Act Duratio N

248,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [11.14],"Iproved considerably. so-called settlement was founded on false premises. It will not remedy the situation. Supplies in Melbourne this week have improved only slightly. At Newmarket only .11,000 fat sheep were yarded on Tuesday. That is far below the normal yarding required to meet Melbourne's requirements. Only country butchers and graziers operated. Melbourne butchers did not do so. Lambs fetched 4Ss. 7d. each and wethers 49s. lOd. each, those prices being about 2s. ab6ve the wholesale ceiling price. . The prices fetched for bullocks were also well above the average. are unable to obtain any meat. They are just keeping their shops open with their staffs at the ready, wondering when sheep will come to hand. Some shops have not had any supplies since Priday last, and those butchers are pessimistic about obtaining any mea.t this week. It is reported that a quantity of frozen beef was made available, but the quantity was well below the average necessaiy -to meet normal supplies. For instance, one butcher whose normal demand is 2,000 lb. a week received only 400 lb. last week. He found it impossible to supply the needs of his customers. The position is that metropolitan butchers are not competing at the sales because the acquisition order is still in force. Until that order is abrogated they will not buy; and in such circumstances sheep-owners will not send their stock to market. When this matter was brought previously to the notice, of the Minister he said that the acquisition order would remain in force until the supplies became normal. It must be obvious that so long as the acquisition order remains in force the situation will not become normal. The first thing that the Government should do is to abrogate that order. If that be done, supplies will become normal. My second point relates to responsibility for the present situation. Yesterday, I a^ked the Mimster a question, to which he replied'.Pile ink was scarcely dry on the agreement before certain interests commenced a movement to frustrate the agreement. Those interests were making every effort to induce producers not to forward stock to Melbourne. ThenI asked the Minister to name the interests to which he referred, and he repliedBeing aware of the honourable member's knowledge of the fat-stock trade of Victoria, I had it in miud to ask him that question when I got an opportunity. The Minister, in effect, admitted that he could not name the interests which he stated in a vague sort of way were sabotaging the agreement; and I take this opportunity to say that I do not know of any such interests. In this House last week some honourable members said that the producers were on strike ancl woulcl Some metropolitan butchers not send their stock to the sale-yards. That"" is not correct. No one can expect the producer to send fat stock to market unless he is assured of fair prices. I have seen no evidence that the opera-' tions of wholesale or retail butchers have had any material effect on the general state of the market. This attempt to find a scapegoat for the troubles that beset the industry will fail. The scapegoat is and can only be the Government itself. This situation is not one which has arisen this week, this year or even last year; it has been in existence ever since rationing and ceiling prices were instituted by the Government. Not the slightest effort has been made by the Government to enforce its regulations governing either of those important features of its war-time administration. If the Government had actively policed the regulations governing rationing ancl ceiling prices this' situation would not have arisen. Its lack of a sense of responsibility in this direction has resulted in tlie growth of vested interests which have operated to the detriment of producers and consumers alike. Producers now hold large numbers of stock which, were bought at high' prices; they cannot be expected to sell at the reduced prices now ruling. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture should review the whole situation or the Government should be willing to appoint a committee of members of this House to ascertain the facts. I have indicated the causes that have brought about-this unsatisfactory state of affairs and I appeal to the Government to act at once to end its tinkering",71,Adjournment Honey Fencin G Wiee Fa T Stock Sales In Melboubne Nationa L Security Act Duratio N

I ask 'the Minister to go to Melbourne immediately so that he may be able to obtain first-hand evidence of what is going on and take the necessary steps to find a solution. desire to comment on the statement made to-day by the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) in reply to a query which I put to him on the motion of the adjournment of the House some weeks ago. The right honourable gentleman's statement related to the definition by the Government as to when the war. in which Australia had been engaged was to be deemed to have ceased. I doubt if anybody who listened to the right honourable gentleman would be at all enlightened upon the point. It is clear that there is a great deal of uncertainty in the commercial world and in the community generally as to when the war is deemed to have ended. ""We were looking to the Attorney-General to throw some light on this important matter, but he has not taken it a stage farther than any previous statements made by the Government. To sum up his statement in a sentence he puts it that a state of war will be deemed to have ended when the treaty of peace has been concluded. He may have implied that a state of war ended when that government itself had made a public proclamation on the subject. That would be an appropriate way to end the uncertainty. One does not get very much help from the legal authorities on the subject. In the American case Chapman v. Wacaser. just after the Civil ""War, it was laid down that a bond stipulating that the money should be due "" ten days after peace"" between the United States of America and the Confederate States meant merely ten days after the war was over, and not ten days after the ratification of a treaty of peace. The British authorities, on the other hand, decided after the last war one important case, that of Kolzias v. Tyser, which contained this comment by the judgeIn the first place, the authorities show that, in the absence of any specific statutory or contractual provision to the contrary, the general rule of international law is that as between civilized powers who have been at war, peace is not concluded until a treaty of peace is finally binding upon the belligerents, and that that stage is not reached until ratifications of the treaty of peace 'have been exchanged between them. I do not believe that we can look for very much guidance from the legal authorities who have determined this issue in respect of past wars because the conditions obtaining in this instance differ very materially from those of the past. Beference was made by the learned judge in the case I have just quoted to "" civilized powers who have been at war "". There was little of civilization in Germany and Japan or in the manner in which they conducted the war against us. The Japanese war started in what they termed the ""-Chinese Incident"", which subsequently developed into a full scale war in the Pacific. I believe that the Attorney-General oversimplifies the matter when he says we should await the conclusion of a peace treaty. As I asked earlier, with whom is the peace treaty concluded? In this instance there was not an armistice, as was the case during the 1914-18 war; there was an unconditional surrender by our enemies in Europe and in the Pacific, and if unconditional surrender does not mean the conclusion of a state of war, plain English words have ceased to have any real meaning. [Quorum formed.] I claim that a state of war ceased to exist with the unconditional surrender of the enemy. Viewing the matter in a practical way, does the Minister seriously suggest that all the war-time arrangements under the National Security Act are to continue until Australia has concluded a treaty of peace or has been a party to an international gathering at_ which a treaty has been concluded 1 The right honourable gentleman has emphasized the separate position of Australia in relation to international commitments. We declared war as a nation in respect of both Germany and Japan. Therefore, we do not have to await a final determination by other nations as to the conclusion of a state of war before we decide that a war is over. Having regard to the impracticability of concluding -a peace treaty with Germany, now subdivided into various areas for occupation by the Allies, or with Japan, at present governed by directives issued by General MacArthur, the proper course for the",72,Adjournment Honey Fencin G Wiee Fa T Stock Sales In Melboubne Nationa L Security Act Duratio N
251,Mr Holt (Eawkner) [11.23],"ICommonwealtli Government to take is to issue a proclamation that a state of war between this country"" and its former enemies has come to an end. If the Government does not pursue that course, but attempts to maintain the utterly unreal attitude that a state of waicontinues unti l treaties of peace have heen concluded, the suspicions that have been aroused in the minds of many people in this country w ill be f u l l y justified. They suspect that the Government, having been defeated in its recent referendum proposals, and having been frustrated in its efforts to continue into the peace-time existence of this country its war-time administration is straining the language of the National Security Acti n order .to continue its operation beyond the proper date, thus imposing on t.he people of Australia legislative enactments and regulations which should no longer have force or validity. I put it to the Attorney General that he cannot allow the country to continue in the state of uncertainty in which it has been left by the statement that he made to-day. The Government should examine realistically the situation that now exists between ourselves and our former belligerents. The proper course is to proclaim or formally declare that a state of war no longer exists. Mi-. HUTCHINSON (Deakin) [11.34]. I wish to follow up the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) in regard to the meat position in Victoria. confusion among the meat producers in that State cannot be questioned. There is absolute chaos on the Melbourne meat market. Thousands of people in Melbourne cannot purchase fresh meat. Men are out. of work. I am also advised that there is a new for m of Gestapo at work in connection with the butcher shops. Beauteous females, called ""Dedman's damsels "", with tears in their eye3 implore butchers to supply them with meat to help "" poor Uncle Dan"" or some other person who badly heeds sustenance. As they have not the necessary coupons, the unfortunate butcher who supplies meat is taken to court and finds himself written up in the columns of T r u t h . A little more than a week ago, a conference was held in Melbourne. Prior to that a rather extraordinary debate took place in this House, from one angle alone, in that the Ministerf o r Post-war Beconstruction ( Mr Dedman) took one line and threatened the producers with "" merry h e l l "" if they did not do what he wanted them to do, whilst the Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) took an entirely different line and adopted a conciliatory tone, stating that a conference was to be held in Melbourne during tbe week-end from which he hoped that good would come. That conference was held, but it merely added to the confusion. It was said.that the open market would be resumed, ceiling prices would be retained, and the meat acquisition order would be withdrawn. There was some confusion as to what this meant. Last week I asked the Minister for Commerce and A g r i culture when the acquisition order would be withdrawn, and his reply was, "" When the producers start sending in their stock"". The producers, on the other hand, believed that the acquisition order would be withdrawn before they sent in their stock. Had that been done, undeniably fresh meat would be in the Melbourne markets to-day. Last Saturday, an article appeared in the Melbourne Herald, which added to the confusion. It mentioned that more than 1,000,000 people in Melbourne were without supplies of fresh meat on that day, and went on to sayPeople closely associated with the meat industiy know this. They also know the organizers of this move and the motives inThat there is considerable fluencing them, but they are afraid to speak out. The article then stated that members of the Federal Parliament did not know or would not say what was the cause of the trouble. Another statement wasMen who have been closely associated with the meat industry say the withholding of supplies has been sponsored by a small group of people comprising some agents and dealers whose real concern is not the amount of meat Melbourne will get or thc price producers are to be paid but their own profit. Usually, I have a great deal of respect for the Melbourne Herald. I know many of the men who work on'it. I can only conclude that some executive officer said to a young reporter, "" Go out and scour the city and find out what is the trouble with the meat market"". He did so, and then wrote this article, which is the greatest "" trip e "" I have ever read. What is the trouble? pi'ice of wether mutton lb. That means that a 46-lb. wether, allowing 2s. or 3s. for the skin, should be selling in Melbourne for 26s.; and a -50-lb. wether, regarded as good trade mutton, for 28s. or 29s. The Border Mail last Saturday, reporting a stock sale held at Albury on stated that the prices realized young merino wethers, over 39s.; cross bred wethers, 37s. to 3Ss.; border-cross ewe weaners, 37s.; and ordinary wool ' wether weaners, over 29s. Those are store prices, but fats are supposed to be sold in the Melbourne market at between 26s. and 29s. The whole problem is purely an economic one. It is so simple that anybody who is in touch with the situation knows the cure for it. The first reason for its existence is the utter failure of the Government during the last twelve or eighteen months to deal with black marketing That, however, is only a minor cause. The principal cause is that last year we had the most colossal drought in our history, and millions of sheep died. day, the demand more tban equals the supply. Darwin right down to Victoria, has been a wonderful season, and there is a flush of feed. Nobody is stocked up, and many producers have been almost cleaned out. At least 70 per cent, of the producers are in lien to banks, wool firms and stock and station agents. must have some money in their pockets and they must keep their pastures in good condition. Can we expect the market to be normal? ducer must have a payable price. early in January or late in December, the prices winter fattening have been running from 30s. upwards, and those prices are normal in districts from which the winter mutton run on poor country, but on rich clover land. How can a producer who has paid 30s. or more for wethers be expected to send them to Melbourne and sell them for 26s. or 27s., less trucking and yarding dues? The producers' costs have risen. We know that prices have increased over a wide range of commodities, Prices Stabilization Committee has given Mr Ifulohinxon. The ceiling subsidies in respect of a large variety of is 6^d. per products. Is the meat industry to be exempt from the usual practice? Why cannot the Government recognize the economic facts in relation to the 'meat industry, and rectify the position? I do Albury not, believe that there is a large number of sheep that the producers wish to sell. Friday, The Riverina and the north-eastern weredistricts of Victoria are not fully, stocked, and there was a strong tendency to hold and shear. The producer might well expect a good wether to provide him at shearing time with wool to the value of £1. For example, I was told by a person present at the Albury sale that wethers -sold for 39s. would in a late district cut over £1 worth of wool, and that would leave a young wether off shears a value of between 24s. and 26s. If wool prices rise as is expected, the price of sheep also must rise, and the ceiling price w ill have to be in conformity with rising wool and enforce ceiling prices. values. We cannot discard economic facts, and say that the level of prices ruling some years ago w ill become the level to-day. There w i ll be new levels in the post-war Toworld. We shall not return to the 1942 values. Owing to the known fact of Everybody wants sheep. From drought and the demand for sheep being there greater than the supply, we cannot expect present ceiling prices to hold. The Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture should get in touch w i th the leaders of the industry in Melbourne. I would say to the Government, "" For God's sake do They not send John Dedman "". If the Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture would get to work in the matter and face the facts I ' believe that the problem could Of course not. The probe solved.
