Howard said, and I think it is important to put it on the record again: There is nothing surer than that, with a privatised Telstra, whether partly or wholly, Concern about the environment is no longer some the board will be directing the company not kind of fetish, pseudo-intellectual passing phase only to make investments in overseas teleissue, it is now a mainstream issue of permanent communication industries but also to make concern to Australians of all generations and that sure that tax is paid at the minimum possible is a point that I have made time and time again, not level. The minister cannot direct any of those only in the period I have been Leader of the Opposition, but also before that, and therefore what things. That is not possible under the current we have decided to do in this policy is to make the legislation.

Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC663 Wednesday, 8 May 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 May, on motion by Mr Jull: That the bill be now read a second time. to congratulate you on your elevation. It is fair to say that you are widely respected in the House for your tolerance. On behalf of the opposition, I wish you the best. It is obviously a very difficult job and it is often most unrewarding on your own side of parliament when under some pressure. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill is largely uncontroversial, stemming from section 66 of the constitution, which has a requirement that there be amendments in regard to increases in ministerial salary. This, of course, interrelates with the 1990 Remuneration and Allowances Act and with increases that stem from the relationship between the wages of parliamentarians and those of the Senior Executive Service bands. One point that has emerged in the last week-and the Minister for Administrative Services( Mr Jull) has given assurances that a seeming problem is being covered-relates to the impact of this move upon former ministers and the pensions of such people or their widows. Obviously, if you decrease the wages of the outer ministry, the interrelationship with former ministers' pensions or superannuation could be affected. The context in which this bill is being presented is one of the new frugality and lean administration of the government. Great play is being made of the reduction in the size of the ministry and the decision to pay a number of the more junior ministers less money. There is reference to the disappearance of the National Media Liaison Service and the supposed disappearance of consultants. Of course, this is a new nirvana, a new Camelot in Australian politics after 13 years in the desert, and all is going to change. On historical precedent, one has to have some doubts about this long-term tum of events, if we have reference to the Fraser government and its early statements about what it was going to do and to a bit of the history afterwards, which involved the suppression of material in relation to areas such as wages and staffing levels. More interestingly, I heard a lot of this when, after 15 years in the wilderness, we had a new government in New South Wales and there were going to be similar changes. The minister has a job ahead of him in curbing the kind of problem that we saw emanate from that government when similar promises were made. Interestingly, the speech of the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey) made reference to his maiden speech, but he certainly skipped over the regime that operated in that state. During that period we saw very few ministers survive the actual government-whether it was the Deputy Premier who was found by ICAC to have created a 'climate conducive to corruption' or the Minister for Education who resigned after tax evasion or the assistant secretary who was in a similar category or the Minister for",136,Notices Reports Shall Stand Referred To Committees In

298,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (10.00 A.m.},"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunityMC664 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 Administrative Services who resigned after revelations of an attempt to influence the Minister for Planning. That was the kind of new broom that went through. We have really got to have some doubts about the long-tenn cost cutting and reduction in services of the ministerial wing. I can assure you that the opposition will be vigilant in these matters. It is interesting that already we are seeing the decision by five ministers to operate in their home states, supposedly for a variety of reasons. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was not too interested in the comments of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), who said that, along with the privilege of serving as a minister or parliamentary secretary, there were some personal sacrifices in terms of the time and energy that must be devoted to official duties and some loss of privacy. The only reason Dr Wooldridge can give for moving his ministerial office to Melbourne was so that he would be, as he said on 8 April on Channel 10, 'close to his family'. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) came up with an even more preposterous proposition for why he had to be in Brisbane. On the same TV program, he said that it was to be 'closer to our indigenous communities'. That is why the minister had to move his office to Brisbane. As we have seen in the last week or so, it might have more to do with his Albert Schweitzer efforts in the health field rather than with proximity to indigenous communities throughout this country. We are already seeing the decision to move ministerial offices to home states. That is obviously going to occasion refitting. It is also going to occasion public servants getting on planes every five minutes with pieces of paper and briefings, and obviously there will be a consequential increase in cost there. So that is one area where we are seeing difficulties. We have also seen in the last few days the pressure that has been put on the minister for Aboriginal affairs to give up his occupation and there is the continuing question over the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson). Supposedly, there is no conflict of interest with regard to his operation of that portfolio and its interrelationship with the field in which he makes a dollar. Already-despite constant assurances from those opposite that they will reduce waste, that there will not be conflict of interest, that there will be integrity in government-there are very big questions. They made great play of who was overseas and who got whatever travel allowances et cetera, but when they tried to run a mock anti-terrorist operation through the Protective Service coordinating centre, which runs mock anti-terrorist activities for the ministers, they found that none of the ministers in this new government were available to undertake the operation-they were overseas or unavailable. That is typical of what we can expect. The reality is that this bill, as is indicated, essentially decreases the amount available for the coming year because of the reduction in the size of the ministry. That reduction in salaries pays for the increase for ministers under the previous government. There is nothing controversial in the measure but essentially we will be putting forward that there is a need to be vigilant, that there is a need to be watchful, especially given the already questionable insistence and attempt by some ministers to evade the Prime Minister's requirements with regard to ministerial conduct. There is already evidence of some ministers having a commercial interest in fields where they have ministerial responsibility. As I said, there is a need to ensure that the promises we have been given with regard to reductions in consultancies do persist and are not simply an early enthusiasm for change which, as with the Fraser government, soon disappears. Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC665 great to be able to follow the member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson). I was told he was a good bloke and I did not realise what entertaining stories he could tell. I suspect my children would probably respond quite happily to the fairy story we just heard. Jack and the Beanstalk is their current favourite, but I might show them a few copies of the honourable member's contribution in this place this morning. But let us stick to the topic at hand. 1952 which, of course, sets the sum required from time to time to cover the changes to the level of ministerial salaries or the number of ministers. This sum is appropriated and is expected to meet the costs of salaries and no more. As has been mentioned already, it is based on section 66 of the constitution. The changes that are before us today are twofold: one is to tidy up the mess which was left behind by the previous government and the other sets a new course for this new government. The previous Labor administration, as we all know, was just no good with money. They increased ministerial salaries and they did not appropriate the funds that were necessary to cover the cost. These amendments today are all about that. Currently, the act limits the amount to $1.615 million but Labor spent more than that in the current year because it did not budget the funds. This legislation increases the appropriation to tidy this matter up for the current year. The amount involved is $1.64 million, which will meet the cost of paying previous ministers in the old Labor government. They are lucky that it was not a performance based pay agreement or a few of those former ministers might be owing the Australian people a large refund at the moment. Under the previous arrangements set by the old government, $1.78 million would have been the amount required in subsequent years under this legislation. The second set of amendments proposes a new lower limit of ministerial salaries for those who serve outside the cabinet. As a result of this second tier of wages for ministers, the amount required in subsequent years will decrease to $1.6 million. This saving might seem small in the overall scheme of things but it is a start. I applaud the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) for proposing these changes, although I believe that the changes do not reflect the expertise, experience and commitment which the ministers are bringing to their jobs. Some members opposite may see the whole thing as a stunt and, if it is, it is quite unlike those of the previous government because it is one which actually saves money. I have spoken to a lot of members of my community about this, and they applaud the gesture. In fact, on the night that the minister made the announcement I was at one of my local clubs, the Macgregor Lions Club. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be amused to know that I was fined by the tail twister as a result of this particular decision. He said there must be a lot of ministers in Canberra if a $10,000 reduction in pay was going to fix up an $8 billion hole in the budget. I paid over my couple of dollars quite happily. That was certainly the way they joked about it, but I must say that that gentleman, many others in the Macgregor Lions Club and other members of my community have since come to me and conceded that they see the gesture that is contained within this bill, as announced by the Prime Minister and the minister, as indicative of the sort of leadership that they wanted and expected from this government. I commend the bill to the House.",145,Representatives Main Committee

301,Mr Hardgrave,"Yes. We are talking about amendments to the Ministers of State ActMC666 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson) and the member for Moreton( Mr Hardgrave) for their contributions. I know the member for Reid did raise the issue of the superannuation payments to former members and their widows. For the record, I assure the member for Reid that the government was well aware of what the effects of that would be. Under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act, parliamentary pensions are fixed as a percentage of parliamentary salaries payable to serving members from time to time. The $10,000 reduction in the additional salary for non-cabinet ministers did have the effect of reducing pensions for politicians. In order that the effect of this measure be prospective and not retrospective, the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey) wrote to the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) on 2 May seeking his agreement to amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act of 1948. The Prime Minister has replied to my colleague the Minister for Finance consenting to such an amendment. So that will be covered. The member for Reid-in a good-natured way, I am sure-raised the issue of my capacity to keep the costs of government under control. Let me assure the member for Reid that I am well equipped to do this and that the business of keeping costs under control is already well under way. He did mention a couple of items but, if you look at the savings that have been made in the first couple of weeks of this government, it really is quite incredible. Certainly, the reduction in ministerial salaries was a marked move away from the moves that were made by our predecessors. The reduction in the size of the ministry also brings considerable savings to the government. The reduction in the number of consultants to the ministry, from 40 to one-and that one consultant being to the Prime Minister-also saves millions of dollars. So that commitment is there and at the moment we do have under review a number of other areas where we think we could make some considerable savings in the cost of government. set by the leadership of the country. I believe that example has already been set and will continue to be set as we review the costs of government. By the interest that has been shown in this bill, with so many government members in the chamber, I know that they too are going to make sure that the government does meet its commitment of reducing unnecessary costs. When you have members such as the member for Gilmore( Mrs Gash) and the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) who have certainly been most up-front in terms of their commitment to slashing government expenditure, you can see the sort of backup that this government is going to have as it tries to rationalise the cost of government in Australia. I also thank the member for Moreton( Mr Hardgrave) for his contribution. I am fully aware of that particular Lions club as it used to be in my constituency. I will not tell you some of the things that I was fined for over the years, but I know from the membership of that club that they too would be very interested in the cost reduction. This bill does provide some very real savings in the money that is going to be required not only for this year, under the new government, but also over coming years when we will see significant savings. I understand the bid for next financial year will be $1.6 million, which is a reduction of what we are looking for at the moment; that is, $1.64 million to cover the costs of the salaries of ministers of the previous government. I thank those who have contributed to the bill. We look forward to its speedy passage in the other place.",147,Representatives Main Committee

Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 May, on motion by Mr Prosser: That the bill be now read a second time. a pretty straightforward proposition. The main purpose is to insert in the Excise Tariff Act 1921 the definition of 'prescribed division' which is currently contained in an excise by-law. In effect, what that definition does is determine the periods of the year for calculating excise duty on crude oil under the Excise Tariff Act. The bill has been presented as the result of advice received by the government from the Attorney-General's Department earlier this year. That advice suggested that the transfer of the definition from the by-law to the act should be made for the purposes of clarity, and with retrospective effect to the date that the by-law definition came in-which was 1 July 1983. So the amendment which this bill effects is remedial. It will put the validity of both future and past duty collections beyond challenge. We appreciate the importance of the technical amendment to secure the revenue base and it is against that background that we will be supporting the passage of the bill. The bill also makes a drafting amendment to the Excise Tariff Act to achieve gender neutrality. We commend this as the gender neutral drafting of Commonwealth legislation was a process that we initiated when in government. So we support the passage of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1996. Committee of the 38th Parliament and to have the opportunity to speak to this bill. The purpose of the bill is to insert into the Excise Tariff Act 1921-the principal act-the definition of 'prescribed division' which is currently contained in an excise by-law. The definition is necessary for determining the periods of the year for the purposes of calculating the excise duty on crude petroleum oil under sections 6B-'0Id' oil, 6C-'new' oil, and 60'intennediate' oil, of the principal act. The people in my electorate and in other country areas of Australia only know it as petrol or diesel. And their concern is about the prices, and the variety of prices, that are experienced in country Australia, and about the differences between metropolitan areas, such as Melbourne and Sydney, compared with the prices in an area such as Bendigo, which I have the honour and privilege to represent. Country people fully accept that there may be a few cents per litre difference in the price of fuel but they will not accept the fact that between urban and rural prices there could be differentials of 10c, 15c and sometimes up to 20c per litre in the price of petrol or diesel fuel. .This is a very important issue for me, as it is, I am sure, for the member for Ballarat and a number of other members representing rural constituencies. It is a very important issue and it is one which the coalition addressed during the lead-up to the 1996 election campaign.",148,Representatives Main Commiti Ee

306,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (10.19 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to be here in the MainMC668 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 The shadow minister at that time, Peter McGauran, the federal member for Gippsland, was very active on this issue during the election campaign. He introduced a proposal to introduce fairness and transparency into country petrol prices. When the shadow minister launched that in Melbourne he said that the policy that we would be implementing in government would ensure that consumers in country areas would be able to buy petrol at fair prices. He claimed that there were distortions in the market which caused unacceptable pricing differentials between metropolitan and country markets. Since that time, of course, the coalition has been elected to government and we are looking forward now to the government and the minister implementing this policy. As a first stage in this, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to examine prices at every stage from the refinery gate to the petrol pump to investigate any anticompetitive or discriminatory pricing schemes so that offenders can be prosecuted. These hearings will be held throughout the length and breadth of Australia and I understand that that process has already commenced. The minister has obviously been very active. He has implemented this policy and is going to make every possible endeavour to ensure that country people have access to fuel at a reasonable price. I think that people can understand that there would be one or two cents difference in the price per litre resulting from fuel being transported from the refinery gate to country areas. They can accept that, but they certainly cannot accept the wide variation in prices that has occurred over many years. The Keating government failed miserably in its attempts to implement any mechanism whatsoever to address this problem. It preferred to ignore the problem. It just looked at it over 13 years. In an effort to try and get a petrol pricing policy that would achieve some form of equity and balance throughout Australia, it never came up with anything that was satisfactory to country motorists. I can recall that when the Hon. George Gear-I think he was the Assistant Treasurer at the time and is a former member now-was asked about the difference betweeen country fuel prices and their metropolitan counterparts, he said that he dismissed completely the concerns of country people and business people in country areas. He claimed, 'The issue is one that just needs to die down.' It will not die. When you are paying up to 20c a litre more for fuel than someone 150 kilometres away in Melbourne, I can assure you that the issue does not die down in an area like Bendigo. Nor would it die down as an issue in an area like Ballarat. It is on everyone's mind; it is a major factor in everyone's budget, and car expenses are a very significant factor in the cost of living in a country area. For many people in country areas, and certainly in my area, petrol and diesel are not only essential commodities for the rural and farming community but are also very important parts of the costing of any industry or business which operates outside the metropolitan area. The additional costs which are incurred by those businesses in rural and regional areas have to be passed on to the consumer as part of their business activities. That makes other services and other commodities in regional areas more expensive than they are in metropolitan areas. It is a very important issue. It is one which I am delighted to see the minister has tackled early in the parliamentary year at the start of the new government, after 13 years of neglect by the former government, which was not prepared to address this question. The minister has set out to try and get some transparency and some fairness into the country pricing structure. Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC669 I look forward to seeing the activities of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as it carries out its duties throughout country Australia, having hearings and inquiring into the petroleum industry to make sure that everyone is treated fairly throughout the length and breadth of Australia. This issue will not die down as the former Assistant Treasurer, Mr George Gear, claimed it would. It will not die down. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) come into these proceedings, because he would be aware of the huge cost of petrol in his electorate and the difference that it would make to him if there were some equity and fairness in the pricing of petrol throughout rural areas of Australia. With those few remarks, I support the progress of this bill, which is non-controversial. I make the point that we will be watching the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission work and report back to the government. It will ensure that prices are monitored and costs and profits in the petroleum industry-including oil company distributors and service station operators-are looked at to ensure compliance with the consumer protection and competitive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Where the ACCC identifies price discrimination or unfair prices, the government will act to maintain fair business practice within the industry. 1996 might have been of some consequence but it quite clearly is merely a housekeeping bill. All it really does is take the legislation out of the by-laws and put it into the act on advice from the Attorney-General, which probably means it was not necessary anyway. But, having listened to the previous speaker, I thought I must have been here to discuss the wrong bill. I am glad that he ranged so widely, because I am going to too. In respect of country fuel prices. if he is paying 20c a litre more for fuel-living in the outer suburbs of Melbourne as he does-there is something wrong. I would say that that 'something' must clearly rest with the federal member, because if I lived that close to Perth and my fuel was 20c dearer than it was in PerthI would be screaming blue murder. It is simply not right; transport costs do not come anywhere near that. WhatI want to talk about is deeper. As it says in Isaiah, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' I think we have a situation in Australia wherein we have a lack of vision. I want to put a scenario to you; it relates very vaguely to fuel. Around Rundle in Queensland, there is a vast resource of fuel oil available in the rock. With the advent of a technological advance pioneered in Canada by Australians with Australian money, we have worked out a much more effective way of getting fuel out of these rocks. If the government were to forgo excise on this altogether, this would be highly viable. It would free up our existing supply of oil and it could be exported overseas. While we cannot set the oil price, because of the quality of our oil, we will always sell it. This could really do something to address our balance of trade, which seriously needs to be addressed. It is no good just doing this in isolation. If we were to redress the balance of trade and reduce our debt, the immediate consequence-with other things being put in place-would be to raise the value of the Australian dollar. As every member of the National Party should . know, that would be disastrous for most farm exports. If we converted our fuel source to shale oils, we would convert enormous capital cost into labour cost. We would have a very large increase in job availability. I have not done the figures: when I have, you will hear all about",149,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (10.29 A.m.),"I thought the Excise Tariff Amendment BillMC670 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 it. I strongly suspect that pay-as-you-earn taxation would more than offset the revenue that government would lose through such a process. In my calculations, this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill will give us somewhere under $200 million a year on oil. There is a chance that we could have an increase in government revenue, an enormous increase in employment and a substantial increase in export earnings. It will require vision and this government does not seem to have this vision and neither did the previous government. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have ranged widely; I thank you for your tolerance. I urge the previous member to look into the freight component of oil in his electorate and, if necessary, to leave parliament and to get into fuel transport. they really have made a silk purse out of a sow's ear with this particular piece of legislation. I am happy to do that, because I could put in some things that you did not read, but that would waste the chamber's time. I looked at item 1 subsection 6A(2) of the schedule to the bill and saw that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel used the break after the parliament was prorogued to identify remaining acts and draft appropriate amendments to achieve a gender neutral result. This involved a lot of Commonwealth drafting. I thought I had a pretty miserable time over the election campaign, but I suspect I got off fairly lightly compared to the onerous task that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel had in going through the remaining Commonwealth acts that needed to have gender neutral language included. I want to speak this morning about this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and ensure that we, as a nation, maintain $1.9 billion worth of revenue received since 1984-85 from new crude oil. Heaven knows this country can ill afford a $1.9 billion loss after the endeavours of my colleagues opposite. The member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) can wave his independent flag and absolve himself of all sins, but a lot of us on this side of the House know very well that he was directly involved in the decisions of the former government which impacted dramatically upon rural and country people. The honourable member sat on his seat for six years. There is no point in attacking this government. Not once in his time under that former government did he have the intestinal fortitude to take them on. He should not come in here waving his independent flag and telling the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid) about petrol prices, because for six years he did nothing at all to address the problems facing rural and regional people. As far as crude oil is concerned and the price of petrol, not once did I hear him talking about it. Not once did he raise it, but there he was, perched on the edge of his chair, attacking his government, until push came to shove, and then he went missing every single time. I am pleased to see that the member for Hotham( Mr Crean) is here too, because he had a time as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, as some of you may well remember. They bought him a pair of moleskins and some elastic sided boots, and got him a Driza-Bone, with the tag still hanging off the back of it after six months, and not once did he talk about petrol prices. Not one single thing did he do to stop the inequity between petrol pricing in metropolitan Australia and non-metropolitan Australia.

I have certainly no intention of speaking for any less time than the honourable member for Bendigo. While we are talking about it, I will give you a scenario about what it is like living outside metropolitan Australia. This was the biggest problem with the former government, and that is why they were absolutely decimated in non-metropolitan Australia, and some of my colleagues are here today as a result of that. Not once was the former government ever prepared to concede that life outside metropolitan Australia was totally different from that in the city. What they failed to realise was that public transport is not available. The members from the country here today know-the member for Burke knows-that country people do not do anything without using their cars. I am talking about families that are driving 30, 50, or 100 kilometres purely to do the shopping and they are driving their kids to sporting venues. Their lives revolve around the motor vehicle, not through any great desire to jump in a car and drive it, but through absolute necessity. Every time they jump in their car, their expenditure· goes through the roof. But not once did the former government do anything about that petrol price inequity. Not once! The platitudes before the election from you people sickened me. At the public meetings around Australia the candidates got up and they had no idea what they were talking about. They had no intention, when push came to shove, of doing anything about it. We are going to do something about it and we will make up for the 13 years lost time that you gave us. morning, you idiot.

We do not have any problems with that. As I said, it was previously presented by the former government. It is a piece of legislation which is being continued by the new government. As I understand it, it has the support of all the parties, so I am happy to support the passage of this legislation through the chamber. 1) Amendment Bill and the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill. The contribution made by the Australian dairy industry to the real wealth of Australia is, without question, substantial. In 1994-95 the export value of Australian major dairy products was $1,351 million-that is, nearly $IY2 billion-and we expect that value to rise by 15 per cent in the 1995-96 season. Despite some of the great. difficulties placed upon agriculture and agribusiness in Australia under the previous government, the dairy industry is an example of where we have moved beyond a dependence on commodity sales and now have a growing percentage of the share of the added value market. I have spent the last four years as a doctoral fellow analysing the export performance of the dairy industry, as well as of other food export industries in Australia. In particular, I have been assessing the impact of the industry'S organisation, regulatory environment and marketing strategies and have compared Australia's industry development with that of its competitors. I can speak with some degree of confidence when I say that the dairy produce levy schemesthe market support levies-as well as the corporation, promotion and research levies, have been instrumental in assisting the dairy industry to enter and grow in the deregulated international markets, particularly those of Asia and now Europe. In line with our commitments under the Uruguay Round of GAIT it is now necessary that we rejig the industry marketing schemes to remove any direct nexus between exporting and domestic market support. We have before us an amendment which really, in terms of its practice, came into effect in the industry in July 1995. The amendments are now in line with GAIT; however, the revenue generated by the scheme, and so the benefits to producers under the industry, are intact. It is these new arrangements which are now being ratified and formalised in the amendment today, and that is why you will see that the opposition is as concerned as we are that this amendment flows through without difficulty. In July 1995 the domestic market support scheme replaced the 1986 arrangements that had been in effect for raising the domestic farm gate prices for manufacturing milk by approximately 2c per litre above international market returns. All Australian milk producers are levied to produce these enhancements, and this is known as the market support program. The scheme has had the effect of reducing the difference between farm gate prices paid for market or drinking milk and for manufactured milk. We all know that in Australia farm gate prices are generally so low that many of our best producers across the agribusiness field barely survive from one season to the next. Thus, given this little assistance, dairy farmers supplying milk destined for processing and export were able to make the investments necessary to increase production to meet growing export markets. As well, by paying producers according to their milk's fat and protein content, a quality-consciousness was brought to bear on the industry-which had, as had so many other",155,Representatives Main Commitree
342,Mrs Stone (Murray) (10.51 A.m.),"I speak in support of the Dairy Produce Levy (No.Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 675 agriproduct areas, been more focused on quantity of output rather than quality-over the decades in which it has survived. The market signals through this levying process have been transmitted to the dairy producer quickly and often, and so today we have a very sophisticated, innovative and business like dairy producing sector in Australia. The market support schemes have been particularly important for Victoria and for my area, the Murray electorate, because we are the home of the dairy export industry, where only some nine per cent of milk is destined for the higher value, fresh drinking market, compared with New South Wales, where 60 per cent of dairy production goes to the fresh drinking milk market in Australia. It should be noted that, although we have had this levy and this support, we are not talking about ongoing support forever. The amendment shows it will be phased out by the year 2000. But we need those last few years of support because of the rapidly changing regulatory environment in the international dairy trade and also the substantially changing and evolving markets for dairy produce that are particular to the north of us in Asia. Let me talk a little about those changes and how well geared up we are to capture the opportunities that are being presented to us. Given that we, in terms of international production, are fairly small-scale dairy producers, it has been the European subsidised EC producers who have been the price setters. The prices that they have created have been artificially low. Australia, as a small producer, has been a price taker. To compete in the commodity markets, in particular with these artificially low prices, Australia and New Zealand have had to become the world's lowest cost dairy producers. In Australia, however, we have also become the lowest cost administrator of our dairy industry in the sense that the ADC operates with only two per cent overheads compared with seven per cent for the New. Zealand Dairy Board. As the GATT takes affect internationally, we can expect dairy production in Europe to fall and prices to adjust to reflect real demand and real growth in the markets of the world. We also expect the USA industry to come on line with reference to their GATT commitments. At the moment they continue to subsidise and their production is continuing to expand. We look forward to the time when the USA also takes GATT seriously. The Australian dairy industry is not protected on international or domestic markets. The market for domestic dairy produce in Australia is mature-it is not expanding. Manufacturers in Australia have long had to compete with produce from New Zealand that is freely imported into our supermarkets. Given New Zealand has a very small domestic market-it has to export over 90 per cent of its total annual milk production-we in Australia have to be not only very good, but also world best to survive in our domestic markets as well as internationally. Despite all the constraints and artificially low prices I have talked about, quality and price conscious markets like Japan werdn fact captured by us. We have the leading market share for cheese in Japan. In 1995, our share was 32.5 per cent compared to New Zealand's 28.7 per cent and Europe's 30.3 per cent. In 1996, we expect to draw even further ahead of the low cost New Zealand producers. We are doing extraordinarily well in an extraordinarily difficult international environment and in a nation which, until March 2, gave no particular help to agriproduct in Australia. We are expecting to see our dairy produce increase in availability in Australia-from about 8.6 billion litres now to some 10 billion litres by the year 2000. We are gearing up. MC 676 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 How is the market evolving? I have talked about the regulatory environment changing. In fact, the market demand in our near neighbours is evolving. We have to gear up to meet that demand if we are to compete and succeed. Dairy produce is not a traditional food in Japan-the most valuable market to us-r in other Asian markets. There is lactose intolerance in a lot of those countries. During the 1950s, because of the Second World War and the destruction of most of the local food supplies in places like Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and so on, food aid in the form of milk powder was one of the life saving foods introduced to those countries. Despite their lactose intolerance, those countries became accustomed to drinking milk-reconstituted milk powder. Much of it came from the USA; some came from Australia. Those countries began to understand the value of milk for the long-term nutritional benefit of their population, which had been protein limited in their traditional diets. In each of these countries-and, indeed, throughout all of Asia-as per capita income is rising, the family structure is changing, from an extended family with a mother at home cooking for the whole family to a nuclear and even a single parent situation. The food consumption patterns are the quick-fix, single-portion meal, microwaved rather than stir-fried. Children come in from school, eat a light meal alone and rush out to tutoring. In Japan, at any one time, one in four of the male household heads are away from the home base, living alone in regional centres and looking for easy, quick-to-prepare, high energy foods. So the slice of pizza or bread and melted cheese is perfect for them, and so our shredded, stretched cheese exports have risen from 3,000 tonnes in 1990 to over 16,000 tonnes in 1995. There is an escalation of the westernisation of traditional Asian diets and food consumption patterns based on cows' milk. Now they are using dairy products for children, as confectionery, medicinals-as in Yakult-as fast food and quick-fix snack foods at home. The addition of a slice of cheese to the McDonald's hamburger has been underwriting much of the new dairy production and consumption in all of these countries. As per capita income rises, food tastes evolve, refrigeration becomes more common, food technology becomes more sophisticated, mom and pop stores and the wet markets are replaced by supermarkets, and the demand is for a more processed retail ready product. The domestic dairy manufacturing industry, challenged by rising wages, starts to import more of its ingredients and then looks to go offshore to places like Australia for joint ventures where the product will be re-exported to the home country base. That is occurring in China, India, Japan, Korea and, in particular, in countries such as Indonesia where we are entering into joint ventures. We know that in time such ventures may come back onshore to us. The revolution in market demand for dairy products is matched by the evolving market structure. We have to look at more of the retailers as buyers. In Japan, for example, the supermarkets are wanting to bypass the big trading houses or Sogo Shosha, such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui, to deal direct with our own manufacturers-Bonlac and Murray-Goulburn, for example. In dealing direct, those retailers demand that our manufacturers provide different packs and packaging, a faster response to food fads and a quick response to their 'just new' products as a buying incentive in their home marKets. Our dairying manufacturers have to become world best and highly sophisticated, with technology that is able to deliver the clean, green, no chemical additive type of product demanded in these sophisticated markets. So how are we positioned to maximise these new opportunities and the different demands that are now upon us? We have come a very long way. I have described our increases in value Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 677 and volume-the fact that we have gone from commodity style to more value added product. However, the dairy industry still has a long way to go. That is why these amendments are important and the period to the year 2000 before the levies are gone is significant. Our dairy industry is still affected by seasonality. We still cannot produce year-round highquality dairy product. Yet markets such as Japan demand fresh cheese; they do not like a product which has been produced three or four months before. So we are going to have to move more to grain and other supplementation for our dairy herds, which is going to add costs to our dairy industry. Right now, the grains are extraordinarily expensive but, without this year-round production of dairy product, our seasonality will continue to drag us down. Our manufacturing is still not world best practice in all instances although Peters Western Australia is regarded as world best in its total cleanliness, in terms of its E.coli measures and so on. But, as a legacy of years of neglect by the previous government, the infrastructure supporting our dairy industry is inadequate. Too often, the milk tankers which have to ply the roads twice a day are on main roads which are crumbling, and are not substantially or sufficiently maintained so that those tankers can get through when they should. We have power surges in our power systems in my Murray electorate. This can mean that the highly sophisticated computerised evaporative systems that the dried milk powder producers use are shocked perhaps two or three times a day with power surges. We do not have natural gas in some of the areas where our big dairy manufacturers wish to expand with cheap power alternatives. Our telecommunications systems are not sufficient in areas in my electorate in particular, where mobile phones are essential-not a luxury-for primary producers a long time away from their home base, for milk tanker drivers, and so on. We also have a crisis in Australia in terms of education and training for food technologists, for those who should be carrying our industry into the future. Until we address our shortage of food technologists and those who will support world best dairy manufacturing we will be dependent on people imported from Europe telling us how to do things right and that will always leave us behind the eight ball. We have come a long way. We have examples where some of the biggest dairy manufacturers like Snow Brand, which are nearly 10 times the size of our own Bonlac Foods and the Murray-Goulburn cooperatives, are in joint venture arrangements with a little dairy company like Tatura Milk Products in my electorate. They now produce infant formula for re-export. As we speak, another greenfields joint venture arrangement is going ahead between Meiji, Mitsubishi and Murray-Goulbum. Again, we are talking about some of the world's largest and most sophisticated dairy manufacturers joint venturing with us in Australia. This is the way that things are going in the future. But there are constraints, as I have described, in the infrastructure. Already the Murray-Goulbum region is running short of fresh water and waste water disposal systems are inadequate. As I said, the industry's labour needs are not being met under current training and education arrangements in Australia, and we have infrastructure problems. Our primary producers have to come up to worldwide best practice in terms of production. The amendments proposed preserve the benefit of a scheme that is essential as the international environment deregulates and the market conditions change. And so I have a strong sense of urgency in supporting the amendments to this bill. MC 678 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 on your elevation to that role. I know that all members of the parliament appreciate your skills as a deputy speaker. I am to follow the member for Murray( Mrs Stone). She will make a great contribution to the parliament and she does represent a premier dairying area of Australia-second only, of course, to western Victoria. We should get that clearly on the record. In her electorate, she has got some problems of salting of which she has a very great understanding. I was pleased with her contribution to this debate. I wish to acknowledge also the member for Braddon( Mr Miles) who has a number of dairy farmers in his area. There are a couple of very big herds of 1,700 cows on King Island. So the member for Braddon has a good understanding of the dairy industry, and northern Tasmania makes a good contribution to the export of dairy products. Whilst the amendments to the dairy produce bills seem fairly insignificant, they are significant bills in the philosophic context. To get the right framework, let me read from the explanatory memorandum in relation to the changes. The memorandum says: The changes to the market support arrangements constitute a minor legal correction and do not affect the administration of the scheme. Importantly, the market support arrangements remain consistent with Australia's commitments to the World Trade Organization Agreement. I think that sets out that we are moving towards a more export orientated industry. In the debate on the previous bilI, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, there was a lot of emotion in this chamber in relation to petrol pricing and other matters. I do not think there will be the same degree of argument about the dairy industry. But some 10 years ago emotions ran high in the dairy industry over the Kerin plan, and people were very concerned about how their industry was being affected. But I just say that with the Kerin plan and the adjustments of the Crean plan, and with the activities of dairy industry leaders who I think have shown a change in attitude over the last 10 years, we now have a position where the dairy industry is profitable, especially in Victoria. The dairy industries in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia have contracted somewhat to the fresh milk market. In Tasmania they do retain an export orientation because of the high rainfall. With all the very vigorous debates and the number of deputations that we had back in 198586-87, we now see an industry that is allowing market forces and the export focus to lead to the creation of real wealth in the dairy industry. We see that in western Victoria and in the seat of Murray the dairy farmers are now, along with the wheat farmers, the affluent people in agricultural industries in Australia. It is interesting that these market forces have been oriented towards exports. They have been organised by private companies and cooperatives and not by statutory marketing arrangements, which used to be the order of the day in the dairy industry. Some of us have argued fairly vigorously about that. Again, there has been a tremendous amount of emotional energy directed towards marketing arrangements in the dairy industry and government subsidies over the last 40 or 50 years. The removal of regulation has also been a key feature of the changes in the dairy industry so that the export markets in a true market sense can create opportunities without the regulation of the domestic market in the hope that the export market would follow.",156,Representatives Main Committee

345,Mr Mcarthur,"We look forward to your role in the chair. Let me also say how pleasedWednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC679 In all agricultural commodities Australia stands to gain from a freer and more open world market and the GATT arrangements will assist Australia, both in the dairy industry and in the other agricultural products. Rather than the protectionism and higher tariff levels that were advocated in some quarters, the whole dairy industry now has moved towards this export culture, and that has ensured that in the current pricing arrangements the industry is profitable and has improved its productivity. I draw the attention of the chamber to some of the interesting figures on these dramatic changes that have taken place over the last 20 years. The number of farms has nearly halved. In 1971 we had 48,000 farmers approximately and in 1990, the last set of figures I have got, we have 14,000 farmers. That shows a dramatic reduction in the number of farmers actually involved in the dairy industry. The figures suggest that there are about 8,000 dairy farmers in Victoria, so it is the predominant state for dairying, with the seats of Murray, Corangamite and Wannon in Gippsland being the most productive areas. If you look at the actual size of the herd, in 1970 there were about 2.8 million cows. The herd is now down to 1.6 million cows. It is a dramatic reduction in the number of cows and yet production has increased. If you look at the amount of milk produced per cow, in 1979 it was 2,600 litres per cow and in 1990 3,800 litres per cow. It shows the tremendous improvements in productivity and genetics, and the increase in the productive capacity of dairy farms generally. New Zealand and Australia are probably the low cost producers in the world and New Zealand remains one of our strongest competitors on world markets. As I say, more and more emphasis has been directed towards the export market. We have been moving away from the fresh milk market sector so that we can export to the South-East Asian market, which is becoming more lucrative, and not wony too much about the domestic milk market, which so much of this political debate in other times has revolved around for state governments and, to a lesser degree, for federal governments. The dairy industry really is a great example of value adding at the factory level and as we sell the products overseas. As an agricultural producer, the industry value adds in the processing area and then is able to sell its product. The value of our dairy exports in 1995-96 is nearly $2 billion and it is predicted that by the year 2001, which is not far away, the value of those exports will be $2.5 billion. In 1980, 21 per cent of Australia's dairy production was exported and by 1985 the figure had risen to 32 per cent. Today, 45 per cent of our production is exported and it is expected to be 55 per cent by the year 2000. In very simple terms, half the production of the Australian dairy industry will be in the export markets. This represents a tremendous difference, in philosophic terms, from what was historically the case when most of the emphasis was on the domestic, more profitable, fresh milk market. As I have mentioned, this transition took place as a result of the Kerin plan in 1986. Those of us who come from electorates that have an association with the dairy industry remember the very vigorous arguments that took place with the then minister who, in my view, put up a very forward-thinking plan. A number of the dairy industry representatives at that time were still looking at holding the line at the state level-having constrained interstate trade. I think the minister managed to break that mould and did a very good job . . That plan imposed a levy on all milk produced and then distributed the proceeds to the exporters so as to assist them in the competitive world environment by transferring to them MC680 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 some of the better domestic consumer price at that time. That was at a time when the world market was being upset by subsidies by the European market and by the Americans and others. The Crean plan in 1992 was a plan to phase down the level of support given to the dairy industry by the year 2000-and the bill before the chamber is compatible with that-so that the industry will be internationally competitive by that time and will not be dependent upon the relationship between fresh milk and the export price. Last year the market support system was further amended to conform with Australia's obligations under the Uruguay Round of the GAIT. The previous scheme was seen to amount to an export subsidy but the system that was introduced by the parliament last year was GAITlegal. There was a fair bit of debate about the definition of illegality and the terms that the GAIT operated on. The present system imposes a levy on market milk and manufactured milk which is consumed in Australia. The only milk that does not attract a levy is the manufactured produce which is exported. The present system effectively operates like a consumption tax-domestic consumption is taxed while exports are tax free. The effect is the same: domestic consumers subsidise the export sector when prices in Australia are higher than world prices. That has always been the fundamental argument: that as prices come closer together the domestic fresh milk price will not be so significant. As I said at the beginning of my speech, this legislation is just to get some minor amendments to conform with the GAIT arrangement. The bill helps to define clearly the distinction between market milk, serving the domestic fresh milk sector, and manufacturing milk. The present rate of market support is 33.271c per kilogram of milk fat and 79.8c per kilogram of protein. The levies on market milk and domestically consumed manufacturing milk raised about $160 million, collected and distributed by the Australian Dairy Corporation. As was the intention of the Crean plan, the rate of support given to the export industry is being wound back towards the year 2000. That is the thrust of this bill. Thus the dairy industry has become an industry dominated by international forces of supply and demand with a strong export focus. In Victoria, 91 per cent of the milk goes into manufacturing, much of which is exported. ABARE expects the value of the Australian dairy industry to rise by 31 per cent between now and the year 2000. So, again, we see this quite big increase in the value of the exports. That has been reflected on the farms in the electorate of Murray, down in Gippsland, and in western Victoria as these export prices are holding and actually increasing. Interestingly enough, Australia's market share is expected to rise from its present level of 14 per cent of world exports to 17 per cent over the next five years. More importantly, in east Asia, Australia's market share has climbed to 34 per cent, ahead of New Zealand-which is our key competitor-Norway, the United States of America and Denmark. The strong export performance has given rise to greater profitability amongst Australian dairy farmers, which members who represent these electorates can see from the construction of new rotary dairies worth up to half a million dollars, improved pastures and improved productivity by cow herds. It is suggested that the cash incomes in 1995-96 are expected, from the ABARE figures, to rise from $52,000 to $66,000. We know from personal observation that a number of the dairy farmers are extremely profitable at the moment and there is a lot of investment moving into the dairy industry. The success of the dairy industry has been fuelled by this export price and we have seen huge investments in the processing by the cooperatives. The $30 million invested in a drying Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 681 plant in part of my former electorate at Cobden in western Victoria is a very good example of this. The companies of Bonlac, Kraft, the Bega Cooperative, United Milk in Tasmania, Murray-Goulburn, Queensco Unity Dairy Foods and Malanda Dairy Foods have all put new capital investments into the processing operations utilising new technology. The Japanese Snow Brand Company has entered into a joint venture with Tatura Milk Industries, which again is an innovation from the former position where only dairy farmers were involved in processing. Nestles expressed an interest in using Australia as a base for its dairy operations in Asia. Japanese companies such as Meija Milk Products and Itochu Corporation have both flagged a desire to operate in Australia, exporting to South-East Asia. Again that is a dramatic difference in terms of philosophic approach and the attitude of the dairy industry. The Uruguay Round of GATT has brought about a number of trade liberalisation requirements in world agriculture. The main elements of the package require a clarification of non-tariff barriers, 36 per cent reduction in tariff barriers, 36 per cent reduction in outlays on export subsidies and a 21 per cent reduction in volumes of subsidies for export. Those of us who have been in the argument about tariffs understand the non-tariff barriers that have been used by some countries to maintain the high tariffs towards imports. To date the worse offenders in terms of trade barriers in the dairy industry have been Europe, Japan and the USA. In America, the dairy export incentive program has been specifically targeting Australia's traditional export markets in South-East Asia. On February 2, the USA Department of Agriculture announced a three-month allocation of this scheme for 10,000 tonnes of subsidised skim milk powder, 100 tonnes of cheese and 1,800 tonnes of butterfat into South-East Asia, so the Americans are using some of these backdoor methods to upset some of our traditional markets and increase their market share whilst the changes to GATT are going on. I According to ABARE, the impact of these policies and prices on the Asian markets have been insignificant so far because of the general shortages of supply which have kept prices high. Nevertheless, the American government continues to make a concerted push into the Asian market before its GATT obligations become fully binding, in an attempt, as I say, to gain an additional market share. Graham Tonkin, the Managing Director of the Australian Dairy Corporation, recently told the 1996 Outlook Conference: At the end of the first year of the implementation of the Uruguay Round we find that world prices and local prices can be quickly eroded by subsidised product from the USA and the European Union. The three largest and potentially most lucrative dairy markets, the European Union, the USA and Japan, are tightly controlled by quotas and government regulations. The main developing markets in South-East Asia can be severely restricted by increasing tariffs. Efficient agricultural producers can be threatened in their home market by subsidised products without recourse to countervailing action. Domestic prices in the European Union, USA and Canada and elsewhere continue to support production of uneconomic surpluses. I think that summarises our fears over the last 10 years about the remarkable amount of money that the European Common Market can devote to agriculture. Approximately $US60 billion of subsidy has been put towards keeping the eight million farmers on the land in Europe. That in tum has reflected on our own dairy farmers here in Australia. The European herd has fallen by about 320,000 in the past year and, in eastern Europe, deregulation has seen the dismantling of producer and consumer subsidies. Herd size and production have begun to fall as the subsidies have been gradually removed. The US Congress has moved towards winding back farm programs and the 1995 Farm Bill has helped to bring about some of those changes. MC 682 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 8 May 1996 The developing Asian economies, on which we are very dependent for our markets, are moving from the peasant based rural economies towards manufacturing based on imported raw materials such as Australian skim milk power. In Bangladesh, Red Cow milk powder is being imported and is a valuable additive to the national diet of that country. By the year 2000, there will still be some production controls and price supports in the USA and Europe. However, the ability of uneconomic production to continue with the help of limitless subsidy will be severely lessened with the implementation of GATT reforms. All dairy farmers are worried about this key argument-that the USA might introduce some form of subsidy to look after a small section of its political support base and upset the very profitable industry. The central lesson from the experience of the dairy industry is that market forces and an export focus are the key to real wealth creation in the dairy areas of Victoria. The industry has moved from the regulated fresh milk market sector towards the competitive world market of export. World liberalisation stands to benefit the Australian dairy industry rather than a restricted market. I recall that, in the earlier debates with Minister Kerin, the dairy industry suggested a restriction of about 5.5 million litres. By the year 2000, we will have about 11 million litres. So we doubled the production and we are able to sell it because we have that export focus. We must make sure that we have that focus and that we continue to export. If we move away from protection and regulation, the future of the dairy industry will be assured. We must continue to maintain the quality of the product and the process and ensure that all investments are of world quality standards. We must continue to maintain this focus and supply these lucrative markets in Asia. We must fight off the subsidisation that is always around the comer in America and Europe. your high appointment. I hope that you will give me some indulgence today. As the previous speakers, the member for Murray( Mrs Stone) and the member for Corangamite ( Mr McArthur), have covered the basic purpose of these bills, I do not intend to repeat those remarks in the Hansard. They were made very clearly. However, I am concerned that the member for Murray claimed that her area was the home of dairying in Victoria. I am further concerned that the member for Corangamite said that his electorate in Victoria is the only area in Victoria to outstrip the member for Murray's electorate. I have to disappoint them both and tell them that the home of dairying has been, and forever will be, the beautiful lands of Gippsland. The rich grass grows there-but neither of these members would understand this. In this public place, I invite both honourable members to come to Gippsland to see those rolling hills and to smell that grass. We can stop at a place in Drouin where they will be able to watch the grass grow unaided by fertiliser or irrigation. is important that members of this House understand that this area is the premier area for dairying in the state of Victoria, and probably in most of Australia. Bonlac, for instance, is putting its major new high-tech factory there. Bonlac had the choice to build its factory anywhere in Australia. Where is it putting it? It is putting it at Damum, near Warragul and Drouin in the seat of McMillan in Gippsland. It was not a choice easily taken.",160,Representatives Main Committee

Mr Cunningham paid great attention to what happened to the dairy fanners in McMillan over the to-year period that he was a member. I think it makes a difference to have that type of representation. The member for Corangamite has spoken today on this bill and said, 'Look, we have a direction to go. There's a place where Australia has to head.' The member for Murray has a clear understanding of what the dairy industry is all about and where the export industry is headed. She understands that fanners have taken the decision to grab hold of the nettle, and to head in the djrection of exports-Australia's future-and to make the harsh decisions. I have lived in the seat of McMillan all my life and all my life I have been dealing with refonn of the dairy industry. I was born in a small town called Koo Wee Rup, which is in west Gippsland. was a bad year, but we have drained the swamps since then. that it is appropriate to direct his remarks through the chair and not directly to the member for Corangamite, though I recognise that he has been provoked. that the member for Corangamite has a clear grasp of the issues. I come from the township of Koo Wee Rup and I grew up on a dairy fann of 40 acres. The Bayles butter factory, the Drouin butter factory, and the Cora Lynn butter factory-in fact, four or five small milk factories, as we call them-were all there. On a Sunday evening we could smell the whey five miles away at the butter factory at Bayles. I grew up with that stench in my nose. My parents earned enough money from those 40 acres to raise a family, buy a Holden every couple of years, and live a pretty good life. That was back in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1996 it is impossible to run a farm of that size, of course. In fact, a fann 10 times that size is now about the nonn in that area for dairying. And very few of those fanns are now held over to dairying. As it is only 70 miles from Melbourne, some of the land is now actually used for grazing horses and all sorts of other activities. Some of the best quality land on the swamp has been soaked up for residential purposes. That has been a great disappointment to many of us living around that area. The member for Corangamite said that in the end our dairy industry is still vulnerable on the world market. We must be vigilant as to how we approach it. Improving best practice and quality control and modernising the industry have to be continual processes. We have to get better and better at what we do. Part of that, of course, has been the Bonlac process. In the past there have been opportunities for the people in dairying in my area to grow potatoes on the side and run a few beef cattle. They have been a mixed group. We have had a bit of horticulture down the road. Now we have moved on. So it is with potatoes. We have become more specialised in what we do.

That is how McMillan has moved, anyway. I want to talk about not only the world's best practice area but also the downside of our industry. The costs are going through the roof not only for the dairy industry but for everybody. It seems to me, living on the boundary of my electorate at Pakenham, that the world changes when you get to that boundary at Pakenham and start heading into the regional area of McMillan. When you get to Nar Nar Goon your petrol price goes up 20 per cent. Unless all farmers go to Dandenong every week-which they do not because they have a life to lead in their own community-they do not get the opportunity for those cheaper city petrol prices. They have to suffer the indignity of paying more than their city cousins for petrol. The price of fertiliser has increased. The price of equipment is increasing and the equipment is becoming more high tech and larger. The price of feed is also increasing, as is the price of fuel. In other words, all the costs-whether they are for education for your children or for food...: are increasing. Where did the former government really let down the industry and the families that work in it? It said in the 1993 campaign that it was not going to put on the imposts that the then opposition was proposing. What did it do? It increased the wholesale sales tax on nearly everything that goes into the domestic situation on a farm. It increased taxes right across the board. The prices of groceries were increased to those people. There was a de facto increase of tax up to 20 and 30 per cent at that time. That was pretty upsetting for most of the community who had trusted the government's word that there would not be increases. But the great indignity was the cost of fuel, whether it was unleaded or leaded. The former member for this seat actually said at one stage, 'All my farmers are having such a good time they are driving four-wheel drives.' I met them in McMillan over the last 18 months while I was campaigning and they do not all drive four-wheel drives. If they do, they do not drive new four-wheel drives and, if they drive four-wheel drives, they are probably on a farm where they need one in order to get access. That is what I found. It was not because of wealth. The great sadness is that to actually use a statement like 'all my farmers are doing well' is unfair because we know we have an evolving community. I mentioned the reform that my own small community of Koo Wee Rup had gone through. I talked about the reform that the potato industry is now going through. At Thorpdale, Koo Wee Rup and Cora Lynn we were growing 60, 70, 80 or 300 acres of potatoes. They are now growing thousands of acres of potatoes in the northern part of Victoria, as many of you would know, and they are growing clean, very easily washed potatoes. Every time Thorpdale potatoes come onto the market, the price goes down because there is a flood of them and those potatoes have got that rich soil around them. There is going to be reform in that area. The dairy industry is reforming, trying to push an export market, and so is the potato industry. All these industries are moving. Everybody in a country area has had to deal with reform-and the pain of reform. The small businesses that were down the road trading off those small farms-the potato farmers and the smaller family farms in the dairy industry-are no longer there. They have just gone. I do not think anybody in this room can name a Youngs any more. It was the family store. Is there a drapery store left in country Victoria? If there are one or two, they are not selling the range of goods they once sold. People have to travel. But that comes back to the costs of fuel again. I was going to say that those families do not have four-wheel drives. They might have had Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMIITEE MC685 a car but they needed two cars if they had children because they were moving children to sporting activities or to school or to do the shopping through the day. They are not travelling 10 kilometres or a kilometre down the road to the Forest Hill shopping centre or whatever the shopping centre happens to be; they are travelling 50, 60 or 70 kilometres. 1 visited parts of Victoria continually for 18 months after I left this House-I did not leave voluntarily. 1 travelled the whole of Victoria and 1 met people out in rural Victoria who actually travelled 60 kilometres to town, sometimes three times a day, to participate in normal family activities. So that fuel impost became a huge impost on families. Since1 became the member for McMillan, it has seemed to me that when you cross the Toomuc Creek at Pakenham you are completely forgotten by politicians, who are mostly city based or suburb based. They are not out there enough to understand what it is like to actually live in a community in Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Yinnar or any of those dairying or producing areas. They have no idea. up there. in. The people out there recently said something to the Australian government. We must take those people seriously and never take them for granted, because what they actually said to us was, 'Look, you people do not understand us. You have forgotten us. You have imposed the taxes. You do not care about us. You do not even put your hand up and say, ""We are trying to do something about what is happening in regional Victoria.'"" Not once did 1 hear the former government say, 'We feel the pain that is going on in the regions and we are prepared to address it in this way.' 1 hope that, given the inspiration of this new government, we will have an opportunity to express ourselves as members who come from country Victoria or country New South Wales, Queensland or Western Australia, and say that those people out there are very important to what happens in Australia. People talk about 'grassroots': 'grassroots' is out in the country. That is where people actually see and feel what 'grassroots' is all about. They talk about battlers in the city; let us remember we have got a few battlers in the country areas, too, especially in some of the regional seats. The seat of McMillan suffered, a long way back, not only with regard to the reform of the dairy industry and the way that process went through, but also in relation to the power generation industry. We had some 23,000 people working in the power generation and energy industry; we now have 3,000 to 4,QOO. This is massive change. All that has collapsed upon this regional community. The only people who have been prepared to apply themselves to what has happened outside the urban areas of the state-and, 1 dare say, other states-have been those in the state government. Hopefully, this government will in the future. I had forgotten what a short time it seems when you have got much to say on issues, such as the dairy industry, about your own electorate. 1 had forgotten the passion with which members remind people of the issues in their own electorates.

I am humbled to be able to represent the seat I have lived in for the whole of my life and to begin to address issues such as dairy industry issues in regard to the bill that we are discussing today. There are some things that I want to mention about the dairy industry. One is that it has never stopped training young people. At the McMillan VCAH Campus outside Warragul there is a very special program, at the moment, which takes on people as apprentices in the dairy industry. I do not think we have done enough training; I do not think you can ever do enough training in any industry that you are in. In our area, the dairy industry is taking an active part and actually plays a role in what is happening with these young people, who are going onto dairy farms and learning the processes. The former government went wrong when it never did a family impact statement to determine what was happening to people in rural communities, or a family impact statement on the effects of bills that go before this House. Before the election we said to the people of Australia, 'When we introduce a bill, whatever that bill is, we are going to look at the impact that it will have on families, on family farms, on family businesses, and on families who work in cities or in country areas.' I hope that family impact statements will come before this Main Committee and before the parliament because if we cannot decide how legislation affects the family unit, how it affects individuals, then we are failing the Australian community. After spending the next three years in this parliament I do not want to look back on my time in the parliament and say, 'Like the previous government, we failed to look at the impact of legislation on families.' We have to do everything in this House we possibly can to uphold the family unit and we have to do everything we can to maintain our determination to look after the family unit. We. want to encourage the family farm and encourage the family businesses that create the wealth. They are the wealth creators in our electorates. I remember the training levy that has now fallen in a hole. I was in the parliament when that was introduced and I said then, 'This will not be a goer for the Australian community.' We were howled down at the time but it has been proved that it is not a goer for the Australian community. Commonsense is coming finally to our family farms and to our communities. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address these amendments to the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill. I look forward to supporting the dairy farmers in my electorate of McMillan. They playa major role in the provision of wealth in the whole of the electorate. They will continue to play that role as long as we as a parliament are prepared to support them by getting out of their lives and letting them get on with what they do best. What they do best is work hard. They play hard too but they work hard and they produce very well . for this nation. Thank you very much. before you twice this morning, once in the other place and now here. These bills are going to reinforce some changes that were implemented last year. They had their genesis in the establishment of the GATT agreement and prior to that in the establishment of the milk levy under the so-called Kerin plan. I was not involved in the federal parliament then but I was certainly involved in my local community and it has a fairly extensive dairy industry. Certainly it is not as large as exists in the electorates of my Victorian colleagues sitting in front of me but still it is a very important rural industry in my electorate.",167,Representatives Main Commiitee
359,Mr Vaile Clyne) 01.49 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have had the honour of appearingWednesday, 8 May 1996 MAINCOMMIITEE MC687 As a result of representing the dairy industry in my electorate I have always had contact with key people in the New South Wales section of the dairy industry. Going back all those years to the start of the Kerin plan, I point out that that plan was precipitated by a bit of tension between the New South Wales and Victorian dairy industries. circumstances under which the industry could work and prosper. Certainly it has prospered since then. Then we had the advent of the GAIT agreement and the World Trade Organisation, which Australia is signatory to. I will still maintain my limited support of that, as I have stated on many occasions in this place in the last three years. I maintain that Australia and the government of the day were very rash in their moves to lead the world as far as tariff reduction was concerned. There is evidence of that in some of the available figures concerning what is happening in the United States with the support of their dairy industry and export markets, compared with ours, and what I call, to a certain extent, the corrupt attitude of a lot of the agricultural trading nations of the world. There does not seem to be the amount of bona fides and the commitment to these tariff reductions in other countries that there has been in Australia. A lot of people would argue that there have been benefits. Sure, I think we have to go down that path. But as far as I am concerned-and I am only a lay person in these things-I do not believe it has been equitably done. We have been reducing our tariffs at a greater rate than some of the other participants in that agreement. We are never going to reach the same level because it is a percentage reduction each year, not a percentage of or getting down to a percentage tariff. That makes it doubly difficult. It makes it extremely difficult for people in our rural industries to compete in the world market place, particularly-as the member for McMillan( Mr Broadbent) so rightly pointed out-as previous governments have paid scant regard to the input costs of industry in Australia, particularly rural industries. Our rural industries have a factor that other industries do not have to deal with and that is the climate. They have been affected detrimentally in recent years by that. It is something that people in the rest of Australia sometimes have a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with. They ask: why should we, the taxpayers of Australia, be lending our support to people in those industries? But the taxpayers of Australia go to work in the morning and come home at night and at the end of the week their wages are transferred into their bank accounts, particularly in this city where there are more than 300,000 people. There are some very good people who work in this city. But a lot of the people who work in this city have not had the experience of what it takes to actually physically generate income; it is just there in the bank at the end of each week. People in Australia should have a greater understanding of what crises face people on the land from time to time and the difficulties that they face in producing a very important part of the wealth of this nation. We are-and for a long, long time into the future will always bea commodity trading nation. We should not lose sight of that fact. We need to be developing our manufacturing industries; we need to be developing our IT industries to compete and to work in the world marketplace. But just bear in mind that we are always going to be a major exporter of agricultural and mining products. They are going to form, for many years to come, the backbone of our economy.",168,Representatives Main Committee

It was deemed prior to that date that the way they were implemented was actually illegal under GAIT. I questioned that at the time in a speech that I made in this very chamber about that issue. To be a member of that trading club we have got to play by those rules, whether we agree with them or not, and go down that path. The bills that we have before us today are about making the activities taking place in the industry better reflected in legislation. I would just like to make a comparison of the two support mechanisms, between us and the US. I acknowledge that it is a sensitive issue and that the minister is here, but it is important. This information update on the dairy industry is dated April 1996, so it is reasonably recent. In it there is a fair bit said about what is happening in the US as far as their dairy industry and their dairy export incentive program are concerned. In recent years, our market has been the subject of the wheat export enhancement program under a recent farm bill. The most recent farm bill is directing support mechanisms at our dairy industry Asian marketplace. The update says: The US announced on 1 April target destinations for sales of subsidised product under the DEIP program. Second-quarter allocations were generally unchanged, including 48,000t of SMP (lO,OOOt to Asia), 4,000t ofWMP.... SMP sales to Asia under the March quarter allocation totalled 7,119t at an average subsidy of US$4751t. The indicative fob price of around US$I,950/t was below Australian contractual prices during the ftrst quarter. Domestic production ftgures for the first two months of 1996 show a definite switching by producers from butterlSMP production to cheese production. Wholesale cheese for processing prices during March and April were at seasonally high levels, around US$3,OOO/t. Butter and SMP production were three per cent, and six per cent lower at llO,460t and 87,05Ot respectively. It goes on: Presidential approval was given in early April to the 1996-2000 US Fann Bill. The Bill legislates for a gradual phasing out of the dairy minimum price support program over a four-year period. The accompanying table indicates-this is very interesting-in Australian cents per litre terms, that the support being provided in the US in 1996 is 32.2 cents per litre, and that it is phasing down over four years at the end of 1999 to 30.8 cents. They have 30.8 Australian cents per litre support. It is a fair difference from what we have got that is being provided predominantly by the producers for their own industry to maintain their competitiveness on the world market. The document goes on: However, fanngate payments for manufacturing milk have generally been substantially above support levels in the 1990s. (Fanngate manufacturing milk prices in Australia in 1994-95 averaged 24 Aus. cents per litre.) The Bill fundsthat is the farm billthe export program Dairy Export Incentive Program through to 2002, up to Uruguay Round limits on subsidised volumes. The National Dairy Board will also be able to budget for export market development. So my view is that we have always moved ahead of the game in tariff reduction, in terms of subsidy reduction. We have wanted to be shining white knights leading the way in this area, whereas a lot of our trading .opposition is working to the absolute limits of the margin, and if it can fudge over the edge, it will. Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC689 It is incumbent upon this government-and I have made that abundantly clear to the minister at the table and also to the Minister for Trade( Mr Tim Fischer)-that we take a fairly hardnosed attitude in our trade negotiations when we are in those forums, talking about these things. It is incumbent upon this government to do everything that is humanly possible in the interests of our rural industries. I assure the House that that will certainly be the case. it may be done with a bit more empathy than it has been in recent years. I acknowledged earlier in my address-and it may have been before you were here-that the facilitator of the early plan in the restructuring of the dairy industry was the then minister. That is how the Kerin plan got its name. It was all about the industry helping the industry survive. The industry did not come to the government or to the taxpayers of Australia and say, 'We want you to subsidise our products so that we can compete. We want you to organise this marketplace. We want you to do this and to do that.' Mr Sawford interjectingMrV AILE--You stick to your wool. They worked through this, so this industry could become one the most successful primary industries in Australia today. Through that restructuring process, a lot of people and production units were lost to the industry. As with all major manufacturing primary production industries, that process had to take place and we have yet to see more such processes in other agricultural industries. In the dairy industry, the production units became bigger, more viable and more equitable as far as their equity ratios were concerned. Therefore, we have ended up with an industry committed to develop into a competitive industry in the international marketplace-and it will. When the bill to make the mechanisms GATT-legal came into this place last year-I am not sure when it was-it had the support of the coalition on the day. We wanted to make sure that we gave the support to the dairy industry that it deserves, because it has done the hard yards. Some of the other primary industries are yet to do them. The dairy industry has become very efficient in both production and manufacturing. MrV AILE--All we have to do now is to implement micro-economic refonn at the next stage in the process on the transportation side-on the wharves and so on-to keep faith with the dairy industry as a major export industry. As it is in place now, the mechanism sees a contribution coming from a couple of different sections of the industry. A manufacturer's levy of 4c a litre is collected and put into the market support fund. A market milk levy of 2c a litre from producers goes into the fund. The fund provides market support of 2.2c a litre to producers of market milk. Presumably this mechanism makes the thing GAIT-legal because we are dealing with the domestic situation, not a direct export enhancement situation. This strengthens the industry and makes it more competitive on the international market as far as exports are concerned. A lot of private players in this industry are making great strides as far as exports are concerned. One dairy factory in Taree is developing a new product and . selling labelled product, not just generic product, into Asia that is earning a lot of export dollars for Australia, and doing it extremely well.",169,Representatives Main Committee

In the US fann biII, by 1999 they are looking at 30.8c Australian per litre support in the US. Interestingly, one paragraph says: The Bill funds the export program (DEIP) through to 2002, up to Uruguay Round limits ... It says 'up to'. They are going to work to the margins all the way. They are going to make us earn every export dollar that our industry can. Because it is a major export earner, this industry in this country deserves every little bit of support from both sides of this House. It has certainly reconstructed itself without the absorption or the subsidy that a lot of other industries have had. The dairy industry would have loved to have had the hundreds of millions of dollars that were spent in reform on the waterfront-the Clayton's reform on the waterfront that did not really have any effect. The dairy industry would have loved that sort of public funding in its restructuring process. keep supporting this industry in these ways so we can facilitate what they are doing for themselves. More than that, we have to support this industry and our other major primary, manufacturing and mining industries in this country so they can get on with the job of microeconomic reform. Mr Deputy Speaker, this government will do that. Make no bones about it, the people of Australia need not be concerned as to whether this government.has the backbone to do it. It certainly does. Before my time expires, I go back to the comment by the member for McMiIlan that the dairy industry is one of those major training grounds for young people. There are some of the labour market programs that were put in place in recent years that are working within the dairy industry. They do train young people-there are dairying apprenticeships in the industry-and we do not want to see those young people lost to the industry. That raises the point that while it is good to train someone, it is not an apprenticeship that can take place in a matter of years. It takes quite a few years because it is not just about a job, it is about a lifestyle. The way it is done involves a great deal of commitment to the industry and what it is doing, and a love of rural industries. The next question that raises is about the intergenerational change of farms and how people afford the financial arrangements needed to do that. With the intergenerational change in a family farm, how does the retiring dairy farmer get out, when he wants to leave that production unit to his family, and still be able to live? My personal view is that the mechanisms that are in place now are not suitable and certainly need review. We have to look at all those issues if we expect to maintain viable rural industries in Australia. That goes not just for the dairy industry, but for all our rural industries. So it is very important that we look at the financial mechanisms to enable intergenerational transfer of some of our most important industries in Australia. I am supporting the two bills that are before the House this morning and the way that the government has moved in its support for the dairy industry. Some of the industry leaders come from my electorate, which has always produced a number of the major industry leaders in New South Wales. They have my full support and they certainly know where I stand on the dairy industry.

We hope that the ministerial drought in this chamber continues to be broken. reply-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is the title you assume in this place as well as in the other, I understand. in this debate. There is obviously strong support across the political spectrum for Australia's dairy industry and a recognition that this debate is centred on some straightforward administrative amendments which in no way represent significant policy change and are a further tidying up-if I can use that sort of terminology-of the reinstrumentation of the old all-milk levy arrangements. They were, in my view, a very clever industry funded and industry driven set of export enhancement arrangements which played a significant part in boosting the export performance of the dairy industry. Over the last couple of decades, it has turned from being a rather parochial and inward looking industry with quite a few deep-rooted structural problems-very low levels of farm profitability, low levels of efficiency, and supplying essentially the domestic market-into one which is now aggressively outward looking and is really setting the pace in terms of export performance. The amendments bring us into line with our international obligations as a nation which is not only a signatory to the WTO but an originator and driver of the whole push for trade reform in the agricultural area. SoI do place on record my appreciation for the contributions made to this debate by people from both sides of politics. I would like to recap briefly on some of the remarks that have been made about the performance of the dairy industry. We can be genuinely proud of it. It is generally assumed now that we can wear the cap as the world's second most efficient dairy producer--only New Zealand is generally perceived to still have a bit of an edge on us. At the outer edges of our capacity-and I note that the member for Murray( Mrs Stone) is here-what you are seeing in the Goulburn Valley today would equal the world's best performance, really. The explosion in value adding, innovation and performance in every way in that area is something to behold.

The point ought to be made that the dairy industry has achieved much of what it has achieved through effective leadership. I have said publicly that I do have a concern that the wool industry could learn well from the model set before it, in as much as I note with some delight that the various sectors of the wool industry have recently begun to cooperate more and are not publicly criticising one another in the way that they had been in the past. The wool industry is one that, in my view, needs to engage in a greater degree of fermentation, if you like, of leadership from within its own ranks, and to push that leadership up and then support it, get behind it and make it all happen. I say that with the best will in the world, because I have some concerns that we need to do for the wool industry what the dairy industry successfully managed to achieve for itself in recent years. We have actually seen the dairy industry set a scorching pace in Asia. We hear a lot in this country about how our future lies in Asia and that is where the opportunities will be. Yet the reality is that, because we have been so reluctant to grapple with effective reform in this country, our market share in expanding Asian markets in many ways-and in a wide range of products-has been slipping. It has not been increasing, but slipping-an appalling indictment of economic, industrial relations and taxation policy under the regime that has in this country just been comprehensively booted out. In contrast-and in a moment I will come to some of the historical reasons that the dairy industry has been able to achieve a few things that others have not-dairy has seen its share of the lucrative Asian markets increase over recent years from an already impressive 29 per cent to 34 per cent last year. Currently, it has over one billion dollars worth of exports on an annualised basis. That is a performance of which the rest of the Australian community ought to be very proud; but, at the same time, we ought to be enormously challenged by it. It is in fact a model of what we all ought to be doing but cannot do. Look at the meat industry, where we are being pushed back out of Asia. Why? Largely because it is an industry based not on cooperation but on confrontation, particularly at the level of industrial relations. One reason that the dairy industry has made such great progress is that one of the great things that it had going for it-even though 20 years ago it was fragmented, small and rather inward-looking-was that it was built on a cooperative model. It was built on an understanding that there needed to be good linkages between all of the players: between the dairy farmers themselves and the cooperatives that they formed and the activities of the cooperatives, including those of an industrial relations nature. They were largely decentralised, too, out in rural Australia, and sometimes I suspect it was a little difficult for the agitators and others who would have made trouble to get out there and organise. As a result of its cooperative approach, the dairy industry has made tremendous progress. You will be only too well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker-representing, as you do, a rural region in this country-that very many farm families enjoy extraordinarily low income levels or even negative income levels; but the dairy industry is one of the great exceptions.",173,Representatives Main Commitfee

Of course, players are always a little like that other great industry that is doing reasonably well at the moment: the sugar industry. When you talk to them and say, 'Isn't it marvellous to see your industry doing well?' they all say, 'Ah, yes! But, before you think of making any government changes that might impact on us, it won't be so good next year. Remember that these things are cyclical.' And that is probably a timely warning. I would remind him that, while we have dealt with wool and now sugar, the dairy industry is the subject of the bill. recognising the challenge set by this outstanding industry. We are reinforcing its capacity to continue to set a scorching pace and an example that the rest of us need to be following. Nonetheless, with all due deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will refer to the matter in hand. One of the interesting things is recognising the potential for the industry in Australia and the ideal nature of our geographic position in relation to Asia. We are now seeing significant investment by companies such as Nestle-again in the Goulburn Valley in particular-and, interestingly enough, by the Japanese, with Snow brand, for example, producing skim milk powder and baby milk formula. That constitutes a recognition by the Japanese that, as the old protectionist policies are wound back in their homelands, competitive suppliers like Australia will have an ever greater potential for the future and that they ought to be in here on the ground floor. I have been to the Goulburn Valley a few times now and I have seen what is happening there. It is very exciting and it is reflected in many, many other areas of Australia, even in north-western New South Wales, where there are now a significant number of dairy operators who are buying up country inland because they can extract a return there that other farmers cannot from their activities. I noticed the previous speaker touched on the United States and their trading practices. We note, and I have had the good fortune to put this to the Americans in the last couple of days, that their farm bill does in fact make some very significant and worthwhile reforms. For the first time since the program was set up by Roosevelt in the 1930s, the income support programs will be decoupled from production. That is very welcome, but there are a couple of things we do not welcome. One is that both EEP and DIEP, the dairy industry export program, remain. They actually have not used EEP for grains since July of last year because grain prices are high and they have not needed them. But, as the previous speaker pointed out, they are quite aggressively, within the very clear boundaries of what they are allowed to do under WTO-as opposed to perhaps the spirit of WTO-using DIEP to the outer limits. It appears that that is the objective. We are seeking assurances from the Americans that they will respect the undertakings that they have given us not to harm Australia, as a non-subsidising nation and one that is not supposedly in their sights in terms of their engagement with the Europeans, and that they will seek to protect our interests. We sincerely hope that they will be able to, in a comprehensive and integrated way, honour those broad commitments. We do not mind competing with the",174,Representatives Main Committee

That brings me to a couple of closing remarks about the New Zealanders, who are also very aggressive, very powerful competitors and who have a very major dairy export industry-I think they export over 90 per cent of their dairy product. They are a major player on the world stage in this regard. They have progressed further and faster down the reform road than we have. This does raise some issues for us. I would put those in a couple of categories. One is that we would require of the New Zealanders that they do everything to honour the gentleman's agreement that we have with them in terms of access to our markets because we do not impose the levy that we are talking about here in this legislation-in terms of minor amendments to the legislation-on them when they sell their products on our shelves. That, of course, does constitute something of an advantage for them. They have given us an undertaking that they will not take advantage of that situation and we would be very keen to see that gentlemen's agreement upheld. Again, I can confirm to you that I have taken that issue up personally with the New Zealanders. They have responded in good faith, in an appropriate way. But, to build on that, it does indicate the need for us to get on with urgent reforms-and there are many of them on the government's agenda which are important to the dairy industry. I do not intend to talk at length now about appropriate structures, and so forth, for the dairy industry. Broadly speaking, a lot of that work has been done. The right economic environment is obviously important, fixing the big black hole so that we can ensure that·interest rates are as globally competitive, if you like, as they can be. That is what you need when you are in an export industry in this country-interest rates that allow you to be globally competitive. We do not have them, largely because of past economic policy. Those sorts of things do need to be addressed. There is one area I want to touch on finally. One of our great competitive advantages in Asia springs from our clean, green image. It is no secret that, whilst our product is clean and green, there are challenges before us in primary industry in this country if we are to maintain that clean and green image and to continue to produce sustainably. Again, many of those challenges are evident in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria as we attempt to battle such issues as salinity. The coalition government has a very comprehensive landcare package which incorporates such things as tax rebates and credits for farmers. They are an ideal mechanism both to facilitate the fanner-who, in the end, spends the bulk of the money and does the work on landcare initiatives, be they salinity or whatever, to meet sustainable agricultural objectivesand to let the community, which has a great vested interest in sustainable production, make an investment as well. The community gets a great return from that investment, not just in terms of more jobs and more taxes paid to Treasury, but also in terms of being able to secure the resource base for future generations. The tax credit rebate approach is an ideal part of that armoury. It is also part and parcel of our environment package and I again issue the challenge: if you want what is undoubtedly the best environment-landcare-environmentally sustainable production package ever put before the Australian people in this country, it needs to be recognised that the approach we have put up, with a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust to be funded out of the partial privatisation of Telstra, is sound policy that cannot be legitimately resisted by anybody who has a proper, deep Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC695 and sincere commitment to these issues of sound environmental management and sustainable agricultural production. Thank you for your indulgence. I believe the issues that I have touched on are important. But, in particular, I again want to thank all who have participated in the debate very sincerely indeed, both for their contribution and for their agreement to the objectives sought here today.
