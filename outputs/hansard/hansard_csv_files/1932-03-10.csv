Question not answered. LAND ADMINISTRATION IN THE I have received from the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr it has a considerable bearing on the case Nelson) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The land administration of the Northern Territory."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. [2.52] I approach this subject of the administration of land in the Northern Territory with a certain amount of diffidence, but the duty devolves upon all public men to guard jealously the honour of public institutions. Honourable members interjecting, call for order from the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). I would remind the honourable member that it is definitely out of order for him to make any such remark, and I hope that he will not repeat it. only be fair but also, in all circumsta.nces, illegal surveys, entering into irregular appear so to the public. Public confidence is essential for good government in this country. One of the most important functions of a government is the administration of land. tion of land in the Northern Territory was definitely placed under the control of a commission appointed by the Bruce-Page Government, with a view to assist in the development of that huge country. That body, in its administration, has been found wanting. Gross irregularities, forgery, and even lying, have been resorted to by the commission and its officers. I admit that tliat is strong language, but before I conclude, the B!ouse will have little difficulty in agreeing with me. By the courtesy of administration in the territory were placed at my disposal. They were reasonably complete, with the exception of a number of important documents and correspondence which, had they been available, would have thrown much light on this subject. I feel confident also that if the Minister decides to sift my complaint, and refers to the correspondence which is not on the files, he will find that that I am endeavouring to make out on behalf of the residents of the Northern Territory. that correspondence be obtained? he obtained from the officers of the department. This is official correspondence which passed between the Administrator of the Northern Territory and the officers of the department in Canberra. The territory is undoubtedly good cattle country, and recently the eyes of those who are interested in cattle-raising all over Australia have been focussed on that territory for the purpose of finding a solution of the cattle-raising problem. Because of that, attention has been drawn to shady dealings in connection with the administration of the Land Board. The residents of the territory have asked me to ventilate their grievances. My charge is that the North Australia Commission has been guilty of mulcting the taxpayers, charging illegal travelling expenses, making land dealings, and condoning lying and deceit. That is strong language, but a disclosure of the facts that I have prepared from the files and other documents The administraat my disposal will justify my statement.",13,Ottawa Conference Australian Delegation

51,Mr Nelson,"I suggest that it canI t is as well to understand from the outasked why these blocks, which comprised set that when the North Australia Commission was appointed it was given a definite function. Its activities were confined by the geographical boundaries of the Northern Territory, and no act of Parliament gives the members of the commission the right to go into on« of the States to perform surveying duties. It can be established that members of this commission, with the object, I suggest, of pleasing private enterprise, travelled some thousands of miles or more to carry out surveys in Western Australia. The officials who made the surveys were allowed travelling expenses of 25s. a day in the territory, and 30s. a day outside. The question was raised whether the members of the commission were acting within their powers in going outside the geographical boundaries of the territory to. perform private surveys, but, ultimately, the firm for which the work was done was charged £20. In view of the allowances paid, and the cost incurred for motor fuel and oil over a distance of some 1,000 miles, the Government lost badly on the transaction. And that does not take into account the impropriety of the procedure. company concerned? some illustrations to prove that the commission has been recreant to its trust in the matter of land transactions. I make the charge that blocks 140 and 142 were being dummied, and that one of the commissioners had an interest in them. A person named Gaden, an ex-Queensland cattle man, who is well known to many honourable members, visited the Territory to inquire the value that was put upon those blocks. He called upon the Lands Department, and asked the names of tbe owners of the blocks, which were not being worked. The chief clerk informed Gaden that, although the names of the owners were known, all efforts on the part of the to. trace had proved futile, and correspondence addressed to. them had been returned through the dead-letter office marked ""unknownGaden inquiries through private channels, and then returned to the department and some of the best land available, had not been forfeited because of non-payment of rents. The department refused to confirm his statement that the rents had not been paid, stating that such matters had to be treated as confidential between the department and the lessee. Gaden became rather incensed, and said to the chief clerk, ""Why all this humbug? Ex-Commissioner Easton is the owner of the land "". The chief clerk asked Gaden if he was prepared to repeat that statement in the presence of a Crown law officer. Gaden agreed to do so, was taken before a Crown Law officer, and asserted that the block in question belonged to ex-Commissioner Easton. That declaration is not now on the office files, but I can vouch that it was made. Gaden then said to the chief clerk, ""You cannot get into touch with the owner, but I will show you that I can "". He sent a wire to Easton, who, after retiring from the position of commissioner, had gone to Perth, Western Australia, asking him what price he wanted for the blocks. To that wire he received an immediate reply, over the name ""RBennett"". The signature was mutilated in transit to Burnett, and the addresswas given as 53 Bruce-street, Nedlands, Perth. The services of the Commonwealth investigating officers were called upon, and it was proved that the addresswas a false one, the dwelling at 53 Brucestreet being occupied by a Mr Erank Olivent. It will be noted that the address given on the application for the leasewas 38 Princess-road, Claremont, which was also proved to be false. The departmental files are f u l l of letters that have been returned from the dead-letter officemarked "" unknown "". The investigation officer reports that confidential inquirieswere made, and that Mr Davidson, of the Pensions branch, who had lived next door to 3S Princess-street for 29 yearshad not heard of Mr Robert Bennett department having lived in that locality.

Gaden was subsequently advised, in an under-handed manner, that he could purchase the blocks for £950, provided that he paid the arrears of rent. indicated that he was willing to pay the purchase price asked, but refused to pay the arrears of rent, which ran into hundreds of pounds. that a number of mysterious persons, with fictitious addresses, have taken up blocks in the Northern Territory, have made a first payment, and have then allowed the rents to accrue, in some cases to hundreds of pounds. Later they have sold their blocks, adding the rent arrears to the purchasing price that they asked. tigations have also proved that the signature of ""Bennett""' on the application for the blocks is a forgery. That is a vei-y definite statement, but I am able to prove that, Bennett was not in Australia at the time that the application was made. The alleged signature of Bennett was witnessed by the man who is now Surveyor-General of the Northern Territory. When the transaction was later subjected to investigation, tlie Administrator sent for that gentleman, and asked him what sort of a man was Bennett, whose signature he had witnessed, as the department could not trace him, and there were prospective buyers for the blocks. The Surveyor-General replied that he remembered Bennett as a rough sort of bushman. was again questioned about Bennett, and asked why he had declared that that person was "" a rough sort of bushman"" when, in reality, he was a surveyor who had worked with both the Surveyor General and ex-Comniissioner Easton. Seeing that ,the game was up, the Surveyor-General admitted to the Administrator that he had lied on the previous occasion. Those facts are known to the department, but the correspondence concerning them was not on the files placed at my disposal. I am willing to take an oath that the later Siddons transferred his interest to facts which I have just, related are true. Bennett by wire. This permitted Siddons These are nice carryings on for a public to evade the payment of stamp duties. officer iu such a high position ! Why did The lease instruments were not drawn at this man lie? Obviously, it was because that time. The Home Affairs Departhe had something to hide. What had he ment could not get Bennett's address, and to hide? I suggest that he desired to His action, of hide the fact that he had witnessed a forged signature, which he knew to be forged. He knew very well that the whole transaction was crooked, and that information about it must be suppressed. At the time when this application was He approved by the North Australia Commission, another application was under consideration for the same area, which was in conformity with the necessary Investigations reveal regulations, and was accompanied by a draft cheque for £17 10s., intended to cover the first instalment. This application was refused by the commission on the ground that the applicant failed to add exchange to his cheque. On the 1st September, 1927, the Home InvesAffairs Department was advised that as Smith had refused to pay exchange on his cheque, and had withdrawn his application, the block was granted to Mr Siddons on the 12th August, 1927. I suggest that the information conveyed to the Home Affairs Department by the North Australia Commission was totally incorrect. I assert that Smith did not withdraw bis application. {Leave to continue given.] The files definitely prove that the application was not withdrawn, because although the telegram to which I have already referred was sent to the Home Affairs Department on the 1st September, 1.927, Smith was notified two weeks later by the commission that his application was unsuccessful. Why should the commission advise him that Later, the Surveyor-General his application was unsuccessful if he had withdrawn it? After a number of letters had been sent to the Home Affairs Department by Smith, inquiring why his application had been rejected, he received a letter from the department informing him that the block had been granted to a prior applicant. This is additional evidence that Smith did not withdraw his application. Smith is prepared to' swear that he did not do so. Why all this double dealing and deception? The reason is obvious. The blocks were granted to Siddons and Bennett, and telegraphed the commission on the 24th July, 1929, to supply it for insertion in tlie documents. interrupt the honourable member, but it is impossible for me to hear his speech ou account of the conversation that is going on outside the chamber. members and visitors in the galleries that absolute silence is required of them while an honourable member is addressing the chamber. Bonnett was a fictitious person. Every effort made to obtain his address has proved futile. But, sufficient delay occurred while attempts were being made to find out where he was supposed to live to enable the person who had been granted the lease to effect a sale of the property. Tlie names of the buyers only will appear ou the deed. Tho procedure seems to have been that when blocks were granted to applicants, the initial expenses were paid, and then arrears were allowed to accumulate until the land was sold to some adjacent occupier, whose .name appeared on the lease instrument as the purchaser. This practice afforded complete cover to the persons who desired their names to remain unknown to the public. On the 26th July, two clays after the cation for transfer was signed by all the commission had received the telegram commissioners. On it is a minute, placed from the Home Affairs Department, a rethere on the 4th June, 1931,. a few days ply was received from the commission to before the commission was dissolved, and the effect that Siddons had telegraphed M3 signed by ex-commissioner Easton, which desire to transfer the land to Bennett, read as follows:and to defer preparation of the instruments. It will be noted that even then (meaning Bennett) is not her son, and that Bennett's address was not given. I then she did not know him. looked for the telegram from Siddons conveying that request to the commission, obvious deception have occurred? and found that on the 13th August, or properly understand that minute, it is three weeks after the commission had said necessary to know that the Mrs. Bohning that Siddons had wired, he did telegraph referred to is a resident of the Northern the La-nd Department at Darwin as Territory, who was married twice and follows:Please transfer my interest pastoral leases named Bennett. 141, 142 to Robt.

The signature on this instrument is a particularly clumsy forgery for a man of the calibre of this so-called surveyor, who might reasonably be expected to write a fair hand. The signature was started in a backhand, but concluded in a loose forehand style. It must liave been forged, for the simple reason that this alleged Bennett was not in Australia at the time he was supposed to have signed the instrument. On the 2Sth November, 1929, the North Australia Commission transferred the lease after stating that a.u inquiry had been made into the matter. If the inquiry made in this case is a sample of the inquiries generally made by the North Australia Commission, it is no wonder that the commission cost the Commonwealth more than £100,000.

60,Mr Nelson,"I am quite certainland, when the deeds were forwarded to that address, they were returned through the Dead Letter Office. The investigator's letter, dated 17th November, 1931, son, of the Pensions Branch, had lived for 29 years in the next house to that on this property, but had never heard of a Mr Bennett. The other addresses given also proved to be false. Yet they were satisfactory to the North Australia Commission! It is more than a coincidence that the owners of blocks 140, 142, 165 and 164 were Western Australian people, and that their first rent payments were all made by a Mr S. C. Fisher, of the Perpetual Executors Trustee Agency, Perth. Of course, it is possible these persons carried on legitimate business; but after they had paid the initia l charges, they dropped out of the picture. The rents were allowed to accumulate until a sale was effected, and then they got away. In all cases, the lease instruments were delayed, and were not drawn in the names of the original applicants; but when they sold the blocks, the names of the purchasers were submitted, and appeared on the original documents. In the correspondence from the Administrator, it w ill be seen that these persons at no time attempted to occupy the land that they were holding. When a person obtains a cattle-grazing licence in the territory, it gives him a prior right to the land when it is thrown open for leasing. Messrs. Ayliffe and Hamilton held grazing licences Nos. 11 and 12, and it was understood that they would obtain the lease of their land, but such was not the case. Although they were applicants for the lease, their request was turned down, because of a defect in their application form, which was accompanied by the necessary cheque. But, lo and behold, the block was given to a Mr Grainger, another Western Australian, who had the same address as the other mysterious persons, namely, the Perpetual Executive Trustee Agency, Perth. granted, although it was received in the form of a telegram fro m this mysterious source. The act definitely precludes the Land Boardf r o m accenting such an application, yet it did not question the regularity of an application by wire, and it turned down the amplication of bona fide settlers. Messrs. Ayliffe and Hamilton w i ll probably leave the Northern Territory, and feel disgusted over the treatment they received. I have reams of correspondence which definitely identifies the group of individuals to whom I have referred with purchases and sales of laud which has never been occupied by them. A request was made by the Administrator of the Northern Territory that the department should take advantage of the presence in Sydney of the Chief Clerk of the Lands Department iu the territory, who had made a study of Northern Territory matters, and would be able to give material assistance in getting to the bottom of what I suggest is very underhand work. But this suggestion was not adopted. It is not au easy matter to tackle a heap of files without being familiar with the details of the matters dealt with in them, and when an officer who knew all the details was available in Sydney, his services might well have been enlisted. A furthe r request was made by the Administrator that the In vestigation Branch of the Attorney General's Department might look into this matter, and a reply, dated the 17th November, 1931, was received as follows :I acknowledge receipt of your telegram in State Government code under date of the 11th November, 1031, and your lettergram of the 14th November, .1931. I confirm my lettergram of the 13th November, 1931. On receipt of the first wire, confidential inquiry was made with a view to locating any Robert Bennett at 38 Princess-road, Claremont. Mr Davidson, of the Pensions Branch, has resided at .1(1 Princess-road, Claremont, for the past 29 years, and says that he has not heard of any person named Robert Bennett residing next door to him. The householder at 38 Princess-road is a Mr Leslie. It was ascertained that "" Bert"" Bennett, brother of Dr. Bennett, dentist, at one time lived with people named McKenzie, in Princess-road. Claremont, but a guarded inquiry from Doctor Bennett indicated that his brother does not hold any pastoral leases in the Northern Territory. The electoral habitation index showed the householder at 53 The latter's application was Bruce-street, Nedlands, to be Frank Olivent. As has been discovered, the signature of the wire of the 15th August had been mutilated in transmission, and there was actually only one person named Bennett concerned with the transmission, consequently, the element of suspicion thereby lessened, and it was thought",17,Northern Territory Formal Motion For Adjournment
61,Will Establish The Fact That A Mr David,"that direct inquiries should be made at 53 Bruce-street, Nedlands. Mr Olivent, who for some years past has been iu the employ of Messrs. Robertson Bros., the well-known estate agents of this oity, was interviewed by Inquiry Officer Bennetts, of this branch, and later by myself. Mr Olivent states that a man called at his private residence one evening and said he had been told that he, Olivent, was a land salesman, and would he assist in the sale of pastoral leases at Darwin. Olivent said he thought there was an opportunity for some business and agreed to do what he could in the matter. The inquirer gave the name of Robert Bennett. . . . The inquirer was Mr Easton, and he gave the name of Bennett, knowing that Bennett was not in the country. Accompanying that communication was a tracing, and according to a statement made by the Administrator the tracing showed that the telegram of the 5th August was addressed to "" John Gaden, Darwin "". The Administrator further stated that the back of the telegram was endorsed, ""R. Bennett. 53 Bruce-street, Nedlands,"" the address and the endorsement beiug undoubtedly in Mr Easton's handwriting. ber has exhausted his time. AlthoughI know very little of the circumstances of the case presented by the honourable member for Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), the matter evidently warrants investigation by the Government. When the method of distributing the last unemployment relief grant was questioned in this House, the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Parkhill) was horrified at the suggestion that more money was being spent in one electorate than in another, and he demanded an inquiry into the matter. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has made some startling charges against men holding public offices. There must have been extraordinarily weak administration of the affairs of the Northern Territory if men were allowed to take up land at Is. a square mile, with no resumptions for fifteen years, and no stocking conditions. ditions. be necessary, and the department should be able to trace this Mr Bennett. The North Australia Commission, which cost this country about £100,000, should have seen that the stocking conditions were observed. Some time ago, a man wrote to me, and said he would like to take up laud in the Northern Territory. I got into touch with the Home Affairs Department, which communicated with the commission. A reply was received from the commission saying that it had interviewed the managers of Alexander's, and another station in the territory, to see if they were agreeable to give this man a piece of land. Later he wrote to me again on the same subject. To-day the Northern Territory has a population of about 1,000 whites and the administration of it costs the Commonwealth £100,000 a year; yet people who want to go into the Territory to develop it are debarred from doing so. Gaden has spent his whole life in the pastoral industry, and when last I met him, he was managing a station for Kidman in the Gulf country. He was thrifty, and having saved a little capital he desired to start on his own account in an industry which he perfectly understood. Being unable to get suitable land in Queensland, he decided to settle in the great undeveloped Northern Territory, of whose potentialities we hear so much from politicians. Notwithstanding the expanse of vacant land there, Gaden, according to the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), had to pay £950 to a set of crooks in the employment of the Commonwealth. Gaden was then asked to pay the rent owing to the Crown. Surely somebody in authority at Darwin must have known the former leaseholders; when the application for the lease was granted rent for the first year must have been paid, and when the second year's rent was not forthcoming, the Government officers failed miserably if they neglected to ascertain the reason, and whether the stocking conditions had been carried out. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has told us that the applicants had paid the first year's rent, and then for two or three years "" eaglehawked "" for a buyer, probably circulating optimistic reports regarding the extension of the north-south railway or the construction of one towards Camooweal. Eventually they caught Gaden, and enjoyed their rake-off. I have travelled across the Barkly Tablelands down to Lake Nash, and along that",18,Pastoral Leases Northern Territory

The North Australia Commission was disbanded in June, 1931, and the proceedings of which complaint is made happened prior to that date. been mentioned still in the employ of the Government ? was one of the commissioners, and at the last general election was a candidate for the Northern Territory seat. Section 16, sub-section 4, of the Northern Australia Act 1926, which was repealed last June by the previous Government, provided thatIn addition to the powers specified in BUDsection (1) of this section, the powers of the commission shall include the administration throughout the Territory of Crown lands in accordance with ordinances made, or to be made, in pursuance of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1010, or in pursuance of this act. In accordance with those powers, applications were invited by the North Australia Commission in the Commonwealth Gazette of the 12th March, 1927, for pastoral leases of fifteen blocks, numbered from 1 to 15, situated in the Barkly Tablelands Land District and east of Newcastle Waters. Applications were advertised to close on the 28th May, 1927. Eight applications were received for blocks 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15. They were dealt with by the ful l commission at Darwin on the 15th July, 1927, and were granted as follow: Blocks1 and 2, H . M . Bathern; blocks 6 and 10, H . H . and R. A. Hope; block 9, J. Lewis and Co.; blocks 11 and 15, Rochdale Pastoral Co.; block 12, W. G. Hutchins. Regarding the granting of blocks 6 and 10 to H . H . aud R. A. Hope, a perusal of the Darwin office file reveals the fact that on 27th April, 1927, C. Eisher, of 8 Fairfield-street, Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia, telegraphed to the commissi an £143 in respect of Hope and Hope's applications for blocks 6 and 10, and asked that the receipt be forwarded to him. On the following day, a telegram, signed Nacom, and initialed W.R.E Mr Easton-wa s sent to Eisher acknowledging receipt of the amount, and intimating that a formal receipt was being posted direct to Eisher. On the 23rd July, 1927, a letter purporting to be signed by the secretary of the North Australia Commission, was addressed to Fisher, aud, after referring to his telegram of the 27th April, stated"" I have to inform you that both the blocks applied for have been granted subject to applications being lodged on the proper form "". Two forms of application for a pastoral lease were enclosed, with a request that they be completed and returned to the Darwin office as early as possible. Regarding the acceptance by the commission of this telegraphed application, it may here be mentioned that regulation 7 under the 1924-1925 Crown Lands Ordinance, specifically stated"" The board shall not accept any application for a lease which is made by telegraph"", and regulations passed under the Crown Lands Ordinance 1927-1928, which repealed the previous ordinance, carried forward that intention.

The Crown Lands Regulations provide thatAny land notified in tlic Gazelle us available for leasing and not allotted by the board shall remain open for leasing unless withdrawn or again advertised by notice in the Gazelle setting out any altered conditions of occupancy. In consequence of this provision, the unallotted blocks, Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13 and 14, remained open for application by the first applicant. Hope's applications for blocks 6 and 1.0 had been withdrawn, these blocks also were available for application. On the 5th August, 1927, C. R.

In view of this, Smith was advised on the 15th September, 1927, that his application was unsuccessful, and his deposit was refunded. Having regard to the statement in the lettergram that block 10 had been granted to one Sideline as the prior applicant, a further perusal of the Darwin office files discloses the following: On the 12th August, 1927, applications were lodged for blocks (t and 10 in the names of Oswald Threlkeld Siddins, of Wyndham, and As Hope and Robert Bennett, of Claremont, Perth, pastoralists, as joint tenants.

That a joint select committee be appresenting to Parliament a report of the inquiry previously conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into(a) Parliamentary control and procedure in relation to the public finances of the Commonwealth; (6) The form in which the Estimates, budget papers, and other financial statements are presented to and dealt with by Parliament; and (c) The desirability of uniform methods of accounts for the Commonwealth and the States. 2. That three members of the House of Representatives be appointed to serve on such committee. 3. That the committee have power to send for persons, papers, and records, and to sit The during any adjournment of the Parliament. 4. That a message be sent to the Senate requesting its concurrence, and asking that three members of the Senate be appointed to serve on such committee. In June last the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts decided to conduct an inquiry into parliamentary control and procedure in relation to the public finances of the Commonwealth. In the course of the inquiry, the committee sought the aid of prominent financial experts, most of whom spent a considerable time in research, and in the preparation of information for the use of the committee. At the time of the dissolution of the Parliament last year, the committee had made considerable progress with its report, and with a little more time at its disposal would have been able to complete it. That report would have been of real value to this Parliament and the Government. The proposal now is to appoint those members of the committee who still remain in this chamber and in the other chamber, as a joint select committee for the purpose of completing the report. for Richmond( Mr R.

If this motion is carried, a similar motion will need to be passed by the Senate. I am informed by the Assistant Minister( Mr Francis) that all the evidence has been collected, and that the new committee will need only to prepare the report. In fact, a great deal of progress has already been made in its preparation. I do not wish, to east any reflection on the members of the previous committee who still remain in this chamber, but the inference of the Prime Minister that those honourable members, if appointed to the new committee, will express the same opinions as they expressed when they were members of the original committee, is, I think, rather far-fetched. Many changes, particulai'ly in political opinion, have taken place since the Public Accounts Committee functioned, and it is only logical to assume that the members of that committee who have changed their political party now hold opinions entirely different from those which they expressed previously. That has already been amply demonstrated, and needs no amplification by me. For instance, the political opinions of the honourable member for Bass have undergone a considerable change. for Bass belonged to the official Opposiconclusions were to be satisfactory.

The mere collection of evidence by a committee is only of secondary importance. Tbe important factor is the determination that will be embodied in the committee's report. I consider that human nature is swayed by political convictions. No That can be proved even in regard to the findings of judicial tribunals. If the personnel of this committee is allowed to remain as suggested, its findings will be lepsided, and I advise the Government, if it really desires the conclusions of the committee to be received with general respect, to see that all sides of political opinion are represented. riugah-Minister for Home Affairs) [4.20] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) is adopting the wrong attitude. This inquiry proceeded during the life of the last Parliament, and it was nearing completion when the general election occurred. The committee's investigations mostly concerned matters of procedure, which are of an entirely non-party character. The Government proposes to use the services of those honourable members now in the House who were previously on the committee, so that they may complete their report with practically no additional expense to the country, except that of printing. understand the proposal to be as stated by the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Archdale Parkhill).

It has come to my knowledge from an authoritative source that a week before the schedule was tabled, it was stated at Inglewood, Queensland, by a director of a tobacco manufacturing company, that the duty ou tobacco leaf was to be reduced to 3s. per lb. The date of the letter from the Godfrey Phillips organization coincides with that statement at Inglewood, which indicates that the precipitate action of the Government has most adversely affected this important industry. This Government has seen fit to interfere with the duties that were introduced by the previous Government, when the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) was a member of it. That action has led to the tobacco company refusing to buy the Australian-grown leaf. I have given the Government definite proof that this is so. before the amended tariff schedule was tabled? and the announcement was made at Inglewood in Queensland, at the same time. The paramount importance of this subject is shown by the fact that even in a small district such as that to which I have referred, there are 80 tobacco-growers this year where there were only five last year.

If the order of business can be changed at the slightest whim of the Government, honourable members who may have spent a considerable time in preparing themselves to discuss certain subjects, may be out of the House at the time such subjects are brought forward. This would not be fair. The five members of my party may be particularly interested in special items, but may by reason of the chopping and changing in the order of business, lose their opportunity to speak. The Government has already taken action of this kind three or four times; and we shall continue to protest against it. Yesterday, when the Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) desired a re-arrangement of the business to enable him to move the motion for the second reading of the bill dealing with wireless broadcasting at a particular time, he consulted us in the party room, and we offered no objection to the alteration.

By this measure it is proposed to amend three sections of the War Service Homes Act. more or less formal in character, but the proposed amendment of section 36 is of a more important nature. Most honourable members are aware that the War Service Homes Commission has provided homes without requiring the payment of a deposit; in thousands of eases the only deposit requested has been a minimum sum of £10. Such a payment would not provide the margin of security required by a private individual: but the commission felt that it was interpreting the wish of the Government of the day in making homes available to returned soldiers on the best terms possible.

A few years ago broadcasting, being a much less important service than it is today, was entirely controlled by private concerns with a few A class stations. Subsequently the Bruce-Page Government arranged to take over from private companies ' the then existing stations, and planned to carry out with the abundant funds then at its disposal, an extensive programme of development, which included the establishment of national service stations in different parts of the Commonwealth, particularly the more remote centres. The financial depression caused the Scullin Government to abandon that programme with the exception of certain works definitely planned for immediate undertaking. It was intended to establish up-to-date broadcasting stations in all the capitals; money was provided for the purpose, and tenders were called for the necessary plant. Thef if t h of the series was the Crystal Brook station in South Australia, and the sixth was the station at Perth. Unfortunately, work on the Perth station was stopped. The order for the plant was cancelled, and the station has not yet been completed. When the decision to cease work on the stations was The value of a proreached, tbe Crystal Brook station was so f a r advanced that it was decided to complete it . The fact that the Perth station remains unfinished has caused a good deal of feeling in Western Austhing, it has rankled in the miuds of those who talk of secession. Many persons there believe that they are not getting from the Commonwealth the deal to which they are entitled.

Following on the taking over of the private stations, tenders were called for the supply of programmes for a period of three years, the successful tenderer being the Australian Broadcasting Company. It was arranged that this company should receive 12s. from every licence-fee of 24s., 9s. was to go to the Government, and 3s. was to be paid as royalty on tlie patent rights held, or said to be held, by the Amalgamated Wireless Company. Our Government decided not to renew its con' tract with the Australian Broadcasting Company; but that is not to say that we were dissatisfied with the services rendered. We desired to establish a national system of broadcast control somewhat on the British system. SinceI have been in a position to know anything of the matter, I have always maintained that the services provided by the Australian Broadcasting Company were distinctly good. Mi-. Doyle, the chief executive offibe said on behalf of the artists all over cer of that company, managed it in a highly capable way, and with a large amount of public spirit. It has been said that the proportion of the fees which went to this company appeared to be rather high. I agree with that, and, at the present time, it would amount to £201,500 a year. It has to be remembered, however, that the artists employed by the company received considerably more than half the revenue which went to the company. Moreover, the compauv paid to our old friends, the Performing Right Association-concernin g whom we all get a little impatient-mor e than £30,000 a year.

Mr Doyle, who is the most active spirit in the company, and carries most of the work on his shoulders, approached Mr Albert, and through him was successful in obtaining a reduction of the fees payable to the Performing Right Association. However, even yet we are not satisfied with the charges made by the association, but we eannot have them reduced by a wave of the hand. legislation? General has pointed out, it is largely a legal matter. Both in Australia and New Zealand, attempts have been made to fight the association, but so far with little success.

There is a great deal to the world who copyright their music, and are as much entitled to derive royalties from their work as is an inventor whose idea is covered by a patent. Of course, just how much of the performing right fees goes to the artists has never been made clear.

Our Government, therefore, decided to institute a system of national control. Frequent complaints have been made regarding the quality of the programmes put on the air by the Australian Broadcasting Company. I am sure, however, that if the honourable members who have voiced that complaint visited one of the company's studios, and saw there the great number of artists, both Australian and British, they would realize that it was better for us to encourage this system of entertainment than to treat the public to the "" canned "" efforts of foreign artists. employed by the company? the public would be better off without their services. artists are tried out, no one can know what possible genius is iu our midst. I have also visited the B-class studios, and can understand why it is said that these stations provide better music than the A-class stations. At one station I visited there was a local quartette of no great ability, which had volunteered its services, regarding it as an honour to be put on the air. There was also a local comedian who did his turn, after which the operator put on a musical record from the score of ""Viennese Nights"". The rest of the evening was taken up with gramophone records. It was rather painful to have to listen to it at close range, but I was told in a town a few miles away that it was a splendid programme. The difference between the B and A class stations is that the one provides chiefly "" canned"" music, while the other provides an opportunity for the development of local talent. makes provision for the establishment of a national orchestra.

IfI could see that the suggestion was practicable, I should endorse it, more particularly if the commission included the present director of postal services. Every one who knows him will agree that he would be in every way suitable for the position. But it would be impossible to attach to this gentleman, in addition to his ordinary duties which he is carrying out with outstanding success, the onerous duties which will be undertaken by the chairman of this commission.

The Scullin Government had in mind the appointment of a commissioner who would devote the whole of his time to national broad casting, giving service for service sake, and in addition be in direct liaison with the other members of the commission.

The need for that provision is evident, because, if the commission were given a free hand it could seriously interfere with the revenues of the Postal Department, at the same time depriving of employment many highly-skilled postal officers. Clause 22 provides that tlie commission shall not broadcast advertisements in general. That provision will be welcomed by the great newspapers of Australia. Sub-clause 2 of that clause provides that nothing shall prevent the commission from broadcasting, if it thinks fit, sponsored programmes. That is a wise provision. Easy money is at present being made by some of the B class stations in the capital cities, from the broadcasting of sponsored programmes by the Shell Oil Company, and other firms. In these cases the only advertisement used is announced at the beginning of the programme. Mr A. Green. "" ShellO i l "" are mentioned about every two minutes. evidently not listened to sponsored programmes.

It is not right that the B class stations situated in thickly populated centres should be able to take the cream of the funds available for advertisement purposes, at the same time lowering the standard of their programmes.

Clause 25 provides that the commission shall endeavour to encourage the rendition of orchestral, choral and band music of high quality. If by means of this legislation we establish an orchestra such as that brought into being by the British Broadcasting Company, we shall have more than justified this innovation. When the Scullin Government was considering legislation similar to this, it was approached by persons of musical and artistic attainments who asked that their interests should be represented on the commission. This Government proposes to overcome that difficulty by providing that the commission may appoint committees to advise it on all matters in connection with the provision or rendition of broadcasting programmes. That will enable persons of talent and special knowledge to co-operate with the commission in an effort to improve the standard of the national broadcasting service.

I trust that the Government will exercise proper control of national broadcasting without hampering the commission with red tape, which, of course, is not actually used in the Public Service. The man outside the Service always considers that he can do a better job than the man inside it. In fact there are thousands of people outside this House who believe that they could represent the Federal constituencies much better than we do; but I am sure no honourable member will agree with this opinion. Another important provision gives power to the Minister to prohibit the commission from broadcasting any matter. If that power is used wisely it will be beneficial; if unwisely used, it will prove disastrous. I am almost entirely in agreement with the bill, but I should like to be quite sure casting has been brought under national what will be the duties of the Commissioners. I hope that, those selected will be not at present traverse, that cannot of undoubted integrity, and that they will be people who have not been too prominently associated with Nationalist politics. The Gover.ii.ment cannot hope that this bill will pass through both Houses, and particularly the Senate, without being subjected to a storm of criticism. predict that the storm centre will be the sponsored programmes. Other issues may be introduced merely as decoys. I hope that the Government will not submit to dictation in this matter. Our metropolitan B class stations are strongly entrenched. One has only to be a Minister i.n control of broadcasting to know that. Immediately a change of policy is indicated, the Minister is inundated with suggestions from interested parties. hope that the Government will not give way to this class which already holds special privileges. Mv. BEASLEY -Al l B class stations are not controlled by vested interests. Sydney Trades Hall has no vested interests; it is stojvy broke. And that is more or less the position of the Melbourne Trades Hall. The hill has stations which are not associated with vested interests. and I shall not quarrel with the honourable member on that issue. He must know that some B class stations are controlled by newspaper combines, which use them to broadcast only one political opinion. I had hoped that the air would be free to all, and that at election time every party would be given an opportunity to express its opinions over the air. Unfortunately that has not been our experience. Certain newspaper combines are endeavouring to obtain a monopoly of B class stations, and I sound the note of war.ning that sooner or later some government will have to tackle the very difficult, but necessary task of dealing with the problem of metropolitan B class stations. Nothing short of a complete national scheme will do. I u Great Britain there are no B class stations; there broadcontrol. For reasons, which I canyet be done in Australia. I admit that country B class stations are performing a useful service, in many cases at a loss to those concerned. My objection is against the operation of chains of newspapers such as that which is obtaining such a stranglehold over the eastern part of I Victoria, and disseminating its propaganda through the stations that it controls. There are also other big corporations that are acquiring interests in B class statians by lending money to those who now own them, and shortly a monopoly will come into existence which will be detrimental to the welfare of Australia. I am pleased that the bill has been introduced. I hope that a national I orchestra may be established, and that the operation of the measure may bring into being a national broadcasting service, whose standard will equal that of the existing service.

In. one or otlier of its many forms, wireless has revolutionized the world, and will continue to do so. It has banished isolation and annihilateddistance, and by bringing more closely together the nations of the world, and removing misunderstanding, between their peoples, it has made the first substantial step towards world peace. It has done incalculable service to the Empire. Associated with the Beam service, it has made Empire government, at. last possible. Our voice can now be heard in every other dominion, and we, in turn, can hear theirs. In introducing the measure, the Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) indulged in what he seemed to regard as an eulogistic fantasy of the future of broadcasting. Yet his remarks fell far short of the prosaic facts; the influence of broadcasting can hardly be expressed in words. It has permeated' every phase of human activity, national, social and economic, and has opened to us almost unlimited vistas. Whether it be well or ill governed must depend entirely upon the character of its people, and broadcasting furnishes the most potent and flexible agency for their education in every avenue of human activity. In the arts, in music, in science, in general knowledge, its influence is far-reaching. we consider our difficulties as a democracy, difficulties aggravated by our isolated position,, we must welcome the advent of broadcasting. Therefore, in considering a measure for the better utilization of this incalculable boon, we must determine whether the machinery proposed to be set up is likely to function for benefiting the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) spoke almost unreservedly in favour of the bill. We are to conclude, therefore, that he regards this machinery as satisfactory. But, curiously enough, it is his opinion-unshared, our people of Australia-that ing system of broadcasting control in Australia is also satisfactory. the answer to those who contend that the J/V. Hughes. existing system is satisfactory is that the measure before us has been introduced t® put am end to it . My remarks, of cduirse, are confined: to the control of the A class stations.

I agree with the Minister that the British Broadcasting Corporation has been an unqualified success. It weald be difficult to exaggerate the influence for good that that corporation has had upon the people of Great Britain. There was never a time in the history of the Mother Country or of the world when it was so desirable that there should be such a convenient, flexible instrumentality for informing and moulding public opinion. The underlying principle in the control of wireless by the British Broadcasting Corporation is complete independence of outside control. Wireless in Great Britain is not the plaything of any Australia is a democracy. political party. It is not controlled by any chain of newspapers, such as that referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green); it is not subjected to the influence of capitalistic interests. The initial step taken in Great Britain to control wireless was one natural to a people gifted with When a genius for self-government. The importanceof broadcasting was clearly recognized; the best men available for its controf were sought, and it is now generally admitted that those selected were men of great ability and ripe judgment.

I believe that I am re-echoing the opinion of the great majority of our people when I say that we are profoundly disappointed with the proposals of the Government. It must be apparent that the success of the new era of wireless on which we are said to be entering depends almost wholly on the personnel of this commission. Oan any one imagine that a mere change from Mr Stuart Doyle, acting -as Mr Stuart Doyle, to Mr Stuart Doyle, acting as chairman of a broadcasting commission, is likely to have a miraculous effect? There is no virtue in a commission qua commission. We must get the right man for this important position. The right man was secured in England. It was not known at the time that he was the right man, but he has certainly proved himself to be so. No one in Britain to-day would dream of going back to the unco-ordinated, unsystematized method of conducting broadcasting which was in operation prior to the creation of the British Broadcasting Corporation. This bill stands condemned because it proposes to place broadcasting in the hands of men who, ex hypothesi, are mediocrities. Only mediocrities could be obtained for 'the salaries proposed. I say deliberately that the influence of this broadcasting commission upon the community will rank in importance with that of our education department, and our universities. Broadcasting will be more potent in reaching out to the distant parts of this great country, and in exerting an influence for good or for evil, than any other agency, including our educational system and our -universities. as an educational factor broadcasting supplements the activities of our education departments. Yet is it proposed that this supremely important work shall be placed in the hands of a committee of five persons whose combined salaries will amount to only £1,800 .a year.

If that question were sufamitted to us for discussion, we should witness a demonstration .of unanimity the like of which had not previously been manifested in this Parliament.

I am profoundly disappointed with this bill. We were given to understand that the measure would be modelled on the British system of control. But it would be a mockery to compare the commission which the Government proposes to set up with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Our commissioners are to be paid a beggarly pittance. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie gave the ca.se away when he said that the Postmaster-General's Department would really control wireless. It is perfectly natural that a person with my history should favour government control of important public utilities; but political control of broadcasting would be disastrous. so many words, but that is what the bill does. The Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) is in office to-day, because the party with which he is connected was returned to power with an overwhelming majority; but surely the honourable gentleman's memory will carry him back two years and compel him to think of the uncertainties of political life.

Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. of interjection, said that the commission would not draw up the programmes. Therefore, as broadcasting will be successful or unsuccessful according as programmes are suited to the tastes of the people and the circumstances of this country, it follows that the commission is not to do the very thing for which the control of broadcasting is desirable and necessary. I shall, however, point to some of the clauses of this bill which seem to be in conflict with what the Minister has said. I direct his attention to clause 16, which contains these wordsThe commission shall undertake the provision and rendition of adequate and comprehensive programmes for broadcasing. I do not know what interpretation the honourable gentleman places upon those words, which seem to me to be unambiguous and free from possibility of misunderstanding. To the ordinary man, they mean that the commission is to drawup the programme, yet the Minister says that it is not to do so. Clause 24 statesThe commission shall, as far as possible, give encouragement to the development of local talent and endeavour to obviate restriction of the utilization of the services of per.sons who, in the opinion of the commission, are competent to make useful contributions to broadcasting programmes. There it would appear that the commission is given authority to deal with matters directly incidental to the drawing up of programmes.

Perhaps they were not included in the text of the measure drafted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie; but the sub-clause certainly gives the Minister power to direct the policy of the commission. The Minister tells us that the commission really has no authority at all, and, consequently, can have no policy; it is the general manager who exercises the authority.

203,Mr Hughes,"The Minister has sored programme will be as rare as acommission, and that this' commission is composed of mediocritiespersons, at any rate, who are to do in their spare time what is required of them -or, if you like, geniuses who in the abundance of their knowledge and energy will be able in their spare time by a mere wave of the hand to do all which ordinary men could hardly do in a full clay, we are filled with apprehension. The commissioners are to be mere puppets; their control is illusory. They are all to be subject, of course, to the general manager, who in turn is to be subject to the Minister. That appears to me to make it perfectly plain, first of all, that this commission is not to control broadcasting, but is to be controlled by the Postmaster-General's Department, not habitually, but when the Minister deems it necessary. So long as these commissioners-men of strawdo as the department wishes, there will be no direction; but if they do not, then the Minister will "" direct"" them just, what they should do. If this is not political control, what is? We hear strange rumours in the land. To-day we were told that Mr Lang contemplates day we were informed that he contemplated coming into this House, and the honourable member Gander) is believed to be ready, like another John the Baptist, to prepare the way for him. Therefore, we must look forward to the time when Mr Lang, exercising that potent influence in federal politics that he certainly exerts in the politics of New South Wales, will be sitting in this chamber, and will be able to wield the control contemplated under clause 5. That does not appeal to me. I am entirely opposed to the political control of broadcasting, and I want to see a commission established which will be entirely independent of such control, so that no political party will -be able to use this great public instrupower of any government the utilization mentality for its own purposes. We all, I think, want that. We desire, too, a -commission which will command respect, and be composed of men possessing qualities which will ensure that broad-casting shall be used for, not only the entertainment, but also the education Mr Hughes. will have a potent influence on speech. That is most desirable, because slipshod speech connotes slipshod thinking. It will, I hope, educate the people to an appreciation of the higher classes of music, and instruct them in literature, science, and general knowledge. It will lend itself to the advancement of industry by disseminating far and wide those processes which from time to time science and expert knowledge are placing at the disposal of our producers, so that all sections will have the advantage of up-to-date information, and expert advice upon matters of first importance to them. But if broadcasting is to do this great and necessary work its control must be vested in a commission composed of men of vision and knowledge. The British Broadcasting Company has achieved wonderful things, but particularly has it exercised a potent influence in raising the musical taste of the people. We want a. national orchestra in Australia. It should have been established long ago; when it is, it will have a direct and powerf ul influence on the character and spiritual life of our people. We want to ensecession, but yestercourage native-born talent in drama and music, both vocal and instrumental. To do all these things we must have a comfor Reid( Mr prehensive policy attuned to the circumstances of this country and suited to the times in which we live. We cannot have that unless control of this service is vested in men of the highest capacity; indeed the very institution itself will depend in the last analysis on the character of the men who control it, and it is most unfortunate that the Government has not made provision for the creation of an independent board of commissioners vested with complete control. The salary and tenure of the commissioners should be such as would attract the most able men in the country. This Parliament should place beyond the of broadcasting for partisan purposes. I am the last to suggest that the views of political parties should not reach the people by air, but the manner in which this should be done should be determined, not by political partisans, but by an entirely independent body. While the of the people. Broadcasting B class stations continue to operate there will be no need for any special provision for political propaganda through the A class stations. I am profoundly disappointed with this measure. I cannot conceive that it will create those conditions which are desirable in the control of broadcasting. The bill is vitiated by cardinal defects, and the Government would be wise to amend it radically on the lines I have indicated. But particularly this House should not be asked to vest the control of broadcasting in a commission which the Minister has declared will have no authority to control programmes, but will be limited to the appointment of a general manager of whom we know nothing, and who, in his turn, will be subject to the direction of the Postal Department, thus making the commission in substance, if not in name, a politically controlled organization. As Postmaster-GeneralI was associated with the inauguration of wireless broadcasting in Australia at a time when the science was comparatively new, and was in operation in very few countries. Such blunders as occurred in the first few years were only to be expected of a huge service that was to serve 3,000,000 listeners. Whatever control we may institute now will be subjected to criticism by millions of people in Australia, and it will be impossible to satisfy the wishes and tastes of everybody. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr the last three years, wireless is the only Hughes) has stated that the scheme propounded by the Government bears not the faintest resemblance to the British Broadcasting Corporation. We cannot expect that it will do so for many years. If the twelve national broadcasting stations in Australia were situated in Victoria, broadcasting only within that State, and enjoyed an annual revenue of £2,000,000, the people of Victoria could have a service almost equal to that in the United Kingdom. stations are separated by thousands of miles, and are endeavouring to serve, amongst others, outback communities nearly 3,000 miles distant from them. The main purpose of this bill is to transtorswill ne>t be full-time servants of the fer wireless broadcasting from private control to a board, and I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney that that body should be free of political control. I had seven years experience of administration of the Postal Department, and I know the trouble that broadcasting involves. Broadcasting should be as free from political control as the Commonwealth Bank. is. If we keep the broadcasting board as independent as the Commonwealth Bank Board, it will be able to function for the benefit of all sections throughout Australia. In transferring from private control to a public board, the Government proposes that the profits earned by the service shall be paid into a fund, which, I hope, will be ear-marked for use by the board in the extension of its operations. Scores of people in Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and even Tasmania cannot receive wireless programmes to-day. What the profits of the system will be we cannot estimate. The balance-sheets of the private companies for the last two years show that they lost £4,000 in one year, and made £6,000 in another year, but we do not know what their overhead charges were, and what payments were made to directors and staff. From every listener's fee 12s. is to be paid to the board for broadcasting purposes, and I am sure that these payments will accumulate a large fund, to be used, I trust, to establish new stations in distant centres for the service of people who receive only a weekly or fortnightly mail Because of the curtailment of train services during means by which the country people can obtain daily news of the outside world. The district in which I live is fairly advanced, and had enjoyed a daily mail for 52 years, but now on three days of the week we have to rely on wireless news. I trust that the new service will be operated in such a manner as to relieve this isolation of the men outback. The bill proposes that the chairman But Australia's twelve of the board shall receive a salary of £500, the deputy chairman '£400, and the other members £300 each. The right honourable member for North Sydney has found fault with this remuneration as inadequate. I remind him that the direcCommonwealth, but will attend meetings of the board when required, as the directors of the Commonwealth Bank do. Sir",42,Fenton

It is not f a i r that two or three newspapers which, in the early stages of broadcasting, acquired licences to operate B class stations, should have a monopoly of this work to the exclusion of all others. The news service provided at present over the wireless is not so satisfactory as it might be. The newspapers are merely giving to the people over the air what they put on their posters as an inducement to the public to buy their papers. It is very nearly as sketchy and limited as that. A good news service should be provided for the benefit of the thousands of licence-holders in country districts, many of whom receive their mail only once a week. The commission ought to be able to take steps to improve the news service. If the newspapers are not prepared to give a better service, the commission might establish its own news service for the benefit of licence-holders. I do not think that the present licence fee of 24s. is too much. That fee is divided, into three parts; 12s. is to go to the broadcasting division, and I feel sure that the commission ought to be able to carry on with that ajid have something over. Out of the 12s. which the commission is to receive, it must pay performing right fees. What that w i ll come to nobody seems to know. To the ordinary person, the charge made by the Performing Right Association seems preposterous, and I trust that the Government, will take action to limi t the charges which this association may make in respect of rights which, in many instances, it may not, perhaps, possess. The post office receives 9s. out of each licence-fee, in return for which it volving sometimes considerable sacrifice. telephone tralia for relaying purpose. Programmes broadcast in Victoria may be relayed to Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and even Perth. These relays sometimes involve the use of 3,000 miles of wire. Over such long distances a complicated system is employed, comprising the use of valves and repeaters at various points along the line. Large staffs are also required, and while the broadcast is in progress, the Contelephone lines are not available for ordinary purposes, and the department loses revenue in consequence. The remaining 3s. of the licence-fee goes to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. MrA . GREEK -What for? During the last four years, this company has received £52,000 a year. the patent rights in the first instance for £4:0,0001 it paid for them, but I know that those patent rights are valued in the company's own books at £90,000. An agreement was entered into between the Government and the Amalgamated Wireless Company in 1927 in respect to royalties for patent rights, and one clause of that agreement is as follows :The company agrees to prosecute as expeditiously as possible to judgment the actions which have already been instituted by it in Australia for infringement of patent rights, which actions it is agreed are for infringement of patent rights substantially important in connection with wireless broadcasting. The action which was pending at that time was against David Jones and Company of Sydney. The company lost that case, which was to test the validity of certain patents. Therefore, that action did not assist the company to establish its claim to draw royalties. I admit that it lost the case on a technical point, but, nevertheless, it lost. The company was then supposed to take action against the Government of New Zealand, which had put itself in the place of its people, and said that if the company was going to sue anybody in New Zealand, it must provides technical services insue the Government. The company then proceeded against Myers' Emporiumi n The department must supply Melbourne. Thisf i r m said that it was facilities all over Ausnot going to defend the action. It took the ""view that it did not matter to it whether it won or lost the case, as the Government had entered into an arrangement with the Amalgamated Wireless Company to pay royalites in respect of all patent rights. The Amalgamated Wireless Company was given a verdict by default. The company had already begun an action against the Government of New Zealand, but, in view of the fact that",44,Fenton

207,Mr Gibson,"I do not know whatit had won so easily against Myers', it withdrew the action against New Zealand. I am anxious to know whether the pa tent rights claimed by the Amalgamated Wireless Company really exist. The agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the company was entered into for a term of years, which will expire in November next. The Government has the right to cancel the agreement by giving twelve months' notice. I should like to know whether the last Government, or the present Government, gave the company the necessary notice to terminate the agreement. I trust that the Postmaster-General will take steps to determine definitely whether or not the Amalgamated Wireless Company possesses the rights it claims. Already it has received from the Government, in royalties, £165,000, in respect of alleged rights valued at only £90,000. The managing director of the company, Mr Fisk, in a recent speech reported in the Melbourne Age, claimed that his company was just such another as that in which Disraeli purchased shares on behalf of Great Britain. action of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who obtained an interest in the Amalgamated Wireless Company on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, with that of Disraeli, who bought for Great Britain a controlling interest in the Suez Canal Company.. Disraeli's purchase gave Britain control of the waterways of the world; Mr Hughes' purchase gave tiie Commonwealth an important measflile of control over the airways of the world. In this speech, which was a most admirable one from the point of view of Mr Eisk, he said, ""During the past year we have handed over to the Commonwealth £117,000"", and he led his hearers to believe that the Commonwealth had benefited to this extent at the expense"" of the company. But that money represents terminal rates on telegrams and cablegrams which the company was bound to collect just as the cable companies collect rates and hand them to the Government. There is not a shilling of revenue in the whole £117,000 that was earned by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, but that company received £165,000 clear money from Mr Gibson. the Postmaster-General's Department for the use of its patent rights. turned to the Government.

British Government operated the Beam system in Great Britain, but when the Imperial Communications Company took over the cables it paid Great Britain £250,000 annually for the right to-operate the Beam system. The Amalgamated Wireless Limited have a similar concession for nothing, and it is the most profitable side of its business. If it were to carry on broadcasting, with its revenue of £60,000, and the profits on the Beam system, the Government, as a partner in the concern, would be on a good wicket, but as the position is to-day, the only inference one can draw is that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is making a huge loss on its",46,Fenton

The urgency of this bill must be apparent, to every honourable member. The commission is to be appointed to take control of national broadcasting, and to start operations on the 1st July. It has no organization, and has issued no programmes. It has nothing with which to make a start on the 1st July. It is absolutely essential, therefore, is more trouble in the world to-day than to appoint at once a manager and the staff to provide the programmes. The public must be acquainted with the nature of the programmes at least one month before operations commence. It is not an easy task to get together a huge staff at such short notice. I agree in the main with this bill. Several alterations might be made to it in committee. It is essential to take the control of this undertaking out of the hands of the Minister. jurisdiction over the British Broadcasting Corporation. tem proposed in Australia is similar to that of Great Britain, except that the commission here will be advised by the Minister, which should not be so. would be surprised to know the power that, the British post office has over the British Broadcasting Corporation. that which this Government exercises over Ijhe Commonwealth Bank Board to be exercised in this instance. That control is negligible. I hope that this undertaking will soon commence operations, and will be successful. I hope that it will stand to the sponsored programmes. That is absolutely essential if we are to safeguard national broadcasting. I feel sure that the commission will be able to get together a staff which will give to Australia a better service than before. I am not complaining about the present service. We view it from different stand-points. What satisfies one does not satisfy another. I trust that the Government will provide sufficient money to enable the commission so to extend its operations national broadcasting system. of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). He went to some pains to stress the value of wireless to mankind. For instance he said it had been responsible for the creation of a measure of peace throughout the world. It would be difficult to substantiate that statement at the moment, because' there there has been for many year3. No doubt the idea of the right honourable member was that wars between nations had been minimized, because of the fact that they could make contact more readily than before. But that apparently is not having much influence in the East to-day, although there is wireless there as well as in other parts of the world. There is no doubt, about the value of wireless in respect of conferences that have taken place between nations, particularly at the International Labour Office. There, because of the sysrem of transmitting a speech to the delegates by means of headphones, they can follow it, although they cannot understand the language. I appreciate the value of that system, because after all, it is not always what one says, but the way in which one says it that has the most effect. I . quite agree that in the discussion of matters in conferences between nations, the broadcasting system to which I have referred has its value. The bill places a great responsibility upon the commission, and with that I agree. The last, speaker stressed the point that the members of the commission should have special business training; but I am satisfied that that is not the only qualification that is needed. The men who will be called upon to undertake this work must have vision, must understand art, and be able to create a public taste which will tend to l if t the intellectual life of the community to a higher plane. I am given to understand that this has been accomplished in large measure under the system adopted in Great Britain.

We have heard a good deal about political control, particularly during the last twelve or eighteen months, and I am satisfied that the expression is used largely for the purpose of bolstering up the arguments of the opponents of Labour. I have heard much about the Commonwealth Bank Board, but I have attended a meeting at which members of the Bank Board were present, and one member particularly expressed tbe opinion in my presence that he would oppose any proposal'emanating from the Labour party. Tbe Minister who is in charge of the bill was present at that meeting. He knows exactly what took place. threatened to expel the both of you from that meeting. ment that appoints a commission is able to have its political opinions reflected in the actions of that body. Every man who if. competent to undertake this work has certain political views, and any decision given by him would be biased by those views, irrespective of what his intention might be. I have no objection to power being placed in the hands of the Minister. I honestly believe that the opinion of the people should be reflected in the operation of a great national institution such as this. The policy of to-day will not be the policy, probably, of three years hence. As the nation develops, so the opinion of the people is reflected in the governments that are elected from time to time, and any national undertakings under governmental control are in that way kept abreast of modern thought and opinion. Tlie last Government exercised political control in respect of broadcasting at the general election. My complaint is that every party, with the exception of the party which I represent, was given an opportunity to use the A class stations in the various States. Certain times were set down for them. Even the leaders of the parties in the States were given an opportunity to broadcast messages to the people. We Avere deprived of that privilege, but, thanks to the B class stations, we did have an opportunity to get into touch with some of the people. Much has been said about the B class stations being controlled by vested interests.' It is quite likely that great newspapers are controlling some of these stations. But, if my memory serves me well, when the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) was Postmaster-General iu another administration, and had the task of allocating B class licences, he gave the most important one in South Australia to the Advertiser, which is associated with the Melbourne Herald. So thr.t the disposal of licences is generally in the hands of the Government. I shall not support the e who jendenm p the part that is played by B class stations. It is my opinion that they are providing better programmes than those supplied by A class stations. I know that from personal experience, as I have a wireless set and prefer the programmes of the B class stations. Incidentally, I interjected when a reference was made to the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. That organization turns out one of the finest sets produced in xVustralia. It has done splendid pioneering work, and great credit is due to it. Whatever losses it may have sustained have been justified by the results obtained.. I believe that nine out of twelve persons who own wireless sets tune in to B class in preference to A class stations. able member know? friends, and on occasion we visit them. I have formed that opinion from personal observation. B class stations do not receive any licence fees, and have to build up their revenue in other way?. I point out that there are other stations in New South Wales besides SKY which are not run simply for the purpose of making money. Many of those stations have experienced pretty bad times, and the criticism that has been levelled at them is unjustified. I object to any action by the Government that is designed to prevent B class stations from disseminating knowledge in the community. Af ter all, there are other matters besides politics which interest people, and in the majority of cases the A class stations will not broadcast such subjects. B class stations are doing a",48,Fenton

As soon as I obtain the figures E shall supply them to the committee. figures, and I do not wish to misinform honourable members. The other day I met a gentleman in Canberra who made some comment similar to that of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr and I and my party will contribute our Hughes) indicating that the charges of this organization are out of all proportion, and represent a burden that this country should not tolerate. buting to the Performing Bight Association an amount equal to that contributed by the rest of the British Empire. to our people, and the Government should not hesitate to take steps to rectify the position. The management of 2KY made representations to Mr Brennan when he was Attorney-General in .an endeavour to have something done, but they were unsuccessful in making him realize the advertising as it is to-day, and it found the burden intolerable. Perhaps it may not be practicable to include in this measure a provision to deal with that matter, but the Government should introduce legislation along those lines as promptly as possible. I have no objection to the form of control that is specified in the bill. This is a national undertaking, and it should be controlled in the manner that is intended. Strangely enough we never hear any criticism about political control in connection with the Defence Department. We do not hear anybody suggest that that department should be handed over to a board consisting of munition workers, the representatives of Yickers, or anybody else. Yet that is just as vital a service as any other. of nationalization. the war period, particularly iu Great Britain, steps wore taken to co-ordinate the whole of the social services, and place them entirely under the control of the government of the day. That was done, it was said, in the interests of national safety. I do not remember the right honourable member for North Sydney complaining that that action was political control. As a matter of fact, during the war years he was its greatest advocate. Too much capital is made out of the bogy of political control. Certainly the phrase tickles the ears of the supporters of honourable members opposite. I believe that this measure is necessary, part to making it successful. I firmly believe that the success of the undertaking depends entirely upon those who will be appointed to control it. If they possess the proper qualifications, and are not obsessed by cold business considerations, it is quite possible that instead of wireless owners tuning in to B class stations in such large numbers, they will listen-in to A class programmes, with the result , that a great many more licences will be issued and much more money will be collected in revenue from this source.",49,Fenton

One is theappointment of a small commission of experts working full time, and the other is the appointment of a conar mission. in the nature of an advisory board with power to appoint a general manager, who would conduct and organize the details of the undertaking. The Government has chosen the latter alternative. It is obvious that efficiency is essential if the scheme is to be a success. The revenue to be derived from broad*easting wiW depend largely upon the service that is given to the public. It is commercial interests may influence their the opinion of those engaged in the radio business that, provided that they can substantially improve the present standard of the broadcasting service, they will be able to increase the revenue that is obtained from licence-fees most satisfactorily. The scheme that has been adopted by the Government suggests to me a possible drawback. Up to the present the broadcasting service that has been made available to people in outlying communities, such as that from which I come, has been much inferior to that enjoyed by those who live in the more populous centres. In Western Australia, particularly, we have been singularly unfortunate. There we have no really effective transmitting station, and it seems improbable that we shall have one for at least another twelve months. The drawback that I see to this project is that it provides such small salaries for the commissioners; that those gentlemen will necessarily live in one or another of the large cities on our eastern coast and their vision will be limited to those centres. I wish to make oneor two suggestions in connection with the personnel of the commission. We have been told that a lady member is to be appointed. I hope that the claims of Western Australia will be considered in this regard, for it may be possible to get a lady from that State who, of this association, that it is simply a for £300 a year, will give her whole time to this work. It will not be possible to get a competent man to make this a whole-time position for £300 a year. whole-time job. petent man would not come from a distant State like Western Australia for this remuneration; but a lady might be induced to do so. Unless something like this can. be done,, the interests of the distant States are likely to be forgotten under the new scheme as they have been under the present one. I am glad that provision is being made for the appointment of advisory committees. I hope that the commission will set up such committees in the distant States which it is not able to visit. I trust that the commission will not be overloaded with gentlemen whose decision as commissioners. I wish to pay a tribute to the excellent work being done by B class stations. In Western Australia we are very much beholden to these stations for the programmes they put on theair, and I hope that more consideration will be given to them than they have had in the past. I am sorry that the advertising field is not being left solely to the B class stations. The attitude which the commission will adopt towards the Performing Right Association is a matter of great importance. Many complaints have been made about the operations of this association, which, I understand, is a branch of an international organization. It is recognized, of course, that copyright must be protected, and I am not prepared to accept, without investigation, all the allegations that are made against the Performing Right Association. It is alleged, among other things, that the original Performing Right Asso1 ciation obtained a virtual monopoly of copyright of large quantities of music before the value of radio was really understood. We have been told that certain wealthy interests formed themselves into a combination and acquired numerous assignments of rights, and established themselves in an almost unassailable position. It has been said, in defence co-operative association, and that its profits are distributed among the composers of the music; but we have also been told that .the composers merely get",50,Fenton

237,Mr Nairn,"That is so; and a comthe lump sum ""which is paid for the assignment of rights to the association, and that the profits of the organization are enjoyed solely by the few financial gentlemen ""who comprise it. These statements should be carefully investigated. It is unfortunately very difficult to ascerand slightly altered so that a new tain exactly how this association conducts its operations, because it pursues a policy of concealment. It will not declare where it stands or what copyrights it holds. It is alleged, also, that the association unfairly charges for chairs at certain entertainments whether they are occupied or not. Producers pay royalties to composers, and the users claim that when they buy the films they buy the music. Still the association levies further toll on the users and will not indicate the music over which it holds rights. The consequence is that users of music are subjected to a kind of blackmail. They cannot find out what music is copyrighted, yet if they perform certain copyright works in ignorance, they are called upon to pay fees or else a writ is issued against them claiming damages and an injunction. This threat is held over small societies and semi-private organizations, which at times, arrange concerts or entertainments to provide funds to maintain their activities. Sometimes a small charge is made for admission to such performances for the purpose of covering legitimate expenses, and the organizers subsequently find themselves called upon to pay heavy fees. A pianist may play only one copyright piece in an evening, but this is sufficient to involve the organizers of the entertainment in legal proceedings if they do not accede to the demands of the Performing Right Association. Unfortunately, our Copyright Act does not make registration compulsory. If registration were compulsory, people would know where they stood, and they could, if they desired, avoid the performance of copyright music. I do not think that' the position in this respect should be left where it is. Performers of musie should be able to ascertain where they stand. Copyright is much more serious than patent rights, because copyright exists during the lifetime of the author and for 50 years thereafter. A great deal of ingenuity has been displayed by the Performing Right Association in reconstructing the music of old masters so as to produce what passes for new compositions. Music which has been in more OT less common use for 20 or 30 years is, in some cases, rewritten copyright may be obtained. The most outstanding example of this kind of thing is in connection with the composition ""Yes, we have no Bananas To-day"", which, we are told, is a patchwork composed almost entirely of bars taken from great compositions. If the Copyright Act were amended to make registration compulsory, there would be some protection for the people. I realize that the broadcasting commission will not have power to deal directly with the copyright law, but it should be able to make a review of the existing conditions and recommend alterations to the law. We have been told by representatives of the Government that the copyright law must be handled very carefully because of its international complications. On that ground there is a tendency to leave the subject severely alone, but I do not think that the Australian public will be content to allow things to remain where they are. It is true that Australia is a party to the In ternational Copyright Convention, and ""has agreed to protect the rights of composers of other countries in consideration of other countries protecting the rights of our composers; but we are not obliged to do this unconditionally. Though we have agreed to give fair and reasonable protection to the copyright compositions which we receive from other countries, we have not consented to submit to exploitation by an organization like the Performing Right Association. [9.29] I am disappointed in this bill, because it contains three serious weaknesses. These are, first, that the commission to be set up is far too weak to deal effectively with the tremendous interests which will be placed under its control; secondly, that the principle of political control in its worse form is being introduced into broadcasting; and thirdly, that no provision is being made for the establishment and control of B class stations. Although these serious",51,Fenton

The Postmaster-General( Mr people.

I do not particularly blame the present Ministry-it has not been long in office-bu t the last Government, during two years of the most critical period in the history of wireless, took no action to improve broadcasting facilities. course, that that Government was handicapped by the fact that a certain contract was in force; yet it is regrettable that the numerous General, who are now members of this House, made no serious attempt to take advantage of the educational yalue of broadcasting. The public of Australia has not been educated to appreciate high-class programmes. newspapers show that the most popular items are band music' and gramophone records, which cannot be called high-class music. The honourable member for West Sydney r-vening that certain listeners made a practice of ignoring A class stations, and switching B class stations. to the fact that the majority of those who listen-in to-day are mainly interested in second-class music, since the B class stations chiefly broadcast gramophone recor,ds, and poor necords, at that. In the last ten or twelve years, various Mr Thompson. federal governments have failed to rise casting facilities for the education of the the population resides in the capital cities, where most of the listeners are to be found. That is true; but it proves the shortcomings of governments. While successive administrations have allowed broadcasting contractors to cater for the needs of the people in capital cities, they have shamefully neglected the claims of Compared with country districts. Most country members will agree that it is almost impossible to obtain good wireless reception in rural districts, and this is mainly because there are only three or four relay stations. The educational value of broadcasting being recognized throughout the world, Australia should not have been so backward as it is to-day in taking advantage of the opportunities offered. EviThis disparity casts a reflection dently, various Commonwealth Governments have not taken the possibilities of broadcasting seriously. This Parliament now has its first opportunity to deal with this subject, which is of vast importance to the people, and yet we are presented with a weak I recognize, of bill. In many respects it shirks the main issues. In the first place, the commission, which we were told was to be a replica of the British Broadcasting Corex-Postmastersporation, is to be the weakest thing imaginable. The Minister has contradicted himself. He said that we were to follow the lines laid down by the British body, and yet the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), who is an ex-Postmaster-General, reiterated the Minister's statement that we have a Various ballots taken by long way to go before doing what has been accomplished by the British Commission. If it is desirable that the new system of commission control should resemble the British pattern, we should ( Mr Beasley) stated this try to copy it as closely as possible immediately. Why should we remain ten years behind the times? The honourable over to the member for Corangamite remarked that I put that down it was practically impossible for us to adopt the British system. Then why does the Minister say that under this measure we are copying Great Britain so far as possible? The Minister referred in his speech to the high capacity of the gentleman in control of the British commission; but bow cau we hope to obtain the services of a highly-qualified gentleof this commission at the remuneration man to act as chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission when the suggested remuneration is only £500 per annum? This gentleman will be required to control broadcasting for the next five years, during which period enormous developments may take place; even television may be found practicable. The deputy chairman is to receive £400 per annum, and the other members of the commission £300 per annum. It is said that the commission will not have a whole-time job; but I submit that broadcasting is one of the most important enterprises in Australia to-day, and the commission should devote practically the whole of its time to the development of this system in the interests of the people generally. result of the new form of control to be introduced, I have no doubt that double the present number of listening-in licences will be taken out, which means that instead of receiving a revenue of £400,000 from this source, we shall get £800,000, and it should not be difficult to increase that revenue to approximately £1,000,000. Then why strangle the commission at its birth by providing a paltry remuneration for its members ? While I admit that in these difficult times we cannot afford to be extravagant, the Government need not have gone out of its way to remove the possibility of obtaining the services of first class men for this important work. I realize that we shall be fortunate in having the services of Mi. Brown, the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, who will be in control of the technical side of the undertaking; but the driving force behind the movement will be the chairman of the commission. The manager, of course, will be merely a creature of the board. He may be appointed to-day, and dismissed to-morrow. We shall be very fortunate if we cau find an ideal manager. The Government is, apparently, looking for another Sir Robert Gibson; but will they be able to obtain the services of a man capable of controlling the broadcasting system for the paltry salary of £500 per honourable member suggest? year? No doubt 500 or 1,000 men in Australia would consider themselves the"" chairman not less than £1,000, to qualified for appointment as chairman specified in the bill. member know how the time of the commission will be occupied? wireless broadcasting is placed under the control of the commission, which has 230wer practically to educate the people of Australia in any direction it like3. It can dictate the nature of the programmes to be broadcast, and it can publish literature. It has all the powers and functions of the board of directors of a great business concern, yet we are offering probably the most paltry salaries ever provided under federal legislation. That fact will cause profound disappointment. Because wireless broadAs a casting is a most fascinating interest, many capable men would be ready to serve on the commission, and sacrifice their other interests to do so; they would be ready to accept appointment for five years and give of their best to Australia. But they will be deterred by the small remuneration proposed, which would compel them to maintain their private interests. Is it sound practice to offer big jobs to men who mav_ treat them as sidelines, continue their activities as directors of banks and companies, keep their fingers in this or that financial pie, and after a hard day's work drift along to a meeting of the broadcasting commission ? For the last ten years the Australian people have been disgusted with the broadcasting service, and have looked forward eagerly to a complete reformation of the system. From my own experience, I know that they are concerned not so much with the amou-nt of the fee, as with the value they receive. They are convinced that under the systems of control in operation hitherto they have not received fair value. Now they are thinking of a new wireless service, which will compare with the world's best, but the feebleness of this bill will dispel a lot of their enthusiasm. The remuneration of the commissioners and the director should be increased.",52,Fenton

I am sorry that this Government, members of which have so often condemned the political control of banking, should have introduced that principle into this bill.

What possibilities that will open to a strong or audacious man ! Imagine the honourable member.for West Sydney in control of broadcasting when a general election was approaching. misused the broadcasting service yet. facilitate misuse of it. Why not lay down definite principles, so that a great educational facility shall not be misused for political purposes? The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) declares that many people prefer to listen-in to the B class stations, because they want to hear Mr Lang. I assure the House that the majority of people, even those with very definite political views, strongly object to the growing practice of "" jamming the air"" with political harangues. persons say, ""Lang again!"" and rush to the wireless cabinet to switch on to another station, and from it, in turn, they hear ""the Red Flag."" Let us eliminate entirely ministerial control. I would trust the present Postmaster General to any extent, but we do not know who may succeed him. I certainly would not trust some past Ministers. But why not shut out personal considerations by prescribing that the controlling authority shall be the commission, which shall be independent of ministerial interference? The Commonwealth Bank is free of political control, bu* wireless is more important to the people than that institution. How few people have access to the Commonwealth Bank in comparison with those who are keenly interested in wireless ! But this bill is establishing a principle by which some future Postmaster-General, backed by a government determined to poison the minds of the people with political propaganda, may abuse this great educational service. The ignoring of the B class stations is a serious omission. We have twelve national broadcasting stations, and the Government proposes to establish eight more. The twenty will provide a very fine service, and will, I believe, double the present number of listeners. Unfortunately, Ministers, in devising this scheme, seem to have based their calculation on the present paltry revenue from 350,000 listeners. Some day these will number 1,000,000. TheB class stations have not had a fair deal. They may be regarded as the poor man's stations, catering, as they do, for people who prefer the cheaper classes of music and entertainment. At present they are dependent entirely on their returns from advertising; but they are entitled to participate in the revenue from listeners' fees. A class stations cannot be established -everywhere; and, therefore, the number of B class stations must increase, particularly in country districts. In fact, the bill should make definite provision that the increase of A class stations shall be accompanied by an increase of B class stations in a stated proportion; for instance, if eight new A class stations are brought into existence, four more B class stations should be established. This would ensure even development of I have heard the two phases of broadcasting; each caters for a different taste, and, therefore, both are essential. It is not fair to exclude the B class stations from government assistance. The listeners now pay a fee of 24s., but they would readily pay 30s. if they were assured of value. Why should Amalgamated Wireless (Aus-",54,Fenton

I hope that provision will be made to give them a prescribed share of the fees from listeners. It is evident that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is to be a big factor in the success of broadcasting. It is the biggest manufacturer of wireless material, and occupies a privileged position, because the Commonwealth Government is the principal shareholder. At present it is receiving £50,000 a year from broadcasting. What service is the company giving in return for this revenue? I am aware that it has certain patent rights, but what is their value? The Government seems to assume that the new system of control must continue the payment of £50,000 a year to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. the revenue was distributed at present. The Government will take action in regard to the future distribution. Wireless (Australasia) Limited cannot prove its title to one-fifth of the total broadcasting revenue; Parliament is entitled to know what service it is giving in return. Although it practically monopolizes the manufacture of wireless material, it is not producing cheap receiving sets for the people. One of the big influences retarding the development of wireless is the prohibitive cost of receiving sets. This public company is exploiting the people as ruthlessly as any private firm. The Government should investigate its operations with a view to assisting the development of wireless by making cheaper receiving sets available to the poorer people. Then, there is this Performing Right Association, about which I can tell honourable members something. It is paid a proportion of the licence revenue, but we should inquire what are the grounds upon which it is entitled to this money. The last balance-sheet issued by the association in Great Britain showed that, out of a total revenue of £60,000 drawn from all part3 Limited, the Performing of the Empire, Australia contributed no less than £30,000. It looks as if they are "" putting it over "" Australia to some purpose. Some gentlemen associated with this concern are at present in Canberra, and the Government might do well to interview them, to learn just upon what grounds Australia is being bled in this way, and what value the association is giving for the money it receives. We know that one of the factors necessary for the success of broadcasting in Australia is the establishment of a national orchestra. No provision is made in the bill for this purpose; it is merely provided that the commission may establish an orchestra. But where is the commission to obtain the money? It is not likely to have available £60,000 for this purpose out of the proportion of the licenee fees which it will collect. At the present time, we are paying £50,000 a year to the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited-nobod y knows what for-and £30,000 a year to the Performing Right Association, a foreign body, and we do not know what that is for either. That makes £80,000 altogether, which is at least £30,000 too much. I suggest that it would be possible for the Government to obtain at least £30,000 of the money necessary for the establishment of a if it can, national orchestra from the levies at present paid to the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the Performing Right Association, and that without doing any injustice to anybody. I maintain that the Performing Right Association has no rights in this country at all. We hear a great deal about international copyright. How does it concern us? When did we become a party to a copyright agreement, and in what way are we bound by any agreement? Africa repudiated the claims of the association; so did the Irish Free State; and so did Canada. The Canadian Parliament even passed an act establishing its own performing right association. The members of the Performing Right Association, who are really the publishers of Great Britain, quickly compromised with Canada, and that dominion got out of the matter very cheaply The Irish Eree State fpught the Performing Right Association in the courts, and won, and",55,Fenton

In Australia, however, where we have never contested the claims of this association, we are robbed and exploited to the tune of half the total revenue collected by the association throughout the whole Empire. The Government is making a serious mistake in proceeding with this legislation without testing the alleged rights of the Performing Right Association. first matters which will be attended to by the commission ? power to do so. If the honourable gentleman can show me anywhere in the bill a provision empowering the commission to deal with these matters, I shall withdraw what I have said. Under this measure the Minister is to be the controlling force, have upon the education and culture of a and the commission will exercise only nominal control. It will be the Minister's servant, and I object to that. Why does not the Commonwealth Government challenge the claims of the Performing Right Association? Why are we paying this money? The association cannot enforce similar claims in New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada, while even in Great Britain, where there are 4,000,000 listeners-in, the association receives less than in Australia where there are only 350,000. I trust that the Government will reconsider the whole scope of the commission, and take steps to make it a more powerful body. It should try to get an able chairman, and pay him a decent salary. It should be a full-time occupation, not merely a lunch-time job, as it will be under these proposals. chairman is a man who will make a success or failure of the whole system. I suggest that no political influence should effective control over the programmes be allowed to obtrude in the making of an appointment, and no suggestion from outside interests should be considered for a moment. I appeal to the Government, before the matter goes too far, to cut out the pernicious system of political control. The Government should make some provision to safeguard the interest of B class stations. Those stations have been sadly neglected for years past, and they look to this Parliament for justice. Einally, the Government should take an early opportunity of testing the claims of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the Performing Right Association, with a view to obtaining relief from their heavy exactions. welcome this bill in that it is a step towards bringing broadcasting control in Australia into line with the excellent system which obtains in Great Britain; but it is a very small step, indeed. This proposal, as I see it, is merely a parody of the British system. The Minister who introduced the bill has interviewed many deputations, more than one of which requested that a select committee be appointed to go into the whole subject before legislation was passed. Having regard to the immense scope of broadcasting, and the great influence it can community, as was poiuted out by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), too much care cannot be exercised in framing measures for its control. We have been told by the Minister that the system proposed to be inaugurated here resembles the British broadcasting system. So far as I can see, the only similarity is that the commission is to have a seal and a charter. Clause5 of the bill provides that the commission is to be charged with the general administration of the act, subject to the directions, if any, given to it by the Minister. Clause 15 provides that the commission shall appoint a general manager, and such other officers as it thinks fit, but the salaries paid to the general manager and the six next highest officers shall be subject to the decision of the Minister. The Minister said that the general manager The would exercise control over programmes. It would be extraordinary, indeed, if the general manager were able to exercise broadcast from various stations throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. manager would have certain officers under him. officers to be?

The general manager win be a man who is at present a member of the civil service, and the six other perthoroughly into the matter of prosons will be appointed by the Government. What a parody this is of the system operating in Great Britain! A board or commission is much the same as a board of directors, and the members of this board will be paid quite inadequate salaries. It may be possible to obtain the services of suitable men for the remuneration offered. There are, no doubt, leisured persons in Australia possessing the necessary culture who may be prepared to do this national work for small recompense. We should remember, however, that it will not be a full-time job. They will merely attend certain meetings to deal with the business put before them. When a board of directors meet, they deal with the business which has been prepared for them by the secretary; they go through it in a perfunctory way, accepting the recommendations of the executive officers. That is how many companies are run, and yet the directors receive larger fees than it is proposed to pay to members of this commission. It must be admitted that the programmes broadcast in Australia have not been all they might have been, and there are many reasons for this. TheA class -stations engage performers who, apparently, made a great impression on the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr present the Postmaster-General charges A. Green) ; but in many instances, the stations cannot afford to pay big salaries, and they are trying all the time to dodge paying fees to the Performing Bight Association. The result is that, although -occasionally good programmes are broadcast, as a general rule the quality is indifferent. I agree with the right honourable member for East Sydney that the B class stations have given the best service. gramophone records. gramophone music is frequently the best. It is certainly better than the efforts of the "" Wiregrass "" brass band, or of some egregious comedian. [34 ] stations are not treating their listeners-in to such items as that, they are only too frequently broadcasting the odds at Ascot or the depth of the water in the Murrumbidgee at, say, 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The British Broadcasting Commission is composed of qualified persons who go grammes. That is the main reason for having a commission, and its work has been an admitted success from an educational and cultural point of view. Much the same sort of thing could be done here. It is surprising, however, that Cabinet should expect much from a commission, consisting of a chairman receiving £500 a year, and a few lesser lights, assisted by a manager and executive. In view of the fact that committees have been appointed to inquire into transport and other important problems confronting this country, surely broadcasting, which is as important, should have been investigated by a select committee. Had that been done, we would not have wasted so much time in this House discussing this legislation. We should have had an immediate and complete change, whereas this legislation is but a step in that direction. About 330,000 licences are issued in Australia, and it is estimated that there are four listeners-in to each licence. Therefore, something like 1,300,000 people, representing one-sixth of our population, are interested in wireless. If we wish to make wireless popular, and to bring civilization and education nearer to the people who are pioneering outback, we should reduce the licence-fees. At Is. for collecting fees; 12s. is paid to the companies carrying on broadcasting for the cost of their programmes; 3s. per licence is paid to the Amalgamated Wireless Limited; and 8s. to the Postmaster-General's Department for technical services. That is a total of 24s. In Great Britain the cost is about one-third of that amount. Although we have a greater space over which to broadcast, there is no reason why the fees should not be reduced. The technical control of broadcasting is an important factor. The bill provides for the usual governmental control.

253,Mr A. Green,They play a lot of,58,Fenton
254,Mr White,"That is true, and I admit that there is one good argument for government control, since it controls trunk line telegraphs for distant broadcasting; yet it is clear that there is lack of co-ordination in respect of the technical side of broadcasting. I do not wish to disparage the eminent engineers employed in the Postmaster-General's Department; but there is no reason why they should not be transferred to the technical branch of the commission. If that is not to be provided for in the bill, I hope that the commission, when it is appointed, w ill take early steps to establish its own technical department. In 1927 a royal commission inquired into wireless, and in its report it strongly condemned the conduct Limited. If the Government is cognizant of that fact, it should certainly institute an inquiry into patent rights. doing that. graph on this subject appeared in the Argus of the 15th September last:For stations 3LO and 2FC Sydney, the Postal Department hired the necessary technical equipment from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, whicli owns and operates the stations. There is ample evidence to show that this arrangement has proved cumbersome, uneconomical, and wholly unsatisfactory. The essential components of such a public utility cannot easily be conducted under entirely independent control. A single illustrationan example of which occurs almost daily in one State or otlier-wil l serve to show how impracticable effective co-ordination has proved. I have heard producers of plays who have broadcast them in Melbourne complain that the whole performance had been marred because they were unable to overcome their technical difficulties. The paragraph continuesA technical mishap or failure may mar a performance upon which several weeks of rehearsal have been spent. Listeners are not slow to express their disappointment to the broadcasting company. The company, however, is powerless to take remedial action. Its manager cannot send for the responsible engineer and make such arrangements as will prevent a recurrence. Instead, he must transmit the complaint to the Postal Department, which, perhaps, has to refer it to Amalgamated Wireless. pany receives a reply from the department that the complaint has been investigated, and, it is hoped, rectified. The necessary co-ordination is lacking, and without it we cannot have perfect technical transmission and reception. Why does not the Government go the whole hog and let the broadcasting commission be a commission in effect? Leti t be free from the influence of any Minister, and let it have its own technical department to deal w i th inadequacies of transmission. Reference has been made made to the B class stations.

As a result of the company's acts clause, which provides that the national und omissions, the company is regarded with broadcasting stations may enter into comsuspicion and its business methods disapproved throughout Australia, No criticism could be stronger than that. The commission pointed out that the New Zealand Government had issued a cordial invitation to the Amalgamated Wireless Limited to take proceedings against it for refusing their claim for patent rights. The proposed broadcasting commission will be of no use unless it inquires into patent royalties. The commission of 1927 further statedThe history of the acquisition of these rights by the company would seem to indicate that the £90,000 which it paid in shares for these rights in 1913, was arrived at by compromise, and not on any carefully considered basis of real value. Another £3,000 was paid for a number of other rights. The wireless commission pointed out that at least 20 of these patents have expired, and that a considerable number of others have no application to wireless receiving sets.

It is said to be modelled on the British Broadcasting Corporation. honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and others have said, it falls much below that standard. inclined to agree strongly with the criticism that was levelled at the salaries prothat the commission shall not "" without posed to be paid to the commissioners, bin. after analysing the measure, and realizing the real ambit of the responsibilities of the commissioners, I am inclined to change my opinion, and to think that they will be overpaid. Clause 5, as has been pointed out by the right honourable member for North Sydney and others, in a general way, places the acts of the commission able member that he need not labour that matter. on to clause 15. As the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) pointed out, there again the Minister possesses a real measure of control as the fixation of the salaries payable, not only to the general manager, but to his firsf six subordinates, is to be subject to the approval I see the of the Minister. Clause 16 provides that2. The hours during whicli programmes shall be broadcast from the various national broadI casting stations shall be subject to lhe approval of the Minister. This commission is not even to have the right to say whether it shall start at !> or 10 in the morning, without receiving the approval of the Minister. Section 17 provides that the commission shall have the right to conduct cerThey were designed to tain subsidiary interests, but it specifies that none of those subsidiary interestsshall be engaged in by the commission without the approval of the Minister. Section 19 stipulates that the commission shall not, without the approval of the Minister, conduct any transaction which so much exception can be taken to that, because the ultimate financial responsibility that is assumed by the commissionrests upon the Government. However,, as the commission will start off with an annual revenue in excess of £200,000, that limit of £5,000 appears to be a small one.. The proposal that is Sub-section 2 of section 20 sets out thatThe location of any studios to be providedby the commission in pursuance of this secAs the right tion, shall be subject to the approval of tinMinister. The commission cannot even select its. I was own studios without ministerial approval.

That is not so hurtful. Section 22 provides that even that modicum of advertising effort which is permitted the commission shall not be indulged in without ministerial approval. Section 52 providesThe Minister may, from time to time, by notice in writing, prohibit the commission from broadcasting any matter, or matter of any class or character, specified in the notice, or may require the commission to refrain from broadcasting any such matter.

""While I believe that we shall experience real difficulty in findpansion of that principle. ing the proper type of men to conduct this work, because of the parsimonious salaries that are offered, I believe that the of the provisions of this measure were greatest drawback is that, after all, these commissioners are merely to be rubber stamps. ""What we need is a real copy of the British system, even if that means the complete subordination of the B class stations, and I speak, perhaps, as one who has the greatest individual in terest in B class stations in Australia. Rather than see a half-baked measure of this type, I should prefer the alternative to which I have referred. second last speaker suggested that B class stations should participate in the licenceleast, start equal. A reference was made fees. I say "" amen "" to that, of course, but I do not submit it as a serious proposition. Advertising, however, should be left to B class stations, as that is their only field of revenue. I am glad that the bill specifically exempts direct advertising from the powers of the commission. But is it f a ir that this body, which starts off without any capital, except that which is invested by the Treasury, and which is heavily subsidized by the licence-fees that are received, should be allowed to compete even in a measure with the B class stations which have no other source of revenue? It has been pointed out to-night that the revenue of the national stations for the past' year was in excess of £200,000. I draw attention to the fact that since 1925 licences have increased in number from 61,000 to 341,000, and this during a period of unparalleled depression. One can visualize what w ill happen in the way of expansion when the f u l l benefit of the recent change of Federal Government is felt. It is not difficult to forecast that within the next three or four years tbe number of licences w ill increase to 500,000, and that the revenue of the commission will automatically reach one-third of a million pounds, to say nothing about the additional £50,000 which w ill go straight into the coffers of the commission should the subsidy of Amalgamated ""Wireless (Australasia) Limited be terminated. I feel that, innocuous and limited as its provisions may be, this is but the beginning of another trading enterprise, and I have seen sufficient of them to make me a very definite opponent of any exI n his speech, the last Postmaster-General( Mr. A. Green)-and I believe that most sponsored by him-le t the cat out of the bag when he said that it was necessary to provide that national events, such as cricket matches, should be preserved for national stations. There is nothing at present to prevent those stations competing with B class stations in that class of work. Surely they have little complaint, seeing that they are so substantially backed by. the Government, whereas fi The class stations are entirely dependent on that field of revenue. They should, at to the development and encouragement of Australian music. I point out that only recently it was left to a B class station to put over the air the Australian Grand Opera chorus. It is only reasonable to ask that the national station, under whatever control it might be, should, at least, start off without the advantage of both a subsidy and the right of advertising. AlthoughI am not able, enthusiastically, to acclaim the measure, I hope that in the committee stages some amendments w ill be accepted by the Minister.
