Having consulted the Attorney-General, I find that it is not competent for us to do more. HATS FOR CADETS. I promise the hon-",11,Setup

I instructed the Military Board early this year to consider ancl submit a scheme. Regulations for the formation of a Reserve Forces List were published in Gazette of 19th September, 1908-Statutory Rule 1908/102-and the formation of such a reserve is being carried out. Had records been kept, as will be done in the future, there would be a possibility of obtaining the information with something approaching accuracy, but there are no records. It is difficult to suggest, in the absence of them, bow information could be obtained, which would be of any value, more especially when the following details are required :1. Lists of al] who have served for any period during the last thirty years. 2. Length of such service. 3. Efficiency attained during service by each individual. 4. Information as to existence, or presence in Australia of each individual. 5. Present state of physical fitness for service of each individual. I will consider the matter, and if it be possible to devise any scheme or procedure by which even approximate figures can be arrived at, I will inform the right honourable member. fence, upon noticeReferring to question No. 8 of 27th ultimo, as follows:-""What was the amount of the actual expenditure (exclusive of ' special defence material ' and ' new special defence provision') on account of the Military and Naval Defence of the Commonwealth for the year 1906-7 and the year 1907-8.

Does he observe that the return he has furnished in reply thereto does not comply with the terms of the request? 2. Does he observe that the amount of ^250,000 put to Trust Account, which is still subject to the decision of the House, is included under the head of ""actual expenditure"" for 1907-8? 3. Has he any objection now to furnish the information as asked for. 4. Would he kindly direct the total for each year to be given? right honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The return already furnished contains all the items of expenditure. The comparison being between actual expenditure, not appropriation, and an estimate of probable appropriation, embracing both Naval and Military Services (initial cost and upkeep) which cannot become an actual expenditure for two or may be three years, it was thought that the details from which the total was derived would be acceptable.

Ten voting machines or models have been submitted' to, and examined by, the Committee appointed for this purpose, and advice has been received that twelve additional machines or models are in course of construction. It is anticipated that the Committee will be in a position to furnish a comprehensive report early in the next year on the whole of the machines submitted. toThat a return be laid upon the tabfe of the House showing(1) The premises leased by the Federal Government in the several capital cities of the States.

In Committee of Supply : Debate resumed from 3rd November (vide page 1878) on motion by Sir That the item, "" The President ^1,100,"" be agreed to. that I shall be able to continue my remarksto-day in a calmer atmosphere than prevailed .last night. I regret that I was not permitted then to continue for a few minutes longer, since but for a reference ro the question of the transfer of the States debtsI had almost concluded my speech. I certainly hope that the debate will not bestarted anew to-day. I understand that the honourable member for Mernda claims that his scheme for the transfer of thedebts of the States would involve absolutely no loss to the States themselves, and. that they would simply continue to pay by way of interest on their debts the sameamount as they had done before. His proposal, as I understand it , is to return to the States a fixed sum of ,£6,500,000 per annum based upon the average returns for the three years 1902-5, and as the total amount of interest payable by the States is£8,700,000 per annum, there would thus be a difference of £2,200,000 per annum* which they would have to make good. The honourable member proposes that the payment of that amount shall extend over a period of twenty years, and that it shall be decreased to the extent of 5 per cent, annually. The honourable member urged that in this way the States, instead of suffering a loss, would gain to the extent of the5 per cent, cumulative reduction made each) year. I fail to see how it would be possible for the States in the first place to escape such a large liability as is represented' by their debts without paying anything. The amount returned to the States up tr> 30th June last averaged £ 7 , 7 7 5 , 0 0 0 , and under the honourable member for Mernda'sscheme they would lose the difference between that sum and the fixed amount of £6,500,000 which he proposes shall bereturned to them. a great deal more than three-fourths of theCustoms and Excise revenue. fact remains that they would have to giveup a considerable sum. us over and above the three-fourths.",13,Assistants Stores Branch South Melbourne

I find, further, that the Government proposal is to return only £6,000,000 per annum to the States, instead of £6,500,000, as proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, and that would result in their having to make good a difference of £2,700,000 in respect of their interest bill. for Mernda admitted that his calculation made no provision for old-age pensions, a Commonwealth scheme not having been agreed' to when he prepared it. were payable throughout the Commonwealth, some of the States would be relieved of a considerable expenditure which they now incur in that respect. But, as it is, some of the smaller States where old age pensions schemes are not in .operation would have their revenue largely decreased under the Government -proposal, whilst they would secure no compensating advantage in the shape of relief from the expenappear to be much prospect for some time diture on old-age pensions, such as would fall to the lot of the two most prosperous States of the union. As the total amount payable in respect of interest on the debts of the States is £8,700,000 per annum, it ought not to be said that the adoption of the honourable member for Mernda's scheme would involve no sacrifice to the States. paying that amount by way of interest. also receiving from the Commonwealth, under a statutory right, nearly £6,900,000 per annum, as against a return of only £6,000,000, which the Treasurer proposes to make to them. That means that they would have to make good a difference of about £900,000 per annum. omitting the payments in respect of old age pensions. proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, that amount will have to be paid for twenty years, but under the Government scheme it will have to be paid for no less than thirty-five years. That being 90, I do not think that it can reasonably be said that the States are to receive something for nothing. Eveni f the Customs and Excise revenue remained as it is, the States, for the next thirty-five years, would between £32,000,000 and £33,000,000. pocket. ber's interjection is very pertinent to the point I was trying to make. If it all comes out of one pocket, the people of the States will eventually have to pay, through their taxation, the amount the Commonwealth has to pay, because they are the people of the Commonwealth. It is therefore necessary to see what advantage is to be gained by all this shuffling and handing over of debts to one central authority. The only advantage that can be derived appears to be that the Commonwealth may borrow cheaper than the States can. But at the present time, seeing that Japan is not able to get rid of her war loans, which she offered at £ 9 0 at 6 per cent., and that Prussia is paying 5 per cent, on £ 9 2 for her money, while Canadian3 per cents, since the financial crisis are no longer at par, there does not to come of Australia obtaining money at 3 per cent. We appear to be taking upon ourselves as a Commonwealth a very large financial responsibility in the hope that we shall be able to get money at a cheaper rate than we are doing now. A good deal of the trouble has arisen through our trying to take over too much. Seeing that in any case the saving by the Commonwealth in interest must be almost entirely upon the loans held externally, and not upon those held in Australia, we could arrange the matter much better by taking over only the London money, which totals £183,000,000, and bears an interest charge of £6,640,000. The Commonwealth could take those loans over gradually as they fell due, and allow the States, without any of these complicated financial transactions, to face their Australian-held debt only. The amount that we must return to the States, so long as the Braddon clause continues to operate, will exceed the amount required to pay off the Londonheld loans; and it is only on that part of the national debt that any profit can be made by the Commonwealth for the people of Australia. We could not induce Australian bond-holders to take less than 3.6",14,William Lyne

36,Mr Crouch,"The honourable memper cent., which is the average interest payable at present on the Australian-held loans. I believe that Australian money could be used more profitably than that. Our only chance, therefore, will come from trying to float into Australian consols the £183,000,000 held outside. We should not need to ask the consent of the States to take those loans over, although it would be necessary to amend the Constitution in order to deal with any of them which have been incurred since the adoption of the Federal Constitution. Not only does that sum of £183,000,000 represent the amount of the States debts upon which it will be possible to make a saving, but the interest on it comes absolutely within our powers to meet out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise .revenue. The difficulty about the Government scheme and that of the honourable member for Mernda is that it is necessary to obtain the consent of every one of the States to the transaction, and, if only one of them stands out, the scheme falls to the ground. Western Australia, for instance, would not be greatly advantaged by it. get the consent of all the Statesi f an amendment of the Constitution were agreed to? ment of the Constitution contemplated so far is directed purely to the question of taking over the debts incurred since the Federation was inaugurated, and not to the question of whether the States will join in or not. whole power required ? ber appears to think that that amendment of the Constitution would give the Commonwealth power to limit the rights of the States to borrow except through the Commonwealth. That touches the crux of the whole question. ready to agree to that in the shape of an amendment of the Constitution, it will be necessary to secure the agreement of all the States to the scheme. If they can borrow where and when they please, it will mean that in some years, when the Commonwealth has to convert £20,000,000 or £25,000,000 of old State loans, the States will come in offering better terms and repeat -the disastrous cutan amendment of the Constitution or by throat policy of the past. at once refuse to allow the State Governments to borrow if they had to borrow at higher rates. have not shown that tendency in the past. A little while ago two Australian States wanted to float large loans. One offered 3J per cent., and the other immediately offered 3! per cent., while New Zealand came in shortly afterwards and offered a loan on the Melbourne market at 4 per cent. Consequently, unless the Commonwealth has some control over future State borrowings-and that can only be secured by the consent of all the States, or by an amendment of the Constitution-the future dealing by the Commonwealth with the national debt will be in danger of being prejudiced. can borrow more cheaply than ctin the States, the people of the States will demand that the States should borrow through the Commonwealth. Treasurers of two States have stated publicly that the Commonwealth cannot borrow more cheaply than the States 'can. That was said by the Premier of Victoria, and also by the Premier of New South Wales when he was lauding the financial reputation of his State. word on the subject. same would be said again, and I have not the slightest doubt that if any State wants money in the future and the Commonwealth exercises no control, it will proceed to borrow. The States will want to borrow money, because Western Australia, for instance, could some day easily spend £100,000,000 on railways in the necessary development of her vast area. No doubt that State will some day have a very large railway system, and it Unless the people are will not limit its borrowings unless we can obtain an amendment of the Constitution to compel it to do so. This is the first time that I have heard an amendment of the Constitution for that purpose suggested.

I have put forward these views because the honororable member for Mernda has from time to time met various alterations and criticisms of his scheme, and I should like him to give them consideration, seeing that under that part of his scheme the Commonwealth cannot work without the consent of the whole of the States, and the Commonwealth would eventually have to take the matter into its own hands, if we are to take the honourable member's view of the writing on the wall.

Sydney) [3.1] I should like to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that, during last year, the expenditure was exceedingly small in comparison with the money voted, and great complaints have been made that certain facilities which were very urgently required have not been provided, owing, it is said, to lack of funds. In 1907-8, the sum of £ 2 8 5 , 6 4 6 was voted for works and buildings under the Department of Home Affairs, and, of that, only £ 1 2 6 , 0 9 8 was expended.

If we provide funds for necessary improvements, we ought to feel certain that a fair proportion of the money will be expended, so that the works may not be held over for future years. A glance at the Estimates shows that an enormous number of the items are That honourable member stipulates re-votes. For instance, on the first two pages of the Works and Buildings Estimates, we find that eight items out of nineare re-votes, and that discloses an unsatisfactory state of affairs, to overcome which some means ought to be adopted. If we have a repetition of last year's experience, we shall find complaints growing louder. It was promised long ago that there would He did not dogmatize on be a more rapid execution of works, especially if the Estimates were passed early. I admit that, even last year, the Estimates were not passed as early as they might have been, but, at any rate, they were agreed to in September, when only three months of the financial year had gone by ; and yet, instead of three-fourths of the expenditure taking place in the remaining three-fourths of the year, we find that less than half the amount voted represents the expenditure. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Treas u r e r ) ^ ^ ] I was myself very much surprised to find at the end of the year that so little of the money voted had been spent.

In New South Wales, for the construction of telephones and telegraphs, the actual expenditure was .£4,000 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 more than the appropriation. there has also been an excess of expenditure over appropriation, but no excesses of that kind are to be found in the case of the other States. In Victoria the expenditure was a good deal less than the appropriation. I cannot understand this in the light of the allegations that works are not being pushed on as expeditiously in New South Wales as the people there could wish. I mention these things at this stage, so that when the items are reached the Treasurer will be in a position to give us a more lucid, or, at all events, more convincing explanation than he has suggested up to the present. should like an explanation from the Treasurer of the item of £ 2 , 0 0 0 in the appropriation for 1907-8 for a launch. Out of that only £ 6 5 was expended. Is it for a Customs launch, or a pleasure launch ? Is the amount commission on a sale, or money expended towards the building of a launch ? the honourable member is now referring is in Division No. 2. Division No. 1 is before the Committee. Treasurer, as the matter has been brought under his notice, will supply the information when that division is reached. dially agree with the suggestion that it is necessary to have a Commonwealth Department of Public Works. Over and over again I have experienced considerable difficulty in getting works completed, and on inquiry I have found that the matter was practically hung up in the State Department. Consequently,., one can get no satisfaction from the Minister. His reply is, "" We are urging the State Department to proceed, and doing all we can to accelerate the matter."" The onus is then thrown upon one to approach th2 State Department, and one cannot readily do that unless one appeals to the State member. Consequently we, as Federal members, are placed under a compliment to the State members by having to ask them to intervene. Only yesterday I received a letter which shows how these works are delayed. For some months [73]2 past it has been proposed to build a Post Office which is urgently needed at Cessnock, in my electorate. At this late date I received a letter from the Department, to the following effectWith reference to previous correspondence reI n Queensland specting the proposed erection of a new post office building at Cessnock, New South Wales, I have the honour to inform you that the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, recently reported that the papers and plan relating to the matter were being returned to the Works Director for New South Wales for an amended estimate of cost and sketch in connection with certain alterations to the Telephone Exchange room, suggested by the Electrical Engineer, Sydney. That is where the matter stands at present,, and from that morass it is absolutely impossible to drag it out, without the intervention of the Minister himself. I cordially agree that we should have a Public"" Works Department of our own. TheTreasurer states that the building which he purposes to construct is to be fireproof I have seen a great many buildings supposed to be fireproof, but when a fire comes along they seem to burn better than any others. I would ask the Treasurer to endeavour, if possible, to have the building fitted with a system of sprinklers, which, so far as my experience goes, is the only method of preventing destructive fires. The item to which The Treasurer told us on one occasion when putting the Quarantine Bill through the House, that there would not be much additional cost entailed. member's memory is too good. long memory to follow the Treasurer.

98,Mr John Thomson (Cowper),"serious consideration to the practice which has hitherto been followed, and the way we have been treated. been a considerable amount of delay in many cases, my experience is that it has not been altogether the, fault of the States Public Works Departments. In many cases there is so much circumlocution between the different Departments and offices as to who shall approve or condemn different buildings that to blame the State Departments is sometimes a convenient way of shifting the responsibility on to a body with which we have no power to deal. The State Departments are responsible to some extent for the delay in the carrying out of public works in the shape of repairs, additions, and new buildings, but my experience is that when some such work is decided upon there are quite a number of different gentlemen whose business it is to have a finger in the pie. We have first to move the Post and Telegraph Department to say that the repair or new work is necessary. matter then goes through the Deputy Postmaster-General's office, from him fo the Inspector for the district, thence back to the State Public Works Department, from there to the local officer, then back to the district officer, and back again to the State Department, and so on round and round until one has to be very conversant with the .intricacies of the different Departments to be able to follow the sets of papers in connection with each case, and one is afterwards very fortunate if he is able to put the saddle on the right horse. I wish to caution the Treasurer and the Government before they attempt to create a Commonwealth Public Works Department. I put a question on the business-paper to-day which had a direct bearing on the matter. I asked for information as to what we paid the States to carry out and supervise these works. The information read by the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, was that, according to an arrangement made, the States receive, on new works costing o v e r ;£ > 6 per cent, plus expenses of IOO clerks of works as prescribed in the Commonwealth Public Works Regulations; while on new works and buildings costing less than £100, 8 per cent, is paid to Tasmania, and 10 per cent, to all the other States; and on all maintenance, repairs, and furniture, 8 per cent, to Tasmania, and 10 per cent, to all the other States. During the financial year just closed we Mr John Thomson. expended £126,098 on additions, new works, and buildings, under the control of While there has the Department of Home Affairs, and on page 28 of the Estimates-in-Chief it is stated that the amount paid to recoup the various States for salaries, & c , for supervising the work-and this I understand includes the cost of the Public Works staff -wa s £7,500, or a little over 6 per cent. 011 the total cost. Our experience of Government Departments teaches us that we cannot start another Department of our own and duplicate all the officers, inspectors, and so on for anything like 6 pep cent. The proposal must be regarded not from the sentimental point of view of whether we ought to have a Department of our own or control more officers than we do, but from the stand-point of whether, if adopted, it will enable us to carry out the works in the most economical way possible. No Department that I know of could carry out these works in the way that they have been carried out by the different States Departments for anything like 6 per cent. The We know that the works of the States being carried out in conjunction with some of our works account for delays, particularly in smaller matters. In the State which I represent it had been quite common to see three or four inspectors in a country town, superintending, one a post office, and others a court house, and various works. This only leads to a multiplication of expense. This has now been remedied and the whole is superintended by one man. I am afraid that similar circumstances would be repeated if we had a Works Department of our own, and I suggest that, before any ' alteration be made, the question of the relative cost of the two systems ought to be looked into. While something may be said in favour of our having a Works Department of our own, the present system is, I think, the more economical. wish to strictly obey the ruling of the Chairman in regard to the discussion of questions of policy, and, consequently, I shall do no more at present than congratulate the Government on tlie proposed expenditure of £2,000, which I understand, is to assist the Government in their benevolent policy of universal conciliation-in enabling honourable menibers and distinguished persons to realize in congenial company the beautiful surroundings and glories of Sydney's beautiful harbour.",22,Thomson Tli E Amount Out Promptly Than To Have These Unex

In the course of the negotiations, fhe interests of the Commonwealth appear to have suffered to a serious extent; and if a Commonwealth officer is responsible he ought not to be allowed to remain in. a position to make similar blunders in the future. On the other hand, if a Minister is responsible, we ought to know who that Minister is. No time should be lost in ascertaining whether the blunder can be rectified, and the Commonwealth rights secured. As to the curtailed' expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department, there is seething discontent in the country districts, and, to a lesser degree, in the larger centre^ of population. The Treasurer says that he has hitherto made the provision asked for, but that this year he proposes to reduce the amount. In looking over the Estimates, I find that last year we voted for additions, new works, and buildings, £285,646, of which £159,548 remained unexpended at the end of the year; and presumably that was returned to the States. It would be just as well to know how far the Post and Telegraph Department has suffered in this connection. In the works for that Department, under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, in New South Wales, £40,332 was appropriated', and only £10,933 expended, leaving an unexpended balance of £29,399; and yet, at the same time, we are told that the services are starved owing to want of money. Not only are new works never entered upon, but approved works are unattended to; and all this shows unmistakably that! there is a screw loose somewhere in the administration.

The position would be different if the money we voted last year were available now; but, under the circumstance?, the money has now to be found out of new revenue; and that seems to make clear one of the reasons why there is so much friction and trouble.

AVe have the Electrical Engineer declaring to the Royal Commission on the Post and Telegraph Department, that a sum of something like £800,000 to bring his branch of the Department into a state of efficiency. is saying nothing in regard to the expenditure for new works which the public urgently demands. the Treasurer the cause of the enormous disproportion between the appropriation and the expenditure of last year, and whether what happened then will happen again this year. which will not be expended? If the expenditure cannot -take place because of faulty administration, let us have the matter remedied. It seems to me that there is undue friction and too much red-tape procedure in the relations of the Commonwealth and State Departments. It is hinted that the officers of the States do not deal speedily with Commonwealth work because they look upon it as an additional task, and it is said that they give the greater part of their time to State work, doing the Commonwealth work in their odd time. However that may be, the present state of affairs is unsatisfactory. Parliament should not be asked to vote more money than can be expended. administration of the States Departments, we should be asked to remedy the evil by appointing more officers of our own. But whatever the nature of the difficulty, we should be fully and thoroughly informed regarding it, and steps should be proposed for removing it. What is the use of asking, us to pass the Works and Buildings Estimates as quickly as possible, on the ground 1 of urgency, if only part of the money voted will be expended ? Last year, out of £-285,000 appropriated, only £126,000 was expended, votes amounting to £159,000lapsing. The observations of the honourable member for Calare are justified, and I regret that the"" story which he told is not a new one. Each year since Federation our expenditure on works and buildings has been considerably less than our appropriation. This year the Estimates should have been laid on the table much earlier than was the case, because Parliament met over two months after the end of the financial year,, and during those two months the Department should have prepared them. Generally, it is not possible to present the Estimates until Parliament has been sittinga month or six weeks, because the financesof the year cannot be reviewed by the Treais needed surer till the financial year has ended; but"" in this instance they should have been That presented at the beginning of the session. Last year we voted no less than£1,098,000 for works and buildings, but I wish to know from only £877,000 was spent, £221,000 remaining unspent. This year, no doubt, a number of votes will lapse, because only six months remain in which to spend the parliamentary appropriation. Something What is the use of voting money should be done to gmend this unsatisfactory state of affairs. Throughout the Estimates one comes upon votes of last year of which very little was expended. Western Australia this year. We expect the members of the Labour Party from that State to see that fair play is obtained from the Ministry which they support. We have heard a great deal about the want of funds in the Department of the Postmaster-General; but I find that the appropriations of last year were not expended.

There is nothing that one of an utterly generous nature dislikes so much as to be interrupted in a charitable interpretation -of the action of an opponent. I was giving what to my mind was the most charitable interpretation that could be placed on the action of 'the Treasurer in purchasing Mr Hordern's yacht as a Customs launch, -when I unfortunately ran foul of the 'Standing Orders. But I am sincere in expressing my deep admiration of the altruistic policy that underlies the action of the Ministry in purchasing a yacht which, however unsuitable for Customs purposes, is none the less as suitable a yacht as could be bought for the money for entertaining one's friends or those of the Government. yacht that has been purchased for the Government is one of the prettiest pleasure boats that we have in Sydney harbour, and as such is dirt cheap at £ 2 , 0 0 0 .

I hope that these Estimates piano on board when she was owned by Mr Hordern. But, apart altogether from pianos and furnishings, she is well equipped. She has magnificent state-rooms, and splendid state lockers for state cigars and state whisky. She is really the best vessel of which I know for conciliating the opponents of the Ministry. But it is absolutely ridiculous to purchase her for use as a bona fide Customs launch. She cannot be used for such purposes. The Treasurer has had some experience of buying pleasure yachts.

Sir alteration been made? has not. I was under the impression that Mr Reeks, the naval architect, had been requested to report as to what alterations are necessary to render the vessel suitable for use as a Customs launch, but whether he has done so or not I am unable to say. I have learned with surprise from Mr suitable for its work. Miller, that, at present, it is proposed only to make some trivial alterations of a temporary character. foolish. All necessary alterations should be -made and the yacht ""put in first-class order. At present she is fitted with light"" chain plates for her shrouds to pass through, and there is a risk when she is ranging alongside a wharf that the piles might carry them away. A string piece would do away with this risk. Tapering from the bow it could gradually swell to the chain plates along the side, and taper away again to the stern, and if nicely rounded would add to the appearance of the vessel. She certainly requires re-decking, which should be done straight away, and she is too heavily sparred for harbour work. Her engines and rudder also require some attention. With those alterations, I am satisfied that the Commonwealth has made a very safe investment in the purchase of the yacht. She is admirably adapted for pleasure purposes, but no less admirably, when the necessary alterations are carried out, for ordinary Customs work as an auxiliary boat. In contrast to her, I would remind the honourable member for Wentworth that a boat was built locally for the Customs DepartmentI am not sure whether at Mort's Dock or the Cockatoo Dock-of which -everything was made in the country, and, as far as possible, I believe her engines were made here, and yet that boat has -never given satisfaction. -a good boat cannot be built in Sydney. boat has been an absolute failure. all. I am informed, the top of her boiler flew out, and she is now out of commission undergoing repairs. There were too many fingers in the pie in her construction. Her cost was great and her upkeep has been exceptionally heavy. The Treasurer has in buying the vessel at present under discussion, although she is more of a pleasure yacht than a boat for rough knock-about work, and it may be necessary later on to acquire another. A similar vessel might with advantage be obtained for Port Phillip, because I do not think the Customs Department in Victoria has any boat I shall not cavil of the Works Department, at expenditure of that kind, which I regard as absolutely necessary. This particular investment is one in which the ComThis, I think, is monwealth has obtained in every way a very excellent bargain. Prime Minister, on 9th October last, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Dalley, said that this boat cost £ 1 , 7 0 0 , whereas the amount on the Estimates is £ 1 , 9 1 6 . How is the difference accounted for ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think £ 5 0 is for different fittings required. terations. hope I shall be able to gain the attention of the Minister, speaking, as I do, from the Ministerial corner. I have no doub: that the yacht purchased is a beautiful one, and I trust that it will be at the disposal of members of Parliament, in order that they may be able.to supervise the efficient working of the Customs Department on the waters of Port Jackson. I do not know that members have yet been invited to make use of it. I have not received an invitation yet; but I trust that I shall not be forgotten. I quite admit that occasionally it will be necessary that the yacht should do some work in connection with the Customs Department, but I hope that will be at a time when it is not wanted for more important purposes. Has the Treasurer made any statement to the Committee as to T t is nonsense to say that the grounds upon which he secured the authority of Parliament for its purchase?

Of course, it is in the power of a State to prevent the Federal Government from trawling, seeing that the Federal power is only beyond "" territorial limits""-thoug h what that means has never yet been explained. At all events, the States have control of all fishing within the three-mile l i m it ; and we may not expect the trawling to be kept outI s the building side that, though, I believe, in some parts of the old world, trawling is carried on forty or fifty miles out.

She is a deep sea vessel, capable of withstanding any storm that is likely to occur on the Austramation as to the cost of manning tlie lian coast, and will be so equipped as to be able to remain at sea for several consecutive weeks. Her upkeep is sure to be an expensive item. In the first place, her master and crew must necessarily be picked men. and their wages will not be those paid to ordinary fishermen. Then, again, scientists are to be employed in connection with her, and, having regard to all these facts, the Treasurer must not imagine that she is not going to cost us more than would a small fishing boat. If we are to have inything like a scientific investigation of oui waters with a view to the development of the fishing industry, the Treasurer must be prepared to provide a considerable sum foi her maintenance and equipment. Even if our experiments in this direction fail, we shall suffer no loss so far as the construction of the trawler is concerned. It must not be forgotten that the Commonwealth Government proposes at an early date to take over the control of lighthouses, and that this vessel will be eminently suitable for the periodical visits of inspection. As to the question of manning, I would suggest to the Treasurer that the Department should take care to obtain through the Public Service Commissioner the best possible crew.

An excellent suggestion has been thrown out by the honourable member for Dalley as to the work which this vessel might do in connection with the inspection of the lighthouses whicli we propose before long to take over from the States. She is eminently suitable for such work, and without her we should have either to charter a steamer, or to build one specially to enable a periodical inspection to be made. to speak, a lighthouse ferry.

He is sending me certain information which I am sure will prove of great value. Dr. Ramsay Smith referred specially to the importance of studying the habits of fish, and the foods for which they have a liking, with a view to discovering when certain fish are likely to be found in certain waters. He also gave me a great deal of information of much practical interest. I would recommend those who are interested in this subject to avail themselves of the first opportunity they have of discussing it with Dr. Ramsay Smith, who, I should imagine, is more familiar with its scientific features than is any one else in Australia.

I met Dr. Nansen several times in London, and he was good enough to send us plans for the trawler that we have built. He informed me that in Mr Dannevig we have one of the best experts to be found in the British Empire. The honourable member for Brisbane inquired where the trawler would commence operations.« I cannot answer that question definitely, but should imagine that she will commence her investigations in the colder waters along the coast of Tasmania, 01 the southern coast of Australia. trawler has been constructed, is it not time that the Department elaborated a plan of operations ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE so; although I do not suppose that the vessel will be in commission until three or four months hence. orable members are not familiar with the habits of some of the edible fish to be found in Australian waters, but the subject is certainly an interesting one. For instance, what is known as the school trumpeter found in Tasmanian waters, usually keeps fairly close to the coast, but we do not know that there are not further out to sea feeding grounds where it may be found at certain periods in large numbers. what is known as the solitary trumpeter which grows to a large size, and is usually found some miles off the coast. the solitary'trumpeters with the trawler? solitary trumpeters because they are not a school fish. We do not yet know the habits of the pilchard on the New South Wales coast, and I presume that fhe habits of the herring are much the same. know is that the pilchard comes in from somewhere to the south-east, strikes the coast about the Promontory, and then runs right along the coast some distance out till it gets to the south of Queensland, when it goes away north-east. ought to find out where those fish come from, and where they go to at certain periods. three or four months in the year. lieve they are just about finished now. Then there is the large mackerel-no t the small mackerel that we get along the New South Wales coast, but the large mackerel -whic h goes along the coast of Tasmania, coming from the south or south-east, just as the pilchard does. It runs along-the east coast of Tasmania until it gets to the north, and then it goes away to the northeast. That fish comes in myriads, like the pilchard, and its habits should be discovered. Colonel FOXTON -There are other fish further up the eastern coast. are many others that I do not know of. find out the whereabouts of the whiptail it will do some good.

But I should think that the colder waters would be the Probably honfirst to bedealt with, seeing that there the better fish as a rule are to be found.

In the matter of scientific discovery, and in Communicating with the lighthouses, we shall have plenty for the trawler to do, and she will answer the purpose well. canning ? There is also fishermen are out here now to get information about Australian fish for the purpose of forming a large company to carry on canning work.

The first idea in connection with this trawler was that we should ascertain whether we All we could not take some practical step which would result, not only in finding fish for the Australian people, but in getting up a great canning industry. I think that in that direction the trawler will do very usef u l work.

At any rate, there has been time to have proper plans and estimates and specifications prepared, and tenders should have been called for. must bear in mind that only eight months of the present financial year remain, of which two will be consumed in calling for tenders and letting contracts. Not very much work can be done in six months. works could be carried out in that time. arrangement, there will never be more than I six months in any year for the carrying out of new works. so. I find that where a work is to cost only £ 8 0 0 or £ 9 0 0 , we are asked to make provision for its partial construction this vear, with a view, I suppose, to its completion next year.

It is not surprising that the administration of the Department is considered unsatisfactory. office at Murwillumbah, estimated to cost £1,500, that amount was voted last year but nothing expended, and we are now asked to re-vote only £500. Apparently, even small buildings are to be erected on the instalment principle, so much being done each year. The Tingha post office was estimated to cost £800, and £40 0 was voted for it last year; but nothing was spent, and the re-vote this year is only to spend that amount in the year? do so with an effort. These matters are under the control of the Minister of Home Affairs. that the Minister will succeed in getting that large amount spent. I am not blaming the Postmaster-General. The fault lies, apparently, with the Treasurer, or another Minister, but the Ministry, at all events, must be held responsible. We find that in respect of a building which is to cost £800, it is proposed to expend this year only £100 , although £400 was voted for the same work last year. In the next item we have provision made for an expenditure of £400 on a post-office at Wahroonga, the total cost of which is to be £1,750, and in respect of which £1,400 was appropriated last year. Then we have an item of £600 towards the cost of a telephone exchange at Ashfield, which will involve an expenditure of £1,500, and in respect of which £600 was voted last year. struction of post-offices at an estimated cost of £6,000, which is to be spread over four years. Only £1,500 is to be appropriated this year. so; but I have been dealing only with items in respect of which appropriations were made last year. There is no excuse for all the delay that is taking place in confactory way at the present time, what will' nexion with these works. The administration of our Departments must have reached an extraordinary stage, when having had twelve months in which to prepare plans and specifications for a building estimated to cost £800, it is found impossible to expend more than £ 1 0 0 in respect of that work during the current financial 1 year. I have alluded to these items, not because they relate to New South Wales, For a post but because they are! grouped more comprehensively in this estitnate than in those relating to the other States.

We are asked to commit ourselves to a state of affairs far worse than has been disclosed in connection with any other Estimates. In connection with only four items, out of a total of eighteen, for which appropriations have already been made, has any expenditure been incurred. No satisfactory explanation is possible. Minister does not recognise that he is admitting, not only that the system has beenunsatisfactory, but that it is to be still more unsatisfactory. Reference has beenmade to the desirableness of creating a Commonwealth Department of Public Works; but honourable members do not appear to recognise what it would cost to have Commonwealth officers all over Australia to supervise Commonwealth works.

The position, at all events, is unsatisfactory, and we seem to be drifting from bad to worse. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-4-5 p-m. [7-45]--In the first item of this subdivision provision is made for an appropriation of £ 3 , 8 6 2 in respect of "" sundry offices."" Last year, the amount appropriated was £ 6 , 0 4 9 , d the amount actually expended a n was only £ 3 , 1 6 8 . This year we are to have a re-vote of £ 1 , 8 6 2 , and a new vote of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , making a total appropriation of £ 3 , 8 6 2 , or a sum slightly in excess of the actual expenditure under this heading last year. If a i l to understand how the Postmaster-General is going to keep in repair all the post-offices in New South Wales and to make the necessary additions that are required in many instances with such an appropriation. shall not be able to secure accommodation for the telephone exchanges that are urgently needed in many country districts, and that there is no likelihood of necessary improvements being made. If , as is proposed, we are to become the custodians of these transferred buildings, we must certainly keep them in repair, and a vote of £ 3 , 8 6 2 is wholly inadequate to maintain the many post-offices in New South Wales as they ought to be kept. The fact that the appropriation proposed to be made exceeds the actual expenditure of last year does not prove anything further than that we are to have an accumulation of unfinished works that should have been dealt with before. does not by any means prove that the expenditure under this heading last year was adequate. Representatives of country districts know that it was not, and it ""would seem that we cannot hope for any improvement during the current financial year. Unless we are to have a larger vote we cannot expect that attention to country postal buildings that should be given to them. The number of items in respect of which amounts are voted and re-voted is becoming I agree that the cost of remarkably large. In connection with a certain work in my own electorate there has been an item on the Estimates for three successive years, and we have not yet had the plans prepared. It is impossible to ascertain with whom the responsibility I should rests. Inftonnexion with the proposed ejection of a post office at Coff's Harbor, difficulty was experienced in obtaining a site, and now that a site has been secured, I learn that the man who prepared the plans for the proposed building apparently forgot that it was designed to be used as a post and telegraph office, and made no provision for a battery room. The Government new works is due to the failure of the Parliament to place at the disposal of the Department the funds necessary to carry them out. It is for the Government first of all to propose what expenditure shall be incurred, and then to indicate how the money is to be found. In connection with a long list of new works in New South Wales, for which provision was made last year, we find that an expenditure on new works has been, incurred in only four cases. I hope that an end will be put to these delays. As to the item relating to the erection of telephone exchanges, I hope that the exchanges It seems to me that we named therein are not the only ones that are to be erected this year. The proposed vote in respect of them is certainly £ 1 6 2 in excess of the appropriation made last year, but it is not sufficient to cover all that is required. I am in the unfortunate position of having within my electorate a partially-constructed telephone exchange which will be completed goodness knows when. In an important' centre in my electorate telephone poles were erected last April, but the telephone exchange has not yet been opened. In several other cases subscriptions have actually been collected from subscribers, but the exchanges have not yet been opened. What reason can there be for delay in opening offices or exchanges It the construction of which has been completed? I trust that I shall not be asked in this connection to exercise for another two years that patience which I have exhibited since my return to this Parliament. If I am, I am afraid that the breaking strain will be reached. I hope that I shall not be accused of parochialism in pointing to the singular fact that while the total appropriation in respect of post and telegraph buildings in New South Wales under",39,William Lyne Ha S Not That Done The Commonwealth A Distinct Service

A large number of the excuses given by the Post and Telegraph Department for the non-fulfilment of promised public works are shown by these Estimates to have been not altogether veracious. I know instances in my own electorate-and other honourable members have numerous examples of the same thing-wher e works are said not to be proceeded with because of lack of funds, but these Estimates show that the Department has not utilized the funds voted. Last year £4,000 item 23-Erection of telephone exchanges at various suburbs of Sydney -and only £838 was spent. Those works are urgently necessary, and I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs to see that they are immediately put in hand, so that the money will be spent this year. the farce in this Parliament of constantly voting supplies for works, the money for which is not expended before the close of the year. lies with the Ministries that have conducted Commonwealth affairs for the past seven or eight years. down the estimates of the cost of public works, how can the officials of the Home Affairs Department proceed to put the works in hand? They cannot take steps in that direction until the Estimates are passed, and the Government take good care that the Estimates are usually the last thing submitted to Parliament before it rises. Under our system of doing business the Estimates should be submitted the momentParliament meets, and driven right through before we do anything else. Only by such, methods will the officials of the Departments be able to carry out works which Parliament has authorized. Until the Government of the day cease to conduct public business upon lines which tend to their own immediate comfort in this House, and' transact it for the public good,, we are bound to have the distorted and strained' finance of which the country has been complaining. 1 referred to the striking discrepancy between the amount appropriated last year and the amount expended.

306,The Fault Of This Undoubtedly Mr Thomas Brown,"Well, Iresponsible for the delay; and finally, no doubt, thq information was that, although everything was ready, the Treasurer had not provided the money. That is the sort of battledore and shuttlecock administration that goes on; and I desire to know who is responsible. Despite urgent appeals, only ,£10,000 out of the £40,000 voted was spent; and I desire to know whether we may expect a similar policy to be followed in the future. there are appropriations for sundry offices, and, under this heading last year, out of the £6-,ooo voted, the sum of £2,800 was left unexpended. Much dissatisfaction has been caused in this connection; and I may say that in some of the larger offices in the country, the adoption of the condenser system of telephony has resulted in very primitive arrangements for carrying on the work. At Condobolin the telephone system is worked alongside the telegraph system, with much attendant inconvenience ; and the same remark applies to the office at Barmedman, where the public have to carry on their telephone conversations in the room devoted to the general work of the office, their conversations being heard at the public counter. As we all know, a great essential in the telephone business is privacy; and the only way to meet the public requirements is to have proper cabinets constructed. When, however, requests are made for cabinets, the reply is that there is no money to carry out the work, and the conditions under which it is carried out reflect no credit on the Department. Only during the present week I presented to the Postmaster-General a communication from the municipal council of Cowra, calling attention to the congested state of the business there, and the necessity for some reform, in the interests not only of the officers of the Department, but of the general public. I am pleased to know that the Postmaster-General is prepared to grant the requests made in this connection, and will ask the House -to grant a sum of money for the purpose. I should like to know, however, whether the work will be carried out this year. There is another item to which I should like to direct attention. There are many -farming centres, generally railway towns, which are growing in importance; and these are not like mining townships, which may disappear as mining ""gives out,"" but are substantial and progressive. In many such places it is necessary to convert offices from the non-official to the official status, Mr Thomas Brown. and the first step would be, of course, for the Department to acquire suitable sites, the selection of which, if left till later, may prove infinitely more expensive. Amongst such places are Manildra, Koorawatha, Stockinbingal, where, in the near future, there must be provided properly equipped official offices. It is not to be wondered at that, under the conditions which the Estimates disclose, there should I notice be seething dissatisfaction in the Department itself, and amongst the people more particularly affected. There is a general absence of proper administration. discussion of the Estimates affords honourable members an opportunity to keep a watchful eye on the public expenditure. The honourable member for Calare has spoken of what the Estimates disclose; but, in my opinion, the Estimates are so framed as not to disclose;, but rather to hide facts which ought to be made public; and the items immediately under discussion afford a capital illustration. We find that, of the sum of £40,332 voted in 1907, only £10,933 s expended, and, wa as a matter of ordinary business, one would expect the unexpended balance to appear as a re-vote this year. As a matter of fact, however, instead of a re-vote of the balance, we are asked to vote a smaller sum. There is a considerable shortage. Either the discussion of the Estimates for 1907 was a sham, or the present discussion is one. The only other inference to be drawn is that the Minister last year misled the Committee, I do not say intentionally, or was misled by those who framed the Estimates. If £25,000 was required in connection with twenty-one items last year, and the money could not be spent, then, because it was impossible to get out the plans in time, we should not be asked to vote only £10,000 for the same items this year. The total expenditure in connection with these twenty-one items, including re-votes, is £19,420, which is less by £1,000 than the unspent balance of the appropriations of last year. has been done this year. expending money on new works this year, although the Estimates are for new works and additions. are faked.",42,Thomson Cowper Cannot Say That The Delay In Carrying Out

310,Mr Tilley Brown,"Thes e Estimatesin his classical, Collins-street style, says that the Estimates are faked, and a shrewd man would, no doubt, take that view of them. At any rate, they disclose discrepancies which I do not understand. The mere fact that Parliament votes money does not prove the wisdom of the proposed expenditure. Does the Minister inquire of the experts who ask for the money whether the expenditure is necessary, and will give a profitable return? If , say, £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is applied for in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-General, are such questions asked ? If the directing officer of a large private business concern proposed a big expenditure, he would be called upon to show that it was necessary, and likely to be piofitable. Parliament, however seems satisfied to vote money without asking questions. When expenditure is needed, we should certainly make provision for it. But the Minister who proposes it should be armed with information by his expert advisers, showing that it is warranted. These Estimates have not been framed so that he who runs may read; a man is more likely 'to run away,from them than to read them. I ask the Minister to explain why the re-votes on one particular page are less than the balances left over from the appropriations of last year. there has been no fresh expenditure this year, or that the amount voted last year was sufficient for this year also; or are we merely voting in the dark, trusting to chance for justification ? [8.32] -Some of the remarks addressed to the Chamber since the dinner adjournment are unreasonable, honourable members overlooking the need for balancing the public accounts. Are those who have indulged in this severe criticism aware that the Treasurer hopes, by means of his manipulation of the Estimates, to balance up his accounts so that at the end of the year he will not have a penny to his credit ? balancing. the balancing trick. On almost every page of the Estimates there is evidence of manipulation, for the purpose of making the national expenditure balance the national income. I do not characterize this manipulation as dishonest. The Treasurer, however, has been compelled to pare down his proposals for expenditure in order that the total outgoing shall not exceed the one-fourth of the revenue which the Constitution permits the Commonwealth to expend. I take strong exception to the manner in which public works are now carried out. It is farcical to vote hundreds of thousands of pounds each year, knowing that the money wjll not be expended. In connection with one Department this year the re-votes total £ 9 0 , 0 0 0. But while, throughout the estimates of the Department of Home Affairs there is a continual stream of re-votes, there are no re-votes in connection with the appropriations over which the Departments concerned have direct control. For instance, there are no re-votes in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-General. of the appropriation of last year. No revotes are asked for, because the appropriation was a general one, amounts not being allotted to specific works. Considering the magnitude of the sum, the actual was very near the estimated expenditure: plaining only of the difference between the way in which money is expended by the Is it that Department of Home Affairs and by other Departments. The more we control our own public works expenditure, and the less we rely upon State assistance, the better it will be for us. Five months of the year have nearly passed, and when the Estimates are through, we shall have to seek the assistance of State officers to oversee much of the proposed expenditure. They will take up the work when they have finished the task set them by their own Governments, and if the business of their offices is congested, our applications must stand over. a good opportunity to further reproach the Commonwealth with incapacity. this system if we choose. According to the T h is is conjuring, not Minister who is representing the Minister of Home Affairs, we pay about 10 per I call it doing cent, for the oversight and control of public works by State officials.

Therefore the present system is wasteful as regards expense, and disastrous as regards delay. The situation must be faced sooner or later, because, year by year, it is getting worse instead of better.

I do not wish to indulge in any statements to the effect that, "" I told you so,"" but six years ago, I predicted, in a speech in this House, practically all that has happened regarding the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I saw then that nothing was being done to meet difficulties that were arising. ber suggested any remedy? remedy is needed. All that we require is capability at the head of the Department, and sufficient money to keep it up to date. When the Post and Telegraph Department was first taken over by the Commonwealth, we had the statement of experts that £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 was necessary to place it on a sound footing. I was ridiculed by many honourable members when I said then that we ought to face the position boldly, and that Ministers should ask for an additional vote of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , so that the Department might have a chance. As a matter of fact, it has never had a chance since its transfer. It has been going from bad to worse, until to-day we are told that an expenditure of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is necessary to place it on a proper basis. We do not know what the result in the end will be. .Certain it is that every year will find the position very much worse, and I hold that the Minister in charge of the Department must be held responsible. I am not referring particularly to the present Postmaster-General. The chief offender is the Prime Minister himself ; he is chiefly responsible for the present state of the Defence Department, as well as of the Post and Telegraph DepartI agree with ment. The honourable gentleman has allowed no Minister to remain in either of those Departments long enough to make himself conversant with what needs to be done. For six years we have had a pro. cession of Ministers, through what are, perhaps, the two most important administrative offices in the Commonwealth. No Minister has remained long enough in either of them to enable him to gather up the threads of the difficulties which there present themselves, and the result is that they have simply been shelved.. Meantime, the policy of the Post and Telegraph Department, I shall come up to the peniwhen any demand in the House has become clamant, has been to make a proposal for reducing by a shilling or two the prices, charged for certain services rendered. Whodoes not remember the statement, made from time to time by the ex-Postmaster General, that he would not be satisfied unt i l the people were able to secure a telephone service for is. per week? The officers of the Department are now telling, us that the telephone service is too cheap; that it is not commercially profitable. Is it not the height of absurdity-is it no: almost a national disaster-that Ministers should play with the interests of the country, as they have been doing, in connection with the Department ? Where are we to obtain any improvement ? I see no prospect of any. This Department can earn money if*it is permitted to do so. It can balance its own ledger very readily, if the Minister in charge of it is permitted to put it ona commercial basis. I am not arguing that that should be done. The Department, I know, has a developmental as well as a money making function. to the f u l l , but there must be reason in all' things. Since the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth, it has lost on its transactions nearly £2,500,000. The total debit shown in the balance-sheet, since the Department was transferred, is about £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , but if we add to that interest year by year, since the date of transfer, we find that the debit is nearer £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 than £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , as stated by the Postmaster-General.

For myself, I have no complaint to make on behalf of my own electorate, the Postmaster-General having seen the f u l l force of the representations made to him in favour of increased accommodation and facilities. This is a Department which enters into the daily life of every man, woman, and child, whatever position they may occupy; and there ought to be, at any rate, greater continuity of method and policv. The present Postmaster-General is following one who energetically endeavoured to f u l f i l the important duties of his position : but we have had so many Postmasters-General, with changes of policy, that the Department is not now in anything -like proper working order. facilities should be increased and perfected ; and that can only be brought about by the Government grappling the question in a business-like manner, and letting the country and the House know whether it is the postal branch, the telegraph branch, or the telephone branch which is a drain on the resources. pleaded for a segregation of the accounts so that we might be enabled to obtain specific information on this point; but at the present time, notwithstanding promises that have been made, we are entirely in the dark.

It is evident that the whole system is wrong; and we all must bear the responsibility. For myself I do not see why the Works Estimates should not be proceeded with before the Financial Statement, as would be done in any ordinary business concern. I suppose that we have copied the States in beginning our financial year on the ist July, but it seems to me tiiat it would be more convenient in many respects to commences it on the ist January. We have a number of very able and intelligent men in high positions in the Department of Home Affairs, and, other Departments, and there ought to be no lack of suggestions to enable us to get over our difficulties. We here are supposed to be the cream of the intelligence of the Parliaments of die country; and we ought to be able to show the States an example and evolve some better plan; and inci-dently I may point out that we have had Royal Commissions and Select Committees to investigate much less important questions. Although there are amongst honourable members a number of able financiers, we have not been able to evolve a practical scheme of getting our works carried -out in reasonable time. Wales the Commonwealth works are carried ' out by the States officials, who very naturally are expected to see to the work of the State first. The Commonwealth work is a sort of extra job, and the system is byno means working satisfactorily. It would appear as though we should have to establish a Works Department of our own, because it is too much to expect from human nature that the States officers shall attend to the Commonwealth business first. There is not such a friendly feeling on the part -of the Mother State to the Commonwealth as we would desire, although, of course, I do not presume to say that that has any influence on the officers' who have to carry -out our public works. In any case, our works are delayed, and , as a matter of 1 fact, appear to be forgotten. highly desirable that we should have -officers of our own, whom we could hold responsible to the Commonwealth, .and to the Commonwealth only. seems to me that the present method is unbusinesslike, and should be altered. WeI do not know how might, perhaps, deal with the Works Estimates before discussing the financial statement as a whole. It might be well to decide, in the first instance, what works are absolutely necessary, and then provide money for them. In this way a considerable amount of time might be gained. In any case, there must be delay; but the delays now are disgraceful, and it is not surprising that the public is disgusted. The promise is made that a certain work will be carried out when the Estimates are passed, but after that nothing is done. In one town in my electorate the local people have spent money in providing wire and poles for a telephone connection; but the Department has not performed its part of the contract. These people would not have spent their money had they known that so much delay would occur. There are many minor works, for which only general provision need be made by Parliament. I hope that the Commission of inquiry will make some suggestions in this matter. A Department like that of the Postmaster General should be given a considerable sum out of which to provide for minor works. At present it suffers considerably from lack of funds, not only in the carrying out of urgent works, but even in regard to the manning of offices. I have already complained that, in one instance, an office is being run almost by boys, the letters being In New South delivered by contract until recently, when the contractor went on strike, because he was not receiving enough pay. It should not be necessary to wait until the financial proposals of the Government have been discussed at length to get authority for necessary expenditure. My suggestion is that the Works Estimates should be brought forward at the beginning of the financial year, questions of finance being dealt with later. At present, officers are often asked to carry out works in anticipation of parliamentary approval, and there is always the risk that Parliament may not sanction these works. The criticism of these Estimates forces one to two conclusions, that the spending Departments should hustle more to get works It is constructed, and that the Department of the Postmaster-General is in need of more funds.

It was erected during the State regime. The building is unsuitable for so large an area. I see no item on the Estimates for an enlargement, however. It would be a serious mistake not to enlarge the building. The population of the district is growing rapidly. Houses are demanded faster than they can be erected. I am certain that the Postmaster General could obtain f u l l value for the present building, and could easily choose a It was pointed out that it Suitable site for a new one.

458,Mr Bowden (Nepean) [10.47],"in consequence of the unforeseen expansion of business, 'and on account of demands for money by the Post and Telegraph Department. Amongst other items, there was one for the construction of special telephone lines from Sydney to Woollongong, Sydney to Katoomba, and Sydney to Gosford. It was stated that unless an expenditure of £52,5.58 was incurred, it would be impossible to complete essential works in New South Wales. A little further on the Treasurer stated that there was no doubt that a great deal of the work asked for was of an urgent nature, and that it was very desirable that it should be undertaken during the present financial year. He made a reference to the Treasurer's Advance Account, out of which the money would be paid. In his statement he saidI make this statement now, in order that Parliament may understand the situation, and not be surprised if additional estimates for new works and buildings to the amount of about j£i20,ooo are introduced. In the meantime, unless any very strong objection is taken I shall anticipate authorizing such works as appear to me to be of the most urgent character. I desire to keep the expenditure, if possible, within the limit expressed in my Budget speech. On the 13th December, 1907, the Treasurer said that these works were of such an urgent character that he could not wait for' any Supplementary passed-they following April-but in hand at once. orable gentleman the other day, on the motion for adjournment, whether the construction of the trunk line to Katoomba was being proceeded with, he said ""No."" I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether provision for the construction of three special trunk' lines for New South Wales-from Sydney to Katoomba, and from Sydney to Gosford-is £49,rot, ment ' intends to proceed with the works which his officers have reported are of an urgent character. were not included in last year's Estimates, the Treasurer considered them so urgent that he made, as I have shown, a special statement to the House in, reference to them, and proposed to proceed with them in anticipation of the vote of the House. With the passing of time, the urgency has not decreased, but has rather increased. Mr Bowden. ready stated that the works are not provided for on these Estimates; but that, if possible, more money will be advanced to the Department for the purpose of carrying them out. They have been put on the list of urgent works required, but are not provided for. It has been stated to-day that in order to carry out urgent works, such as have been mentioned, the Department would require an appropriation of £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but it is not possible to make that provision at this juncture. [10.54] -The honourable member for Parramatta mentioned how his electorate had suffered at the hands of the Department, owing to its inability to meet the great needs of his constituents, although it was in close touch with the city. If that is the case with respect to an old-settled electorate, what is it in the case of those electorates which would each include the whole of the electorates round Sydney, and leave a lot of room to spare? Take, for the approval of Parliament by instance, my electorate, which extends from near Dubbo to Cootamundra, and from near Mount McDonald to near Euabalong, an immense area of country which practically comprises the wheat growing belt of the State. Settlement is extending rapidly there, and provision of this character is required in order to bring Estimates to be the settlers in touch with larger centres, were not passed until the and thus enable them to conduct their busiwanted to put them ness. During the last twelve months, the When I asked the honcomplaint has been that, whilst the Sydney postal authorities have recognised the needs of these centres, and are satisfied that the extension of telegraph and telephonic communication which was asked for would be a good paying proposition to the Department, still they have not been able to act, because the necessary money Sydney to Woollongong, from had not been provided for them.

460,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare>,"r alleged that no money was available. Only recently I brought before the Department 0 proposal to construct a line between Cudal ancl Manildra, which -is very urgently required, to provide telegraphic and telephonic communication, and the reply was that the work had been considered and approved, but could not be carried out until Parliament had made the necessary provision. Let me now take the next item, "" Construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including the construction of conduits and placing -wires underground."" propriation was £ 7 9 , 9 1 1 , and the expenditure was £ 8 3 , 1 7 9 , or £ 3 , 2 6 8 in excess of the appropriation. While that was so, and a large number of applications are held up awaiting the provision of funds, still, on these Estimates, it is proposed to appropriate only £ 4 9 , 1 0 1 , or about £ 3 4 , 0 0 0 less than was spent last year. very important Department, in a very vital -direction so far as settlement is concerned, is asked to be satisfied in the coming year with about £ 3 4 , 0 0 0 less than was expended last year; ancl with that increased expenditure, last year a large number of applications from country centres -had -lot read, would bring home this grievance very strongly to the Minister; but I shall -content myself with reading two communications. General in Sydney, I received a communication saying that an application for a telephone exchange at Koorawatha hacl practically been approved; but he goes on to sayI may add, however, that even if the establishment of the exchange mentioned was approved of the question as to when the work -could be carried out would depend on the provision by Parliament of funds for new works -of this class. Still, in face of that statement, we are asked to vote nearly £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 less than was expended last year. Here is another communication, which I handed to the Postmaster-General a few days ago. It relates to a proposal which has been under consideration for a very considerable time. At. 'last, when the writer had got fairly desperate over the matter, he wrote in these termsIn Teply to your communication re telephone from Con'doblin lo Bobadah, I have to point out -that you have taken about eight months to give a reply, and at this rate of progress it would take about 80 years to build the line, if you live long enough to decide to do so. You estimate the cost of construction at £i,7S<o, but I would like you to understand that it is not a heavy line of railway we are asking for. The writer goes on to suggest that the Postmaster-General might allow that community to construct the line, and use it for twenty years, when they would be prepared to hand it over to the Department, provided that they were allowed to utilize all the revenue it earned during that period. That is a sample of the correspondence which honourable members receive and forward to Last year the apthe Department,, as the outcome of the policy which has been pursued during the past few years. I am considerably disappointed with the provision made on this year's Estimates. able member voted that the Budget was satisfactory. The honourable member knows that the motion to which he refers was moved with the object of consolidating the opponents of the Labour movement in this House. kind. to be held up.

I must express my dissatisfaction at the arrangements that are being made. I hope that supplementary Estimates will be submitted so that the bare needs of this side of the Department may be supplied. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [ n . 2 ] I wish to enter a protest on lines similar to those which have been adopted by the honourable member for Calare in regard to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I have in mv electorate a business man who has been endeavouring for six or seven months to have 'his premises connected with the telephone exchange.
