[ 3 7 ] I hope that in acknowledgment of: 2 this generous treatment by the Opposition, Ministers will, when the Bill is hefcru us, have a little more information to givethan we were able to get last night, when I had to protest quite a number' of times, about the paucity of the information available. Never in my parliamentary careerhave I known Ministers to have so little in formation to give in explanation of Works Estimates. If Ministers themselves pos sessed the information, they suppressed it j . but in some cases I had to correct misleading statements made by the Minister at the table. sheer ignorance. Misleading information: was given by the Minister of Home AfTaiTs,. who did not know anything about the matters with which he was dealing. There should at least be made available to members the official explanations which always accompany Estimates, so that we may have details respecting the proposals for which we are asked to vote money. ter and Treasurer) [2.39] I recognise thecourtesy extended to the Government ins allowing this motion to be moved without notice; but similar courtesy has been extended to every Government in regard to this B ill ; and on many occasions the Works and Buildings Estimates and the Bill have been passed through the House at one sitting.

9,Mr West,"I draw the attention of'Sydney, which appears in this morning's Argus, in which it is stated that over 100 cadets were prosecuted yesterday at the Paddington CourtAt the outset Mr Payten, S.M., asked if any instructions had been received by the military authorities from head-quarters in Melbourne as 10 what action should be taken in such cases in future. He understood that some instructions of the kind had been received in Brisbane, but he had not heard, of any having come to Sydney. Mr Magney, who appeared for the prosecution in a number of the cases, said that he was not aware that any instructions had been received. He suggested that in each case defendant should be ordered to f u l f i l the duty in whicli hope to-morrow, respecting the cases rehe had made default. In the majority of the cases dealt with this course was followed, the costs being fixed at 13s. A similar paragraph has appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. It is understood that the Minister of Defence issued the instruction that these prosecutions should not continue. Has the Honorary Minister any information to give us on the subject? graph referred to by the honourable member, and, if its statements are correct, there is some misunderstanding in New South Wales regarding prosecutions. tions were sent out some time ago to the District Commandants, directing that prosecutions be shaped in conformity with the provisions of the Bill that has passed the Senate and is now before honourable members. The instructions were clear and definite, and to the effect that where a lad had put in fifty-four of the sixty-four hours required for the year's drill, and would give his personal undertaking to do the remaining ten hours, no prosecution of any kind should be commenced; though, if he would not give that undertaking, some action was necessary. Where cadets were more than ten hours short, prosecutions were to take place, but in such cases the magistrate was to be specifically requested to accept the personal assurances of the lads that they would put in the necessary time, and then no punishment or fine of any description was to be inflicted. In addition, it was an instruction of the Minister that no legal assistance should be given. Furthermore, the Attorneys-General of the -States were asked by our Attorney-General to communicate the wishes of this Government to their magistrates. The Attorneys General of five States agreed to do this, -but the Attorney-General of South Australia refused point blank to convey any such message to the magistrates of that State. jection has been taken on several occasions to Executive instructions of the kind. that. The instructions to the District Commandants were quite clear. The Minister has communicated by telephone with the District Commandant of New South Wales, who stated that he had received the instructions some time ago, and had immediately issued them to his responsible officers. A report will be forthcoming, I ferred to by the honourable member. senting the Minister of Defence make inquiries as to whether it is usual for the Department to request the Bench to exercise its discretion in a particular way, and whether the proper course is not to instruct the person prosecuting not to ask for the heavier penalties? the practice, but the persons prosecuting were directed to ask for leniency in the direction mentioned by myself. caution, so that there should be no possir bility of error, the State Attorneys-General were requested, through the Attorney-General's Department, to allow the matter to. come under the notice of the several magistrates. replies were received complying with the rer quest, which was merely an act of courtesy, and in no sense a direction or order. There is no complaint against the State which has not replied. lieving the magistrates of any suggestion of refusing to enforce the Federal law in cadet prosecutions, would it. not be possible to. expedite the passage of the proposed legislation to mitigate the penalties? so far as the magistrates are concerned;: what was done was merely as an extra precaution. The instructions to the prosecuting officers in the various States were most clearSo far as expediting the passage of the legislation is concerned, my answer is that the Minister is most anxious that this should"" be done.

92,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes)' [3.18].,"go to a remote and tropical district. We have taken over from South Australia railways that we are running at a loss, but no proposal has been made for extending the line from Pine Creek either immediately or in the future. If Australia were a national Crcesus a liability of ;£i 1,000,000 might not give us any great concern, but to a young country this is a very large matter. The people would be astonished if they knew that the Government have no definite policy in regard to the Northern Territory. If there is a policy, we should know it, and should have an opportunity to criticise it before a penny is spent on the Northern Territory. to endorse a policy, money should not be expended there. The honourable member for Darling_ Downs made a reference to the Queensland railway gauge, but I hope that Ministers will not promise to depart from the standard gauge which we have resolved shall apply to all the railways constructed or controlled by the Commonwealth. The State of New South Wales happens to have adopted the 4 f t . 8^-in. gauge, which is recognised by engineers throughout the world as the standard gauge, and is used by most of the big railway companies. turning against that gauge. other gauge, and Victoria is the world to the honourable member, but in the ordinary acceptation, of the term the world's standard gauge is the 4 f t . 8 J-in. gauge, which is therefore more economical and convenient than any other. the Government will not be beguiled by the representation of any State to depart from that gauge. tory question was under discussion, it was suggested that the South Australian Government should be asked to sanction a deviation of the transcontinental railway to the justification there is for the change of east, so that it might pass through land of a better quality than would be traversed by a direct route, and might be connected with the Queensland, New South Wales, and Victorian systems at less expense. Of what is to be done in that matter we have heard nothing. many small enterprises the Government shows great activity, it has allowed months to pass without formulating a policy regarding an undertaking which commits the country to an expenditure equalling half-ayear's revenue. maintaining railways on which it loses money. I hope that Ministers will take the matter up, and say definitely for the information of the public what they intend to do. a very tempting opportunity to discuss the Northern Territory, but I do not intend to do so on this occasion I desire merely to call the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to the fact that, according to the answer given to a question to-day, a new regulation has been issued raising the qualification of an official office from a revenue of Until Parliament is prepared ^200 to a revenue of ,£300. When the question of penny postage was before us, the present Minister of External Affairs promised that country post-offices would not suffer as a result of any reduction in the revenue, and that ^200 would be the maximum required to establish an official office. I do not know who is responsible for the new arrangement, but it is a distinct breach of faith and a grave injustice to country districts and sparsely-populated areas. It is difficult enough to attain to an official office with revenue of jQzoo, and 0 the difficulty, of course, is intensified if the maximum is increased. I do not intend to let this matter rest, because I believe there is a majority of honourable members who agree that the new regulation is an absolute imposition. cise of the official mind ! the official mind should be curtailed. If we have a statement from the MinisterI hope that that country offices are to be placed at no disadvantage as a result of penny postage, no official outside this House should have When the Northern Territhe right to reverse the policy stated on behalf of the Government. If the new arrangement is the outcome of the Government's policy, I should like to know what front ?

A very large expenditure is going on, and the Government ought to adopt some definite plan.

We have resumed 85,000 acres of land; and as there will doubtless be a big revenue presently, some policy ought to be laid down. There is some doubt in regard to the route of the railway from the Capital to Jervis Bay, and representations have been made to the effect that by an alteration of the route nearer to Braidwood, there could be tapped a big timber country with large deposits of coal. Strong statements have been made regarding the resources from which electric power can be obtained; and it is contended that sufficient power can be obtained from the Shoalhaven River near Marulan to supply the Capital and all the railways. Who is going to fix the route of the railways? ister, or are we to have these public works supervised and investigated as in some of the States. We have been going. along in a very haphazard way, leaving everything to the Minister. The honourable gentleman is, of course, advised by his Secretary, but that gentleman resides in Melbourne, and visits the Territory only once a month'. He or some other official ought to be kept in the Territory all the time, because the works there are sufficient bunal shall be appointed. to warrant the supervision of one or more men. There ought to be some Committee or Commission appointed. Committees! be better to have a number of Committees than to go on in the way we are now going. Is the Prime Minister, with his reputation have time to give ail these matters their for caution, satisfied with our present method under which no one seems to assume absolute responsibility? Wild charges are made of men being intoxicated, and not doing their work. ber believe the charges? but the Government ought to be in a position to refute them. futed some of the charges. so, but is it reasonable to accuse men of being intoxicated when there is no liquor within the area? slander on the working men, and the charges are mere electioneering claptrap ! no doubt that men, whether working on day labour or under contract, will have a whisky if they can get it ; but, as I say, I do not believe these charges. The Minister of Home Affairs has done, and is doing, good work; but I object to his being a king not only in name, but in reality-to his being in a position where he has simply to wave his hand, and say, "" Doi t , "" and the thing is done. Notwithstanding all the hard things that are said about the honourable gentleman, I believe he has done good work, and .approached this matter in a business-like way; but he ought to be relieved of some of his present responsibility. He has enough ' to do to look after the work at his office, Has it to be the Mhv and, as I said before, there ought to be a Committee of some kind appointed. At present, I am a sort of unofficial representative in this House of the people of the Capital area. At the present time no one can say when those who have sold their landwill get their money. Under the Act, they have to go to the High Court to get the values fixed, if they are not satisfied ; but the Prime Minister has promised that some sort of intermediary local trithem in trying to get a final decision. but they are being embarrassed by the delay, which is serious in view of the fact that many of them desire to make fresh homes. We cannot expect the Prime Minister or the Minister of Home Affairs to personal attention, and, though they no doubt mean to carry out their promises, their hands are too full already. If necessary, let us make the Minister a Commissioner; at any rate, let us.have some local government in the Capital area. As I say, there is some doubt whether the railway to Jervis Bay. ought not to tap some big timber country which is spoken of.

171,Mr Austin Chapman,"Thehave the same rights and privileges as those in other parts of the Commonwealth. the Commonwealth Bank there? the Prime Minister has that in his mind now. He says very fairly that he will meet any genuine cases that arise. It is a great anomaly that 2,000 people living in the Federal Territory should be Ishmaelites, as it were. They have to apply to the Minister of Home Affairs to know what they are to pay for water or lighting, and they have nothing settled. A man inside the Federal Territory does not know what he is to get for his land, who is to fix the values, whether he will have to go to the High Court to fight the matter if he does not like the values, or when he will be paid, which, after millions have been wasted, and at the same time he cannot go anywhere else. This matter must affect us as Australians, because it involves a great principle. I urge the Government to do something to give these men, not only representation, but some consideration in the shape of a definite policy, .so that .they will not orable member mean? be handicapped in any way, or have withheld from them the privileges which other citizens enjoy. -The interest displayed in the welfare of the Northern Territory by honourable members opposite, and more particularly by the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Parkes, must be refreshing to the House and gratifying to the residents of the Northern Territory, as well as to all who are anxious for its advancement. Standing by itself, it would appear to be very good, but we have had the further information given to us that an agreement has been made by the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, under which it' is intended to construct in New South Wales a 4-ft. 8£-in. line, to connect with the Queensland system, so that ample opportunity will be afforded for the trade of the Northern Territory to ""flow to its nearest port,"" and so forth. This information is deeply interesting, and I hope that it will be very carefully considered by the Government when they are determining their policy iii regard to the Northern Territory. As to what that policy is to be, we have only the very slight indication furnished by the appearance on these Estimates of an item of ,£5,00.0 to provide for a survey for a proposed extension' of the Pine Creek railway to the Katherine RiverI do not [79] say that the Government have made up their minds in. this respect, but straws in the air sometimes indicate which way the wind is blowing. WhatI do hope is that there will be no"" scheming on the part of any of the States to obtain an advantage in respect of the trade of the Territory before the Territory itself is opened up. In the interests, not only of the Northern Territory, but of Australia as a whole, it is essential that the Territory should first of all be opened up and developed. I do not think it is going to be a sink for Commonwealth moneys, as the honourable member for Echuca has suggested; but it certainly will be if the State Rights' brigade ""gerrymander '' a policy for the purpose of diverting a trade that -is not yet created, but would probably be enjoyed by certain States against the interests of the rest of the Commonwealth. That sort of game is very amusing. much anxiety on the part of some members of the Opposition that, having regard to the arrangements that are being made between New South Wales and Queensland, the Territory railway line shall start from the north, and not in the south, where we have the highlands. rangement between New South Wales and Queensland. . . member is one of the most innocent men in Australia; but I am very glad that the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Parkes, in their thirst for knowledge, have given us the valuable information to which I have alluded. I sound a note of warning to the people of Australia, and earnestly appeal to the House to get above State Rights scheming, and to determine that the Territory shall be opened up in the interests of Australia as a whole. [4.0] I have no doubt that my honourable friend is very earnest, and very honest, straightforward, and outspoken. In short, I have no* doubt that he is the one man in the House who takes a ""broad national view "" of all these questions. Every one knows, however, that he has an eye on his own State all the time.

In other words I would get about me the best ability I could command in the continent for the purpose of making proper surveys, and investigating the country through which those surveys passed. My honourable friend may well leave the Opposition alone in this matter. find that they are as patriotic as he is. He will find that they are just as ready as he is to observe the broad lines of the bargain that has been made with his own State-and made, as I think, much to the advantage of South Australia. He certainly will not promote his cause by making insinuations and attributing unworthy motives to men who are as anxious as he is that the Territory shall be developed on right lines, and quite as anxious as he is to do the best for the Commonwealth which we are all here to serve. been rather struck by the attack made this, afternoon by honourable members of the Opposition on the administration of the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Echuca began by attacking the Government for expending any money whatever in the Territory, and he was followed by the honourable member for Parkes, Who complained very bitterly of the fact that this Parliament had made itself responsible for an indebtedness of £11,000,000 in respect of the taking of that'Territory from South Australia. This Government has had control of the Territory for practically only twelve months, and is endeavouring now to do what the Tories, Liberals, and Fusions of South Australia neglected to do in the past. The honourable member for Parkes expects this Government to say in detail what it is going to do with a Territory whose area is, I suppose, .fifteen times more could the Opposition have done, had [79]2 that of Victoria, but, as a matter of fact, The very first we are proceeding in a business-like way, and are providing for works necessary for its settlement and progress. Objection has been taken to the proposal to expend I should select the best men I £4,000 on a railway survey, but the remaining ,£50,000 odd is for works that are urgently needed, which the Tories of the past have neglected to carry out. The expenditure proposed is to make ready for the reception of a population. That is the first ,step to take.. The sum of £3,000 is to be spent on additions to buildings, while for the Darwin Hospital £1,650 is asked; for artesian water bores, £2,000; for houses for Government employees, .£21,000; for quarters for the guard of the gaol at Fanny Bay, £ 6 2 5 ; for workshops and fittings, £ 1 , 1 0 0; for the survey of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, £ 4 , 2 0 0; for the erection and equipment of a steam laundry, £1,000; for a new public school at Darwin, £ 1 , 5 0 0; for another school at He will Brock's Creek, £ 3 6 5 ; for a police station, £ 5 0 0 ; for a court-house and warden's office at Pine Creek, £ 6 0 0 ; for a public works store, £ 4 , 0 0 0; for additional office accommodation, £ 4 , 0 0 0; and for well sinking and water conservation, ,£3,000. Are not all these, and the other undertakings which are provided for, necessary? Is population to flock to the Northern Territory and no provision to be made for it? The Government has engaged a Geologist, a Director of Lands, a Chief Surveyor and staff, an Administrator, and a Judge, and is now looking for an Inspector of Mines. It has also sent a doctor to Darwin, to clean up the pestilence that the Liberals, Tories, and Fusions of the past handed over to us with the Territory. WhatI have heard of in that connection is not fit to describe. This Government is accused of having no policy, but it knows its duty, and is endeavouring to make Port Darwin a little cleaner. Sydney. who have been to Port Darwin what has taken place there is shocking, and thi» state of things remained while the Territory was under the control of the Government of South Australia.

187,Mr Jensen,"To hear from personshave done half as much. Members opposite sat on the Ministerial benches for ten years, but it was necessary for this Government to come into power to accomplish the taking over of the Territory. We are blamed for not proposing large expenditure on railways in the Northern Territory, and, at the same time, the Fusion press is attacking the Labour party for its extravagance. critics opposite? The honourable member for Parkes desires the 4-ft. 8j in. gauge, ; while the honourable member for Darling Downs wishes for a 3-ft. 6-in gauge for the railways of the Territory. The Government has done all that it can in the time at its disposal. It has appointed experts to report as to the best means of developing the Territory, and next year, if still in power, as I believe it will be, it will have proposals to make to Parliament. If the Government formulated a policy before its experts had made inquiries, and furnished reports and recommendations, the Opposition would declare that that policy wanted ground to sustain it. Honourable members opposite appear to me to talk for the sake of talking. They accuse us of not spending enough, and, in the same breath, with being too lavish. What can we do to please them? There does not seem to me to be reason for the heat which Ministerial supporters are displaying in the discussion of this matter. should have heard the honourable member for Parramatta. very warm speech from the other side. It is the unanimous desire of honourable members that a policy for the development of the Northern Territory should be formulated at the earliest moment on a sound basis. We all recognise tlie enormous responsibility devolving on us in this matter; but, like the honourable member for Parramatta, I must protest against proposals for expenditure about which we have no information, especially the proposal to spend money on railways. We have already had occasion to complain of the adoption of a system of land tenure without regard to the opinions of Parliament, and now we are being committed to a railway policy which, so far as we know, forms no part of a general scheme of development and settlement. Railways, of course, are necessary, but the money will be wasted if they are not constructed in accordance with a definite scheme. It has been contended by South Australian representatives that a transcontinental line should be constructed through their State, while many other honourable members think that the Territory would be better served by a line going through the eastern States. This conflict of opinion is evidence of the need for an investigation by an independent body, which could make reHow can we please our commendations on the subject to Parliament. tion are always asking for Boards and Committees. public money should take place only after a proper investigation of the proposals of the Government. point high-salaried officers to report to us if, in addition, we are to appoint Boards of Inquiry? in the Territory specially qualified to report on a scheme for its development. there. report on particular questions.

This Territory is part of our Commonwealth properties, and it has been stated by some honourable members that there is a chance of developing an agricultural community there.

I wish particularly to call attention to the extraordinary position in which citizens of both the Federal and the Northern Territory are placed in regard to representation.

The majority must rule in every part of this country, and I look forward with interest to a statement by the Minister in regard to these two points. There seems to be a constant moaning on the part of the Opposition. I do not know of one matter that has been brought before the House this session concerning which the Opposition have not ftomplained that the information furnished is insufficient to enable them to come to an intelligent decision. There certainly must have been a Caucus on the subject, otherwise they would not have sung their song as well as they have done.

I desire, in the first place,, to refer to the Commonwealth Woollen' Mills, concerning which a great storm was raised last night. A cursory glance at the Estimates should indicate to an intelligent man that the work of providing these mills has just been entered upon-that a certain portion of the buildings is to be erected, and that portion of the machinery is to be installed to enable operations to be commenced as soo.i as possible. ' It is evident that it is not proposed to refrain from doing any work until the whole building has been erected, and a vast quantity of machinery has been installed. The desireis, I take it, to start in a small way and toadd gradually to the buildings, plant, and' machinery. Coming to another question, I would remind honourable members that the development of Australia was due, not so> much to squatting or farming interests as to I the discovery of gold, which led to a great influx of population, and gave an impetus to the whole country^ I am one of those who believe that one of the best things that could happen to the Northern Territory O'MALLEY -Colone l Miller would be fresh discoveries of gold-bearingreefs and other mineral deposits in that vast area; and I hope that the Government Geologist, Dr. Jensen, who is a man of very high standing in his profession, will soon surround himself with a capable staff of practical miners, and at once set out. for a practical miner to assist him. statement, for, whilst I am inclined to pay very considerable deference to the views of a geologist, I have even greater faith in a practical miner.

I am inclined to pay considerable attention to the views expressed by the representatives of South Australia in this regard, and to believe that the developferred, and I trust that he will take them ment of the Territory will be more rapid if we start from the south rather than from the north. I do not suggest that we should neglect the north, but I understand that -he proposed extension of the Pine Creek railway to the Katherine will run directly south along what would be the ordinary route to be followed, whether there was any deviation or not. In this regard, however, I am looking to the development of not only the Northern Territory, but Central Australia, and the best way to develop Central Australia, as well as the Terrftory, is to construct a line as nearly as possible down the centre of the Territory, provided that there are no insuperable engineering difficulties in the way. Such a line would develop not only the Territory, but the eastern portion of Western Australia. I hold the view that, in the far east of Western Australia, there is untold mineral wealth, and a line running through the Territory from north to south, with branch lines running both east and west, would do more to develop Central Australia than any other scheme of which I know. Reference has been made this afternoon by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to the want of banking facilities in the Federal Territory. The honourable member takes a keen interest in the Territory, and, in passing, I may say that I think that one way of getting over the difficulty in regard to the non-British settlement cannot show a more disrepresentation of residents of the Federal Territory in this Parliament would be to attach that area to an adjacent constituency. I am satisfied that in that way residents of class and type? the Federal Territory would be as well represented as they would be if they had separate representation in this House. As the result of the transfer of the Federal Territory to the Commonwealth, the State Savings Bank, we are informed, is not now carrying oh business there, and cannot renew .loans made by it to local land-owners prior to the transfer. splendid opportunity to establish there a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. There are a number of workmen in the Federal Capital, and we should afford 1 have not yet them every facility to place their savings in safe keeping. We should also give some consideration to local residents who have borrowed money from the State Savings Bank, and who, because of the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, cannot obtain a renewal of their loans. I wish to impress upon the Minister the importance of the three points to which I have reinto consideration. The Government would have done much better than they have if , before making any proposal for expending money in the Northern Territory, they had submitted to the House a complete schedule setting forth a definite policy. I also take the view that they would have acted more in the interests of the Territory had they started the work of development from the south. We have had submitted to u j reports to the effect that there are exceedingly valuable agricultural, pastoral, and mineral areas in the vicinity of the MacDonnell Ranges, and with such reports before us, we could not make a greater mistake than that which we are now committing. The attempt to develop the Territory from the north has been responsible for the failure that has hitherto been experienced. It is the one mistaken policy that has resulted in one of the greatest failures in the history of British settlement. We have there an indebtedness of £3,500 per head of the white residents of the Territory, and that gives us an expenditure of ,£144,000 per annum in .respect of interest. The Governrtient are adding one-third more to this indebtedness, and this, capitalized, brings the indebtedness per head of the white population up to nearly £4,500.

258,Mr Thomas,Did they sit on this side,35,Chapman The As He Has Promised To Do The Common
259,Mr Mcwilliams,"No; but, withmonths, they have sat on the Government side of the House ever since I have been a member. The policy of successive South Australian Governments has ended in disastrous failure, because of the attempt to settle the Territory from the fever, the malarial, and the tick or tropical zone. They have overlooked the fact that rich and valuable land is to be tapped from the south, where we have, comparatively speaking, the temperate zone of Australia. The Territory would derive very much greater advantage from the construction of a line starting from the south, and. working in a northerly direction, than it will do by a continuance of the disastrous policy under which an attempt has been made to settle the Territory from its more tropical norththat it was accompanied by the condition ern extremity. I was one of those who opposed the taking over of the Northern Territory from South Australia, because I felt that the Commonwealth was making a very bad bargain; but having assumed responsibility for the Territory, no good puimoney on the development of the temperate pose will be served by imitating the mistakes of South Australia. We are, however, following the example of that State by continuing the policy which has brought about the present condition of affairs. We have sent to the Northern Territory a large batch of highly-paid officers, but have not attempted to induce one white settler to go there. hammer for the cracking of nuts. At an expenditure of over £60,000 a year, the Northern Territory is to be governed by officials. of colonization. have sent to the Territory nearly a dozen highly-paid officers. fifteen times as great as that of Victoria. population of only 1,000 white persons. The indebtedness of the Northern Territory is £3,500 per head of the white population, and to that this . Government has added one-third without increasing the tax-paying population in the least; all those whom it has sent to the Northern Territory are a burden on the taxpayers. Honourable members opposite are as dissatisfied with the way in which these Estiof absurdity was reached when a market mates have been put before us as we are. The honourable member for Hindmarsh knows that the policy of settling the Terrion these Estimates has been unusually long, tory at its northern end is condemned throughout his ""own State, but he will do nothing to remedy the disaster brought about by South Australian methods. But instead of dealing fairly and squarely with the position, he played the part of the squid, that unsavoury fish which, when disturbed, ejects an inky fluid, under cover of which it tries to escape. He tried to make out that there is a conspiracy to depart from the arrangement with South Australia in regard to railway construction. The honourable member for Grey knows that I have stated publicly and privately that I consider that the Commonwealth is pledged to construct the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. One of the reasons why. I opposed the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth was that the line should be taken from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. Being now bound to construct that line, it would be a common-sense course to commence its construction at the southern end, spending our lands of the Territory, where something like, comparatively speaking, closer settlement may be possible. The leasing of the Territory to squatters will not materially increase its population. For half a century a great part of the land there has been held under pastoral lease; but the work of the stations is done largely We are providing a steam by aboriginals who, although disinclined for ordinary work, make fairly good stockmen. If practically all the Territory were under pastoral lease, its population would not be much increased. But in. the temperate region near the Macdonnell Ranges, there is a hope of settling the We country. Before we spend a shilling on railway construction, we should have a full and definite scheme of railway development put before us, and should proceed in accordance with that scheme. Short lines like that from Darwin to Pine Creek will do little for the development of the country. Nothing much is to be expected from continuing that line for a few miles. All that will be done will be to add to the enormous indebtedness of the Territory, and to increase the army of officials who merely help each other to do nothing,, from the geologist to those employed in the steam laundry.

It is the practice -of every Parliament for Ministers to inform .members fully regarding their works pro.posals, and not one item should be passed until members have obtained from Ministers :the explanation they require regarding it. In this case, we have had no information .as to the purposes for which money is asked, -or as to the ultimate cost of works towards which we have been asked to vote money. 'We have been expected to vote blindfold. If the supporters of the Government were on this side, they would be as eager as we are for information. Why has it been refused? Is it because the departmental officers have not supplied it to Ministers, or because the Jatter wish to bludgeon through their proposals without regard to what we may say, -or what the public may think?

Our expenditure on Defence per head of population puts us at the head of the list, and the efficiency of our fighting force at the bottom of it. The Defence vote will have to be taken in hand before very long by one side of the House or the other. One matter mentioned by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro requires consideration. Some of the small landholders in the Federal Territory. may be placed in a very awkward position owing . to the fact that they have borrowed money from the New South Wales Savings Bank, which is not permitted to advance money on any lands out of the State. This presents a chance for the Federal Government to establish their Savings Bank in the Federal Territory, and take up the position held by the State Savings Bank prior to the transfer. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Did not the honourable member hear the Prime Minister assure the House that consideration would be given to every case? should be done at once, because, as the loans are falling due, the settlers may, as I say, be placed in an exceedingly awkward position. In regard to the Federal Territory, I hope the House will pause before committing itself to any railway extension from the north, but will rather decide to continue the line from the south, where there is, at any rate, a chance of has been as earning some revenue. notice that no expenditure is proposed for armament at North Head, Sydney, and Goode Island, although that line remains in the Estimates. Evidently the Government do not intend to spend any money whatever in fortifying North Head, although we know that, according to the military authorities, it is most desirable that it should be fortified. Last year £5,000 was voted, and apparently, .£5,000 was spent on the armament of the three places menground has the tioned. for the expenditure of £115,000 upon armament and stores for fixed defences.

This bears out Ithe contention of honourable members on this side that the Estimates are prepared in such a vjagne way as to make it not at all surprising that we do not understand where the'money is to be spent. There were two neyr guns placed at Middle Head last year, but these can be of no use if North Head is left unprotected. Lord Kitchener not only expressed the opinion that North Head should be fortified, but wondered why it had not been fortified before. Fortifications at Middle Head, or at any other inside point of the harbour, are futile against a foreign warship, which might lie off the North Head, where there is a lot of dead water that cannot be touched from the South Head, and from which any vessel could shell Sydney. So far as I can see, however, no provision is made this year Tor the fortification of North Head, for, if any portion of the £115,000 was intended to be spent there, the fact would appear in the Estimates. -none of the £5,000 voted last year was spent at Goode Island; and this means, 1 suppose, that the old fort at Thursday Island is to remain.

The ostensible reason for in the curves, and in the rolling-stock. the fort at Thursday Island is to protect a naval base and coaling station, which is supposed to be between Goode Island and Wie-wier Island. It is only a small ex r panse of coral-bound water, and the guns at Thursday Island are supposed to protect merchantmen or men-of-war who put in for coal, or for protection. The absurdity of the position is that the fort is dominated by many of the surrounding islands, and that, at the back of those islands, on the further side from the fort, there is deep water and good landing placesfor both men and guns, the latter of which could be taken on to the hills of theislands, and from there have the fort at their mercy. There are from eighty to one hundred men, with officers, stationed at. Thursday Island; and there is a large expenditure each year on wages, upkeep of barracks, and so forth, although the fort serves no good purpose. It is said that the fort, if removed, should be taken to Goode Island, but of that I do not approve, because the proper place would be Simpson! Bay, which has the mainland for a background, and an excellent harbour, with anisland about 2 miles from the shore, emi? nently suitable for the magazines and -stores. In any case, we ought not to have Evidently obsolete guns at Thursday Island. As to the Northern Territory, I fail to see much use in constructing the proposed line fromi Pine Creek to Katherine River at the present time. Such a line cannot confer much benefit, even on the people of the NorthernTerritory, for, during my visit, I did not see any evidence of much population in thetwo sets of rolling-stock.

The greatest number of people will be served by taking the railway to Sydney instead of to Adelaide. The census returns show the population of New South Wales and Queensland to be 2,252,000, as against a population of 1,724,000 for Victoria and South Ausr tralia, and it is this smaller number who would have a shorter distance to travel if the route were vid Adelaide. From -the point of view, therefore, of the greatest good to the greatest number, there can be no doubt that the line from Sydney to Bourke vid Camooweal to Darwin should receive the earnest consideration of the Government. There is, of course, the problem of the gauges, but that is for the Government to solve. If they are not able to solve it, they will have to make room for some one who can. We have a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge in Queensland. I asked the Railways Commissioner in Brisbane, some time ago, when Queensland was going to fall into line with the rest of the Commonwealth by altering its gauge from 3 f t . 6 in. to 4 f t . 8J in. He laughed, and said he had. not the slightest intention of altering it, adding, "" It will cost us £27,000,000 to alter the whole of our gauge."" said that? the Commissioners for Railways. able member should verify that before he puts it in Mr Pagan's name. cost of the consequential alterations. it would cost that amount to alter the mileage of gauge in Queensland. I understood that that means every expense in connection with the alteration of the gauge. whom the honourable member has referred. He is a very able engineer; but that is a ridiculous estimate. He said, as we know, that it would cost far more to convert a 3-ft. 6-in. line to a 4-ft. 81-in. gauge, than it would to alter a wide to a narrow gauge. He pointed out that a great many of the curves would have to be altered if the Queensland railway gauge were raised to 4 f t . 8J in that tunnels, platforms, and rolling-stock would also have to be altered-and he SP<1 : distinctly that the cost would be that which I have stated. The problem is very difficult of solution; and I wish to ascertain whether the Government are doing anything to solve it? Are they communicating with Queensland?

We should have another break of gauge if the Pine Creek line were linked up with the Queensland system at Camooweal; so that between Sydney and Port Darwin there, would be two breaks of gauge. The Government ought to endeavour to grapple with the question of uniformity of gauge. If Queensland is going every year to construct mile after mile of railway on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, we shall never be able to look forward to a solution of the question. I understand that conferences .have taken place, but that nothing definite has-been arrived at. Surely some'steps should be taken to bring about conferences of the States in order that finality may be reached. I have no desire to labour the question; but to survey a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River is to start in the wrong direction. A complete and comprehensive scheme of railway construction in the Northern Territory should be mapped out for us. We should then be able to determine where a start should lie made, or we could leave it to experts to guide us in the matter. It seems to mc that this bit of a railway line is to be planked down, so to. speak, in the dark. The Government have no idea whether it is going to be carried on. or what is to be done in regard to the question of break of gauge.

303,Mr Glynn (Angas) [5.59],"I hopeought to be the standard gauge for Australia. They ought not to assume that the decision to construct the transcontinental railway on a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge was a direction from Parliament that the Commonwealth Government, in agreement with the States, should make the standard gauge for Australia 4 f t . 8J in. I have no desire to repeat what I said when this question was discussed last year; but, having heard the honourable member for Parkes say that the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, in opinion as well as in fact, I suppose, is the gauge of the world, I feel it necessary to call attention to the last report on the subject of gauges. I refer to the report of the Irish Railway Commission, which sat in 1909. That very important Commission was appointed to consider the monopoly of private companies of transit, and to what extent it interfered with legitimate development. The English engineers who gave evidence then, as well as the Irish engineers, concurred in the statement that 5 f t . 3 in. was the best of all gauges. It was said that if the gauge of the railways in England could be changed from 4 f t . 8J in. to s f t . 3 in., the alteration would be made; but that they were faced with the fact that a tremendous bill would be consequential upon it. In America, where there are nearly 300,000 miles of railway lines, there is a very large mileage on a 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge running through forty-six or fortyseven States, and passing through some territories which practically rendered it impossible to act on the opinion of modern engineers that the wider gauge is the better from the stand-point of economy, as well as in other respects. I hope that we shall obtain some expert advice upon this matter, and not rest content with the advice of one or two engineers. I should be sorry in any way to impugn either the ability or the bona fides of any of the experts that have reported in connection with the Western Australian transcontir tal railway ; but it would be a very grea. help to Mr Victoria did not acquiesce in the suggestion, Deane himself to have the deliberate opinion of a conference, on which the Commonwealth as well as the States could be represented, called for the .«»ecial purpose r of considering what should 1 'ihe standard gauge for Australia. The meeting of engineers, to which reference was made when this question was discussed If ' vear, was not called to give an opinio' in respect of the gauge to be adopte'. ferred incidentally in their report to the advisableness of adopting a 4-ft. 8 -in. L gauge; but I have reason to think some of. them would not endorse that view if they were called upon now to express a deliberate opinion. It is a mistake, without having the guidance of experts, to introduce another gauge in connection with the Northern Territory. There is already a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line there, and some say that it should be continued on the same gauge with a view to linking it up with the railway system of Queensland. If the Government do decide to adopt the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge, I hope they will follow the suggestion made by Mr Eddy, when Commissioner of New South Wales, that all rolling stock ordered should be capable, if necessary, of accommodation to the wider gauge. He recommended many years ago that a conference should be held to determine the standard gauge for Australia. member mean adjustable rolling-stock capable of being placed on either width of rail. various suggestions as to the use of a third rail, and so forth, but all have been passed by. part of Mr Eddy's report was that theconversion should be made a Federal expenditure. went specially from South Australia -in 1888 to see Mr Eddy. The South Australian House of Assembly, of which I was a member, had carried a motion submitted by me that a meeting of the Railwavs Commissioners of the States should be held to decide what ought to be the standard gauge for Australia, and I went to Victoria and New South Wales to ascertain what chance there was of that motion being acted upon. It was owing to the opposition of Victoria that action was not then taken. Mr Mathieson was then, I think, Commissioner for this State. At all events, and the result was that Mr Eddy's anticipation of a uniform gauge being adopted in about ten years' time was not realized. There was no concert as to what should be the standard. Mr Eddy pointed out that if a standard gauge were decided upon, allfuture rolling-stock could be so made that it could be used on the wider gauge lines. I ask the Government to see that the They rerolling-stock which they order for use on the Northern Territory railwavs is also capable of being used on a 5-ft. 3-in.",40,Chapman The As He Has Promised To Do The Common

307,Mr Glynn,"A very good idea. Igauge. There is no reason for the Government to believe that, because the House decided that the transcontinental railway should be built on a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, the 8J-in. gauge. That opinion, however, was line across the continent to Port Darwin should not be built on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. The South Australian Government would probably be inclined to continue its 5-ft. 3-in. line to Port Augusta, and if the Commonwealth Government widened the 3-ft. 6-in. line to Oodnadatta, and eventually constructed-as they must, according to the moral, and what seems to be the legal, obligation-the line to Port Darwin on the same gauge, we should have one grand trunk line on a uniform gauge running from Albury right up to that port. lines from Queensland and New South Wales being connected with that line either on their present gauge, as feeders, or upon what ultimately may be the standard gauge of Australia. I am asking, not that we should decide to adopt the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, but that the Government should have a special inquiry on the subject. that they should not act upon a merely incidental reference to the question of gauge on the part of a Committee that was not appointed to deal specially with that question. A deliberate decision should be given in the light of expert advice. orable member think that the question is settled so far as this. House is concerned ? The whole matter was discussed. with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. I have already said that we should not regard the decision then arrived at as a direction as to what should be the standard gauge for Australia. engineers has reported. it was doubtless pointed out several times that if we adopted a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge now, others later on, acting against their better judgment, might be forced to adopt 4 f t . 8J in. as an established Federal gauge. It was never said that because the Government were adopting the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge for the Western Australian railway, therefore that gauge, without the guidance of a special conference, should be accepted as the standard for all Australia. In the light of modern evidence modern Commission. neers, which met in 1903, incidentally expressed an opinion in favour of the 4-ft. not based on a comparison of the merits of that gauge with other gauges. is not wrong, a Conference of State Railways Engineers-in-Chief met prior to the decision in this House, and reported in favour of a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. with some military gentlemen. that inquiry. There is nothing to prevent Railways Commissioners met in 1903. at which any evidence was taken, or any deliberate and final expression of opinion given, in favour of a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. I know from experts in South' Australia, whose names I shall not mention, that if I urge some of them were asked for their deliberate opinion, they would recommend a 5-ft. 3-in., and not a 4-ft. 8J-in., gauge. Since 1903, the opinion of experts has been in favour of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. 8iV-in. gauge was recommended for the railway to Western Australia. commendation following upon a proper investigation by experts. However, I shall not discuss the matter now, because finality cannot be reached at this stage; but I ask the Minister to follow the suggestion of the late Mr Eddy, one.of the most competent railway men, from what I have heard and read, whom we have had in Australia, and have the rolling-stock of the Northern Territory constructed so that it may be accommodated, if necessary, to another gauge, or have an inquiry in advance made as to the gauge which should be adopted for all Commonwealth railways. That should not take more than a month or two. It is not to be expected that the transcontinental line through South Australia should be delayed to enable a connection with Camooweal to be made. The transcontinental line was recommended for defence purposes by Major-General Edwards many years ago, and Lord Kitchener recommended it for the same reason, and also, I think, to promote development. to the Commonwealth, because in the near",41,Chapman The As He Has Promised To Do The Common

348,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Nothat matters of public policy relating to works construction, and involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, constitute some of the most important work upon which this House can possibly be engaged. When honourable members opposite attempt to charge us with wasting time because we closely criticise the public expenditure, and ask to be informed on various points in relation to it, they utterly misconceive the purpose for whicli Parliament exists. I can conceive of no more justifiable use of the time of Parliament than in a careful examination of proposals for expenditure such as we have before us in these Works Estimates. matter to call upon a population of just under four and a half millions of people to contribute such an enormous load of taxation as will necessarily be involved in the commitments ahead of us. We should, therefore, be absolutely failing in our duty as a Parliament if , when any Government 1 brought down proposals for expenditure, we did not seek to be properly informed in regard to all the items before we voted for the spending of money which must come out of the pockets of the handful of people on this continent. omission of one item expecting it to be omitted. called tbe honourable member for East Sydney to order, and now ask him to discontinue these interjections. Ministers think that an undue length of time has been taken up in discussing these Estimates, they alone are responsible. There are proposals here involving in many cases hundreds of thousands of pounds, and we cannot get the slightest information from any Minister regarding their' details. Because we try to do our duty by looking after the interests of the public, they charge us with taking up unnecessary time. I repudiate the suggestion, and if Ministers themselves had shown a little more tact and courtesy to honourable members on this side of the House honourable member confine himself to the matter before the Chairt is the matter before -the Chair. This is the question of Supply, and the whole principle underlying it is that there must be redress of grievances before Supply is granted. ber cannot go outside the matters before the Chair. not going outside them. I am not going outside of any matter included in these Works Estimates. I do not want to go into detail regarding them, but if you think that I ought to do so, I shall read out a number of them. I thought I should be saying the time of the House by not doing so, but if I am to be confined only to the items, and am to make not even a passing reference to any question It is no light of policy involved, I must have recourse to the laborious method of going right through the whole of the Estimates.

Elliot Johnson,"You rpolicy shown by the Government in connection with the Estimates, and if I may not . deal with any item in the Estimates, may I ask, sir, with what I may deal? direct the honourable member. I be in order in referring to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills? The Minister of Home Affairs has just given us some information in regard to those mills, and the honourable member for Wilmot asserted a few minutes ago that erroneous details have been given by the Minister concerning the actual expenditure on some ot the items relating to them. This is one of the items concerning which we desire further information. In the Estimates we have an item of £8,000 in respect of "" Woollen Mills,"" but on reference to a paper dealing with those works, I find that £8,000 does not represent anything like the cost of the building. interrupt the honourable member before, but I must point out to him that he is now dealing with distinct details. The honourable member knows as well as I do that the Committee stage is the proper one at which to discuss details. Mr W/ELLIOT JOHNSON -You will not let me deal with matters of policy, Mr Speaker. ber is at liberty to deal in a general way with the whole. question of the report. As long as honourable members have done that I have given them the fullest possible latitude, and I ask the honourable member not to diverge from that course. MrW ELLIOT JOHNSON -The Minister referred specifically to these matters, and I cannot understand why one rule should apply to a Minister and another to a member of the Opposition. I wish to say that certain information given by the Minister was not correct. information that he gave to the House was that a certain sum of. money ber is now referring to a debate on something which took place elsewhere. must not, do thai. referring to a statement made by the Minister. tleman rose, I understood, to make a personal explanation in respect of a statement made concerning him. He occupied about a minute and a half in doing so, and the honourable member is now trying to debate in detail the question then raised. I shall allow him the fullest possible latitude to deal with the question in a general way, but he must not refer to it in detail. Speaker, I wish to know whether we are not empowered at this stage to refer back any item to the Committee with instructions to alter or to eliminate it? If that be so, surely we are entitled to refer to any of the items to which this report relates. arises I shall be prepared to give my ruling in regard to it. The honourable member must not ask me to give a ruling, concerning a matter that is not before the House. have a statement which shows that some of the information that has been given to the House is not accurate, and that the total amount set out in the Estimates in respect of certain works does not represent anything like the amount actually to be expended. That statement will apply, not only to one, but to several cases. It has been the practice with other Governments to submit for the guidance of honourable members, in connection with the Estimates, a general statement covering the proposals embodied in them. That practice has not been followed by the present Ministry, and one complaint is that we are left entirely in the dark as to the nature of a lot of the expenditure involved in the proposals put before us. In the most courteous way we have asked Ministers for information about matters of expenditure, and questions of policy underlying that expenditure, but, in most cases, it has not been forthcoming, while in others the particulars given have been of the most meagre and unsatisfactory description. In more than one The instance, the information has been misleading. I do not say that Ministers have intentionally sought to mislead the House, but the few disjointed scraps of information given by them in. some instances have been misleading, and misleading He probably because they have not had the details to set before us. They do not seem to have come here primed with the information necessary to enable honourable members to know what they are doing. We are placed in a most singular and peculiar position.

373,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Ifor information by members of the Opposition is regarded as a gross impertinence, and as something that must be resented and punished. When the Prime Minister was leaving the Chamber just before the adjournment for dinner, he made the covert threat that he would keep us here all night. Why? Merely because we are asking for information. Surely that is not the way that we as an Opposition should be treated When we are considering .important proposals to expend public money. From a. remark made by the Minister of External Affairs, I gathered that out of a lump sum appearing in the Estimates, provision is to be made for expenditure on fortifications at Thursday Island, although that fact is not shown in the Estimates themselves. While at Thursday Island recently, I saw the fortifications, and also heard the opinions of local residents, military, nautical,, and otherwise. perts who have been up there do not agree that Thursday Island is a fit site for fortifications, and that, as a matter of fact, a vessel from the east desiring to land troops in Australia need not go near Thursday Island. chener include Thursday Island fortifications in his recommendation? did not. He recommended another island, and naval experts have pointed out son ? think Admiral Henderson, amongst others, has pointed out that there are better strategic positions. About Thursday Island is a cluster of closely-grouped islands separated only by two or three miles of water, and some of these being of greater elevation afford opportunities for the landthem. That, however, is our position. ing of troops and guns which could command the forts on Thursday Island. the key to Torres Straits? according to several naval and military authorities, that is quite an erroneous idea. to expend, we are treated as if we As a matter of fact, vessels coming from the east, and desiring to land troops on the mainland, could easily keep out of range of anv guns that might be placed on Thursday' Island. If that be so, there ought to be some further investigation to determine whether there is not a more suitable place in the north for fortifications. It has been said that Simpson Bay is far more valuable from a strategical point of view, but since the honourable member for North Sydney, who is a military expert, has more fully pointed out the weakness to which I have referred, I shall not make further allusion to it. Every one who has been to the Northern Territory is aware that the railway line 'from Port Darwin to Pine Creek is built on a very narrow gauge. It is now proposed to extend that line on a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge to the Katherine River, and this break of gauge is going to be a very serious matter. My recollection is that steel sleepers are used on the Pine Creek line, and if they are not wide enough to carry a 4-ft. 8j-in. line, new sleepers will have to be provided for the whole length of railway from Pine Creek to Port Darwin. The existing line has cost upwards of ,£1,000,000, and if it is to be I believe that military exmade practically useless by an extension on a broader gauge,, we should pause before we commit the country to the proposed expenditure. We ought to have something in the nature of a railway policy for the Northern Territory before any expenditure on railway construction there is sanctioned. As it is, we are working in the dark. The Government have adopted a most slipshod method of doing business in this regard. A lot of schoolboys could not be more unbusinesslike. Imagine a public company saying, through its directors, at the annual meeting of shareholders, "" We want money to carry out certain works. What those works are going to be, or what they are going to cost, we do not propose to tell you. All that we shall tell you is that we intend to go on with those works, although we have not even an estimate of what they will cost."" A body of shareholders would make very short work of a board of directors that put such a proposition before, We are supposed to be practically occupying the position of a board of directors watching expenditure on behalf of .the public. Yet when we ask Ministers to give us some reliable ' information regarding the huge sums which it is proposed were making a most unreasonable request. I have not heard of such proceedings in any other Parliament, and they are not likely to increase the respect felt for this body. HadI followed my own inclinations, I should not have spoken on this question; but what would our constituents say if we remained silent, and when asked,",47,Smith Ther E Was A Question Of Gauge Is Of Great Importance

We tried to ascertain why the money was needed, but, when told that that was not our concern, we did not pursue the matter further."" Under such circumstances, would not our constituents be justified in saying that we had not done our duty, and that they would send other representatives here? 1 do not know what answer the supporters of the Government will give when their constituents ask them what this money is to he expended f o i , and whether the country will get value for the expenditure. All their time will be taken up in explaining. Their present attitude may have this satisfactory result: that the next Parliament may be composed of men who will study more carefully the interests of their constituents, and see that the load of taxation is reduced. It is the policy of the Labour party to pay for works out of current revenue. under consideration will have to be paid for with money taken from the pockets of the people, the great majority of whom are wage-earners only. It is not the wealthy who suffer for our extravagance; it is those who earn merely bread and butter, and find it hard to get the butter. The burden of taxation on them is heavy enough already. I hope that Ministers will recede from their truculent attitude, and recognise that the members of the Opposition represent many thousands of electors, and, in asking for information, are prompted, not by individual curiosity, but by the desire to study the interests of their constituents. In my electorate alone there are something like 50,000 voters. Have they not a right to -know why the expenditure of the country is increasing? And to whom should they come for information but to me, their representative in Parliament? I can get this information only from Ministers, whose duty it is to give it without even being asked. Ministers should have statements accompanying their Estimates, and should be prepared to at once give the fullest explanation of every item. I hope that before the debate is concluded we shall have further information in regard to a number of the matters to which reference has been made. was astounded when the Minister of External Affairs to-day gave certain answers to'questions which I had put on the notice paper. Two sessions ago we were distinctly promised by the Postmaster-General of the day that official post-offices would be established wherever the postal revenue of a place was £200, and that the rule would not be altered by the introduction of penny postage. NowI am informed that official post-offices will not be established, except in places where the postal revenue is £ 3 0 0 a year, and there is a revenue of £ 4 0 a year from telegrams. If that rule is going to be adhered to, I hope that an early opportunity will be given to honourable members to express their views in regard to it. It appears to me that the new rule has been introduced by the Department without sufficient consideration by the Minister, the promise to which I allude being overlooked for the time. I hope that that may be so, and that, on representations being made to the Minister, the promise will be acknowledged, and official post-offices granted on the original terms. I shall not occupy much time in discussing the question before Therefore, the proposals now the House. My great objection to the course that has been taken in regard to these Estimates is .that no definite scheme has been laid down by the Government in regard to large proposals for expenditure, and that we have not been told either how much we are committed to, or how Ministers propose to finance their undertakings. Although only small amounts are covered by certain items, they really commit the country to the expenditure of millions; and I maintain that it will be impossible to meet these commitments out of revenue, or, at least, out of the present revenue. When the Budget is under discussion, I think it will be shown that our revenue is likely to decrease later. We ought to know how Ministers propose to find the money for the undertakings of which we approve. If additional taxation is to be proposed, let Ministers say so; while, if Loan Funds are to be resorted, to, the public should know. Befors consenting to initial expenditure, we should have definite statements as to whai is proposed and what the ultimate cost will be, and should be informed how it is intended to raise the necessary funds orable memkirs have been, in a measure, at cross purposes, the difficulty that has arisen being due to misunderstandings on both sides which, T hope, may shortly be removed.

During the discussion of these Estimates, which has extended over several days, the attendance has varied greatly, and important questions have sometimes been discussed by a very thin House. A preliminary misunderstanding arose regarding the charges about the manner in which the making of tunnels and trenches for the Post Office Department has been conducted. It is impossible to understand thereason why the Government decline to give the reports of responsible inspectors who have signed the reports and made themselves responsible for them-reports , only selections from which have been placed before the House.

For instance, on page 227, a vote of. £80,000 is proposed for the acquisition of sites for the erection of mobilization stores, drill halls, and so forth.

On the next page is another item on which £20,000. general information should be given, and with more particulars than in the previous case; 1 allude to the establishment of the Military College. According to the Estimates we voted for this purpose last y , .£40,000, but £68,000 appears ear to have been spent. Judging by the position of the item on the Estimates, the £28,000 appears to have been spent without authority, and we are now asked to spend ^45,000 more. It is perfectly fair, I think, to ask how that extra £28,000 was spent last year, and how it is proposed to spend the £45,000 this year? necessary to ask for this information; it ought to have been proffered. part of* the information has, at some time., been given to some honourable members; but to the Committee as a whole the information has not been imparted. On page 241, it is proposed fo vote no less a sum than £300,000 for the purchase of warlike stores. These figures are in excess of anything we have been accustomed to in the past. For myself, I I was about to say believe this expenditure to be necessary 1 and essential. says that these items are in excess of what we have been accustomed to in the past; but if he looks at the Estimates, he will see that last year £290,000 was spent in precisely the same way. The item was explained last year, and also this year. Honorary Minister misunderstands. I mean that it is only within the last two or three years that we have been able to spend such sums. Prior to that it was impossible. We are not only justified by the circumstances of the situationin the new departures we are making in military and other matters-but . we are equally entitled to make just as close a scrutiny as ever before of all these items. about this item, which satisfied even the Deputv Leader of the Opposition. ary Minister himself is satisfied, and I hope other honourable members are; but many are not; and it is for the purpose of satisfying them that I am returning upon the chief items which have caused dissension arid prolonged debate. On the next page, the vote for naval works springs up to £200,000 from given of this yesterday to the honourable member for Darling Downs, who expressed himself satisfied. that; but, again, unfortunately, the honourable member for Darling Downs is not present now The Honorary Minister never rose to make one.' to what an explanation is. In the face of the whole House, for the purpose of bringing this prolonged discussion to a conclusion, I have run over some of the chief items to refresh the memory of the Prime Minister. On the next page, 244,' provision is made for the construction and survey of a railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River. This obviously does not need a full exposition of policy; but it does need a sufficient statement. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, when the Bill is before the House, a full opportunity will be afforded to discuss it.

The honourable member must know that, while great latitude may be allowed in respect of a general discussion, an honourable member is not entitled, at the report Stage, to discuss actual details, which should have been dealt with in Committee.

Military areas have been prescribed all over Australia, and halls and other necessary equipment will be required for the increased Citizen Forces. This item, as I have said, does not particularly affect the Cadet Forces; but it must not be forgotten that our Citizen Forces have practically been doubled. We had formerly about 20,000 men in our Citizen Forces, whereas we have now about 40,000, and this vote of .£80,000 will provide hall accommodation and. equipment necessary for mobilization throughout Australia.

The delay which is taking place can be avoided by the Opposition, and I say with the greatest courtesy that we shall be happy if the Bill passes through as quickly as possible, so that we may proceed with works necessary, for the defence and the development of this great country which we have the .honour to govern. had no intention of interposing in this debate, and I rise now only to pour a little oil on the troubled waters. astounded at the speech to which we have just listened. thnt the Prime Minister was suffering under a sense of personal injustice, but all that the Opposition have wanted, and all that they desire is the information that on all prev'ous occasions has been readily afforded by Ministers when asking for Supply in respect of matters of this kind. We have asked for no more, ancl we are -entitled to no less. peared to think that because it became -necessary for us to ask how certain amounts fitted in with general schemes concerning Australian defence, we were in some vague and indefinite way insulting him, so far as his capacity to reply is conr-e'-ned. indicting the right honourable member's power? of exposition than I should dream of humour with which he so often delights the House. ever, that we have never yet had from this Government any general statement as to how far they are committing themselves in matters of naval defence to which some of these items relate. Take, for instance, the vote for naval works. Minister thinks-h e is not quite sure, and does not think it quite fair to ask him to be quite sure-that the vote has something to do with the construction of new naval bases about the coastline of Australia. This system of navaJ bases is a new proposition, which was made in Admiral Henderson's report. know whether the Government has endorsed that report. we shall know in what direction we are tending. We hope to get these yond this particular section then we desire to know on what authority the Prime Minister is proceeding in this direction. For my own part 1 have some doubt that perhaps we may be following too blindly the example of the Mother Country in endeavouring to separate our naval bases from our ordinary mercantile ports. In the Mother Country it is essential to have mercantile ports and naval bases separate, because the constant movements of ships of war would interfere materially with the mercantile shipping. But oui vessels of war are not so numerous or ubiquitous that we need fear that their passing in and out of ports will seriously interfere with the ordinary shipping. I suggest this as a consideration worthy of passing notice, because every penny spent on naval bases I was which may he unnecessary could be better spent on the construction and arming of One might have thought ships. Therefore we should be told what is the policy of the Government in this regard. But when we ask for information, our questions are regarded as insults, and our protests as a nefarious attempt to retard the passing of the Estimates. The Prime Minister referred to the vote for the Military College. I should be the last The Treasurer apto wish to retard the passing of an item of that kind, because the establishment of the Military College was first suggested in this Parliament by me, and agreed to at my instigation. But I should like to know whether the money asked for is for new works, or to repair the blunders of the I would no more dream of past year 9r two? It may be necessary for the rebuilding of the stables, which, apparently, were designed by an architect acaffronting that delectable sense of customed to the accommodation provided for horses on shipboard, since so little room I wish to say to him, howwas given that the horses could not flick their tails without upsetting the domestic economy of the edifice.

There is another The Prime item of £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 ber may not deal with separate items. way of illustration.

The Prime Minister, who, at this last hour, was going to afford us every information, though in a spirit that, to me, seemed hardly gracious,. has misled us, and we have to trust to the cryptic utterances of ministration, and to protest against the the Honorary Minister for the correction of the wrong impression made upon our minds by his chief. orable member's ignorance. He has not read the Estimates that he is presuming to criticise. orable member; but there is no reason for his bitterness -The footnote says that the total estimated cost is £300,000. money is to be spent on drill halls, and how much on mobilization .stores ? We still do not know how many areas are to'have drill halls, and how many mobilization stores are to be provided? The sum provided for training the levies under our new system is, according to the Minister's interjection, only about one-fourth of what will be necessary eventually. If we have to wait four years, what evidence is there of this determined haste to proceed with our military organization of which we heard a few minutes ago from the Prime Minister? I am the last person to desire to hold up the Estimates, but I want something in the nature of a reasoned explanation of them. Perhaps it is hopeless to expect -that from Ministers, though I should like a broad, comprehensive statement of policy in regard to the large question of Australian defence. Indeed, I despair of getting it from Ministers. The Prime Minister, in his hotheaded attack on the Opposition for having the temerity to ask questions, did not do himself or us justice. We are here to ask questions, to try to find out what is being done with the public's money. When we asked what Ministers are spending on themselves, there was an uproar; and now that we wish to know how they propose to spend money on big. public enterprises, we are threatened with a bludgeon. of £4,000,000. people's money is always a trifling matter to a Labour Government. But we are the trustees of the public, to whom an expenditure of nearly £ 1 per head is a matter of importance. The people desire that their money shall be spent wisely; and it is the duty of the Opposition, a duty which will be determinedly faced, despite the bluster and bluff of honourable members opposite, to criticise lax methods of adnon-explanations which have disfigured this debate, and the discussion of the Estimates in Committee. the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, Ministers were very loud and persistent in their assertions that all the information asked for by the Opposition had been given. I wish,' therefore, to draw attention to a specific instance to the contrary . I noticed with surprise that ,£5,000 is set down for the construction of a new General Post Office at Perth. On the. face of it, that is an absurd proposal. I wished to know what the plans of the Government are; what was its object in placing this item on the Estimates; whether there was any further development to announce; and when the building was likely to be taken in hand ? On these points, I have not yet received a word of explanation. The people of Perth and of Western Australia have been clamouring for this post-office for several years. Since it was promised, they have been awaiting impatiently the erection of the building. The site has been acquired, I believe, the Minister of Home Affairs having busied himself about the matter when in Perth recently. I understand that a plan was drawnI saw a reproduction of it in a newspaper some time ago-in which the post-office was relegated to a sort of backyard, and was surrounded with shops and warehouses. That plan has been discarded, as it deserved to be; but we are yet in the dark as to what is to take its place. This matter is important enough to require more explanation than has been given. If an explanation is not forthcoming, I must take it that the Ministry are in the dark as to whatthey are",57,Smith Ca N We Be In From Your Direction I T Will Be Suffirient

When the Department has decided that the building is necessary, the Department of Home Affairs is requested to make the necessary acquisition of land, and the officers in the Lepartment of Home Affairs have to go into the whole question occupying, perhaps, another three months. Then, when these two Departments have decided, the matter has to go on to the Treasurer, who, perhaps, takes another three months to find the money; and in this way important public works, which are urgently needed, are delayed beyond all reason. system of checks and balances. 4:hat was on the coat of the mad hatter in Alice in Wonderland. It is not a reasonable check j and it should not entail the combined wisdom of three Departments, one* after another, being devoted to one detail of administration, that ought to be dealt with by one Department in a week or two. The present system should be uprooted, and the Department of Home Affairs made a Works Department. Department for the acquisition of land and many other purposes, and its works are carried on largely by the Works Departments of the States. Let me give an instance in my own electorate. Some years ago, I recommended to the Post and Telegraph Department the wisdom of providing a post office in what was obviously going to be the best commercial centre in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. years to persuade the Department of the common sense of the proposal, and the Department of Home Affairs was then instructed to acquire the site it had chosen. Some trouble was then experienced in getting the Home Affairs Department to endorse the site selected, although, as we have seen, it had taken the Post and Telegraph Department a long time to make up its mind to go to that centre in the first place. After these two Departments had come to one mind as to a site, and after the Home Affairs Department had got an estimate of the value of the site from the New South Wales valuator, the Minister of Home Affairs asked the Treasurer to supply the necessary money. The Treasurer and the Minister of Defence then put their heads together, and they came to the conclusion that the amount asked for was a large one for a piece of land. It was the amount suggested by the New South Wales Government valuator, and represented, I should imagine, the price that the land would fetch in open market. But the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister, who had never seen the land,and knew nothing of the conditions or of the intense competition for sites .in that particular area, decided in their wisdom, and from their wide experience as land valuers, that it was too much to give, and hung the matter up for three or four O'MALLEY -That is the months.

The regulations made in pursuance of this section may direct that any of the provisions of sections thirty-three, thirty-four, and fortysix of this Act shall not apply in relation to any matter in respect of which regulations are made under this section."" The object of this Bill may be briefly stated. It is the practice for captains of the ships of the Royal Navy to pay their men according to their ratings, without requiring from them any receipt. Under our Audit Act payment could not be legally made in .that way, and it is now proposed by this Bill so to amend the principal Act that that which has proved to be a satisfactory and convenient arrangement in connection with His Majesty's ships in the Royal Navy may prevail on vessels of the Australian Unit. The Bill will also permit of the captain or officer commanding any Australian ship to get credit arid expend money in circumstances in which it would not be permissible for officers of the Public Service to do so. I am legally advised, and the Treasury also advises me, that the Bill will have that effect, and it is approved without any qualification. We think it necessary, for the efficient government of the Australian Naval Unit, in conformity with the custom and practice on vessels of His Majesty's Royal Navy, to have this power. -It seems to me-and the Treasurer will correct me if I am wrong-that this Bill is really designed to apply to vessels of the Australian Unit the practice laid down by section 63 of the Audit Act in respect of moneys outside the Commonwealth. That section provides thatNotwithstanding anything in this Act contained the Governor General may make such arrangements as he considers necessary for the collection, receipt, custody, issue, expenditure, due accounting for, care, and management of any money belonging to the Commonwealth outside the territory of the Commonwealth, and fur the keeping of books and accounts and furnishing statements, returns, and vouchers, and for the examination, inspection, record, and audit of such books, accounts, statements, returns, and vouchers. It seems at the first glance that the Treasurer is seeking by this Bill to apply to the Australian Navy and naval establishments the principle that is now applied in respect of moneys that are being expended and collected, let us say, in England by the High Commissioner. establishments,"" I have in mind naval bases. be limited from time to time. ter ; and I take it that the Treasurer will see that regulations are carefully framed to insure that all moneys are properly accounted for. tive of the officers whole-heartedly assert that what is desired cannot be done without this amending; Bill. carefully framed? the provisions of sections 33, 34, and 46 of the principal Act may not apply "" in relation to any matter in respect of which regulations are made under this section.""

Then, again, section 34 deals with the duties of paying officers, and is rather important.

Bank is absolutely removed from political influence. to appear unkind, but 1 am tempted to say that the Governor of the Bank thought it worthwhile to put an enormous advertisement in the metropolitan daily papers, in the most expensive position, which virtually only informed the people of Victoria where their post-offices are situated. This high official apparently thought that good business, though the advertisement conveyed little information to intending depositors but a good deal of money to the proprietors of the newspapers in which the advertisement appeared. A Government which professes to stand up for the rights of those' unable to help themselves should say that the country newspapers are not to be treated in this shabby and invidious fashion. We are told by the Prime Minister that the Governor of the Bank is beyond political influway in which the Bank would suffer from ence. Surely the right honourable gentleman is not going to allow him to commit a manifest wrong of this sort, and to infringe the policy which the Government says it was specially created to foster and develop. 1 am surprised that the Prime Minister has so readily sheltered himself behind the measure which he introduced to place this high official in such a position that be can not only break down the policy of a Labour hold those who play the role of sweater!

I said all along that I desired that the man who was to run this bank should be absolutely free from political influence; and the success or failure of the bank rests on that. In reply to the honourable member, I have here a memorandum, dated 14th August, directed to the Secretary to the Treasury. It is as followsIn reply to your memorandum I have to advise as follows :We agreed to pay an agent a certain fixed sum for advertising the Commonwealth Bank in the Victorian provincial newspapers. We have no knowledge as to the price offered to the newspapers or whether such price was accepted or rejected, or whether an increased price was subsequently offered. The amount which we originally agreed to pay was not increased. This memorandum is signed by F. P. Coffin for the Governor of the Bank. sub-letting ? Bank is to be free from political influence, he must remain free -He may contract with another party in any way he pleases, subject to the policy of this Parliament and this Government. When the country or other newspapers go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for an award for proper rates, then will be the proper time to talk of sweating. The Governor must conduct the bank in his own way. I do not know, and there are no facts to show, whether the rates paid are sweating rates. I do know that a number of journals, who do not support Liberalism, never got a Government advertisement for twenty years; and now trouble is raised because the Governor of the bank is independent, and gives this work to a firm without asking whether there is sweating or not. I do not know the name of the firm, but I believe it to be one of repute. I cannot take responsibility for what the Governor of the Bank has done, because it rests with himself.
