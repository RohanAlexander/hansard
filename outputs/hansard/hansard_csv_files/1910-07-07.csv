The report -continuesHe had made a protest to the Federal Government against the proclamation being any further delayed. He received a communication fro m Mr Fisher on 25th June, stating that his letter would receive immediate attention, and until Monday last, 4th July, he had heard no more from him. Under these conditions he wrote on Monday, and told Mr Fisher that, in all the circumstances, the only thing left to l i m to do was to table the correspondence in Parliament. He was largely impelled by the fact that, whilst he and the Government knew this proclamation was being delayed, members -of the Commonwealth Ministry were making public statements leading' everybody to believe that all was in order and working in the usual way. All these statements were mere empty phrases, .and all this talk so much waste of time. -In the light of this* latest criticism, I ask the Minister of Home Affairsi f the Government is prepared to allow the Premier of New South Wales to humiliate the .national Parliament by continuing to dominate its policy in regard to the Federal Capital as he and the Governments of New South Wales have done ever since Federation ? member is in order in couching his question 3n those terms. -strictly in order, but, as it contains a request, I shall allow it to be asked. place in New South Wales next September, and the Premier of the State is actuated in what he is doing now by that consideration. tention of the present Government to go right on, irrespective of the views of the Premier of New South Wales, or of any one else. gather from the Minister's reply to the question of the honourable member foi Parkes, that it. is the intention of the Government to ask Parliament to vote £250,000 for the construction of the internal portion' of a Parliament House at the Federal Capital site? ready informed the world that we shall not put up temporary buildings.

Home Affairs, in answer to the honourable member for Werriwa, said that the question bf issuing the second proclamation has received, and is receiving, deep consideration, and I ask the honourable gentleman whether as a result of that deep consideration any reason has been discovered why the second proclamation should not immediately issue? certain legal questions of phraseology and complexity of application that have to be considered. ask if the honourable Home Affairs give the House any idea of when the second proclamation in regard to the Federal Capital will issue?

As to the loss sustained by Tasmania, when the honourable member sees the figures he will notice that the contribution of Western Australia per capita is far in excess of the contribution of the next lowest State -The Government has already taken the matter into consideration, and, although willing to review the question. 1 venture to say that Tasmania's claim will not stand examination.

Is the Minister aware of that fact? it. master-General has fixed ist September for the introduction of the new telephone rates, are we to understand that he is in possession, or that Parliament will be placed in possession, of the report of the Postal Commission which has been taking evidence for months, if not for years ? If he has that report, will he postpone the introduction of the new rates until it is laid before Parliament, so that honourable members may be able to study the. evidence which has been taken at such cost to the country, before the regulation is adopted? the regulation will come into force. PORT AUGUSTA TO KALGOORLIE RAILWAY. of Home Affairs aware that his proposal that the Western Australian Government should reserve a twenty-five miles strip of land on either side of the proposed railway as a contribution towards the cost of the suggested work was made by myself some years ago when the Survey Bill was not before Parliament, and that the Government of Western Australia then agreed to that condition and undertook, through the right honourable member for Swan, to put such land in trust for the purpose? The Minister may find some record of the promise of the Western Australian Government among the official papers in his Department. I made the suggestion I confess I was unconscious of the fact that the honourable member for Parkes had also made it. When the honourable member told me that he intended to ask this question, I looked into the matter, and here is what he said on the 14th October, 1909The moment this line of survey is,"" I shall not say determined, but indicated, a number of enterprising capitalists will endeavour to get hold of land in the vicinity. Theywill know very well that should it become necessary to resume land the test of the compensation will be what was given for it, and what it was worth before the railway was actually undertaken. On the other hand, if the land is not resumed the occupiers will acquire the increment which results from the construction of 'the railway through what at present is unexplored country. if answers are going to occupy such a length of time by the reading of extracts of this description, there is a danger of much of the day being so occupied. I suggest that if honourable members desire information of this kind they should move for a return to be laid on the table of the House As the question has been asked, I suggest that the answer now being read be laid on the table for honourable members to see. to finish, and I should like to do so, because there has bgen such a storm about my suggestion, although it appears I am only following in the footsteps of a greater man. justified in taking his present course merely to justify himself in view of criticism which may have been passed.

The object is that when we, as a Parliament, hereafter undertake the actual construction, we may lay it down as a condition that the Commonwealth shall in some form or other have a quid f r o quo in the shape of a large extent of territory which would represent compensation for the outlay.

77,Mr Laird Smith (Denison) [3.3],"pledging myself, if returned, to endeavour to carry out in this House the propositions of which I told the electors of Denison1 was in favour ? I fail to see that any harm can be done. The members of the Labour party are bound only so far as their platform goes. Outside of that platform, I claim the right, and shall exercise it, to do as I please on the floor of this House. Beyond that pledge no member of our party is bound -I am delighted to learn that the Government are about to make provision foi taking over the State debts, for in that way they will do much to consolidate our growing Commonwealth into the great nation which we expect it shortly to become. The consolidation of the State debts will also do much to put an end to the nefarious practice of borrowing that is being indulge'd in by the States. The Commonwealth has carried out magnificent reproductive works without borrowing a shilling, whereas we find the States themselves continually adding to Australia's enormous debt. Since the inauguration of the Federation, the States have borrowed no less than £40,000,000. £7,500,000 was raised.by way of Treasury Bills-the most expensive and worse form of obtaining money for the State. -Then, again, ' New South Wales, a very nVh State, nothwithstanding that it has received from the Commonwealth the enormous sum of £24,000,000 has added to its public debt by £20,000,000 since ' Federation Western Australia is an even worse offender, having regard to its population, since it has borrowed £7,500,000; whilst the little State of which I have the honour to be a representative has indulged in borrowing during the same period to the extent of £1,600,000. I hope that the consolidation of the debts of the States will be rapidly brought about, and that when it is we shall, in some way or other, curtail the borrowing system. honourable members of the Opposition will be strongly opposed to any attempt made by us in that direction, because once we put a stop to Government borrowing,we shall strike at the very bedrock of the capitalistic placed in the Constitution for all time system. That is the reason why the Opposition have been so antagonistic to the project. honourable friend who interjects has profited very often in connection with the negotiation of little loans throughout the length and breadth of Tasmania. In no country has the money-lender greater power than he has in the State from which I come, and I am not surprised therefore that the honourable member should interject so readily and try to side-track me. Another important matter which has received marked attention from the Opposition is the proposed per capita return to the States of 25s. per annum. I regret exceedingly that the honourable member for Franklin is not present, because I wished him to hear the statement that I am about to make. The Labour party's candidates in Tasmania at the recent general election did not pledge themselves to support this per capita return being made for any specified period. I told my constituents that I cared not whether it was made for ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years; that my sole desire was that the agreement should not be placed in the Constitution for all time, as I wished to save the Commonwealth. That was the all-important consideration. I realized that the story of the future lies mirrored in the history of the past.. My knowledge of the history of the Of that huge sum, United States has taught me a lesson. What was the stand taken up by that great statesman Alexander Hamilton, who found himself confronted by this self-same problem? Governor Clinton, of New York, in his day desired to obtain control of the finances of AmericaI may say in passing that I am not a pupil of the Minister of Home Affairs in this connection; the statement is original-and Alexander Hamilton saw that if he did he would also obtain control of the Union. It was the self-same consideration that led us to oppose the financial agreement being embodied in the Constitution. We had behind us one of the biggest daily newspapers in Australia. I refer to the Melbourne Age, which helped us considerably during the campaign in dealing with this I recognise that most important matter. We saw that the Prime Minister of the Commonweal th: would no longer have the power which should attach to his oflice if the financial agreement requiring this payment to be made were We saw that the State Premiers would be. able to dictate to him, and that he would thus be deprived of the power that we trust the occupant of his office will always possess. There is one matter associated with' the proposal to, which I should like to refer. Tasmania at the present time is in very straitened circumstances, due, I admit, to maladministration in the past.",19,Address In Reply

79,Mr Laird Smith,"N b doubt, myThere we have simply pursued a borrowing policy, with the result that our legislators in the past have not been as careful as they should have been. They resorted to the practice of constructing roads and bridges out of borrowed money, and when a bridge was required to be renewed they simply built a new one beside it, and charged the cost to loan account. A very prominent member of the Tasmanian Parliament, wishing to keep faith with his constituents, caused an expensive swing bridge to be constructed over a river to allow ships to come up the stream; but, as a matter of fact, they have never done so. I refer to the Leith railway bridge, which I . am credibly informed is never opened save when the authorities desire to ascertain whether or not it is in working order. was also constructed to deepen the river channel, and with what result? The breakwater no longer exists, or is not effective. No doubt the money was spent under the old Government regime, but I ask honourable members to temper justice with mercy, and to give to Tasmania some assistance to tide her over the present depression. should give her what the Labour candidates promised at the elections. do what I could, and am doing my best tb get something in addition to the 25s. per head which the other States are to receive. I admit that the Prime Minister is right in saying that Tasmania does not pay to the Commonwealth as much as the amount expended by the Commonwealth on her public services. But I ask. that justice be tempered with mercy. The State is fast becoming a province of Victoria. trade was in the old days done with Hobart; it is now done with Melbourne. ney. same with the North-West Coast trade. The Oonah makes twovoyages a week between Melbourne and the North-West Coast of Tasmania. Consequently our Customs revenue has fallen off. Instead of importing from the Old Country direct, our merchants now import from Victoria and New South Wales. I hope that the Commonwealth will come to our rescue. quite in accord with the Government regarding the proposed note issue, which I feel sure will play an important part in bringing * prosperity to the Commonwealth. I am glad that it is to be the forerunner of a State Bank. I obtained a majority of 2,000 upon my election because, from the Start to the finish of my campaign, I advocated the establishment of a national bank. I did that because I had made myself fully acquainted with the working of the Swiss State bank, and knew the advantages which Switzerland has gained by possessing such an institution. I knew, too, what Japan had done in the matter. She has a State commercial, a State agricultural, and a State specie bank. Denmark and other countries have also State banks. If a country is to be progressive it must control the money volume. The Labour platform provides for the fixing of a minimum rate of wages, and the introduction of new Protection, and my knowA breakwater ledge of banking teaches me that it is often impossible for an employer of laboura manufacturer, merchant"", farmer, agriculturalist, or orchardist-to pay fair and reasonable wages because of the high rates of interest which he is . charged by the banks, and the uncertainty regarding the advance. I have been informed that this has occurred: A man has told his employees that he could not pay higher wages to them, but on being compelled to do so, and going to his banker afterwards, has -been informed that as money was becoming tighter he would have to be charged an additional J per cent, for the discounting of his bills, and an additional 1 per cent, on his overdraft. Thus in part, the banks, and not wholly the law of supply and demand, as some would have us believe, control the rates of wages. Therefore I am glad that the institution of a State bank is proposed. Yesterday a great deal was said on the subject of security. It was asked, "" What security has the Commonwealth for its note Our West Coast issue ?'' I ask honourable members opposite what security would they have offered for t r i e £ 3 J 5 » ° O which they obtained par0 0 0 liamentary sanction to borrow for the construction of warships, which would have become obsolete in ten years. They would have offered as security the people of the Commonwealth, and it is that which will be behind our note issue. If there were not an ounce of gold in the Treasury coffers, it would not matter, because no English community, to my knowledge,"" has repudiated its debts, and I am sure that Australia will not do so. While I am we have the working people of this country as an asset we shall have sufficient security for our note issue. According to the latest official returns, the highest",20,Address In Reply

83,Mr Laird Smith,"Yes. It is thepercentage of coin and bullion held by the. banks, in proportion to their total liabilities on call, is only 53.27 per cent. They work on the good faith of the people. In 1797, when Pitt came to the rescue of the banks in England, as when, less than 100 years later, Sir George Dibbs came to the rescue of the banks in New South Wales, and received £3,000 as a bonus for doing so, and Mr Seddon'came to the rescue of the Bank of New Zealand, the people were, . as they are now, the real security behind the banks. orable member mean by saying that Sir George Dibbs received £3,000 from the banks ? that he received £3,000 from the banks. I understand that the State Government made him a present of that amount. hear that it is not. I have read the statement in a work concerning New South Wales. I look upon the financial editor of the Sydney Bulletin as one of the greatest financial authorities in Australia. According to him, the Union Bank started in Australia with a capital of less than £144,000, and in the first fifty years of its career paid over £8,000,000 in dividends' to its shareholders. The Bank of Australasia started with a capital of £200,000, and in its first fifty-three years paid over £6,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders. The Union Bank is paying dividends at the rate of 14'per cent; the Bank of Australasia at the rate of 12 per cent., with an 8s. bonus; and the Bank of Western Australia at the rate of 20 per cent. Could any business be more profitable? How are those profits made. They are taken out ot the pockets of the workers. I hope that the day may not be far distant when that state of things will be changed, and that the change will be effected by the establishIn the midlands of Tasmania thirty-six ment of a State Bank. One of the most important measures mentioned in the Speech is the proposed land tax. I have been surprised at the want of knowledge on this subject displayed by members of the Opposition. I understood the right honourable member for Swan to say that it is proposed to tax the small man who is struggling; we do not wish to do anything of the kind. We propose a land value tax because it is the fairest tax that can be devised, and the only impost whicli must be paid directly by the land-owner. That is the objection to it felt by our opponents. object of the proposed tax ? big estates. At all events, that is what I hope from it. If the rate at first agreed to does not prove effective, I hope that next year it will be increased to an amount which will be effective. The object of the tax should be to break up the big estates, and to get revenue. We need revenue, and should get it in the only fair and legitimate way, by taxing the land. Other modes of taxation are not fair and just. The time for getting revenue by Customs duties is gone. What is the objection to Customs taxation ? It is that the importer often makes profits by adding more than the amount of the Customs taxation to the price of the goods that he imports. He pays the duty, and charges interest on the money he paid for the goods he took out of bond : and that is the reason we are not in favour of taxation through the Customs. I hope we shall shortly have a land value tax which will throw open the large estates and populate this country as it ought to be populated. In Tasmania we feel the effects of land monopoly more than they are felt in any other State. Young men and women are leaving Tasmania; and it is not hard to believe that there are now about 45,000 Tasmanian residents in other parts of the Commonwealth. Land cannot be purchased within reasonable distance of railways, or with proper access to markets, except under prohibitive prices which are impossible to orehardists and other cultivators. To my sorrow, the other day I met a young man from Tasmania on his way to Queensland, in the hope of there obtaining land. I read in Hansard a statement to the effect that the people were perched up in the hilly country of Tasmania, endeavouring to earn a living from the difficult soil to be there obtained; proof of this latter statement can be found at Bismarck. farms have been broken up into one sheeprun, and the land assessment there has dropped until, I think, speaking from memory, the value is now represented by £ 2 5s. per acre. worth ? or £ 1 0 per acre; at any rate, Colonel Cameron paid £ 9 per acre for land at Monaville.

91,Mr Laird Smith,"It is worth £ 9farms, and the assessment has gone up by leaps and bounds, until for taxation purposes it is £ 1 4 per acre. It is in Franklin, however, that we find even a worse state of things, because the land there is assessed as high as £ 2 5 per acre, while people are actually paying £ 1 2 per acre for the purchase of bush land. This latter land must cost £ 2 0 per acre to clear, and then the trees have to be planted, with a wait of seven years for any return. This is the way in which.the people are struggling in Tasmania, and yet we find representatives from that State decrying any attempt to introduce land value taxation. ber does not know much of Tasmania outside of Hobart: desire is to tax the unearned increment. I know a young man in Hobart, who, getting behind the scenes, was enabled to purchase at a small price land to which a railway service had to be extended; and imme diately the work had been carried out, and the population followed, his land rose to a value of £300. We know that young man did not produce that increased value, but that it was produced by the railway extension and the consequent increase in population. 1 have a return here which shows that in New South Wales the circumstances are similar According, to Wise's Commonwealth of AustraliaIn the State of New South Wales, 987 persons own properties of over ^50,000 in value. These fortunate ones, among them, own ^130,521,000 worth of property, or 35.4 per cent, of the whole property of the State, themselves being only 0.13 of the population. Mr Coghlan remarks that probably half the Stale is owned by 3,000 persons, and what pertains to New South Wales obtains ih varying degrees, of seriousness in all the States. I hope, indeed I am sure, honourable members will pass the measure imposing taxation on land values, and thus break up the large estates now causing so much harm throughout the length and breadth of the country. The Governor General's Speech intimates that the High Commissioner has arrived in London, and taken up his duties. It would be desirable if the Government found something for that gentleman to do than attend big dinners; otherwise, instead of his feasting in London, we shall find him feasting in Paradise. cipal business in London! there is an alteration the better. I hope that some of the Queensland representatives will enlighten us with reference to Ihe Sugar Bounty and sugar matters generally. .1 do not know much of the question myself, but I should like to learn why a rise.' of 5s. per ton in,Germany causes a similat rise in Australia, and whether the growers or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are reaping the benefit. I think I have said sufficient to convince at any rate some honourable members opposite. It did me good to hear one honourable member interject that the time had gone past for the taxation of the workers through the Customs. After all, there are only two powers the Labour party desire for the Government, namely, the control of the money volume, and the control of the land of the country, because then provision would be made for work for everybody. volume too. r follows. If this Government be given a "" fair deal,"" I am sure that at the end of their three years' service the people will say, "" Well done, thou good and faithful servants; return to carry on your excellent work."" am one who thinks that long debates on the Address-in-Reply are not required nowa-days; and I am glad to observe that short speeches have been made by honourable members who preceded me, whose commendable example I hope to follow. 1 had pleasure in noticing that the Governor General's Speech opened with a reference to our late and peace-preserving King, ancl a prayer for the future welfare -ri the Empire under his successor King George. There are many topics touched on in the Speech whicli I shall not deal with just now. Many' of the. paragraphs relate to measures which, I think, there will be no trouble in passing; but there are also some highly contentious matters. The Government do not indicate very clearly how far they intend to go as to these latter questions; but, knowing what was said to the people during the recent elections, we may look for a pretty drastic programme. I should first like to say a word or two about finance.

112,Mr Atkinson,"I do not think it isabout to make fresh financial arrangements, of getting support for special treatment for that State, I intend to launch a ""motion to test whether the House is prepared to do justice and treat the smaller States in a truly Federal spirit. The Prime Minister has given a reason why he cannot grant special consideration to Tasmania; but I think, when the times comes, I can give an effective answer to the conclusion which he drew this afternoon. I do not think he is looking at all the facts of the case or drawing the right conclusion from tlie case a-j a whole. At any rate, I shall submit to him a case which, I think, will somewhat weaken the contention which he put forward here to-day. assistance of the honourable member for Hume, to do something effective in that direction before the financial question is finally settled. Another important matter is the proposed note issue. to be an alarmist, for I have no fear whatever about the notes being paid, but I think we are changing a very good and efficient system for one that is not going to be of any great benefit to the public interest. the States receive from the note tax £75,006 per annum, which goes into the State Treasuries for ""the benefit of thc people of Australia. issue we shall take away that £75,000 from the States, and are to make, presumably, something like £90,000 or £100,000 by means of a saving in interest on the three or four million pounds of which we are to have the handling. The people of Australia will, therefore, if they get every penny of that £90,000 or £100,000, only be making a profit of the difference, but there will be a good deal of expense attached to the business, and other incidental expenditure that will bring the profit down practically to nil. Another point is that the Prime Minister will really have a loan in disguise. He will have three or four million pounds to play with, which he can use as a loan, and yet he says he is not going to borrow. about it. It will be a loan, but I suppose it will be in a form which will enable him to keep within the plank of the Labour platform whicli prohibits borrowing. ling the honourable member. about it, but Australia'will be no better off fair taxation to the States, but the Commonunder the Prime Minister's proposal than wealth is then to ask those who happen to if we borrowed three or four, million own more than £5,000 worth of land to pounds and paid interest on it outside. The note issue mav become risky if a financial crisis arises. There may be an overissue, and then the people who have to handle the notes may find that they have depreciated in value. I do not predict that that will happen, but I cannot see that the people will get any great benefit from the innovation. I can see.no stamp of genius on the proposal. It is more legerdemain than anything else. It is a disguised loan after all, and the real benefit to the community will be about nil. In fact, it will be a more rigid system than the present, because, if money is wanted now, bank notes can go out freely and I hope, with the come back to the banks, and there is no tightness in the currency. orable member remember when the notes I do not wish of the Bank of Van Diemen's Land were selling for 8s. or 9s. in the £ 1 in the streets of Hobart in the nineties? orable member cannot say that there is any likelihood of the same thing happening Under the present arrangement with the notes of any existing Australian bank within the lifetime of honourable members. The financial system of Australia is in an exceptionally sound state so far as By the new note bank notes are concerned. They are a first charge on the assets of the banks, each of which has in its coffers about seven sovereigns for every note that it has floating about. There cannot be anything risky about such a system. Another contentious matter is raised by the following paragraph in the speechA measure will be submitted to you to provide for a progressive tax upon the unimproved Value of land, with an exemption of ^5,000. I do not want to go into that matter at this stage, because it is very important and far-reaching, but, broadly, I hold that the time has gone by when the Federation should touch the land of the Commonwealth, unless there is some special or pressing emerI t is of no use to quibble gency.

States will have to get as much revenue as they can from all sources They will need it badly, because they will be receiving less from the Commonwealtli than hitherto, and their expenditure is going up. They have to develop their territories, to maintain and build railways, roads, and bridges, and to make effective their public health, education, and a thousand and one other activities. They will want even more revenue than they want to-day, and will have less opportunity of getting it. There will, theretoic, be :i very tight pinch for the States. blow at the States-that is one of the objects of it.

A great many of the members of the Ministerial party think that it will have the effect , of causing Australia to be settled by a large number of farmers, but the land which is going to be burst up by the tax-if anybursting up takes place-wil l be the poor stuff. The owner of the rich land will hold out to the last. If honourable members opposite, who know so much about the land, intend to ask poor people to go on to poor land they will be doing an excessively cruel action.

Where only one member is returned for each constituency, there can be no better method of recording votes than that applied in Tasmania to the election of members of the State Upper House. ' It allows the public the widest range of choice, and insures that the candidate elected shall have the support of the majority of those who have taken die trouble to go to the poll. ber is referring to what is known as the contingent voting system? ferential voting system. My view is that it should be applied to the election of members of this House. of the Chamber was returned on a minority vote. these views because of what occurred at the last election. We should make it impossible for any one on either side to be elected on a minority vote. At the present time the political organizations do what they can to prevent candidates from offering themselves, so that there shall be no splitting of votes; but with the preferential system that would be unnecessary, and the public would have the widest range of choice. In every case the member elected under the preferential system represents a majority of those who voted. If there is a spark of Democracy in the present Administration, many months will not elapse before a measure legalizing preferential voting is placed on the statute-book. It is a great cry with Labour members that if they are anything they are Democrats. If they understand what Democracy means, they must require that preferential voting shall become the law of Australia before very long. An important subject, which is dealt with very unsatisfactorily in the Governor General's Speech is immigration. If Australia is to become a nation, it must attract to its shores people of the right stamp. Our population is increasing too slowly. Should, the Commonwealth and the States agree as to the means to be adopted to induce immigration, the High Commissioner, no doubt, could be of service in selecting suitable immigrants. We do not want immigrants of any sort. I should not like an inrush of people to Australia such as now takes place to Canada. We are not in a position to absorb such a large number as is going to Canada, and, no doubt, many of the Canadian immigrants are persons whom we might well be without. But there are many persons wishing to leave the older countries of the world whom we should welcome to Australia. They would come here with the spirit of determination and persistence which animated the early pioneers, who turned the forests of Gippsland, and the perhaps even denser forests of the north-west coast of Tasmania, into smiling farms. With more persons like that in Australia, there would be much less land lying idle. The States should adopt a more progressive policy of development, pushing out .railways wherever there is a prospect of good land being settled upon. At present they are too timid, leaving settlers without means for getting their produce to market. If more were done' to open up the country, settlement would follow means of communication. There are plenty of persons seeking good land. Persons of the right stamp will never regret making Australia their home. ever been on the land ? lived in the midst-of those who make their living from the land, and know their conditions. I earn my livelihood chiefly by serving those who till the soil. My sympathies are with those who have the courage to go out into the back blocks. They are the men whom I am always ready to help. The reference to immigration in the Speech is very vaguely worded. It practically makes the Government immigration policy depend upon the land tax proposals. If there is to be no immigration until the large estates of Australia have been opened up, and fertile land made available by means of a land tax, we shall have to wait a long time for it. The effect of the proposed land tax will be largely to throw poor sheep-carrying land out of use-lan d which no poor man in his senses would try to get a living from. The fertile land of the country will be the last to be thrown on the market as the result of this thumbscrew tax. Our Labour friends say. "" We are not against immigration,"" but whenever an attempt is made to induce immigration they do what they can, by writing to the Home press, or in other ways, to throw cold water on the scheme. They say that they would' welcome immigrants but that they do not want them to come until land is available for them. I ask",28,Address In Reply

150,Mr Atkinson,"No, but I have the Ministers of the Crown and the members of the Labour party who came to Australia from other countries whether they waited until there was land available for them? They have done very well by coming here, and it is creditable to them that they have improved their positions. But there must be many other persons who, given the same opportunities, would do as we'd. , : We shall not assist immigration until there is land available for the immigrants '' ? Every immigrant will not desire to go on to the land. There are manywalks of life, in which immigrants could find employment here. Once here, they would become consumers, and, before long, producers, and perhaps employers. I expected, too, that the Government programme would contain a proposal for insurance against unemployment. friends opposite are very fond of speaking of their love of humanity, and I expected that an attempt would be made by them to assist the unemployed. The. last Government, which I supported, caused inquiries to be made regarding the means of alleviatgramme of the present Government is put ing the distress which follows unemployment, aud I have no doubt that, had it remained in office, there would have been submitted to Parliament'this session a procertain legislative powers, and all. unposal for insurance against unemployment. The omission of such a measure from the Labour party's programme is a serious reflection on those who protess to be 'the friends of the poor, the distressed, and the be left without the necessary means when struggling. It would have been a grave reflection on any other party, but it is a most grave reflection on those who profess to think of nothing but the interests of the and in an indirect way unification will be poor. themselves. able gentlemen opposite should.be forward in helping the poor. side, where all the capitalists in the House are to be found. There is also another omission which I think is worth noting. In the SpeechI 'see no reference to any measure to codify the law on any subject. During the regime of the last Government we passed a Bills of Exchange Bill, which codified the law on the subject for all Australia. We also passed a Marine Insurance Bill, which practically codified the want to point out to the House what will law on the subject, and saves endless trouble to persons in searching authorities. other governing agents of the peoples of It is a most useful measure indeed to the trading community. I see no reference in the Speech to a measure to consolidate the law relating to insolvency or companies, or to other great and useful codifying measures which might be taken in hand. I see no reference to a measure which is to cater for ordinary business men and the community generally. honourable member wants to grease the fat man all the time. just remark. The honourable member is, of. course, aware that every State has an Insolvency Act and a Companies Act, but we want a measure codifying the State laws on those subjects for the whole of Australia. It is only a question of codifying existing laws on certain subjects, Our and bringing them up to date. That is a very useful work which this Parliament will have to undertake sooner or later. It is a work which was most successfully begun in one or two cases by the Fusion Government last session. When the prointo operation it will be a case of saying goodbye to the Federation.

That was a different position altogether. The members of the Labour party go about the country advocating certain measures, which they do not discuss on the floor of the House, but consider and decide in secret. We have an illustration this afternoon of how little interest is taken in the proceedings by honourable members opposite, and to what a farce they have reduced parliamentary government, simply because they know that, so far as they are concerned, the questions are settled; they are here to vote like a number of wooden automata, so that we might as well simply .touch a buttpn on the table when a vote will be taken.

184,Mr Page,"Why did not the honorableMr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON I did; but the honourable member was rather sceptical and difficult to convince. did not say it during the election. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -My constituents were aware of it. I made the announcement on the floor of the House, and it appeared in Hansard, and in the newspapers, so that there is little excuse for my constituents, and none for honourable members who were in the last Parliament, for being ignorant of the fact. I made my position perfectly clear, and it is of no use at this late stage to say that I occupied any other position, or left any one in ignorance of where I stood. I wish first to congratulate the late Government upon their dignified retirement from office as soon as they discovered that the voice of the electors was apparently against them. They proved themselves true believers in the right of the people to govern, and are thus better Democrats than the present occupants of the Treasury bench. Believing that the people had returned a majority who were not in favour .of their party or policy, they took that dignified course which has always characterized Liberals, of immediately relinquishing the reins of oflice. I wish to contrast their action with the attitude of .their predecessors, the prebenefit of the community generally. But sent occupants of the Treasury bench, who clung to office till the last moment, until absolutely driven out of it. They had not a shred of excuse for hanging on, being in a hopeless minority, and had they been in the same position as the late Government, I venture to say that during the whole period of the interregnum between the date of the election and the meeting of the House they would still have continued to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that they knew themselves to be in a minority, so far as the recorded votes of the electors were concerned. able member think that this is very weak criticism ?

I think we on this side of the House can fairly claim to have set an example of forbearance, moderation, and right conduct towards the Government, recognising that we are in a minority, and that they have a majority of supporters behind them. In fhe circumstances, our duty is plain and clear. Instead of following the bad example set by them when they were in a like position, instead of employing all the vituperative epithets which any language, living or dead, could furnish to denounce those who displaced us from office, we have adopted an attitude of philosophic resignation to an unkind and unreasoning fate. AVe are prepared to accept the position of affairs as we find it, ancl to recognise that the Government, having a majority behind them, have a right to the undisputed control of the affairs of the country. It remains to be seen whether, having behind them the absolute majority for which they have so long asked, they will carry out their pledges to those who have trusted them, and sent them here to pass certain legislation which they have alleged to be absolutely essential for the uplifting of humanity and the their programme"" does not show, and has not shown, of late years, at any rate member left the party ! Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Thehon orable gentleman has struck the psychological moment when that change took place. The principles now advocated by the party do not make for the general good of the community as a whole, but are directed to advance the interests of one class at the expense of others. Their programme does not pr.etend to do anything else. In the cold type in which we see it, there is revealed the naked truth that they are simply trying to set up one system of class legislation for another which does not exist at the present time, but whicli did exist some years ago. The Liberal party represents, and always has represented, the Democracy of the country-the right of the majority to rule, the *duty of legislators to recognise the equal citizenship of every member of the community.

And that party has always stood as an invulnerable bulwark between the people and the oppression of those in power. now, under the misnomer of Democracy, all this is to be changed, and class rule is tc be set up again, and class rule, too, of a worse and more dangerous type. Only persons who belong to certain organizations and subscribe to certain political beliefs are to be recognised; all the others are social and political pariahs, and are to be regarded as tabu. There is to be set up now, in the name of Democracy, a system of class legislation of the worse possible kind. I make that statement, not in the heat of the moment,but after full, clear, and calm 1 deliberation and consideration of all the circumstances. In regard to the composition of the present Ministry, we have another evidence of the absolute ingratitude often exhibited by members of the Political Labour party of the present day. been their practice of late years to politically assassinate those member was a member of them once. when it was a reasonable party, with clearcut principles based upon freedom and not coercion. I still hold those principles. But the party threw them-overboard. They adopted restrictive measures to redress grievances which were caused by restriction. They hauled down the noble flag of freedom, and set up in its place the skull and crossbones of coercive, tyrannical, soul-destroying Socialism. When they did that I thought it was time for me to part company with them. As a matter of fact, I claim to be the only true representative of Labour in this House. I -consider that I am a much better Labour man than is any honourable member who occupies a seat on the Ministerial benches. I challenge any Labour man to point to any word or vote of mine, either on the public platform or in this House, which has been opposed to the true interests of Labour. But not satisfied with assassinating those, who are truer Democrats than themselves, but who are not prepared to adopt their tyrannical methods, the Labour party give* the cold shoulder to persons who were associated with the Labour movement long before its present leaders were heard of. Take, for instance, the case of the honourable member for Darling. There is no man, either inside or outside the Labout party, who has done as much as he has to bring Labour into its present complete condition of, organization. I suppose there is not an individual But in Australia who has done more than he has to secure the large vote which was recently cast for Labour in the several States. He is the man who is chiefly responsible for securing victory for the flag of the Labour party.

Another honourable memI t has ber who is not in the present Ministry, but who was in a previous Labour Administration, and who proved himself a most capable administrator, is the honourable member for Coolgardie. He has rendered signal service to the Labour party, and he certainly displayed qualities of administration which entitled him to recognition at the hands of his fellows. Yet we see him displaced by a younger man, who is comparatively new to politics, and whom I congratulate upon having thus early achieved distinction. At the same time, I must say that the member for Kalgoorlie has been elevated to a position in the Ministry to the exclusion of older and more experienced men. members lodge allow him to vote for the honourable member for Coolgardie? happen to belong to any lodge, so that die honourable member's jibe falls flat.

He is a man for whom I entertain a very kindly feeling, and one who has always set a good example in this Chamber.

Those who had already enjoyed the sweets of office should have voluntarily stood aside, or, in the ordinary processes of Socialism, should have been ruthlessly cast aside, to make room for others. An Honorable MEMBER -I s the honourable member chief adviser to the' Government ? not know that I shall receive anything for my advice, but I cannot avoid making these few comments, because the monopoly of office is so palpable, and, from the Opposition benches seems so unjust in the light of the socialistic professions of the party. There is another honourable member opposite who, at one time, achieved great distinction by occupying the time of the House for quite ten hours in an endeavour to impede the progress of legislation. able member must not impute improper motives to another honourable member. suggest that he was actuated by improper motives. On the contrary, his motives may have been very laudable ones. He may have thought that the legislation proposed was not good, that it was not in the best interests of the people. I credit him with having been actuated by the most patriotic motives, and. I say that the service which he rendered to his party on that occasion should have received recognition. Yet'we still find him occupying a subordinate posiceeded with, as will be seen by reference tion. With regard to the proposals of the Government, I noticed some little time before this Parliament met, an inspired paragraph in all the newspapers stating that the Ministry were going to signalize their entry to office with a substantial majority behind them, by coming to the relief of the aged and distressed poor in a way that had never been previously attempted. They were going to liberalize the provisions of the Old-age Pensions Act by reducing the age limit in the case of women by five years. This was going to be a great boon, honourable member thinks that such a penand we were-all pleased cause there was a Labour majority? were pleased to learn what was going to be done by the Labour Government for the aged poor. The honourable member is fair enough to admit that there was never a discordant note struck in this House with regard to the question of old-age .pensions. of the present Opposition with respect to the Surplus Revenue Bill, by which the necessary funds were to be provided? Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -The Surplus Revenue Bill when introduced, as the honourable member ought to know, contained not a single reference to such a purpose, and was not designed to provide for old-age pensions. Nor when moving the second reading did the honourable member for Hume, the then Treasurer, say one word or even think of the idea of old-age pensions. It was not until some time later that the idea was suggested from another outside source to the honourable member for Hume that funds could be obtained in that way for the payment of old-age pensions. HadI known that the honourable member intended to raise the question I should have brought with me a quotation from Hansard bearing on the point. I have the passage marked, and referred to it frequently during the elections. The question was raised then as the result of a leaflet of a grossly misleading character, circulated by the Labour party, and designed to discredit the candidature of men on our side. If the honourable member will look up the speech delivered by the honourable member for Hume, in introducing the Surplus Revenue Bill, he will see that it contains no reference to the question of old-age pensions. The BiH related to entirely different matters. Its purpose was declared to be to enable public works to be proto Hansard, pages 9010 and 9847, of March, 1908.

WhetherI did or did not, the honourable member would have in the House a majority to carry it. If he and those who think with him are sincere in this matter such a proposition can be carried. to depend on the honourable member. think that is a grossly unfair imputation, unwarranted by anything in the honourable member's knowledge or experience of me. But the honourable member would not have to depend upon me or upon the vote of any other member of the Opposition. Eveni f every member Of the Opposition were against such a proposition-and they would not be-h e and his party would have a majority of fourteen to carry it. Soi f he is really sincere himself there is nothing but his own party in the way of carrying such a proposal into immediate effect. To return to the question with which I was dealing-that of reducing the age limit at which old-age pensions should be payable I may say that there was a great flourish of trumpets ' when the announcement in question was suddenly made. Just as suddenly, however, it was announced that the Labour Government had abandoned the idea and left the old people, whose hopes they had raised, to their unfortunate fate because it would cost too much. Why should money stand in the way of the humanitarian ideals of the Labour party when they have a majority to give effect to them? In the last Parliament members of the present Ministry declared that ways and means ought to be, and must be, found duce the pension age. The present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, declared that the Government of the day should reduce the age, and he went so far as to move an amendment when the Bill to amend the principal Act was before the Committee. It is well that this should be known, because I think there is due to the House an explanation as to why this project has been abandoned so hurriedly by a party which previously professed itself so warmly in favour of it, and demanded that effect should be given to it by another Ministry which had the responsibility of finding ways and means. At page 1430 of Hansard, vol. L, the present Prime Minister is reported to have saidI agree with him as to the financial difncul-ties of the situationThe reference was to the Treasurer, who had pointed out what the cost would behut I 'am not of opinion that we should let slip this opportunity to liberalize our invalid and old-age pension* law as much as possible. It might be more advanced, and I think that we should take this occasion to enlarge its scopeHaving quoted section 15 of the principal Act, the honourable gentleman went on to sayVVe should face our difficulties whether they be financial, economical, or political. The publie officers of the Commonwealth and of the States have to retire at the age of sixty' years, being then considered unfit for longer service, and, generally speaking, private firms adopt a similar rule. It must be remembered that applicants for old-age pensions ^re, for the most part, persons who have been engaged in much more arduous and less healthy occupations than those of public servants. I think'that the age at which an invalid pension could be obtained, should be earlier. That has always been my view. . . . I hope that the Treasurer will accept the amendment which I intend to submit so that the Bill may be passed with as little delay as possible..

I believe in legislating effectively against trusts and combines; but I fear that, when we come t.o discuss the Government measures, there will be a wide divergence of views, so far as Ministerialists and members of the Opposition are concerned, and probably members of the Opposition will differ among themselves as to what should be done. According to the manifesto of the Labour party, coal vends are among the corporations, trusts, and They. seem at first glance to be combinations to be dealt with; but when what is popularly known as the Anti-Trust Bill-the Australian Industries Preservation Bill-wa s under discussion, it was sought by Labour members to exempt the Newcastle Coal Vend from its operation, and if my recollection serves me aright, by the honourable member for West Sydney, among others. is quite wrong. pression is that the honourable member was We are told that it is proposed in favour of not applying the provisions of the measure to that Vend. correct. cept the honourable member's statement.

241,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Th eis in error. There has not been a different attitude assumed. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -In the manifesto of the Labour party, published in the Svdney Daily Telegraph on the 7th March, a little before the last election, this statement occursThe nationalization of monopolies demands the urgent attention of the people. It may be admitted that trusts and combines have not yet attained the same giant proportions in Australia as elsewhere, but, notwithstanding out youth, the capitalistic system is developing here upon the same general lines. Already we have in Australia the sugar monopoly, the tobacco combine, the coastal shipping ring, the coal vend, and various minor business combinations of a character detrimental to the public. orable member take exception in that paragraph ? Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON I do not take exception to the paragraph; I quoted it in evidence of my assertion that, since the strike, the Newcastle Coal Vend has been regarded by the Labour party as detrimental to the public interests. change of attitude is inexplicable. of attitude. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON I cannot stop now to turn up the Hansard record in support of what I have said as to the speeches of the honourable member for Newcastle, and the late Leader of the Labour party,' in favour of the Newcastle Coal Vend; but I undertake to make the quotations myself on some subsequent occasion, or to get some other honourable member to make them. It will then be manifest that, when the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was under discussion in this Chamber, /two members of the Labour party at least sought to exempt the Newcastle Coal Vend from its operations. In my opinion, monopolies can be properly dealt with, only by allowing free competition. There is no other way. By nationalizing them, and making them State concerns, you only entrench them more strongly. Of course, I am now expressing niy individual views. Some of the honourable members opposite, who hold that monopolies, trusts, and combines, should be destroyed, combined-Fre e Traders and Protectionists alike-to pass legislation which, in its nature, tends to bring these evils .into existence. They united with others to give Tariff protection to local industries, and by securing local manufactures from competition, gave opportunities for combination. leader led the van. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -He is not now leader of a wholly Protectionist party. The prevention of outside competition gave over the local market to the local manufacturers. AA'hen local manufacturers, secure from outside competition, were competing in the 7 various States one against the other, the most natural thing for them to do was to confer amongst themselves, and to say, "" What is the use of our competing in this fashion and cutting each other's throats? AA''hy not form a combine, so as to keep up prices ancl maintain profits, whilst we have a monopoly of the trade secured to us by law?"" That was done, and is still, being done. It was done in consequence of legislation passed only with the assistance of the Labour party. But forthat assistance the legislation could never have been passed. This Parliament is responsible for the"" establishment of monopolies in Australia, and the greater This part of that responsibility rests with the Labour party. Having created monopolies, they now propose to cure them, not by restoring freedom, but by creating a still larger 'monopoly. So far as I am concerned, they will not get very much assistance in that direction. poly when the State controls it. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON A monopoly is not less a monopoly because the State runs it. AA'herever competition is shut out, there must be monopoly, and a monopoly in the hands of a few is no different in its nature from a monopoly in the hands of a larger number. The true remedy for monopolies is to repeal that legislation which has enabled them to come into existence, and to restore natural and healthy competition in trade, so as to allow us to get the best that is offering at the lowest possible cost of our own labour in exchange. That is the fair and the proper thing to do, and, in my.opinion, the only way to put an end to monopolies. sweating. Mr AV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -It is the very thing to prevent sweating.

If I have done nothing more than to arouse some of our lethargic friends opposite to a sense of their responsibilities to the electors also informed in tlie Governor General's --if I have succeeded in bringing them out of their shellI have justified my action in rising to offer a few remarks. There is also a reference in the Governor General's ""Speech to a Bill to provide for uniform postage rates throughout the Commonwealth, and to the adoption of a uniform Commonwealth stamp. ' We are not informed what kind of a stamp it is to be. Is it intended to establish a system of Inter-State penny postage?

But I am afraid that when the financial aspect of the matter is dealt with, the Minister will find some excuse for not letting the country have this boon, which has been asked for so long, and by so large a section of the people. Then we are to have a Bill for die rectification of Tariff anomalies. I should like to know whether there is any truth in the statement that we have seen in the newspapers, to the effect that the Labour party is now a solidly Protectionist body. A statement to that effect has been attributed to the Minister of Home Affairs, and a similar assertion is reported to have been made by the honourable member for Grey. It is just as well that we should know where the Ministry and their supporters stand in regard to the fiscal question. Have all our old Free Trade friends in the Labour party thrown overboard their fiscal principles and gone, solidly into the Protectionist camp ? If . so, it is only right that the public should be taken into their confidence. now referring to the honourable member for Parramatta ? referring to the honourable member himself for one, and to a statement attributed to leading men in the Labour party, and want to know whether it is true.

Why should our honourable friends have to go down Little Bourke street, and regale themselves in a Chinese cook shop? But perhaps I had better not pursue the subject any further. In the Speech, we are told, thatThe improvement of our trade relations with Creat Britain and other self-governing parts of the Empire is receiving' consideration. I am very glad to hear that, because I have a lively recollection that when we were trying in a previous Parliament to improve our trade relations with Great Britain,and the self-governing parts of the Empire, our greatest opponents were the gentlemen who now occupy the Treasury bench, and the greatest obstacles we had to fight against in trying to bring about that very desirable result were the members of the Labour party, who on every occasion voted for Tariff restrictions Every time we proposed a reduction of duty, they voted for the higher rate. Every time we tried to get a little -preference for the Mother Country, they voted against it, or voted in such a way as to give a preference only in name. I am always glad to see our honourable friends opposite repenting of the error of their ways, and taking up a more reasonable attitude, I am still more pleased when they adopt the Liberal view of these matters. The Liberal view on this particular question was only blocked from being carried into effect by the votes of those who now propose to do the very same thing that we then desired, and still desire to do. I venture to believe that when we come to deal with the matter in the . House, it will be found that this is only a placard; that, so far as its professed aims are concerned, they will not be translated into concrete legislation whicli will have the desired effect. I now come to .a question which I think is perhaps the most important one at present; it is the one thing in their election speeches which tiie party now 'propose to give legislative effect to, and that is the question of a progressive lancl tax. We heard from them a great deal about the nationalization of monopolies. We heard a great deal about the .nationalization of the [8] sugar industry, the tobaoco industry, the shipping industry, and various other monopolies, which they declared it was imperative should be nationalized at the earliest possible moment. But we do not see any proposals of the kind in the programme for the session, unless they are covered up in that nebulous paragraph which I have described as being Deakinesque in its composition. When the honourable member for Denison, in the very good speech which he delivered this afternoon, was talking about a progressive land tax, I asked a question. used to be a land-taxer. honourable member said that I was and am a land value taxer, he 'would be more corr e c t ber has been a number of things. ra te, I have never changed my opinions like the honourable member.

His speech certainly was not a Protectionist one. ' From his remarks I would have taken him to be a very deep student of Henry George; at any rate, he gave expression to views which were identical with those of that great philosophei and economist. But before dealing with his references to a progressive land tax, I desire to allude very brieflyto his remarks on finance. He said that the Commonwealth has never borrowed for' the purpose of carrying out reproductive works, and that he does not believe in a borrowing policy.

Although it is given a different name, it is borrowing, none the less. I have referred to the matter very briefly, without going into the general finanlonge? exist. Here is a problem, thecial question, which has been dealt with pretty fully from this side. There has been so much uncertainty in the atmosphere since the meeting of Parliament, and since the election, as to the purpose of the proposed progressive land tax, that I thought it well to obtain from the honourable member for Denison what, in his opinion, was its object, and I take it that, like every other honourable member on that side, except, perliaps tlie Prime Minister, he has declared to the electors that the primary, if not the sole object of the tax, is to burst up the big estates. ter himself said that. not sure, but I think that he qualified his statement on two or three occasions. told us in the most absolute way that they are going to kill monopolies. Mr W.. ELLIOT JOHNSON -True, the manifesto says that the object of the progressive land tax is to burst, up the big estates. They refer to it as the only means of curing land monopoly and paving the way for settlement; but the Prime Minister himself gives us to understand that that is all a mistake-that that is not the intention at all. He tells us that the primary purpose is not the bursting up of big estates-althoug h that may be an incidental effect-bu t the raising of revenue. . I suppose that every member of the Labour party, when before the electors, declared that the object of the tax was not to raise revenue, but to burst up the big estates. I do not say that the tax will not have the effect of bursting up the big estates; but, if On it depended the immigration policy and the it has and they are all brought within the ; exemption, how do the Government expect to at the same time raise revenue? When ""hose big estates are divided into farming ;reas, in order to attract settlers who are to assist in promoting the prosperity of the country, and assist in its defence, the tax will fail to be revenue producing. The Prime Minister must know perfectly well that, while the tax may do one or the other, it cannot do both; ancl if it does not result in bursting up the big ""estates, and off than we were before, so far as settling people on the land is concerned. The Prime Minister is in the paradoxical posi-"" tion of endeavouring to.burst up estates so that there should be none above £5,000 in value, and, at the same time, expecting to obtain revenue from big estates which no solution of which I leave to himself and his. friends. When the honourable gentleman, tells us that the object, is not to burst up big estates, he is giving the lie to the party manifesto and to the platform declarationsof every one of his supporters ; he is throwing dust in the eyes of the public, and showing that he and they have obtained their position in this House' by misrepresentations as to the intentions of the party. To show what the intentions of the party really are, I have only to quote the Attorney-General who, in the course of the weekly article, "" The Case for Labour, '' 1 he contributes to the Sydney Daily TeletionWhat is the Labour party's proposal ? It is to impose a graduated tax upon the unimproved value of land exempting-sav e in the case of absentee landholders-estates , the unimproved value of which is ^5,000 and under. The object of this tax is to burst up big estates. The Attorney-General said nothing about the object of the tax being to provide revenue; he must have known, as did every other member of the party, that if the tax succeeded in bursting up the big estates it could not, by any possibility, produce a single farthing of revenue, since big estates are not comprised in urban, but in country, areas.

274,Mr Joseph Cook,"In the manifesto hepolicy and the defence policy of the Government cannot be carried into effect. The Labour party stand condemned on their own utterances, as either intentionally misleading the people, or not knowing themselves the nature of the proposals they intend to submit. Leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, speaking on behalf of the honourable member for Nepean, saidThe first principle of the Labour party was the country, in regard to nationalization or to put a graduated land tax on the great estates land values taxation. of Australia. . . . There was as much land in the bands of 728 large holders as all the rest of the settlers of the State. If they could get rid of these 728 holders, they could divide the estates into smaller ones-and thereby allow every inch of the land to be cultivated, and thereby treble the State's population and resources. Here we have a pronunciamento by a leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, speaking on behalf of one of the pledged candidates of the Labour party. The honourable member 'for Werriwa went a little further. In. returning thanks after his election, he saidI f the party came before the public in three years and the big estates were not burst up, the people should consider them unworthy of their place. Honourable members opposite say, "" Hear, hear !"" Again, I ask them this pertinent question, which demands an answer"" If this tax is going to burst up the big -estates, how do the Government propose to obtain, revenue from such estates, in view of the exemption of £5,000?"" the problem the Government have to face; and, in reality, they are proposing.a practical impossibility. When these 728 large estates are divided amongst small farmers in New South Wales, there will not be a farthing of revenue for any purpose, unless the Government procure an equivalent to an Aladdin's lamp, or are able to create wealth simply by .touching a spring. But land nationalizationby the Commonwealth is a new development, so far as the Labour party are concerned. It was not always part of their proposals. At one time progressive land taxation by the Commonwealth was not contemplated by them, if we are to believe statements made by Mr Watson, their ex-Leader. Speaking at the Balmain Town Hall on 22nd November, 1906, and accusing our party and its late Leader, Sir George Reid, of misrepresentation, Mr Watson is reported thus. He wanted to say that, while Mr Reid was trying to frighten the farmers of Australia by the statement that the Labour party was in favour of bringing about the nationalization of the land, he omitted to put the saving clausein, namely, that the question of land nationalization was one for the State Parliaments to deal' with, and, certainly, was not to be attemptedby the Federal Parliament, or even' suggested' by the Labour party. Mr Holman, deputy It is, therefore, not so very long ago that he declared we were misleading the electors in accusing the Federal Labour party of having designs upon the lands of it. the same thing from the Labour party's stand-point. The Labour party say that as the land is monopolized, it must be the first thing nationalized. They say that the only way in which they can cure monopolies is to nationalize them. They begin with the land which is to be nationalized by means of a progressive land tax. That is their process of nationalization. ber object to that? favour land value taxation for revenue purposes: ber object to a good land tax? ferentiate between land taxation and land That is value taxation, and I do not believe in superimposing land value taxation on other taxes. I believe in a substituted tax, and not an additional tax. I believe in land value taxation to take the place of all other taxation. Henry George advocates the abolition of all taxation, save that upon land values, and not the imposition of in, numerable taxes upon every kind of industry, upon labour in every one of its manifold forms, or the superimposition of a progressive tax, unjust in its incidence, upon land values. ber in favour of removing every other tax? honourable member would support me, I should be very glad to go along those lines with him. He will have an opportunity, when I propose some reductions in the Tariff, of supporting me, if I agree to substitute, for the revenue lost through those reductions, a tax on land values.

In that respect I stand out in contradistinction to the honourable member, who, while believing, or professing to believe, in the reduction of taxation and -freedom of commerce, has always or nearly always voted for the highest duties he could get. That has never been, and could never be, laid to my charge. But die honourable member often voted with other members of his party, not in accordance with his declared principles, but in direct antagonism to them. I , on the other hand, have always voted for getting* as near to the point of the abolition of Customs taxation as I could. That is the attitude I have always taken up before my constituents, and on the floor of the House; and that I shall continue to take up when the opportunity offers. I have occupied the time of the House a little longer than I originally intended. ral Capital? stand that it is the intention of the GovernSpeaking at Renmark, on 15th January ment to proceed with that question. If they do intend honestly to carry out the provisions of the Constitution and fulfil the ported to have saidcompact made with New South Wales by the other States, through their Premiers in Conference, I see no reason to criticise them; but shall do all I can to help them forward in that laudable work. But I greatly fear that many influences of an opposite character will be brought to bear upon them to delay the realization of their expressed intention in regard to the Capital. Powerful influences are at work in Victoria and elsewhere, and a considerable section of the Labour party are trying to prevent the agreement with New South Wales from being carried into effect, or to delay it as long as possible, and keep the Federal Parliament.meeting in Melbourne. I hope, however, that the Ministry will rise superior to any pressure that is brought ' to bear upon them with that object in view, stick to their declared intention of carrying out the will of Parliament as expressed in the acceptance of the Federal territory, and proceed with the construction of the Capital as rapidly as possible, so far as funds will allow. annually ought to be put aside into a Trust ,Fund for that special purpose. the Consolidated Revenue. In conclusion, I wish to make, a few remarks upon the alleged humanitarianism of the Labour party They profess to enjoy a monopoly of that sentiment, and charge all who happen to differ with them upon any political question, with being devoid of humane principles. Yet, in practice, there is no more tyrannical body in existence. They may not recognise it themselves; but in their unions and other organizations, tyranny and coercion are rampant. There is no freedom, but rather a system of terrorism, in % some cases reported in the press, has been inaugurated whicli, if practised by other people outside the unions, would receive the severest condemnation of the Labour party. I believe, and always have believed, in unionism, but in unionism of a voluntary character, and directed into proper channels. ""Unionism, however, can be converted into a very dangerous engine of tyranny against the interests of the general community if the wrong sort of people get control; and there are very strong indications that it is being gradually so converted in some instances. Here is an illustration of what I mean. last, Mr James Dale, who is the organizer for the United Labourers' Union, is reI f a non-unionist is wheeling a truck, put sand on his wheels. If he asks you for. a light, strike a match, blow it out, and put the box back in your pocket. Never speak to him. If you are shouting in a pub, leave him out; if he is shouting, leave yourself out. Don't insult him or hurt him, for that will only arouse sympathy for him, but if any one else is punching his head, don't try to stop them. I know a lot of you would like to throw all non-unionists into the Murray, but don't do that.. Still, if you see one drowning, don't go to help him. -That passage illustrates the humanitarianism and the ethics of the Labour party, as understood by some of its adherents. They are lovely ethics to be held by any party. .They are in keeping with the ethics of the Labour journal in Victoria, whose editor published the intelligence that "" Dignity and ethics would be lacking,"" and its policy would be ''All politics and no scruples."" These are lovely ethics for a party which professes a monopoly of all virtue and righteousness, and to legislate in At least £250,000 the interests of the whole community.

288,Mr W.

Is that statement contained in the slip from which the honourable member has quoted ? extract states that Mr Dale is the organizer for the United Labourers' Union. I have simply read a press quotation'; and I do not accept any responsibility for its accuracy. None of us can do that. But I am quite sure that if similar sentiments had been uttered by any capitalist or noncapitalist who did not happen to be a unionist, they would have been condemned in the roundest terms, and -the adjournment of the House would have been"" moved for the purpose of directing public attention to them. honourable member has read may resemble the allegation which was made against the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. it is strange that the report has never been contradicted. The paper from which I have read the report is dated as. far back as January -last; so that there has been ample time for contradiction. When statements are credited to individuals in the public press, and are not repudiated by them, it is reasonable to regard those statements as accurate. I have corrected inaccurate statements concerning myself in the very next issue of certain journals; and yet those statements have been brought up against me by Labour Socialists three years afterwards, and no mention whatever has been made of the correction, which has been conveniently ignored. sufficient to induce my honourable friends opposite to rise in their places and tell us what transpired at the caucus meeting of the Labour party before the ' draft of the Governor General's Speech was agreed to. It would be very interesting to learn from them the reason why we suddenly hear no whisper regarding the nationalization of the sugar industry, or of the tobacco industry, or of other monopolies which were to be among the first evils to be dealt with by the Government. I hope that honourable members opposite will tell the House what they told their constituents during the recent election campaign, and will explain why they are now so silent on matters upon which they were so eloquent prior to 13th April* last. I shall be very glad to acquire such knowledge, and I am sure that the House will be greatly interested in it. Honourable members will doubtless expect me to be a little nervous in essaying to address the House for the first time, and therefore I must crave their indulgence. Personally, I regard the debate upon the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply as a superfluity, which should be abolished at the earliest possible moment. To me it is made up of nothing but electioneering addresses. When I was returned as the representative for East. Sydney, I was under the impression that I should not have to appeal to that constituency again for three years. But since the opening of this Parliament it appears to me that honourable members have made nothing but electioneering addresses which can be of no benefit to the public, and which have involved a sheer waste of the money which we receive for the discharge of bur legislative duties. The Government are prepared to at once proceed with the measures which are foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech, but are prevented from doing so by this utterly futile 'discussion. I trust that, before long, some new method will be devised to overcome this useless procedure. Of course, I recognise that it must be very trying for the members of the Opposition to realize that they have no hope of displacing the Labour party from office during the next twenty years. When the honourable member for Swan was addressing the HoUseI fancy that he felt awfully annoyed because he could not cross the floor of the Chamber and take his seat upon the Ministerial benches. Yesterday I trust that I have said I listened attentively to the very eloquent address which was delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. I have heard him speak many times previously. I have heard him in different parts of New South Wales, and years ago I listened to him in Victoria. I have always been interested in his addresses, but years ago I came to the conclusion that, whilst, he has a wonderful flow of language, as an administrator and a leader of men he is an absolute failure. The Leader of the Opposition described as a catalogue the printed copy 'of the Governor General's Speech. I agree with him that it is, and I tell the House and the country that the book that is going to be compiled from that catalogue will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth.

Honourable members should bear in mind that the British Parliament does not worry about the Constitution. What is written in the British Constitution could be set out on a very small slip of paper.

The land question is one which has troubled the whole world. We have to thank our Irish brothers in the Imperial Parliament for the courage they displayed in tackling the great land question, and for awakening the people to the fact that a monopoly has existed in the possession of land, and that for years the people have been deprived of the use of God's acres by which to create the wealth essential to their happiness. Our English friends would hardly believe that in Australia, where every man and woman has the franchise, such a state of affairs could exist as that which is described in the Argus of this morning, in which the statement appears that in New South Wales there were no less than 700. applicants for one block of land. Is not that a state of things which those intrusted with the duty of leading the people should speedily alter? Who but the Labour party has brought forward any proposal to deal with tliat state of affairs ? Our friends on the other side were in office for several years, but they never brought forward any proposal to solve this great question. They sat ancl drew their I hold that when the people screws, delivered long addresses to the people upon nothing, and their administration was an absolute failure.

296,Mr West,"When I say that the Conwell stick to it. ThoughI am new to parliamentary life, I know something of the wriggling and twisting of it, and I have noticed some funny things even during the few days I have been a member of this Parliament. The Opposition have found all manner of fault with our existing elective system. They contend that it requires radical alteration, but apparently they were unable to find that out until they were asked to change their seats. As soon as they. were condemned by the people to the cold shades of Opposition, they discovered that the elective system by which members are returned to the'Commonwealth Parliament is a rotten system, full of faults. I should like to remind honourable members .opposite that at the last election I polled the highest vote secured by any person occupying the honourable position of representative of the premier constituency of Australia. Mr .TUDOR -What about Melbourne? and I play second fiddle to none. The percentage of electors who voted at the last election was higher than at any previous election that has taken place in the Commonwealth. That is a sign of improvement, and while a system is improving we should not alter it. If the elections showed -a reduction in the percentage of votes polled, I could understand the complaint against the system. I think we should adhere to it until it is proved to be a failure. I have no doubt that honourable members opposite find their reason for complaint of the present elective system in the results of the appeal to the electors on the 13th April. They made some marvellous discoveries on that occasion. It took the thunder out of them, and they found it difficult to realize that a'certain event took place. They discovered then that their misdeeds had come home to them, and that they would hstve to roost on the Opposition benches for a' long time. most unlucky day. interrupts me I shall have to tell him something about Parramatta, the only constituency in which he could find a seat. Some inquiries have been made about the policy of the Government in connection with immigration. hitherto been merely a subject of conversation between parties. Under the existing system, persons come from other parts of the world to our large cities to compete with people already there, and seeking employment. Such a system can no longer be tolerated. I admit that more labour may be required, in the interior, but I think people should not be encouraged to come to Australia unless it can be shown that they will be able to obtain a livingwage when they get here. I have beenconnected with trade unions, friendly societies, and social organizations all my . life, and I have been in communication with similar organizations in the Old Country. When I was consulted on the subject of immigration by some representatives of those organizations, what could 1 say to them? I had to tell them that they would have to take their chance. I could not give the hope of permanent employment, or of earning £ 2 a week. I could not offer the rates which that great man, Mr Justice Higgins, of the High Court, has pronounced to be the living wage. As soon as we can offer men in Great Britain a living wage, there will be plenty of immigration. Our head officials here will then be only too pleased to communicate with responsible persons in Great Britain. It will not be necessary to advertise by means of lanternslides snowing record wheat crops, oranges8 or 10 inches in diameter, and cauliflowers4 feet across. Without such expenditure we shall get the creme de Id crime of the industrial masses of Great Britain.

I desire to devote myself to a few of the points contained in the Governor General's Speech. There is, in the first place, a reference to His Excellency's Advisers. I .call attention to that term, because I am not sure as to the personality of the. Advisers. We know who constitute the Government, but we do not know who really devised the speech which was placed in His Excellency's hand. So far as we can understand) it appears to have been the work of the whole body which sits behind the Government. "" Advisers '' refers to the whole of the Ministerial party. great concern to me what particular men lead the Government in this Parliament, but it is a matter of very great interest to rae that the country should be well governed. I am quite prepared to support the present Government in measures which commend themselves to my judgment and my sense of what is right, but the Speech contains some proposals which are questionable. The first matter of policy upon which I will comment is in its terms excellent. in view of the urgent necessity for encouraging an influx of suitable immigrants to the Commonwealdi, in order more effectually to develop its great resources, and to defend if against possible invasion, His Excellency's Advisers have adopted a policy which it is believed confidently wiil, by making fertile lands available, speedily induce a large number of people of the right kind to settle in this country. That, as I have said, is excellent. It is a statement which we might reasonably have expected to find in a similar document emanating from this side of the House, if the present Opposition had been in occupancy of the Treasury bench. But we have had a clear indication in the speech of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat of the feeling of intense opposition existing in the Labour party to anything in the 'form of immigration. 1 also hold in my hand a copy of a resolution carried at a conference held at the Trades Hall, Adelaide, l t is one of many similar pronouncements even, stronger in their terms. I notice this one, however, because, as far as I know, it is the latest public declaration dealing with the attitude of the Labour party towards this question. It readsWe have listened That the Federal and State Governments be approached in reference to the misleading advertisements appearing in the English press regarding Australianimmigration. member support misleading advertisements ? leading advertisements, but I have so much faith in Australia that I do not believe that any advertisements could be too glowing to paint the possibilities of success for the right type of people if they choose to'come to this country. The point is, however, that this Government put into the mouth of His Excellency words which, in themselves, In that case the term are most commendable, and which I believe everybody in the Commonwealth outI t is not a matter of side the Labour party would be prepared to indprse. But the Labour party itself is absolutely opposed to the policy of encouraging immigration, which the Government announce themselves as determined to pursue. We have a right to know from the Government whether they think themselves sufficiently strong to carry through this excellent item in their programme, and whether the party sitting behind the Ministry will support them in their laudable intention. I take it that there is no more It is stated that important question before us than this. We may talk as loudly as we like about defending Australia, making it a white man's country, and peopling it with the right class; but if the supporters of the Government are determined to frustrate every practical attempt that is made to accomplish the object in view, there is small hope of",49,Address In Reply

It is a fact that speeches have been made in this Chamber by members of the Labour party antagonistic to bringing immigrants to this country. It is a fact that the latest Labour Conference held in Adelaide has expressed a similar view. Honourable members opposite claim to be a united party, but it is evident that, on this most important matter, either the Government spoke with the intention of deceiving the people of Australia, or they spoke in such a way as to prove that there are in the ranks of their own party stronger differences than exist on this side of the House. member been complaining about persons being sent into the country under misrepresentations ? cumstances. complained in the very place which he now occupies about some men having been sent into the Goulburn Valley. ±0 draw a red herring across the trail, and I do not intend to be led.away by it. ring. unsavoury one. died if they had not been supplied with food. party is supposed to speak as a whole, to. be an absolutely solid organization, and without any rift in the lute, I venture to say that a good many things have been said by individual members of it who occupy seats here, which cannot be endorsed by the Government. Their statements cannot bs so endorsed, because they are contrary to common sense. After quoting an extract from a speech by the' honourable member for Batman, I intend to ask the Goveniment whether they assent to his statement. On Saturday, 21st May, he is reported to have said at Heidelberg-The Federal Parliament would bring forward industrial measures, and should the members of the High Court refuse to pass them they would appeal to the people to give them power over the Court. Justices Isaacs and Higgins weie with the workers, and should the other members refuse to pass the measures men would be elected to the bench of the High Court who would.

I am quite a\yare that the aim of a great many persons, who call themselves ""Socialists,"" is to. spend all the money they can in order to create the necessity for levying taxation. Their ambition is to tax property to such an extent that they will have gone a very long way indeed in the direction of accomplishing their socialistic ideals. But the vast majority of the people of this country are not socialistic at heart. They believe that certain things can best be carried out by the Government. So far as the great producing and manufacturing interests are concerned the great bulk of the people are in favour of our present system. millions which it would cost ' to secure in Sydney a Federal Territory? we should acquire buildings in Sydney to any greater extent than we have done so here. I favour an amendment of the Constitution whereby the Federal Capital could be located for a number of years in Sydney, and afterwards, perhaps, for a number of years again in Melbourne. can pursue the idea to'its logical conclusion if he chooses. My point is that at the present stage of our history, when large expenditures are looming in the distance, we cannot afford the cost of creating a capital. According to the Governor General's Speech it is intended to repeal the Naval Defence Loan Act. That, of course, Is quite in accordance with the policy of the Labour party. But what does it mean?. It means that it will be necessary to take £3,500,000 out of revenue to accomplish that object. Then the Labour party have in contemplation the construction of a railway from South Australia to Western Australia, as well as the taking over of the Northern Territory. All these . proposals may be right and proper, possibly judicious ; but, in view of the fact that they involve enormous expenditure, it appearsto me to be nothing more or less than sinful that there should be a proposal to spend some millions of pounds on the construction of a capital which nobody really needs, and which would not serve any useful purpose. , Constitution. Why talk about it now? does not fix any time; it simply provides that the Federal Capital shall be in New South Wales, though not within 100 miles of Sydney; and that, pending its establishment, the Seat of Government shall be in Melbourne. I believe that every Victorian would be prepared to assent to an amendment of the Constitution to allow the Seat of Government to be for a time in Sydney,' rather than that we should at once be putto the expenditure necessary to establish a Federal Capital which would simply be a white elephant. ings in Sydney, and we should have to rent, so that the expense would' be just as great.' ing forecast.

The Governor General's Speech further indicates that the im. provement of our trade relations with Great Britain, and other self-governing parts of the Empire, is receiving consideration by the Government. I do not know what the Government have in contemplation; but there are various proposals, which I view with a certain amount of alarm, in the direction of placing export duties on our staple products.

343,. Mr Palmer,"And I did right inThis was twelve or eighteen months ago, and the resolutions were submitted to the honourable gentleman who now holds the office of Minister of Trade and Customs, and who received the deputation, as he receives every deputation, kindly .and graciously. The proposal has hardly yet taken definite shape; but it is being discussed, and is causing a considerable amount of anxiety. Another proposal, which has yet hardly taken definite shape, but is being discussed, and is causing a considerable amount of anxiety, involving, as it does, a large sum of money to the producers, is to put an export duty on hides and skins. My point is that, if we impose excessive duties against Great Britain and other portions of the Empire, and then adopt a policy of. export duties, so far from strengthening the trade relations, we shall tend to make Australia self-contained, and, independent of the other parts of the Empire. I Hold most tenaciously to the idea that the best interests of the country are conserved by making the conditions of the producers as easy and profitable as possible. I am glad to know that Victoria, and, to a certain extent, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, are exerting themselves with a view to settling an increased number of people on the land; but the conditions necessary to satisfactory settlement, with the result of making the peoples prosperous and happy, and promoting the general welfare of the country, cannot be brought about by, on the one hand, imposing a land tax, and, on the other hand, reducing the selling value of the commodities produced. ' We have to be . very guarded in regard to matters of this sort. The wealth and prosperity.of the country depend on what we are able to take out of the soil. Our mining interests are great; but the greatest of all the interests of the Commonwealth is that of land production. WhatI dread is that the present Government may adopt a policy which will be inimical to the best interests of those easy, and at the end of which there was a connected with the land. There is another proposal, which, as yet, has not taken definite shape, to impose Trades Hall conditions in regard to hours of labour on rural industries. sin, would it not? but it would be a calamity. It would bring about conditions', which, so far from increasing the welfare of the labourers, would eventually mean that scarcely any of those interested in the land would go outside their own families for workers. If the conditions are such as to render it unprofitable to employ labour, then labour will not be employed, and the labourers must suffer. . honourable member think that the men are employed for philanthropic reasons? would fill more than a page. I may be allowed to congratulate the Government on the very strong position which they occupy. I have only one regret, and that is that every other Government since Federation has not occupied a similarly strong position. But the stronger' the position, the greater the obligation and responsibility devolving on the Government. We have every reason to hope -that the Government will carry out their policy; because, so long as they do so,, we can regard them as honest men. They are constitutionally in their position, and I think they value it oh that account. Many reasons have been urged for the great result which was accomplished at the last general election. We admit defeat; we on this side have come back weakened in numbers, and many of us, who previously had large majorities in our electorates, have now only small majorities. honourable member? I am perfectly happy and satisfied. I believe, however, that if the Government attempt to carry into effect their policy, we on this side will be back into power before the end of the next three years, and the present Ministerial party will be in Opposition. Honourable members, perhaps, remember the ancient Greek myth concerning Hercules in his youth. In a dream, Hercules was at the parting of the ways. He saw before him one way which was smooth and fine-looking city. The ooher way was steep and difficult, and he was. puzzled as to whicli he should take. He dreamt that he saw a maiden coming from the city along the smooth way, and that she said to him, ' The city yonder is full of pleasant 1 people, who will treat you kindly; you will not be required to work in the heat and dust if you-go there, but will be able to sit under the shadow of the trees and listen to the music of the birds and of the harp ancl lyre.""

The pleasant things that they offer you in that city are not worth having, and when you get them are not worth the price that you-will have had to pay for them."" The modern Hercules is the voting strength of the people. The reason that the Labour party find themselves with a large majority to-day is that they have been .promising the people easy times, easy conditions of labour, and large pay. The Government have succeeded to an honourable position, and I will say, to the credit of every member sitting opposite, that they have attained to it by energy, perseverance, skill, and labour. But they told the mass of the people that they can have easy and happy conditions by taking life easy, and any party which gains power by promises of that sort is bound to wake up, sooner or later, to the fact that the people have found them out, because they have made promises which the people can only have fulfilled at too great a price. I have, said my say. I have entered my protest against the building of the Federal Capital, and indicated my intention to support the Government while they submit proposals which are reasonable and commend themselves to my judgment. We on this side of the House are prepared to give the Government every legitimate consideration, in spite of the fact that study the land legislation of the various when the positions were reversed they treated us with the utmost unkindness. did not intend to take any part in this debate, but I wish to make some observations in'connection with replies given to-day by the Postmaster-General to certain questions. I should very much prefer the Minister to be here to listen to my remarks regarding him. In the meantime, I may be pardoned for complimenting my honourable friends opposite on having attained the position that they occupy. I have' been puzzling my mind as to how they came there. Many have said it was because they fixed the election for the 13th April. I was not muchtaken with that idea, and began to realize that the name of their party had something to do with the result. It will be noticed that the word Fusion contains three vowels-I , 0, U-and three consonants-N , S, F-no t sufficient funds. Any party that could carry a name of that kind to victory would really deserve their success. It is most remarkable that they never noticed the peculiarity of the name which they adopted, and the way in which it could be dissected. Had they done so, I think they would have changed, not only the date, but also the name, before they went to the electors. I have little to say in antagonism to the remarks of honourable members opposite, because in general they have been very mild and moderate. They have taken up a most commendable attitude, from the Leader of the Opposition down to the rank and file who have spoken to-day, and their arguments have not made any serious inroads on. the Government policy. In many respects they have comt mended it, and their only difficulty appears to be to realize that it is capable of being put into practical effect. I believe that every item in the programme is not only capable of solution, but calculated to give ttie people large and important reforms, which will tend to develop the country and improve their conditions. I am delighted that the Government have adopted a land tax policy, which is so much in accord with the wishes of the electors. When the Bill gets into Committee it will be necessary to thoroughly consider its bearing on the many systems of land tenure existing in die. different States. It will be then that the skill and ingenuity of those who have served in the State Legislatures before being returned to this Parliament, and who have had occasion to States, will he of service in assisting the Government to place this . burden on the shoulders of those who, constitutionally and otherwise, are entitled to bear it. As the honourable member for Echuca has remarked, all parties are in agreement with the first section of the Governor General's Speech. Ha$ the Fusion Government remained in power-in other words, had they secured a majority at the polls-m y strong belief is that they would have been very early in the field with a proposal of this character. It was because prior to the'recent election they lacked the necessary courage that they did not submit such a-proposal themselves. When the Leader of the Opposition declares that land taxation is a State matter he does not do justice to his own knowledge of the Constitutions of the several States and of the obstacles which lie in the path of reform by reason of those Constitutions. I have always wondered why he urges that this is a State and not a Federalmatter.

Honourable members will recollect that close upon two years ago, from information which I had received, I felt it to be my duty to endeavour to secure a thorough inquiry into the conditions obtaining in the great postal service of Australia. There were not many honourable members who possessed the knowledge which had come to me in my capacity as a representative of the people. me were of such a character that I was compelled to conclude that there was only one way of remedying those conditions, namely, by instituting a thorough inquiry into the administration of the Department from top to bottom. How the matter was brought forward, and how the fate of the Deakin Government hung trembling in the balance when the division on my motion was taken, is now a matter of history. It He is also upon record that the motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to conduct an inquiry into our postal administration was carried only by a very narrow majority. There were not many honourable members who really recognised the importance of my proposal. I am sure that -the present Leader of the Opposition did not. I am satisfied that when he learns the residt of that inquiry he will I contend that it is not admit that he was in error in taking up the extreme attitude which he assumed on' that memorable occasion. However, the Commission was appointed. Whether it was appointed with the idea that it should perform, 1 cannot say. But certainly its history has no parallel in Australian politics. From its very inception it has been harassed, misrepresented, and maligned by the press with a view to bringing about its humiliation if not its annihilation. I desire to But despite all the abuse which has been heaped upon it, the Commission has steadily pursued its inquiries: I regret the stand whicli the Postmaster General took up to-'day. Honourable members may set what value they please upon I have frequently listened with the Postal Commissionthe value we ask to be set upon it is simply that which will attach to the report that we intend to submit. We ask only to be judged by our report, and not by any conclusions that may The most important plank in the -be prematurely arrived at by our friends or opponents. It is not only unwise, but inI am glad to note discreet, for a Minister to take up the attitude adopted to-day by the Postmaster General. There is no party feeling in this inatter. The Commission is beyond party. It was appointed to deal with a great Department of State in which the whole of the people are interested, and having regard to the magnitude of the inquiry, I hold that there is no reason for any party feeling in connection with it. My desire is that the country shall obtain the best results from the labours of the ComiTiission. Tlie Postmaster-General has already been informed that the Commission The facts placed before anticipates having its report ready for presentation not later than the beginning of October next, and we hope by energy and application to -bring our labours to a close at an even earlier date. . The Commission has already arrived at a conclusion in regard to two important branches of the Department whose operations they were required by His Excellency's Commission to investigate. The management of the Department which was the first work allotted to us, and the question of finance, which was the second, but which ought really to have been the first, since it is the more impoilant, have been inquired into as thoroughly as practicable, and a report with respect to them has been prepared. 'A fortnight ago the Commission completed its investigations and conclusions with respect to those questions, and also came to a decision as to the telephone rates. Our report, however, cannot be submitted to the House at present, for there will have to be made to it amendments incidental to the further conclusions that will be arrived at in dealing with other important issues that have yet to be determined. present a progress or interim report. been tlie custom for Commissions to present progress, or interim, ' reports, but when I jnoved for the appointment of the Commis?ion, I stipulated, as the present Leader of Ihe Opposition will remember, that it diould be unrestricted, and. that it should have full power to investigate every phase of the work and administration of the Department. The Commission was granted that freedom. power to investigate the workings of the' Department, so to speak, from stem to stern. The several brandies of tiie Department are so interlocked, one witli another, , that an absolutely definite decision with respect to its financial aspect cannot be arrived at until the question of management has been determined. Then, again, a definite decision in regard to either of those member for Gwydir his not been dealing matters cannot be given without referencu to the matter of organization which has also to be reported upon and the conclusion upon which, in. turn, depends upon the question of discipline and the services of the Department generally. I do not believe in' a Commission submitting a progress report when the subjects which it is appointed to inquire into are so inseparably linked together that justice would neither be done to the Commission itself, nor to the Parliament if anything but a complete report were presented. The Postmaster-General was informed that we were going to submit a report not later than ist-October next, and he knows, or ought to know, that our report will contain a recommendation with respect to the vexed question of telephone rates, which has troubled not only past Governments and honourable members generally, but even subscribers. The infirmities of the service have arisen from action taken by Ministers such as that which the Postmaster-General proposes to take on ist September next. The troubles of the Department, it cannot be gainsaid, have arisen from the anxiety of the several members who have held office as Postmaster-General to popularize themselves at all cost. In their efforts to do so, they have brought about immature, ill-digested, and ill-conceived reforms, without having any reasonable guidance. Honourable members cannot get away from that fact, which will be clearly shown by the report of the Commission. We shall stand by our report, because it will be built upon the evidence that has been submitted. making a very serious charge. to perform as a member of this House. I understand, Mr Speaker, that a Royal Commission has been appointed by the Governor General to inquire into the working and administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, and I take it that until that Commission has presented its report to His Excellency,' and it has been transWe were given' mitted by His Excellency to the Government, no member is at liberty to comment upon its'actions, or the work which it has undertaken.

As a member of the Commission, I have endured in silence many actions and statements that I should have liked to resent. In the interests of the inquiry itself, I have remained silent, and would continue to do so, but that I feel I should not be justified in doing so, when a step is to be taken which, in my judgment, is likely to injure the reputation of my party, and might suggest want of confidence on the part of the Government whom I support, in the investigation that has taken place in connection with a great Department. cumstances, I think I was quite justified in saying that we have arrived at a conclusion mncerning the telephone system and charges. If it did not seriously conflict with the conclusion arrived at by the Postmaster-General, I should have made no comment. member say that the Postmaster-General was aware that the Commission had arrived at that conclusion? the honourable gentleman was aware that we had promised that our report would be ready early in October. I can understand a Minister being anxious to do something which might place his name on the scroll of fame. That is a weakness of Ministers in all countries. 'Knowing that weakness, I might have excused die honourable gentleman's action if his proposal were put forward merely as an experiment. But when I know that a similar action in the past has been fraught with serious inconvenience and injustice to the general public, I am bound, as a representative of the people, at least to indicate what I think of it before it is too late to do so effectively. The Postmaster-General is bringing forward the 7A Regulation again, 'possibly in a somewhat amended form. He told me to-day that he was not adopting the report of the accountants appointed to investigate the subject of telephone charges. Two accountants were appointed by one Federal Government to give them light on a very complex question. seven months, and were supposed to be experts in the matter. They furnished a report which I have glanced through, and studied to some extent. Their investigation deals only with this branch of the Department in one State of the Commonwealth-Victori a -and is incomplete even as regards that [9] State. In many respects it is misleading and erroneous. I contend that even if the conclusions in that report were based upon the facts inquired into in the State of Victoria, the Postmaster-General should still hesitate to adopt them because of the partial character of the inquiry. Any one who knows anything of the subject is aware thai ic is useless to try to lay down a system based upon an inquiry into the conditions in one State alone. The systems differ materially,in the different States. In taking over the postal service at the inauguration of the Commonwealth, we assumed the control of six distinctly different systems. In the cirThese have not yet been assimilated, and any inquiry into the subject likely to suggest conclusions on which the public might rely and the Government act, should be one upon the working of the whole of the Postmaster-General's Department. In the circumstances, I do not quarrel with the Postmaster-General for refusing to accept the accountants' report, seeing that it is an incomplete report. Mr Hesketh, who, by reason of his position, has a right to be regarded as the guide of the administrative head of the Department, is a man who has displayed. some originality in his investigations into telephony and similar subjects. I am speaking now of what Mr Hesketh had done before the Commission was appointed. He went into the question before toll rates were introduced into the Commonwealth. I remember it well, because I went into the matter with him at the time. He investigated the systems in operation in other parts of the world, and after a searching inquiry came to the conclusion that the -measured, or toll, system was the only equitable system that could be adopted in conducting a service of this kind. That is the conclusion at which he arrived from an experience of what is done in other countries. He was asked by the Postmaster-General of the day to report upon the question, and did so as official head of this branch of the Department. He informed the Postmaster-General that it would be safe to adopt a measured service, provided it was laid down on well-defined lines. His recommendations on the subject have for years past been available to honourable members, and it would have been They sat for about a good thing for the Commonwealth if the Postmaster-General of the day had acted upon Mr Hesketh's recommendations, instead of declining tn accept the advice tendered to him, and practical Iv forcing upon the country a system which has been largely responsible for the troubles that have arisen",56,Address In Reply

363,Mr Webster,"No, I do not; butin this Department. Mr Hesketh stands by the position he assumed at first, and, acour work. cording to the report recently tabled by the Postmaster-General, maintains that the policy he recommended in the early stages of the consideration of the question should still be followed. He gives advice to the Minister, and then comments, as, in order to protect himself, he had a perfect right to do, upon the rates proposed by the Postmaster-General. Regulation, or the proposals of the present Postmaster-General, will not do what we are so anxious to do-giv e the Commonwealth a satisfactory telephone service. That is exactly what the Minister was told when those rates were originally proposed. But the Minister took no heed of the advice then given him, and in what the Minister is now endeavouring to do, we have merely a repetition of what took place before. I am exceedingly sorry that this should be so, in view of the fact that in a month or two, by the ist October at the latest, the whole of' the evidence collected by the Royal Commission in connection with this question, and the value of which every one will be able to judge for himself, will be in the hands of every member of this House. I have no doubt that every honourable member who has the welfare of his constituents at heart will be able to discover from that evidence the real history of this question. Honourable members will pardon me for taking up the time of the House in dealing with the matter at this stage. I should not have done so had not the Minister definitely decided to introduce, on ist September, a system of telephone rates based upon data that is absolutely unreliable, and which has nothing to recommend it. The Minister has told us that he is not going to follow the advice of the accountants, and that he is not going to accept Mr Hesketh's advice, except in part. Of course, one must admire the man who has the courage to do what he believes to be right, but, as the information necessary for the guidance of the Minister is not yet within his reach, and the counsel which he can get is not the most reliable, he should consider whether he will act wisely in making any change of rates until the report of the Commission has been presented. The public would not suffer any inconvenience from the postponement. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -When does the had time to make it, however energetic he Commission propose to report? ist October, and as much earlier as may sary to know, and which cannot be known be possible.

The rates proposed will not fit the conditions which exist, and whose"" existence will be made known by the facts which are to be placed before Parliament. Of course, if the Minister or honourable members do not require' information, if they are willing to risk' their constituents' welfare without taking advice, that is their affair.

I am very pleased that the electors have given me the opportunity to be present again here, and, putting party considerations on one side, I am really sorry that one of my colleagues is not here to help me to pilot the Commission's report. The question at issue is, not only how can the telephone service be made to pay, but also-and this is more important than the matter of finance-how can it be made efficient. The mere analyzing of figures brought together by accountants, without an investigation of questions of administration, will not solve our difficulties.

371,Mr Greene (Richmond) [9.23],"last night by my honourable friend, the member for North Sydney, in regard to the sugar industry. He seems to be under the Impression-perhap s I should say the misapprehension-that the Parliament of this Commonwealth, in having given to the sugar growers a bounty, conferred a very great benefit upon them, and laid a very heavy burden upon the people. In the first place, I do not think this Parliament has given the sugar growers a great advantage; and, in the second place, I do not think that, in granting the bounty, Parliament laid a very heavy burden upon the people. Few really understand how the Excise and the bounty on sugar operate. As a matter of fact, the grower loses all the time, and the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth gains very considerably. On every ton of sugar produced, there is an Excise duty of £ 4 per ton, but the Commonwealth hands back to the grower £ 3 per ton by way of bounty. As a consequence, the grower is out to the extent of £ 1 per ton on every ton of sugar on which he receives the bounty. to the extent of £ 6 per ton. far as the Excise and the bounty go, I contend that the grower of the sugar is not benefited; whilst at the same time no burden is laid upon the Commonwealth, because the Consolidated Revenue benefits. benefited since the establishment of the bounty to the extent of over .£2,000,000. money, not the Commonwealth. sue this subject very much further, but I should like to add a few words to what the honourable member for Brisbane said in seconding the Address-in-Reply. I hope that the Government will appoint a Commission to go fully into this vexed subject, and thresh it out from top to bottom. If the people of Australia are paying too much for their sugar, by all means let us know where the leakage is, and let us put it right. I now pass on to the Speech itself. The first paragraph on which I desire to say a few words is that which saysIn view nf the expiration on the 31st December next of the period during which the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States were governed by the provisional financial clauses of the Constitution, a measure will be submitted providing for payments by the Commonwealth to the several States, during a term of ten years, commencing on the ist July, 1910, on the basis of 25s. per head of their respective populations, special arrangements being made for the State of Western Australia. It has been maintained by honourable members opposite that in that paragraph the Government only propose to carry out what honourable members on this side proposed to do when they were in power last session, but I think that there is the widest possible difference between the two propositions. It must be remembered that the tentative agreement, which was come to between the State Premiers and the late Prime Minister, was subject to an appeal to the people of Australia, and, what is more, the proposed payment by the States of portion of the anticipated deficit in the Commonwealth revenue was part and parcel of the agreement, which the people at the referendum refused in to to. It is absolutely wrong for the present Government to take one portion of the agreement and say that they intend to carry it out after the people of the Commonwealth have repudiated the whole of it. They cannot take one part of it, and carry it out, unless they intend to carry out the whole agreement. There is only one right and honourable course for the Government of the day to take, and that is to fulfil section 87 of the Constitution, not merely in the letter, but in the spirit, and afterwards to start to pay 25s. per head in accordance with the |'ledge It has which they, through their responsible leaders, gave to the country. I notice lhat in the Speech die Government state diat they have already taken preliminary steps in regard to building a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. I am very glad to know that they are in earnest in regard to carrying out the work, because I believe it is essential that we should link up the whole of the Commonwealth by means of railways, but, in my opinion, one of the first preliminary steps which the Government should take before they attempt to construct any of these great trunk lines is to try in some way to come to a general understanding as to what shall be the standard gauge for all the railways in the Commonwealth, and that, I suppose, could only be clone by a conference between the States and the Commonwealth. Once they had arrived at a basis whereby we should be able in course of time to gradually unify the standard gauges of our trunk lines, then we should build, from time to time, the necessary trunk lines according to the standard gauge. I am also glad",59,Address In Reply

375,Mr Greene,"I do not wish to pur'to know that the Gov-ernment propose to ; take over the Northern Territory. I be>lieve it is essential that for the purpose ot --adequate defence of the Territory over which at present waves the Union Jack it should be occupied as early and as effectively as possible. Unlike the honourable member for Brisbane, I think it is necessary to occupy the Territory for the purpose of defence first and foremost. I do not believe that there is the slightest chance -of any nation near to Australia attempting to land on its shores, unless England is embroiled in a great European war. It is quite possible that that may happen. It is quite reasonable to suppose that it will happen some day. We, of course, hope that it will not happen, but we should prepare for that emergency. Supposing that England was involved in a great European war, and that the issue went against her to any extent, we could then reasonably anticipate that a great nation, such as Japan, or such as China must become in the -comparatively speaking near future, would seize upon that great unoccupied territory which lies to the north of Australia, and -only seize it for the purpose of occupation. I do not think that they would attempt to carry their conquest all over the Commonwealth. I believe that they would simply plant themselves down and say, "" We have taken this country, and now you have to turn us out of it . "" For that reason it is essential that we should do our utmost to populate the Northern Territory, and the Commonwealth is in a better position to do that than is South Australia. There has been ample evidence of that, inasmuch as that State has had the Territory for a very long time, and has practically done nothing with it, the white population having dwindled during the last few years. I shall not follow the subject any further, because there are one or two other matters which I wish to discuss. With regard to a Commonwealth note issue, in my opinion, the subject is a highly technical one. It looks so simple that, perhaps, some honororable members may feel no difficulty about launching the ship of State on a sea which may look perfectly calm to-day but which, I believe, is capable of becoming very stormy in time to come. If they care to trace the history of nations which have tampered with their currency in tnis particular wayI admit that they have made mistakes, and very often done things in a most unwise way-the y will only find that those nations have gone on tinkering and tampering with the subject until they really do not know where they are. I feel convinced that Australia will be wise indeed in leaving well alone. If the necessity should arise for taking a step of this description, then we may possibly be able to do something in that regard, but the subject is of a highly technical nature, and is surrounded with many difficulties which are only known to men who have had a good deal to do with finance. In the course of his speech last night the Prime Minister gave us some indication of what he really intends to do. The present note issue of the banks of Australia is something like £3,500,000. The Prime Minister gave it as his opinion, on the experience of Queensland, that if the Commonwealth carry out this project we should have an effective note issue of considerably more than that of to-day. From the returns relating to the Queensland Treasury notes, we find that, on the average, something like 48 per cent, of the note issue is effective, the rest being held by the banks, for the simple reason that a banker has to have considerable quantities of notes in all his branches to meet the constant demand of the public. Supposing the Commonwealth were to have an effective note issue of £4,000,000, it would be necessary, as a matter of fact, to issue £8,000,000 j or if , on the Queensland figures, there were an effective issue of £3,500,000, the Commonwealth would have to issue £7,000,000. I believe that such a policy must lead to the gold, which the banks hold at present, leaving Australia. If we look at the history of Canada for the last few years, we shall find that that has been the case there j the gold has constantly been leaving the country to be invested elsewhere. For my own information, the other day I took out a few figures on the subject. In the year 1903, the Dominion banks held specie, to the value of $14,219,299, while in 1907 they held $24,097,487, but the money at short loan out of Canada had advanced from $30,585,526 to $63,158,601. All that money went out of Canada as a consequence of the banks having to hold a large quantity of Dominion notes. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There were other forces at work.

382,Mr Greene,"The one to which Iresult has proved that the land was productive. The same policy is needed throughout this great continent. We have quite sufficient experience to know where our land will be profitable, and, I believe, in direct opposition to the policy of the Government, that the State Governments should borrow by all legitimate means, and push railways out into every part of the Commonwealth that is capable of sustaining a close population. If that is done, I believe it will at once solve the whole of the difficulties surrounding the immigration question. The State Governments should realize that their great duty to the people is to make the lands available. Honourable members opposite must remember that many of the people who hold the lands which they are so anxious to take out of their possession are the very men who laid the foundations of the Commonwealth in days gone by, fought the battle against great odds, and pioneered .the; way for others to come after them. It was they who assisted in the development of the continent by launching out with their capital, and endeavouring in every way to make the land productive; and it is to those very men, who seem to be a target for attack at every turn by honourable gentlemen opposite, that the Commonwealth owes a debt of deepest gratitude. One. of the greatest objections which I have to this class of taxation is that the land most suitable for closer settlement, near the railways, and in regions blessed with an abundant rainfall, is the very last which the Government will be able to break up and throw open. That is the land preeminently suited for closer settlement, whereas the land which the tax will break up and make available Ls that which lies far away from the railways and centres of population, and in those more arid regions where it is almost impossible for a small man to make a living. One of the very first effects of the land tax will be to render absolutely unproductive a great deal of country which is capable of sustaining only .1 small population in large areas -' That the debate be now adjourned.
