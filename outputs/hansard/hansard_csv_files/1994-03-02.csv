It is good to see, for electoral reasons, that We need to ask where the opposition is the apostles of Reaganism are still alive and coming from. Let us look at the track record. well on the other side of the House. The hoHark back to the Fraser government. One of nourable member for La Trobe( Mr Charles) the key things that the Fraser government did is an arch-Reaganite. What the Reagan apin 1976, if my memory serves me correctly, proach has delivered in the United States is was to reduce the number of scales in the effectively a collapsing public education income tax schedule from six to three. The system with high levels of illiteracy and net effect of that was to shift the burden from extreme problems with training and retention the wealthier taxpayers back down the scale rates, a grossly inequitable health system, to lower income earners. That was what it poor infrastructure and, of course, massive was designed to do. With fewer steps in the and growing inequality which entails a whole income tax scale, the end result will be that range of social problems which are increasthe relative proportions of income tax being ingly coming to the surface. paid by people at different levels will change, and they change adversely to lower ihcome The 1980s in the United States are a clear earners. example of the true consequences of the In more recent times, as was mentioned by trickle down approach, of the notion that if the honourable member for Lilley( MrSwan) we make the wealthy wealthier they will go in his contribution, we have had the GST. In out and create jobs for everybody and we will amongst all of the hysteria, rhetoric and so live happily ever after. Now we have the reforth that we have heard from both sides on emergence of the throwbacks in the coalition, this issue, there is one fundamental point: a with people such as ex-Senator Bishop aiming tax change such as that which was envisaged to enter this House and taking an increasingly in Fightback would have substantially shifted prominent role in opposition policy. Former income and wealth away from lower income Senator Bishop is suggesting that we need to earners in favour of the better off. Shifting get rid of things like the capital gains tax. We from a mildly progressive income tax arrangehave the hysteria that is thrown at this govment to a consumption related arrangement ernment-which, as I indicated,has reduced through the GST would have had that conseour level of tax to virtually the lowest level quence. It is difficult to determine until it is in the OECD--:in still being described by, actually enforced precisely by how much, but amongst others, the shadow Treasurer, the that is what it would have done. That is why honourable member for Mayo( Mr Downer), I think it is reasonable for us to come to the as the great 'tax and spend' government. One conclusion that the opposition is primarily wonders what sorts of adjectives he would here to represent the interests of the better off use if we were in fact aÂ· high taxing and in the community, the wealthier sections of spending government. The reality is someour society. Whatever those opposite say, what different. whatever crocodile tears they cry about inequality and the like, that is the consequence Others in the coalitionÂ· have been pushing of what they have done in government, and the notion of income splitting as, I suspect, a of what they propose in opposition. device to try to tum back the clock and to reintroduce their notion of the traditional On the income splitting issue; the Labor family as the dominant social unit in our government, through the green paper on resociety. The fact is that our society has storing full employment, is addressing some changed a great deal. We have many types of of the issues, some of the legitimate concerns. families, a much more complex framework. I commend the parenting allowance proposal To crudely examine the issue in the way that in the green paper to the consideration of some in the opposition are doing and to honourable members. That proposal provides suggest simply introducing a tax structure a oasis for people-male or female-to have based on income splitting is, in effect, a much greater support in their role as carers recipe for favouring the better off. for children.
