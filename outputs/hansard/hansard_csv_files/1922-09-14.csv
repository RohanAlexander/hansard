The action of the Government in bringing down this B ill will, I think, meet with the approval of all members in the House. For a considerable time past there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Northern Territory, because, whilst the residents are subject to taxation, they have been given no representation in this Parliament. The legislation which controls the Territory comprises Ordinances issued by the Government and gazetted, and some of them have provoked a good deal of ill-feeling. This was only to be expected, having regard to the fact that the residents prior to the Territory being transferred to the Commonwealth, had representation and a vote in the South Australian State Parliament. We can understand that the residents, as Britishers, resent bitterly, as we would do, being subject to taxation without representation. better to attach the Territory to one of the existing .State electorates?",16,Naval Work S Branch Compensation To Officers

I do not regard the proposal before us as a satisfactory means of meeting the position, and I hope that in Committee the Minister will agree to amend the Bill in the direction suggested. It cannot make any difference beyond, as I say, giving the people of the Territory that to which they are entitled. This is a special case, whicli we have to deal with on its merits. Unfortunately, the population is sparse, and unattached to any other State. When we took over the Territory those people lost their political rights; and we can well understand their dissatisfaction at having no representative in the Federal Parliament. No wonder they complain about being governed from Melbourne, for this is the kind of grievance that has caused wars in various parts of the world. There is great objection to being governed from distant centres where those who govern are ignorant of the conditions prevailing in the governed Territories. How many of us here are in a position to deal with questions concerning the Northern Territory ?

My own opinion is that we ought to visit every part of the Commonwealth, and also the Mandated Territories; but, for the reason I have stated, that is impossible, much as we may desire to go. If a representative of the Territory is admitted here, he ought to possess the same rights as we do as representatives of the people in other parts of Australia. Such a main should either have a full voting power, or should not be here at all. As I have said, I regard the proposal placed before us as an insult to the people of the Territory. There are reports that they hail with satisfaction the promise of representation; but I am sure that, when they learn that it ia representation without the power of the vote, their indignation will be great. is no vote. whether, they know that or not.

I offer no opposition to the measure, and am pleased to see it introduced even at this belated hour. A t the same time, I shall take the necessary steps to test the opinion of honourable members on the points I have raised when we reach the Committee stage. -This is just one of those half measures which will do no good. For years I have urged that the whole principle on which we treat the Northern Territory ia entirely wrong. We have created huge Government Departments there, and at one time. I believe the public servants represented a large percentage of the entire population. The other day I read an interesting artiolie by Mr Cotton, who has had great experience in the Northern Territory, where, I believe, he owns cattle stations; and the suggestionhe makes is, I think, the correct one. It is that we should treat the Northern Territory exactly as we treat the rest of Australia, that is, instead of building up huge Departments with commissioners and inspectors, and a whole array of public servants, there should be a police magistrate, with a few policemen and a clerk, to conduct the public business. I have read the reports of Mr Justice Ewing, and other Commissioners, and I can see nothing inherent in the Darwin population to call for the elaborate governmental machinery that has prevailed in the past. Mr Justice Ewing's report shows that he, at any rate, took a great deal of trouble to thoroughly understand the position there, and his opinion is one that ought to carry some weight here. Why should we not place the Northern Territory in one of the existing State electorates?

I am entirely of the opinion that there should be no taxation without representation, and I think that if we wished to increase the population of the Territory we should abolish taxation there. In 1920-21, the revenue collected in the Territory from duties on alcoholic liquors was £10, and the revenue from duties on narcotics £47, the explanation, being largely that the supplies of alcoholic liquors and narcotics paid duty in tlie south, whence they were imported. In 1917-18, these duties yielded nearly £14,000. figures from the Year-Booh, which show the revenue from the taxation of the Territory to be small, and it would be email per capita if distributed among the whole population, but, as a matter of fact, it is drawn from only a few persons. tion of any rich man who might go to live in the Territory?

In 1920*21, the Customs and Excise revenue of the Northern Territory was £3,995,' the territorial revenue, £18,846; the land and income taxation, £6,445; miscellaneous income, £12,849; lighthouse and light dues, £1,124; and stamp duties, £740; making a total of £42,999. I have not been able to obtain the land tax and income tax figures separately. In my opinion, we might well cease to tax necessary commodities in the Territory, though I would continue to impose duties on narcotic and alcoholic beverages. has been declared a necessary commodity. holic beverages should be taxable, because otherwise they would be largely imported from outside. have to be built to bring the stuff south. charges, if not wholly remitted, might at least be divided by two. The land and income taxation is collected from a very Northern Territory matters few individuals, the great bulk of the population of Darwin paying neither land nor income tax. Lighthouse and light dues are small, because few ships visit the Territory. These charges might very well be remitted. Honourable members opposite are doing all they can to attract population to Canberra, but I think that they will be disappointed, because if ever there was a wild-cat scheme introduced into this Parliament, the scheme for the settlment of Canberra is such. The honourable member ' for ing met in Melbourne a gentleman who is largely interested in the Northern Territory, where he has a big property I have taken a few and big herds of cattle. The other day I met that gentleman in the Queen's Hall, and asked him what he thought about the proposal to give representation to the Territory. His reply was, ""For God's sake, get it off your mind! We do not want it. It would 'be of no use to us."" I pointed out to him that the representation the Territory now enjoys here is much more effective than that proposed by the Minister would be. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to my suggestion. The Bill; as it stands, is useless. We do not know the source from which it emanated, but the Minister, who is big-hearted, has probably responded to some appeal made to him. However, if he thinks the matter over he will be convinced that the Territory would be better off without direct representation than if it had a representative here who could not vote. A man who, after stating his opinions in this chamber, had to go beyond the bar when a division was called, would be in an ignominious position, which neither he nor those whom he represented would consider satisfactory.

We have heard much about importing into the Territory a population quite out of proportion to the general population of the Commonwealth. am not one of those who believe thafc we can set up, in the heart of Northern Australia, a population contented and prosperous, and designed to convert that Terri tory into another Garden of Eden, while,' in fact, much more accessible parts of the Commonwealth are still untilled, and, therefore, unpopulated. We cannot proceed with the development of the Northern Territory in advance of the general development of Australia as a whole. there is one fundamental matter to which we can and ought to direct our attention. We should secure, as f a r as legislation can secure, the happiness and comfort of the people who are already in the Terriritory. out first care should be to guard their fundamental rights, that is, to give them the right to state their grievances with the hope of having them redressed before the only tribunal which can adequately deal with them, namely, the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The story of the injustice of imposing taxation without representation is too old to require repetition. Here we have an area which forms a very considerable part of the whole of the Commonwealth Territory; 1 an area which, if .1 remember rightly, comprises not les3 than 335,000,000 acres. We have in that Territory a. very scant population; b u t if we cannot take practical political measures to increase it , at least we should fight shy of anything calculated to drive out the small numbers already there. The GoThe honourable to give to the Territory representation in this Chamber. When I tell the Honorary Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) that the proposition appears -to be 'in some way part of the Government's electioneering W h i l e , on the face propaganda, he criticises my suggestion as being purely ""flapdoodle."" These people, having no votes-as the Minister somewhat sarcastically remarked in this' House on one occasion-the y cannot possibly in fluence the policy of the Government! It ia true that they have no votes, b u t it is> true also that the Government are not We have heard a good above telling the electors of the Commonwealth that they have settled the vexed question of the Northern Territory by according, to its residents representation in this Chamber. The Government, having promised representation, intend to make sure that, in the event of a close I division in this Chamber upon any matter of Government policy, the balance of power shall not be disturbed by the entrance of a Northern Territory representative. I desire, however, that this representation, shall be made effective; and the only means to that end lies in the right of the Territory's representative to exercise the vote. I have always taken what may be regarded as rather an extreme view w it h reference to But those persons upon whom the burdens of taxation and the necessity foi 1 obeying laws are imposed while they have not the enjoyment, at the same time, of the right to exercise their votes. I have even gone so far as to say, in In order to achieve that, connection w it h the history of great safestruggles on the merits of this very principle, that I would not blame any person for committing any act of extravagant conduct, or misconduct, directed against a Government that withheld from that person the right to exercise his or her vote in connection with the administration of the affairs of the country. In the circumstances, honourable members should embrace the present opportunity to extend voting power to the proposed representative of the Northern Territory. The Honorary Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) has said that he foresees some constitutional difficulty in the matter. I acquit him of the suggestion that he has any personal knowledge. I attribute to him an absolutely virginal innocence of* the constitutional position. But I assume that somebody in authority, or possessing knowledge, or who ought to",23,Granville Ryrie

He has not argued the matter in any way, and honourable members, therefore, are l e f t to speculate upon the grounds on which such an opinion, bare and barren as it is, has been founded. I need not again quote the terms of the Constitution, which, however, are perfectly clear in that they enable the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws giving a Territory representation in this Parliament under such terms and conditions-including , I apprehend, the right to vote-as the Parliament may think fit. It appears to me that the frameors of the Constitution sufficiently apprehended the justice of having our Territories represented here to influence them in making provision for that representation in the original d r a f t of the Constitution. And they made such, provision clear and definite. If there were any difficulty at a l l , I would have assumed that it would be a difficulty of securing the actual representation in this Chamber rather than in the direction of giving the selected representative a vote. However, there appears to me to be no difficulty whatever; biit, if there is, it is "" u p to "" the Honorary Minister to indicate where the difficulty lies. will not suffice. for him to say that he has been informed that the Government cannot the right to vote. stand is, I suggest, to use a much overworked phrase, pure camouflage on the part of the Honorary Minister. I sympathize considerably with the residents tory for the reason that, not only have they had inflicted on them laws in the making of which they have had no voice, but because they have been saddled with laws by persons who are quite out of sympathy w it h the first principles of democratic government. A t present, in the person of the M in ister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), the people of the Territory are subservient practicallv to the lightest whim of an absentee militarist. Any one who is familiar with the history of our Crown colonies, w i th the agitations and quarrels arising from misgovernment, from the lack of government, or due to absentee government, must realize The honourable that this kind of thing-governmen t by Ordinances in which the people of the by Ordinances which even the members of this Parliament have scarcely an opportunity to read or understand-is a direct invitation to the Territory to rebel, not necessarily by foroe of arms, but, afc all events, by simmering antagonism to the Government. what do honourable members know of local conditions in the Territory? The honourable member for Hunter( Mr. Charlton) haa well said that it is only on rare occasions that one or two members of Parliament are afforded opportunities to observe conditions first hand. It is about ten years since I , in company w i th the Honorary Minister, among others, paid a visit to the Northern Territory; and I am bound to remark that I have a much better opinion of the Honorary Minister as a genial travelling companion than as a capable administrator of the Territory. I have in my possession a long and interesting communication from a person who recently occupied a high position in the Northern Territory. I am not permitted at present to disclose his name, although I may be able to do so later. I am glad to be able to say, however, that he is a gentleman who It left the Territory with an excellent name and record among the rank and file of its residents. To take such a means that he was not deported? ported, nor did he beat a strategic retreat at the critical moment. He came away, if not covered with glory, at any of the Northern Terrirate having earned the good-will of those among whom he carried on his important duties. In a painstaking manner he has analyzed the position existing in the Territory. He points out that one of the difficulties under which its people labour has to do with the Publio Service.

91,Mr Brennan,"He was not deand stamina and destroys the good-will of the Service. He points out, too, that if some disgruntled person comes to Melbourne, and pours a tale of woe into the ear of the Minister, the probabilities are that the Minister will forthwith issue an Ordinance imposing the will of, perhaps, an eccentric upon the Territory, the Minister himself being totally ignorant of the actual conditions obtaining. When we have in this House a man who is distinctly representative of the Territory, responsible to all classes of people there, and dependent for his position, emoluments, and good name alike, upon every class, we shall not have any more of this one-sided and secret legislation. Legislaparty who believe in the application, as tion by Ordinance is just as objectionable -and that is saying a good deal-as legislation by means of regulations. There is hardly one member of this Parliament but will remember with shame and indignation what was done, especially during the war, by means of what were known as regulations, and although those regulations were required by Act of Parliament to be laid upon the table of the House, no opportunity was ever given to challenge or discuss them. The consequence was that the Hughes Ministry have earned a reputation for oblique government so unsavoury that it will probably take a good many decades to efface it from the minds of the people. The same kind of objection applies to the Ordipriving them of representation altonances. ' We are governing the Territory in a hole-and-corner manner. not governing it in a way to win and increase the respect of the people in the Territory, or in such a way as to preserve order. and goodwill amongst them. Neither are we making any serious attempt to safeguard the health of the people whom we send there to do the Commonwealth's work. I do not wish to be over-harsh, or critical of some of the people who were sent to the north to discharge important duties-reports of Commissions are on record which tell us something about them-but the undignified and humiliating flight of the late Actto build an edifice of justice-the House, ing Administrator and his chief judicial officer constituted a stigma upon the officers themselves and the Commonwealth as a whole. Such a condition of affairs never could have been reached if the Territory had been properly represented in this Chamber, and had been afforded a constitutional outlet for the pent-up feelings of its people. We shall Afr. Brennan. neveT be able to deal with the questions of land settlement, and education, or the important matter of guarding the interests of the coloured race, unless we have intelligent representation of the Territory in this Parliament, and I ask the Government not to be constantly in dread of having a vote recorded against them. Give the representative of the Territory a vote. It is true that it is to some extent out of harmony with the views of my party and myself to say that 1,500 or 2,000 white people should have as much representation in this Chamber as is given to 40,000. That certainly is aa anomaly, and it appears so to us as a far as possible, of the principle of one vote, one value. But when we are confronted with two evils-o n the one hand depriving the people of a fundamental right, and on the other hand creating an inequality, it is infinitely better to create bhe inequality than to violate a fundamental right. Therefore, I hope that when the Leader of the Opposition moves his projected amendment upon this Bill it will be sympathetically received. We do not stand to lose at all by a little over-generous treatment of the Northern Territory, especially when we remember that we are so deeply indebted to its people. By that I mean that we have done so great and so long-sustained a wrong in degether, that even if they should be a We are little over-represented in the years immediately to come, that will but serve to balance the injustice of the past. I should like to have heard more from the Honorary Minister regarding the constitutional difficulties of which he spoke, and which neither the Leader of the Opposition nor I can at present appreciate. That constitutional difficulty being, brushed away as non-existent, I hope that now we have begun to handle thisproblem-and we welcome this measure in any form as being at all events a basis of discussion upon which we may be ablein its wisdom, will see that full justice is done to those people to whom justice has been so long denied. I do not think that anything less will satisfy the people of the Northern Territory. For instance, they would not be satisfied to be associated, as the honourable member fer Franklin suggested, with some other State, even if the very real constitutional obstacles in the way of so doing could be overcome. To make them merely an appendage to any State of the Commonwealth would not satisfy them. They are entitled to be satisfied, and I do not t h in k . t h at the honourable member's suggestion would prove a wise solution. Nothing less than adequate representation-and I shall not be'afraid if it is a little more than adequate-wil l satisfy the people of the Territory. Therefore, I hope that the B ill , w i th the essential amendment indicated by the Leader of the Opposition, w i ll be carried.

100,Dr. Earlepage,"To further convote. It would seem clear that under this Constitution the Parliament may, if it thinks fit, allow the representation of territories by delegates of the same kind who, although allowed to sit and speak in the Senate or the House of Representatives, would not be members of either House or entitled to vote therein. The Parliament may, however, under this section, allow a territory to be represented by actual members in either House; and in thai case no terms would be imposed inconsistent with tbe provisions of the Constitution as to mode of election, tenure, and light to vote. The number of representatives which a territory may be allowed is, of course, absolutely in tbe discretion of Parliament. That, I think, completely disposes of the question as to the standing that any such representative may have. That is a matter entirely for determination by this Parliament. whether it would be fair to the other members of this House, or even the Territory itself, for a member representing so few people as are in the Territory at the present time, to be allowed a vote which might make or unmake Ministries, and might easily have a very big effect upon the nnancial administration of the Commonwealth. In this regard it is well worthwhile seeing what has been the experience in the TJnited States of America. We find that the Territories there have been divided into two classes-the organized and the unorganized. The latter are described as Territories governed from Washington, the seat of Government, and the organized are those which have a large degree of self-government. According to Ashley's TheA merican Federal StateIn what we may call the territorial, as disthat, and must not look to be spoon-fed, tinguished from the colonial, government, we as the Territory has been so far., I am have a combination of self-government with consure that, with this system in force, the trol by the United States.

Of as much importance as the choice of a representative for the Northern Territory, and his right to a vote in this House, is the other question as to how the Territory should be governedwhether it is to continue in. its present unorganized condition, or whether it is to be organized. The experience of the B r itish race throughout the ages has been that the best results are obtained when the British people have f u l l local control of tiheir own government; and, contemporaneously with the giving of representation to the Northern Territory, I would like to see the opportunity taken to properly organize the administrative control The question arises as to of the Territory in bhe hands of a local Council.

105,Mr Watt,"If they were confined towould be available to tbe CouncilI propose to place in control of tbe Northern Territory, but in any case it would be better for the Commonwealth Parliamezit to make a special grant such as has been given to Tasmania, and to tell the people of the Northern Territory that a definite limit will be placed upon the granting of such assistance, or allow them to have their own Customs duties for a period as Western Australia had. The condition of affairs one finds in thc Northern Territory under the present system of administration is very unsatisfactory. There is an absence of co-ordination. Three different Departments are responsible to three different capitalsone to Melbourne, one to Brisbane, and another to Adelaide. There is a lack of co-ordination between the territorial administration and other Departments which are responsible to outside heads in the various States. The lack of co-ordination is so great that vacant oflices belonging to the territorial administration have not been made available to officers of other Departments desiring to utilize them for official purposes, and it has been found necessary for other buildings to be rented. When one medical officer went to DaTwin he had to reside for several months in a galvanized iron structure although there were eight Government cottages empty at the time. Ultimately, when he got into one of those cottages he was charged £120 per annum as rent, whereas if he had been a Territorial officer his rent would not have exceeded £80 per annum. Although there are only thirty-two vessels in and out of Port Darwin each year, there is a port health officer as well as a Government medical officer to attend to the boats. One man may have practically nothing to do for two or three weeks in each month. Ordinances have been prepared in Melbourne which are totally unsuited for the district. This condition of affairs is of no use to the Commonwealth or to the Territory itself, and the time is ripe, not only for the people of that part of Australia to have representation in this House, but also for a simultaneous organization of this Territory and all other Territories of the Commonwealth, so that we may be able to secure the best possible local selfquoted figures to show that the taxation government and the mobilization of that capacity for public service which is available but is now lying in disuse. Seeing that all that is asked for in this Bill is that the representative of the Northern Territory should have a voice in the Commonwealth Parliament, my view is that his voice should be heard, not in the House of Bepresentatives, but in the Senate. dorse the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), particularly in regard to' his proposal for -the establishment of self-government in -the Northern Territory, biit I regret what has been said by the honourable members for Herbert( Mr Bamford) and honourable, member said that the position of a member of this House with a voice but no vote would be intolerable. The position of the Northern Territory at present through having no representation in this Parliament is infinitely more intolerable. presentatives of Tasmania like to have a voice in this Parliament, but no vote? not comparable. lation the people of Tasmania have not a great deal of advantage over the people of the Northern Territory. people in Tasmania, whereas the population of the Northern Territory is about 3,000. In any case, Tasmania came into the Federation as an original State, with its representation laid down in the Constitution. That Act does not provide that the people of any Territory subsequently created or given representation in ' this House shall have a vote until the number of its .population reaches the proper quota. this Parliament. been clearly explained by the Honorary Minister in charge of the Bill.

There is a member of the Senate -who in the year 1919 paid £8,000 in income tax, upon one pastoral property situated in the Northern Territory, and that amount was not paid into the revenue at Darwin. The same remark applies to the Customs and Excise collections on the commodities consumed by the people of the Northern Territory. Consequently, it is unfair to regard the revenue receipts at Darwin itself as a reflex of the actual amount of taxation derived by the Commonwealth Treasury. from the people of the Territory. collected, the more it supports my argulegislation which gave the right of postal ment; because I seek to have the taxation voting. It will be seen, therefore, that remitted. taxation will not prove a panacea for the ills from which the people of the Territory are suffering. The real point ference between regulating voting and is the policy of development; but depriving people of the right to vote. that matter is not now under discussion. The flBill may not go as far as I would of a vote if they cannot attend a polling like, or as far as the people affected would booth, and are at the same time denied like, but it goes practically all the way. the right to vote by post.

It seems to me a preposterous proposal pared to advocate the rights of the people to suggest that an area which covers of the Northern Territory and the Fed500,000 square miles should be tacked on eral Territory. This reminds me of the to an existing State electorate. I believe old battle for the franchise, when those that I have spoken to more people who who possessed votes could not see why have lived, and who are living, in the those who did not should worry, because Northern Territory than has any other represent member of this House, and I can say conhonorable member fidently that the provisions of this Bill fifty or sixty years, if we may judge by will be generally acceptable to them. the argument he uses.

In regard to the proposal that the people in outlying parts should vote by post, seeing that the mails are brought in from some outlying districts not more than once in six weeks, and as it is possible that election returns may not be got in under seven or eight weeks, it may be necessary to extend the time allowed for the reception of postal votes. A remark was made by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) about the right to vote possessed by a person who pays taxation.

It is to pur interests to induce as many people as possible to make their homes in the distant parts of the Commonwealth, and the best way to attain that end is to give them all full citizen rights and privileges. comment has beenmade on the small number of people to be represented, but I notice that at the first Pederal election a senator for Tasmania was elected with 1,199 votes, and many were returned with 2,000 and 3,000 votes. Tasmania sent six senators, and Senator Keating, the highest on the poll, had 3,700 votes, while the lowest, the one I first quoted, had 1,199 votes. A similar state of affairs prevailed throughout the States. votes, or the No. 1 votes? whioh those senators were elected. will he seen that the same remark as to the smallnees of the population to be represented applies equally to Tasmania, Western Australia, and other States. I may say that the late Sir Philip Fysh, another Tasmanian member, was elected with 1,794 votes. In the Territory there are 1,700 people entitled to vote, and, in the face of the figures I have quoted, they cannot be denied the privilege. them the right to vote. sentatives of Tasmania should be quite prepared to give the Northern Territory people the right to a representative. If representation is to be according to population, Tasmania has too many members, not only here, but in the Senate. I do not object to Tasmania having its present number of representatives, but I think the same privilege should be given to the people of the Northern Territory, where there is so much developmental work to be done; and it is our duty to make the people there as contented and happy as possible. We are prepared to allow the proposed representative to come here and, financially and otherwise, receive the same treatment as is given to other members of the House. That being so, it would cost no more to extend to him the right of voting, and thus give him a higher standing amongst those whom he represents. So far as I understand, it will not be possible, according to the Bill, for the representative of the Northern Territory to be placed on any committee. However, I hope the time is not far distant when the residents of Canberra willalso have the right to representation in this House, and the same applies to New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands which we control. The people in the Some places I have mentioned pay taxation, and, therefore, are entitled to representation. vote one value a farce. should not be entirely guided by what has been done under the United States of America Constitution; we are, I think, so far as our legislation goes, a little beyond the United States of America, and we ought to give facilities for the widest expression of opinion by the people of Australia. I hope the Bill will be passed as something It better than nothing, but, at the same time, I think the Government are losing a golden opportunity to settle this question and satisfy the people of the Territory. think this Bill is a mistake. It , apparently, satisfies nobody in the House. There are some who think that the Territory is not ripe for representation,, 1 while there are others who think it is not denying overripe; but neither party appears to .consider the Bill satisfactory. That is chiefly, I take it , because of the extraordinary type of member that it is proposed to create for the first time in Australian history. He is to be here with a large mouth, which he may exercise incessantly within the Standing Orders, but he cannot say "" yea "" or "" nay "" to any of the questions which he himself has raised and which are special to the Territory or general to the Commonwealth. He is net to be a constituent of a quorum. He cannot be counted, according to the Bill, by Mr Speaker or officers of the House, with a view, to determining whether in a given case, the constitutional number is present. He cannot be regarded as a member of an absolute majority of the House, and he cannot be Speaker or Chairman of Committees. He is to be the first parliamentary eunuch in Australia.

Mr Watt (Balaclava) [4.29],"I( Sir Granville Ryrie), should have been given by his colleagues the duty of carrying so deformed an, infan t into this Chamber as the creature that is to be born of this B ill if it passes-that such a man should be the father, or the proclaimed father, of it . I shall vote for the creation of no representative that has no vote. If we are going to do the tiling at all let us do it properly. Sir GRANVILLE worrying about it ; if the House does not desire the B ill we can easily drop it ! because we criticise his ill-begotten offspring, and it is his first this session. However, although, it is natural that, when the child is criticised by onlookers, the parent should be offended, I hope the Minister w ill follow the reasoning upon which I base my conclusions I believe that the original intention of the Government to give representation, in the Senate to the Territory was a wise one. The mistake_was made, I think, when they drafted ""a B ill which refused a vote to the prospective senator. In my opinion, the Government .this session ought to hark back to a proposition to give a fully-fledged senator to the Northern Territory, if they consider it wise; and for such a proposal I sliould vote. I shall not vote to create another member of this House w i th tlie f u l l powers of an ordinary member, when his total constituency numbers only 1,700. That would not be one vote, one value, as is so strenuously and frequently recommended by honourable members on the Opposition benches. that a man might enter this House with 850 votes, and determine, not only the fate of measures, but the fate of Governments-determin e the death or b i r t h of Administrations and of parties. This constituency, I say, is not suftxciently organized, or sufficiently developed to warrant its participation to that extent in the exercise of the power of the Commonwealth of Austraha. If we are to give those people representation, let us give it to them in such a way that it does not carry the power to determine the fate of Governments. It is perfectly true, as the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has said, that the American people have builded very wisely in the establishment of two forms of territorial government and representation. There must be a definite development of the Territory, and a definite basis of organization, before it can be admitted, in the first place, to local government; and, in the second place, to territorial representation in the House of Representatives at Congress; and, in the t h i r d place, to the status of a State. Right through the years, long before the Louisiana purchase, when the original territories were handed to the care of the primal thirteen States, the regulation Territories were gradually made. We have almost 150 years of the experience of the great Republic of the West, as to how we should sanction and encourage local government and representation of the sparsely-populated Territories of a community like this; and we should follow the example set. If that were done, this B ill would not provide for representation of the Northern Territory in either House, but for the recognition of Papua, which is a much more highly-developed entity of the Commonwealth, than is the Northern Territory. Papua has an A d ministrator, and a local Council, w it h certain legislative as well as administrative functions. revenue. revenue, and occasionally it asks for assistance, either in the form of a subsidy or of a loan to be repaid later to the Central Treasury. This is a Territory that levies tribute on the Commonwealth, and has never yet been asked to live within its income, nor has its ability to do so been tested. In spite of the It is conceivable agitation which has taken place, the Northern Territory, judged by the standard of Papua, is not yet ripe for representation in either House of the Commonwealth Parliament; and I cannot understand why the Government has offered the small number of persons there a kind of hybrid representation because their complaints have been long and loud, and yet has suggested nothing for Papua. Council of its own. practice has been that the first form of representation to be granted shall be local. When a Territory has obtained sufficient population, and is sufficiently organized, to warrant the grant of local government, it gets it . Lateri t may become entitled to claim its second p r i v i lege, namely, representation in Congress",31,Granville Ryrie U P In The Vernment Have Now Presented A Proposal

There are huge areas in Australia which, as the ""new State movement"" for which certain honourable gentlemen here are responsible proclaims, are suffering under disability in more practical form than the sparsely populated Northern Territory. In time to come, the fragments which break off the. larger States may be given the primal status of Territories, and we shall have to devise a system consonant w it h our Constitution to give them temporary representation while they are developing, growing. fragments unless the persons residing in them are given votes. sentation, in the first place, for local governing purposes. pulse of the men who settle in new country is to secure control of the things that matter' a great deal to them: the making of roads, the provision of water and the facilities for transport and communication. ning more important than even the defence of the country. But later the spirit of nationhood grows in such a population -, well if there were not an Administration, in Melbourne interfering without knowledge in everything done in the Northern Territory. giving the people of the Northern Territory local government. The next step is to give them representation in the cent r al organization. ef the Territory think of this measure? regard it as a sop, as something that makes their position a little better than it is at present. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson), who has visited the Territory recently, tells us that the people there await this measure thinking that it will help them along the road of development, but net regarding it as particularly useful, or constitutionally defensible. If we pass this measure because a population of 1,700 persons wishes us to do so, we shall be laying down a principle of representation which will be adversely commented on as Australia grows, and cannot be defended. I suggest to the Minister to hold over the B ill , which is in no sense a party measure, and to take consultation with the interests in the House that desire to give fair play fco the residents of the Territory and at the same time to preserve the principles of our Constitution. We should see if we cannot evolve a better measure than this. be still more grotesque if the representative of the Northern Territory were given a vote. in the other house No !

The representatives of those bodies had the right to vote, but they The original i m were, and were expected to be, special advocates, and although both representatives were, I think, peculiarly fitted for the work they undertook, they made night hideous -with their cries about service privileges, increments, and salaries, so These are in the beginthat the Parliament, at fche first opportunity,chopped out the system of separate representation with an axe. Northern Territory have a right to be heard here. cient organization and have exhausted the powers of self-government, tlhey can be brought into the central organization, and T h a t can be cured by their representatives can be given, not only a voice, but also a vote in the Senate. It would be improper, at the present time, to give the representative of 1,700 persons a voice, with or without a vote in do the people this Chamber, which considers matters determining the fate of 5,000,000 persons. as tihe Northern Territory it is impossible for the people to get together and to organize. gradual growth of population, industry, and settlement which will entitle these persons to rank as a permanent entity. Before the 'Northern Territory is given representation at the Seat of Government, its population and development must be sufficient to warrant suoh recognition.

Should a division be taken, I shalL vote against the Bill. stated before that the Northern Territory will always be a source of trouble to the Commonwealth while we continue to administer it on the lines that we are now following. Pastoral occupation, as it was known in the old days in the bigger States of the Union, is gradually giving way in those States to closer settlement, which is a good thing for Australia. But if we wish to develop the Northern Territory, the most natural way to do so will be to make available there to pastoralists leaseholds of a reasonable area. should also provide a measure of self government sufficient to create a feeling of self-respect and citizenship among the people of the Territory. I agree with the last speaker that more development is needed there. The appointment of "" Pooh-Bah"" ofncials to govern the Territory, its people being taxed without representation, makes for dissatisfaction and retards development. If the Minister does not act on the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , and postpone the consideration of the B ill in order that the principle which should govern the representation of the Northern Territory may be further considered, I shall yetvote for it , because I think that the people of the Northern Territory should be heard in this House. I should like to know at first hand their opinions on matters in which they are concerned. haps. some one of discretion would be chosen to represent the Northern Territory, and that he would not speak except on subjects in which his constituents were in terested, because he would have no vote. It would be foolish of the House to decline to receive such first-hand informar tion. Were such a member given the right to vote, there would be a violation of the representative principles of our Constitution, and other segregated sections in Australia might ask for similar treatment. I do not know that it would not be better to postpone the B ill to give the House time to reconsider the whole question of the administration and representation of the Territories. But the development of the Northern Territory can best be advanced by the adoption of the method I have mentioned. The pastoral interests of this country may be relied upon to develop the Territory, and the I have only officials needed there are a magistrate and a few policemen, the Commonwealth acting as its protector. When the Territory has been sufficiently developed, it will have acquired a status qualifying it to join the Federation of States. Question resolved in the affirmative. B i ll read a second time. In Committee: Clauses1 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5(1.) The member representing the Northern Territory shall not be entitled to vote on any We question arising in the House of Representatives. I move That the word "" not "" be left out. Since the Government intend to provide for the representation of the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives, the representative should be given something more than a merely speaking part in our deliberations. It would be absurd to expect that, upon the ringing of the division bells, he should be required to stalk out of the chamber. It would be more than absurd; it would be utterly unsatisfactory to the people of the Territory. They would never be content with such a half measure of representation. No honourable member, were he a resident of our far-northern areas, would "" stand for "" it . Those people are Britishers, like ourselves; they are probably almost all farmer residents of tVe various States, who at one time enjoyed f u l l rights of citizenship. They are willing and anxious to do what they can in the direction of developing the Northern Territory. I know that if I were selected to represent them. I would refuse to sit in this Chamber merely with a voice and bereft of a vote. Prior to the taking over of the Territory from South Australia, the people of the f a r north were given f u l l representation in the South Australian House of Assembly; the members for the Territory had the right to vote, just as had all the other members. The Commonwealth cannot claim to have done much for the Northern Territory so far. We have actually taken from its residents those rights of citizenship which they formerly enjoyed.

I appeal to honourable members for fair play and for the preservation of British rights of citizenship. We welcome the proposal of the Government as amounting to a step in the right direction. Buti t is no more than a step; it gets the people of the Territory very little further forward. I believe in according representation upon the basis of numbers, so far as may be possible, and in giving to one vote one value. But, so far as the Territory is concerned, the application of those principles would be impossible. The Territory has only a very small number of residents, but they are so far removed from the heart df affairs in the Commonwealth that they should receive special consideration rather than a total lack of it. If we can make them, satisfied with their lot, they will do their best to improve their conditions. They will help enthusiastically in the Territory's development. We cannot hope to populate those far parts if we do not accord their proposed representative in this Chamber complete rights and privileges. ney-Honorary Minister) [4.58] -The Government cannot accept the amendment. In my view, a more grotesque suggestion has never been made in this Chamber. It is absurd to advocate that there should be given a vote in this House to the representative of probably 800 or 900 electors. I mention that approximate number for the reason that there would probably not be more votes cast at an election by the adult population of the Northern Territory. I have been taken to task by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and accused of bias because of certain references which I made to a class of people at Port Darwin. to the workmen, or-as I called them"" the so-called workers,"" of the Northern Territory as Bolsheviks. These are the people who will be concerned in sending a representative into this Chamber. I do not deny that I applied the epithet ""Bolsheviks""; but l i e Leader of ithe Opposition further alleged that I had taunted those same people with the fact that they had no vote in the Commonwealth Legislature. If I said that they had not, I did not speak with any serious intent. Emphatically, I had no thought of saying so as a taunt. I have possibly been the victim of a misdirected joke. If I have been recorded in the cold print of Hansard as having said what the honourable member for Hunter suggests, I must admit that my joking comment would be likely to be taken seriously. I say now that I fearlessly made the statement that the so-called workers of Darwin were Bolsheviks; but I have never said that they were Bolsheviks because they had no vote or voice in this Parliament. I did not say that they should not have votes. I maintain that they are entitled to the representation which the Government now purpose giving them. With respect to the term "" Bolshevik,"" I do not know that I should not appeal, for the correct definition, to the honourable member who knows everything. I refer to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). I have had in mind that a Bolshevik is one who is an extremist, at all events, in industrial matters. All extremists nowadays are liable to be called Bolsheviks. I desire to show now that I had justification for speaking of certain persons in Darwin as Bolsheviks. I ask honourable members to listen attentively to a quotation which I shall make from the report of the Administrator, Mr Urquhart, for the year ended 30th June, 1921. ister did not have that report before him when he made his statements. not; but the fact of its having come to hand later only bears out the fact that what I said at the time was fully justified. The Administrator saysTo one like myself, accustomed for many years to the well-ordered processes of a State 'Public Service, the position I found in the Service here was somewhat astonishing, not I admit that I have referred to say dismaying. To begin .with, the Service .was permeated with the doctrines of extremist unionism, vigorously inculcated hy the local union leaders (extremists of the extreme), and enforced by every subtle tyrannical device their none too scrupulous minds could conceive, until the more or less depressed and bewildered civil servants had arrived at a stage where they seemed to doubt to .whom their first allegiance was really due, whether to their country, as represented iby the Government which employed them, or to the truculent terrorists who,_ in the much-abused name of unionism, and without much let or hindrance from higher authority, had arrogantly claimed a right of control over them.",34,Ryrie W E Are Not For The Government Of Those Developing

And so the House of Darwin's and the Northern Territory's prosperity fell, and fell upon evil days indeed.

SoI think I was justified in calling these men extremists. In that same report the Administrator said, also, that one of the greatest causes of complaint in the Territory was taxation without representation. I agr.ee that the people should have representation in this Parliament, but I cannot see that they are entitled to have a vote. I quote the following extract from the Sydney Morning Herald of the 30th August, 1922, as having an instructive bearing upon this question: THE TERRITORY. A PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATE. America's Example. In deciding to give the inhabitants of the Northern Territory a representative in the Federal Parliament, with the right to speak, but not to vote, the Ministry is following thc example of the United States of America. From its inception the National Government of America possessed a vast area of land outside the limits of the several States, the larger One is from Mr part of which remained wild and inhabited only by Indian tribes. When, with thc westward march of the whites, any particular region became sufficiently settled to require a regular Government, its boundaries were set and it was made into a territory. I shall Most of -the 48 Statesof the Union which were added to the original 13 were for a time territories, and became States when they from the report of Mr had reached a certain population. The process went on until almost all the continental area of the United States was distributed intestates, and there now remains in that area only one region, Alaska, still called a territory. There are others, however, in the island possessions. The territories send neither senators nor representatives to Congress; neither do they take part in presidential elections. The House of Representatives, however, admits a delegate from each one of them to sit and speak, but not, of course, to vote. The position there disclosed is analogous to that of the Northern Territory, and this Parliament will be doing nothing singular if it concedes representation without a vote. The extract continuesThe position of a territory is, therefore, that of a rudimentary State. This is the Northern Territory's position to-day. One day, if it is developed, it will become a State. The delegate from the Territory will really be a person whom ihe House of Representatives, under a Statute, admits to its floor and permits to adThe late ""Viscount Bryce, in his well-known work, Tlic American Commonwealth, pointed out the peculiar position of a citizen of the American territories, and his remarks apply with almost equal force to the residents of the Northern Territory. "" It may seem inconsistent with principle that citizens should be taxed hy a Government in whose Legislature they were not represented,"" said Viscount Bryce, "" but the practical objections to giving the full rights of States to these comparatively rude communities outweighed any such theoretical difficulties."" The honourable member for Batman referred to my lack of knowledge of the Constitution. I am not a constitutional lawyer, and perhaps the honourable member's comment was justified.

Surely we can .afford to be generous to the residents of the Northern Territory, and do the decent thing by them. other honourable members.

Instead of the in credible folly of a proposal to make the railway gauges uniform , I think it is far better to set out upon a programme of connecting this outlying Territory by railway communication w it h the larger centres of population. I shall vote for the amendment, with which I am in entire agreement. I shall vote for the amendment moved by ton). ( Sir Granville Eyrie) to go to America for an example to bolster up his argument, but he will not follow that country's example in its method of electing representatives to Parliament, namely, the population basis only. Why are the people in the district in which Washington is situated disfranchised 1 The reason was given to me by D r . Bell, the inventor of the telephone. He told me that it was because there was such a large proportion of blacks in Washington that they dominated the Legislature and made it corrupt. I can imagine the Honorary Minister saying in regard to the recent trouble at Darwin, "" A whiff of grape shot would also settle that trouble."" The littl e corporal who used those famous words was not so great in bulk as is the Honorary Ministeri n charge of this B ill , but his mental qualities were much greater than those of any honourable member of this Parliament, and he would not have suggested the use of a whiff of grape shot at Darwin. L e t me tell the HonoraryM in ister that if similar trouble had occurred in some of the western States of America, the men administering the affairs of the Territory would have been shot or hanged, and I am not sure that the vote of the people of Australia would not have justfied their action, so infamous was the control at Darwin as exercised by the officials there from Judge Bevan down to the least of them. The Honorary Minister has quoted from the report of the present Administrator. I cannot forget that he is an ex-policeman who was fined in a paltry Police Court. Fancy the W it h many Governor of ""Victoria or the Governor General of the Commonwealth being fined in a Police Court! The Colonial Office would recall him at once. I discount Mr Urquhart's report, and I am content to quote from the report of his predecessor, Mr Staniforth Smith, whose experience of Australia is probably as vast as that of any other man in this country. Mr Staniforth Smith speaks of the Prime Minister's promise to give representation to the people of the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister has made many promises, many of which he has not kept, but I welcome this B ill as an earnest of his intention to keep at least one of them. Mr Staniforth Smith, in his annual report on the administration of the Territory of which ho was It may suit the Honorary Minister Acting-Administrator, saidThe Northern Territory is the last province of Australia to claim the toga of citizenship. The promise of the Prime Minister of Australia tliat a Bill would be introduced -to give the people of the Northern Territory a representative in the National Parliament was received throughout the Territory with the keenest pleasure. The history of the struggles of the people of the various colonics of Australia for the right to make the laws that they are called upon to obey is interesting and instructive. In 1842, the Imperial ""Act for the Government of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land"" gave the colony ""representative"", government creating a new Council consisting of twelve nominated members-si x official and six non-official-and twenty-four elected members. The Imperial Act of 1850 allowed New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia to recommend the form of government they preferred, although the population of those four colonies numbered at that time no less than 750,000. HereI express my appreciation of the democratic State of South Australia in the early days of its settlement. Mr Staniforth Smith's report proceedsThe province of South Australia gave a vote to all men who had lived six months in the-colony lor the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly to be triennial.

The report which I am quoting continues In otlicr ways South Australia led tbe way towards modern Democracy. She was the first of the Australian colonies to pay her members of Parliament, and the first to give women a vote. In conformity with the liberal traditions of the South Australian people, it was natural that at a very early date (1890) a f u l l and liberal franchise should be conferred upon the European settlers of the Northern Territory, who at that date numbered only 1,144 white people and 3,754 coloured aliens. I would like the Honorary Minister to get some of his officers to search ""the archives in South Australia in order to ascertain whether one voice was raised against giving .these men a vote. The report continuesThe South Australian Government allowed the white people of the Territory, on an adult suffrage franchise, to elect two members to sit in the South Australian Legislative Assembly, and on the 18th April, 1890, Mr V. L. Solomon and the Hon. J. L. Parsons were elected to represent the Northern Territory in the South Australian Parliament. In addition to these two members, the people of the Northern Territory were allowed to vote for the election of a member for the Legisact so nobly as to give the Boers the lative Council by being included in that member's electorate. They were also privileged to take their full part in the great decision as to whether thc Australian colonies should form a federated nation. The residents of the Territory were fit to vote on the question as to whether or not there should be an Australian Commonwealth, but, according to the B ill , their representative is not fit to vote in this HouseAt the first Federal elections in 1901, a furprivileges of citizenship throughout this ther privilege was exercised by the white residents of the Northern Territory, as they were granted full voting rights both in the election of the Federal senators and a member of the House of Representatives for South Australia and the Northern Territory.

Subsequently the people of the Northern Territory voted for the election of the member for Grey in tlic House of Representatives, and continued thc privilege of voting for all senators elected from South Australia. For twenty years the people of the Northern Territory, thanks to South Australia, enjoyed the fullest franchise, and could proudly claim both State and Federal representation. On the 1st January, 1911, the Commonwealth assumed tlie control of the Territory, and all citizenship and voting power was taken from them, and this condition has continued up to the present, although section 122 of the Commonwealth Constitution expressly provides that The .Parliament may make laws for the government of any Territory surrendered by any State. . . and may allow the representation of such Territory in either House of the Parliament to thc extent and on thc terms which it thinks fit."" A new era is dawning for the Territory; there is now a definite prospect of the early introduction of legislation to give the people of the Northern Territory a representative in the Federal Parliament, and this has given general satisfaction. During the Boer war I was on their side, and I must say I never dreamt that England, having conquered, would rights and privileges of a free community under the British flag. But that is what England did, and the Boers responded nobly when Botha led them against the German WestA f r i c an possessions during the late war. The Minister, as a soldier and as a comrade of that great man, wil l agree that that was a noble return for a noble act. I now ask that Australian men and women, for the sake of their children, shall exercise all the rights and country. I have no desire to unduly criticise the American Constitution and its working, owing to m y regard and affection for that great country; but I may point out that that part of it which deals with Territories is from old, pertaining to the last century. Wa In the name of are now living in a new era, and we ought to realize that a man who is fib to voice the rights and claims of his fellowmen is entitled to a vote in regard to those rights and claims. The late Mr Duncan Gillies, a one-time Premier and leader of Conservative thought in Victoria, once said that while a man could sometimes explain away a speech, it waa a very awkward business to explain away a vote, and certainly the casting of a vote is a most important duty. Having made my appeal, I now wish to say a few words in regard to the health of the Northern Territory, especially in view of Sir Henry Barwell's yelping for black labour there. Perhapsi t was for this that that gentleman obtained a title, but, if so, it is ""a very "" b l a c k "" title. However, on the authority of Knibbs, the Northern Territory presents possibly the healthiest community in the world. Contrary to statements that have been made to the effect that women cannot live there, and so for t h , I find that amongst the women there is really a lower death rate than amongst the men. Taking the years from 1914 to 1920, the average male death rate was 3.33 per cent. member is making a speech more appropriate to the second-reading stage.

Clause5 has to do with applications for postal vote certificates and postal ballot-papers. It amends section S5 of the principal Act by adding a provisoThe to the following effect:Provided that the application shall not be deemed to have been duly made unless it reaches the Divisional Returning Officert o whom it is addressed before 6 o'clock in the afternoon of the day immediately preceding the polling day. for the election. At present an application for a postal vote certificate and ballot-paper may bereceived up to and upon the very day of an election. Applications are sometimes sible for the officers concerned to supply certificates and postal voting papers. Hence the reason for the proviso.

201,I Invite Honourable Mr Groom,"I am dealing with thecertified list of voters at a polling place the Court of Disputed Returns to prescribed for the subdivision. The proidentify, where necessary, any particular posed new section statesNotwithstanding anything contained in the taching a number to the ballot-paper. last preceding section, wherea person, whose Certain safeguards were inserted, but the name has been noted on the certified list of Government have reconsidered the point, voters used at a polling place prescribed for and have decided not to include this the subdivision for which he is enrolled, as an elector to whom a postal vote certificate and numbering of ballot-papers in the meapostal ballot-paper have been issued, claims to sure. vote in an election at tliat polling place and agree to the omission of those proposed states, when requested to deliver to the Presiding Officer for cancellation his postal vote certinew sections covered by clause 12. ficate and ballot-paper, that he neither applied for nor received a postal vote certificate or a which deals with the places at which postal-ballot-paper, he may, subject to section absent voting electors may vote. 115 and the regulations, be permitted to vote, if he makes a declaration in the prescribed section statesform before the Presiding Officer at the polling place. The ballot-paper of such a voter is then dealt with in the manner prescribed by the regulationsProvided that no such ballot-paper shall be scrutinized unless the Divisional Returning Officer is satisfied that the voter is entitled to .vote in the election, and that a postal vote certificate or postal ballot-paper has not been issued to him. The next amending clause, 9, proposes to insert two new sections-the one providing for a penalty for unlawfully marking a postal ballot-paper, and the other for unlawfully opening such a paper. The first, No. 93A, statesNo person other than(a) the elector to whom tlie postal ballot paper has been issued, or (fi) an authorized witness . . . assisting an elector whose sight is so impaired that he cannot vote without assistance, shall mark a vote upon the ballot-paper. The second new section, 93B, provides thatNo person other than the Returning Officer for the division in respect of which a postal ballot-paper has been issued, or. an officer acting under his directions, shall open the envelope in which the postal ballot-paper has been placed . . . and which has. been fastened by an authorized witness . . . I have already indicated' that the profact of the claim and the reasons for the reposed new section 105, as set out in fusal thereof, and the Presiding Officer and clause 10, simply provides machinery sence for the printing of Senate ballot-papers of those scrutineers may also sign the note. and the determination of the order of A person may make application for a groups and names within a group. In the Bill as introduced in the Senate, in establishing proof as to whether the certain clauses were included to provide claimant had or had not claimed the for the marking of individual ballotright to vote. The Presiding Officer papers after the manner adopted in might say that he could not remember Queensland, the purpose being to enable whether or not that person had claimed. vote. The means of doing so is by atThe Senate will be asked to Clause 13 seeks to amend section 113, The On polling day, an elector shall be entitled to vote at any prescribed polling place for the subdivision for which he iB enrolled, or he shall be permitted to vote at any other polling place within the Commonwealth at which a polling booth is open. . . . The purpose of the proposed amendment is to substitute the word "" m a y "" for ""shall,''' second occurring above. The necessity arose out of a specific recent case of absent Voting. Australia is a ,very large country;; its electors are widely scattered, and it is very difficult to make legal provision against every contingency. But every elector is entitled to vote at any polling place in respect ef the electorate in which he is enL rolled. In the matter of absent voting, however, this substitution of the word "" m a y "" for ""shall"" will prevent an election from being declared invalid in the event of the discovery of a shortage of one or more ballot-papers for absent voters. Clause 15 purposes the addition of a new sub-section to section 121. It has to do with the voting claim of a person whose name is not on the certified list, or has been struck out. The proposed addition statesWhere the claim of any person to vote under this Bection is refused the Presiding Officer shall make a note in writing of the a poll clerk shall sign the note in the preof Buch scrutineers as are present. Any vote: but in a recent case difficulty arose It is there for© proposed to alter the law to provide that where the claim of any person to vote under section121 is refused, the Presiding Officer shall make a note in writin g of the fact of the claim and the reasons for the refusal thereof; and that the Presiding Officer and the poll olerk shall sign the note in the presence of such scrutineers as are present. An y of those scrutineers may also sign the note. evidence of the claim. It is proposed to add also a new section, to be called section 121A. According to section 118, immediately upon handing the ballot paper to the person claiming the vote, the Presiding Officer or a poll clerk must place a mark against the person's name on the certified last of voters, if his name is on that list. We are now proposing to add this new section(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act where a voter, against whose name on the certified list of voters used at a polling which shall not be proved to have affected the place prescribed, for the Division for which he is enrolled a mark has been placed in accordance with section 118 claims to vote in an election at that polling place he may subject to sections 39 and 115 and the regulations be permitted to vote if he makes a declaration in the prescribed form before the Presiding Officer at the polling place. (2) The ballot-paper of a voter voting under this section shall be dealt with as prescribed by the regulations: Provided that no such ballot-paper shall be scrutinized or counted unless a Divisional Heturning Officer is satisfied that the voter is entitled to vote in the election. In otheiwords, the applicant's vote may be taken, and the matter can then be in quired into. Of course, if the man is entitled to vote it is righ t that he should do so. Sometimes mistakes happen, and a. wrong name on the list is marked off. Clause 25 is necessary, following upon a decision given by Mr Justice Bartoni n the case of Hedges versus Burchell. In that case application had been made to the Court of Disputed Returns on behalf of the petitioner Hedges for an order entitling him. to inspect and take extracts from the rolls and certain other documents used at or in connection with the Eremantle election, and also that a certain roll in the possession of a divisional officer should be delivered to the petitioner for inspection. The Judge held that he had no power to make that order, and saidThe result is that no section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, nor any rule under that Act, has been discovered which can be held to give this Court of Disputed Returns Mr Groom. the power to make such an order as is sought on behalf of the petitioner. It may be that such a power is highly necessary, and that the ends ofjustice are frustrated by its absence. It seems strange that in a proceeding which involves the question of the proper conduct of an election, when information is sought which exists only in the rolls and other documents in the custody of public officers, a petitioner is not entitled to the discovery that is here sought. But the remedy is in the hands of the Legislature, not those -of the Court. That will provide It is now proposed to give the Court increased power in that regard. Further powers are being conferred by clause 26 with regard to the production of certain ballot-papers and postal certificates. Clause 27 embodies another important amendment. The point w it h which it deals arose in the disputed Ballarat eleotion. The principal Act providesNo election shall be avoided on account of any delay in the' declaration of nominations, the polling, or the return of the writ, or on account or the absence or error of an officer result of the election. Mr Justice Isaacs, in his judgment in the case of Kean versus Kerby, saidThe Australian Act differs very considerably from the English legislation in several respects relevant to this case. Particularly I refer to the duty of the Court in the case of official errors. In England it is enacted that no election shall be declared invalid by reason of non-compliance with the election rule or mistake in the use of the forms, if it appears to the tribunal (1) that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the body of the Act, and (2) that such non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the election. In other words, if the matter is left so that the mistake may have affected the result, the election may be declared invalid. Under our Act it is different. By section 194 it is provided that "" no election shall be avoided . . . on account of the . . . error of any officer which shall not be proved to have affected the result of the election."" The"" result"" means the return of the particular candidate, and not the number of his majority. Honourable members w ill observe the difference between the two Statutes. The Commonwealth electoral. law provides that no election shall be avoided/ on account of an error which shall not be proved to have affected the result of the election,, whereas the English law provides that no election sliall be invalid by reason of any mistake if it appears to the tribunal that the mistake did not affect the result of the election. Clause 27 proposes to apply the wording of the English law, and do away w i th the necessity for admitting evidence as to how a voter intended te vote. The Bill also proposes to continue as a permanent measure that provision in the War-time Electoral Act which prevents the States from taking a referendum on Federal election day. The High Court has established our power to do that in. the Queensland appeal case, Ex parte DanieU. We are, therefore, inserting this new clause218A. On the day appointed as polling day for an election of the Senate or a general election of the House of Representatives or the day fixed for the taking of the votes of electors for the purposes of a referendum held under the provisions of the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act 1906-1919, no election or referendum or vote of the electors of any State or part of a State shall, -without the authority of the Governor General, be held or taken under the ^aw of a State. I commend the Bill to the House. TON) adjourned. Sitting sitspended from 6.80 to 8.%0 p.m. In Committee of Ways and Means: [8.22] I move That in lieu of the rates of tax imposed by the Entertainments Tax Act 1916-1919 upon payments for admission to entertainments there be imposed upon such payments as from the second day of October, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, a tax at the following rates, namely:Payment for Admission (excluding the amount of tax). One penny One shilling Exceeding one shilling first shilling and one half-penny for every sixpence or part of sixpence by whioh the payment exceeds one shilling This motion involves an alteration of the basis upon which the tax upon entertainments is imposed, and carries out the Budget indication that it was proposed to remove the tax upon tickets of admission to entertainments of the value of under Is. The entertainments tax was imposed during the war purely as a war measure, so far as the Commonwealth Government was concerned, and the receipts from that source, which have been very substantial, were of the greatest value during the period of the war, when the whole of the nnancial resources of the Commonwealth were stretched to the very furthest point. The actual amounts received were191617 .. .. .. £112,000 191718 238,000 191819 .. 355.000 191920 551,000 192021 .. .. 644,000 1921-22 .. .. .. 675,000 Without the remission of the tax now suggested, it was estimated that the revenue from this source during the present financial year would be £650,000. The amount involved in the remission is approximately £100,000. The war is now over, and we are endeavouring to make a very real and sincere effort to get back to a normal basis; in fact, the Budget gave some indication of this. The reduction in our expenditure from revenue this year is £3,000,000, and one hopes that, in due course, the revenue will follow the same lines as the expenditure has followed in the Estimates for the present year. At any rate, taxation is being remitted this year, and it is hoped that, as the years go by, it will be further remitted. The relief given on the present occasion is, of necessity, limited, and in arriving at its extent consideration has been given to the object of enabling all classes to share in it. I have heard the suggestion made outside, Bate oi Tas. and even in this chamber, that the Budget is an electioneering Budget. gestion has been made, because it shows a fundamental misconception of that for which the National party and the National -Government stand. We are in the unique and enviable position in this House of representing all classes of the community, and of necessity, in our endeavours to do justice to all, our remissions of taxation have fallen upon all classes. The suggestion that ours is an electioneering Budget is nothing less than an outrage and a gross misconception of the whole position. the Treasurer will not prevent the humble supporters of the Government in this corner from saying that.",44,Electoral Bill Second Reading

When my late Leader( Mr Tudor) was fighting with the object of securing the reduction now proposed, and even a greater measure of relief, the Government were very obstinate. They stood then for gathering all they possibly could under the entertainments tax, but, as in other cases, they adopt a different attitude now that au election is within easy distance. member regard as being "" within easy distance "" ? the 9th December would be within easy distance. The Treasurer is at great pains to assure us that this remission of taxation is for the benefit of the people as a whole; but it is well known that it is for the benefit of people who are attending picture-shows and similar entertainments where they are charged up to Is. I think the Treasurer would only be doing justice, in view of his own statement as to this field of taxation being left business to let the public know them. to the States, if he were to wipe it out altogether; or apply it only to the higherracy of what I am now saving, but we priced seats at theatres. doing. veil-y low, and I think that the Treasurer might start his taxation at 3s., as more reasonable,, taking all the circumstances into account. would not be worth collecting. the States. a low one for theatres for there are very few seats in theatres at 3s. suggestion would mean a loss of a year. told us that this taxation was imposed with the idea of raising additional revenue for financing the war. In 1919 tlie revenue collected was £355,000, in 1920 it was £551,000, in 1921 it was £641,000, and in 1922 it is estimated to be £675,000. It will be seen that under his present proposals the Treasurer will get considerably more than he did in 1920. when the war was over. the war was not over. it will not be over for a long time to come. The poorer people of the community, who made the most sacrifices in the prosecution of the war, should not be called upon to pay for it. What is the wealth of the country doing towards paying for the war? Why is it not taxed to a greater extent? "" rot "" when we are about to go to the country to tell the people the truth.

This taxation, as I say, was imposed to assist in paying the cost of the war, and it should .be removed as quickly as possible from fche shoulders of those who are least able fco bear ifc. The people who attend picture shows, and pay taxation charges up to Is. admission, can ill afford, generally speaking, such charges, small as they are, out of their scanty earnings. I regret the Bill does not go further, and begin the taxation at admission charges of 3s. Th\ EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [S.4.6]. -There was a saying of Pitt, in speaking of taxation, that the Goat might be taxed off a man's back so long as he did not know how it was done, because then he was not iu a position to place his finger on those who took it. From, what I can gather, that seems to be the method favoured by the Government and the Opposition in the collection of taxation; fchey prefer indirect means, sofchafcthose who have to pay da not know how it is done, or whom to blame. This is a direct tax, and because of that, and because it is felt to be onerous, it is to be removed. Bufc in view of the position of the country, how can we remove taxation in this way ? Tlie Government, in carefully graded doses, are removing taxation, and in the case of the entertainments tax are exempting all admission fees up to Is. We are told by the Treasurer that this remission will mean such an increase in "" invigorating relaxation,"" to use his owu words, that the production of the country will be enormously increased. The policy and attitude of fche Treasurer reminds meI suppose this isfcheinfluence of the pictures we have just seen in the Queen's Hall--of the medicine-man of a savage tribe who carefully puts a, pinch of this here, and a pinch of that there, in order to work his charm.. Thafc is the method adopted by the Treasurer in his remissions of taxation. However, I think the publio will, without difficulty, see through these devices. Disguisei t as we may, the position is that, if these remissions of taxainstead of their having to stamp thom, arid tion take place, the revenue of the Commonwealth for the ensuing twelve months will be £2,700,000 less than the expenditure. heartedly about further remissions, but he cannot see further than another year ahead, from that point of view, unless there is some definite alteration made in regard to the expenditure. Under the circumstances, I cannot be a party fco the remission of taxation on what I regardas a luxury, because luxuries should, in my opinion, be utilized in this way to assist in paying our indebtedness incurred by the war. The Treasurer, as I say, draws a beautiful picture of the "" invigorating relaxation "" that will result from this remission of taxation. If fche honourable gentleman were a member of my profession he would know that eye damage may be done -to young children who attend too frequently at picture shows, owing, in many cases, to the continuous flickering on the screen. I can scarcely see where the ""invigorating relaxation"" comes in, except that perhapsafforded by the eating of peanuts during the entertainments. always invigorates? merous forms of relaxation that cannot be said to be invigorating. In my opinion, this tax on amusements should be retained. I should agree with the Treasurer if he , said we were going to leave this field of taxation completely to the States, but, at the present time, the proposal is one made merely to improve the position of fche Government in the electorates. No attempt has been made to bring the expenditure within the revenue, and I see no reason why this taxation, which is a tax on luxury, should be remitted under the circumstances. a coon-d with the views expressed by the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce); but there is one matter to which I sliould like to draw his attention, and that is the way in which the tax is collected. When this legislation was introduced some years ago, the proprietors of picture shows and other entertainments were required to provide their own.printed matter. Where they were working under bond, they were -given tickets by tbe Department they had to supply a yearly or half-yearly audited account. I have had some little experience in running picture shows, and The Treasurer speaks lightI can assure honourable members that the collection of the tax is not a simple matter.

233,Mr Jackson (Bass) [8.52],"I am inentertainment proprietor. I suggest that the Treasurer might intimate that the Department is prepared to have this auditing done by Government auditors, who are to be found in each of the States, so that the charge may not f a l l on the proprietors of the houses of entertainment. Many people think that those proprietors are making "" a min t of money,"" but, as a fact, those who are making the money are those who sell the films. for extrai revenue, they might, as I suggested some time ago, impose on the films an ad valorem duty instead of the l ^ d . per foot as at present. However, I tr.ust that, at any rate, the other suggestions I have made will receive attention. not think it is of much use arguing the question at length.

We would be sinners if we acknowledged the force of the honourable gentleman's contention, and children if we believed it . We know that there is a desire to give back something to the people. Whether that be righ t or wrong is another matter. The Treasurer told us that the imposition of the tax was a war measure, which, during the six years of its operation, has earned us £2,500,000; and that now it is proposed to ease down the tax in order to give the taxpayers relief. This is the first measure of relief that is the outcome of the Budget proposals. It has been hurried on, whereas we have merely had notice of the land tax and income-tax reductions.

Those of us who were in the House at the time w ill remember I do the introduction of this tax.

I understand bhat the proposal before the Committee, whioh I support, willinvolve a remission of taxation to the extent of about £100,000 per annum. If a i l to see that this proposal affords any reasonable opportunity or excuse for stirring up class hatred. raise the question of the taxation of any one specific class in the community as compared w it h any other class. There is, in the proposal itself, no suggestion that one class is taxed too heavily while another is taxed too lightly. My own opinion is that all classes in this country are taxed too severely, and that there should be all-round remissions and relaxations. The release from taxation of the admission ticket under Is. for picture shows will afford relief to many of the people who are least able to pay taxes. However, there are other classes of entertainment beside moving pictures. While I am not personally concerned in taxation imposed upon this form of entertainment, there are varieties of relaxation in which I am deeply interested, and which, in my view, are of infinitely greater national importance. I refer to a class of entertainment to which the terms "" exhilarating "" and "" in v i g o r a t in g"" can be much more appropriately applied than to picture shows. them. satisfy the consistent yearning of the I have honourable member for information if I mention one intellectual relaxation which has never received adequate consideration from this House. I have on other occasions raised my voice in favour of the exemption of all forms of country dancing from the entertainments tax. On the first occasion, when I spoke of this matter,, my words fell on rather unsympathetic ears. I can only hope that in the light of wider experience, especially that which I understand some honourable members have had at a place known as Dixieland,, where, in my opinion, the Federal Capital should be situated, I shall receive a better measure of support on this occasion. I do not think enough is done in this country to encourage a most enjoyable and social form of relaxation, namely, modern dancing. In my ownelectorate I have done my best to cultiI vate and spread the light in regard to this matter, not only by precept, but also, in a humble way, by example. Mir.

The inhabitants w it h in a particular city block apply to the municipality to be allowed to hold a dance.

Whilst supporting this resolution, I shall, whenever I have the opportunity, recommend t h a t ' both the Government ^nd the municipalities do more than they are doing now to encourage and cultivate all forms of those delightful, useful, and intellectual entertainments I have indicated. I give somewhat reluctant support to the proposal made by the Treasurer. My reluctance is due to two reasons-One, that the £100,000 proposed to be remitted w ill be taken, not from savings made by the Government, but from the accumulated surplus; and, two, because I think the Treasurer has missed an opportunity of, at all events, endeavouring to make the class of entertainments whicb have been the subject of discussion a littl e more intellectual than they are. The Treasurer stated, amongst other things, that the remission of the tax upon tickets on pictures would encourage the education of young Australians. word "" educational "" was used in addition to the phrase "" exhilarating relaxation."" tion picture shows only. surer made a general remark that the reduction of the tax on lower-priced tickets would afford some' encouragement to the education of the children. Some honourable members w ill recollect that about two years ago a proposal was made for the remission of the entertainments tax on tickets of under 3s. In view of our knowledge of Commonwealth finance since that proposal was made, honourable members will agree that it was well that another place rejected it , because by so doing it enabled the Treasurer and his predecessor to collect a sum of about £500,000 which otherwise would not have been collected, but which the people have paid freely. It would be better for the young people in the Commonwealth if the Government were to exercise a littl e more rigid control over the films that are shown. We know to our sorrow that our picture entertainments are . practically Americanized. What w i th American pictures, American books, American methods, and American slang, it is about time that a l it t l e more control was exercised by the powers that be. In connection with this remission of £100,000 of entertainments taxation, I should have liked to see the Treasurer discriminate and differentiate, if possible, between that which is educational and that which is not. Coming to the House tonight I passed a picture show where the piece de, resistance was entitled. "" I s the Lady legally Married?"" If the Treasurer thinks that subject is educational, I do not. Of course, it may be educational in regard to the divorce laws, but I would give no sort of encouragement to young Australians to see pictures of that sort. I believe it would have been possible, if careful thought had been given to the proposals now before the Committee, to afford some relief in respect of entertainments that are purely educational. I would have preferred some alternative proposals that would give a little more consideration in respect of tickets up to Is., or Is. 6d. if you like, to entertainments in the form of music, art, or literature. If care and thought had been given to the consideration of how best to remit £100,000 worth of enterA t all events, the tainments tax, the Government could have given some stimulus and aid to the betterment of the character of the young community, instead of producing the slapdash proposal that is now before us. This remission of taxation could have been I think the Treadonei n a better way. Picture shows as they are r u n to-day, w i th exclusively American films, in the interests of an American Combine, are not educational in any way, and I believe that even now the Government could make some regulations whereby the young people of Australia could see with greater freedom, some of the very high-class educations! films that are being produced in England and other parts of Europe. see a few of them in Australia. but, unfortunately, we are not able to get them. If , however, thought had been given to the subject, the interests of education could have been furthered by encouraging the exhibition of some of the best industrial, scientific and travel pictures which are being produced in parts of the world other than America. I repeat, that I give a most reluctantsupport to the proposal now ""before the Committee. I enter my protest against this proposal.

B ut the huge Budget presented by the Treasurer shows that during the current year the Commonwealth is to incur a heavy loss. Only a few nights ago we passed a LoanB ill for twelve million pounds. That is not m y idea of finance. It If we are in a position to remit taxation to the amount of £100,000 in this particular sphere, it should be remitted in . respect to items that would be of very much greater benefit to the community as a whole. a multiplicity of very serious liabilities. The amount of relief that will be given per capita by this remission is so small as to be not worthwhile, especially when we take into consideration that the great war for our freedom has placed upon our people a debt of £380,000,090. Having regard to the purpose for which that expenditure was incurred, and the advantage it has conferred upon Australia, people should be prepared to contribute to the funds of the Commonwealtli in any sucb reasonable form as the every assistance I could render to the tax upon entertainments. income, tax is concerned, the Government are proposing to increase the exemption to single men of £104 to £200. w ill relieve single men who can well afford to contribute toward the expenditure of the Commonwealth, and it is their bounden duty to so contribute, in view of our enormous war commitnients and all that has been done for Australia. The liabilities of the Australian people include a national debt of approximately £800,000,000, an annual war pensions bill of approximately £7,000,000, and other recurring amounts of £5,000,000 for old-age and invalid pensions, and £700,000 foithe inaternitv allowance. Those commitments are very large; and when we take into consideration the small amount of relief that this remission of £100,000 on amusements means to the individual, but how great is the need for revenue in the aggregate, I feel that it would be false economy to do as the Treasurer proposes. On those grounds, I protest against this motion. The Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) in his Budget originally intended to show a surplus of £500,000, and to that extent I am willing to reduce taxation, because I consider that a reduction of taxation generally is most necessary for the progress of the country, but I cannot support the resolution submitted to-day or any other proposal for a reduction of taxation without a corresponding reduction in our expenditure, when the Budget actually proposes to show a deficit of something like £2,800,000. has been said that the entertainments tax was imposed as a war measure, but we must also remember that since the war stopped we. have added about £140,000,000 to our Commonwealth debt. The Commonwealth has In any case, the first remission of taxation should.be a reduction of the income tax of the lower grade of taxpayers who have large families. I would vote for such a reduction w i th pleasure to the extent of £500,000, but I am not in favour of the remissions proposed by the Treasurer to-day without the equally necessary reductions in our expenditure. MrM c WILLIAMS ( F r a n k l in ) [9.43]. -When this matter was discussed last session I was oneof those who gave So far as Government to enable them to retain this tax. On bhat occasion the Opposition took exactly the same position as That they are taking now, namely,' that the tax on amusements should not be levied on the lower-priced tickets. What has. happened since the Government fought so vigorously to retain the tax on the lower-priced tickets? Has the position of fche finances improved? My opinion is that it is f a r better to tax luxuries and amusements than fco tax the necessaries of l if e or poverty. If we are prepared to throw away a certain amount of revenue there are other avenues in which it can be done-notably , that which has just been mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt). member regard entertainments as a luxury ? MrM c WILLIAMS An y form of amusement tax is a tax on luxury as compared with the taxation which presses so heavily on men with large families, particularly the Customs Tariff, and the income tax. I often wonder how these men manage to> get along as well as they do on a small wage. These are the people to whom we should give our first relief if we are to remit any form of taxation. We are commencing at the wrong end by reducing the tax upon amusements.",55,Entertainments Tax Bill

Bub again I repeat: What has happened since this matter was last before us, when the Government fought the Opposition with all fche strength they could assemble in order to prevent giving the remission which is now proposed? to reduce t h e ' t a x, and the Government accepted their verdict gleefully, and, when asked by the Opposition to adhere to their first proposal to remit fche tax on lowerpriced tickets, fought for its retention. I think that the amount of revenue they have secured in that way has helped to keep the national ledger straight. This is not the time for the remission of any taxation on amusements. Auy relief we can afford fco give should be extended to those with large families who are now burdened by Customs duties upon the necessaries of life and by the income tax.

277,"Marks."" W. M. For Franklin ( Mr Mcwilliams) In Regard","that when voters are compelled to vote for up to seven candidates, a' good deal of confusion must arise. Seven candidates must be voted for, and in cases where four candidates are to be elected, as w ill exist in two States on this occa7 sion, it w ill mean that nine candidates must be. voted for, the Act providing that there must be double fche number to be elected, plus one. Inasmuch as we on this side generally r u n three candidates only, there may. on the other side, be two groups, with , probably, an independent candidate, and a voter who favours the candidates who are against Labour naturally votes so as to leave the Labour candidates out, whether there be grouping or not. Thafc is the disadvantage we on this side suffer under the Aot as it was amended previously. TheB ill before us may reduce the number of informal votes to an extent, but it w ill not do justice to us on this side of the House. We run three candidates, bufc Labour electors are compelled to record. seven votes, thus giving four votes to our opponents; and I admit frankly that Labour supporters are very reluctant; to vote for those whose principles they do not approve of. On fche other side, there may be three Country party candidates and three Nationalist candidates, with an independent, Labour vote fon the whole lot. tion in New South Wales, the Country party ran only one candidate. several other candidates who were not Labour candidates, and the result was thafc the votes were given to the seven, men outside Labour, who did' not, in .those cases, get a vote. ThisB ill gives no relief to this side of the House. I cannot see how, even if the electors showed by a majority that they favoured Labour at the next appeal to the country for this House, we can hope to have the decision reflected in another place under this B ill . To me that appears absolutely impossible. Although we may have a majorit y of the votes in Australia, we cannot get that fact reflected in the elections for the Senate. votes for your political opponents are counted until, your candidates are .defeated. on circumstances at a later stage. No party is likely to get its candidates elected at the first count. A candidate for the Senate at the last election forfeited his deposit on the first count, and yet, when the counting was completed, he was returned. and the legislation was intended to be a farce; it was passed for a political purpose. The Labour party has now two members in another place; and, even if we succeed in regard to this House at the forthcoming election, we cannot hope for a majorit y there. The electors may approve of certain principles of a partyeither the Country party or the Labour party-bu t the fact remains that, while members are returned to give effect to those principles here, there is, because of the electoral law, a majorit y in another place which can prevent them being given effect to. worse results under the old system. that that is so. There may have been some objection to the old system, but, anyhow, it was a case of "" first past the post""; there was, at the least, a aecision by the and those opposed to majority of the people, and the party dominant here was also dominant in the Senate. To-day, however, the party dominant in this House find their opponents dealing with their legislation in the Senate; and it is not to the credit of the Government or of Parliament that what was done some few years ago has not been undone. proportional representation for the Senate. but the present method of election is very unsatisfactory, and every fair-minded man knows that it does not do justice gets the whole of the seats. position in consequence? A party which ie in the majority in the country w ill be in a minorit y in the Senate, and f i a t is because of legislation passed specially to bring about that result.

290,Mr Hector Lamond,"You wouldmuch. The Bill also deals with the matter of the deposit, to which I have already referred. Personally, I am opposed to the system that requires a deposit at all, and since I have heen in this HouseI have attempted on> many occasions to have that provision eliminated from the Act. There should be no impediment in the way of any candidate. If the electors nominate a man he should be entitled to go to the poll without the risk of losing his deposit if he fails to secure a certain number of votes. ""When the Bill is in Committee it will be necesmay be deemed necessary. sary to give very careful consideration to clause 14, which provides that certain questions shall be put to a voter. The effect of this provision will, I believe, be quires full and adequate discussion. I to cause serious congestion in pollingbooths, especially in thickly-populated areas, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, when, as a rule, large numbers of electors are rushing to record their, votes. to put all those questions. two questions, namely, as to whether an elector has voted at the polling-place or elsewhere in the election, or if his place of living is within the division, are put to every person wishing ito record a vote, considerable time must he occupied. It is highly probable that the congestion in the booth before the hour of closing will prevent other electors from gaining admission, and thus they will be prevented from exercising, the franchise. It is doubtful whether, in its application, the clause will not do more harm than good. Generally speaking, the provisions dealing with impersonation will be acceptable to honourable members, but it is undesirable to have such a long list of questions. Many people, especially womenfolk, have some diffidence about approaching the polling-booth, because of the nature of certain questions that may he asked them. The provision requiring an elector to indicate the order of his preference up to .the seventh candidate is likely to lead to a good deal of informality in the voting. Most of the clauses are, I think, necessary to remedy certain shortcomings that have been disclosed in the working of our election machinery. [90] I trust, however, that when the Bill is in Committee we shall have ample time for the consideration of these new proposals. This is not a party measure. It is designed to insure the conduct of elections in the best possible manner, and we ought to be able to put our heads together and make the measure as perfect as possible. We shall have no opportunity of touching the main principle of the Bill.

Each would then have the same chance. I do not propose to move an amendment to give effect to that suggestion, because I do not consider that at the present moment the public are sufficiently educated in this matter; but what I propose would provide a solution of the present difficulty. ton) has, with great force, indicated the enormous disadvantage of the present electoral law. I think it was interjected by the Assistant Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr Hector Lamond) that the present system is not as bad as that which preceded it. There is very little doubt upon that point. The peculiar feature of the present system; is that it provides, in a most efficient manner, for the whole of the senators, as far as possible, to be elected by the party that happens to possess a slight numerical majority. If, for instance, one party is supported by 51 per cent, of the electors, and the other party is supported by only 49 per cent., provided the voters are so well organized by the party machine that they will vote as directed, the party with the slight majority returns the whole of the members of the Senate. We have seen this travesty of representative government in the fact that, prior to the death of Senator Adamson, there was only one Labour member in the Senate, although the Labour vote at the last election represented about 45 .per cent, of the people. Although this form of election is highly efficient for the purpose for which it was 1 designed, it is fundamentally opposed to the principle of representative government. Seeing that we shall have an opportunity to discuss this matter further when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I do not now intend to go exhaustively into the question of proportional representation. election is almost unknown throughout the world, except as regards our Senate, and it was devised for the purpose of excluding any representation at all of the party not in a minority. There quired would be given if the voter had is a better method that could be employed, and one that would only involve an alteration in regard to the system of counting the votes. I refer to proportional representation, which has been in practice for many years in Tasmania, and has since been adopted in New South Wales. of it already. ber and those whom he represents may be, but the people of New South Wales have given no evidence of being tired of it. On the other hand, they have returned members in support of proportional representation with a larger majority than they had when that principle was first' introduced. Party organizers may be tared of it, because it enables the electors to be represented adequately by the men whom they desire to represent them. The people should have a chance of casting their votes, and of having them counted, under an efficient and enlightened system. This is not possible under fche present law, and I regretfconotice thatfcheGovernment are endeavouring, by this Bill, to continue to impose upon the people the present inequitable electoral system. agree with fche honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) as to the principles that should underlie an Electoral Bill. Our present) system is obsolete. In 1910, Labour secured eighteen seats, and the opponents of Labour none, in the Senate. In 1919, .the Labour party obtained one seat out of eighteen. Such a system does not secure fche representation of the electors proportionately, and we should try to give representation on the basis of fche strength of the great sections of the electors. To do what is required would mean defeating fche Government and sending the Bill back, and there is little hope of outvoting the Ministerial party, so the best course is to try to improve the measure as we have it. I have one or two suggestions to offer. The Bill certainly does improve the existing Act, but only in a machinery way. There is a good deal of difficulty in conOur present method of nexion with the postal vote, considering the results we have obtained from, it. I do not see why it is necessary to have, an authorized witness to sign an application. This is not required in fche States, and it provides no check.

I u a case where there is illnesj in a family, it means bringing an authorized witness on two occasions to a sick person, and that causes unnecessary worry. I certainly think the postal vote should be safeguarded. It is a dangerous vote, and I have never liked it. I urge the Minster( Mr Groom) to reconsider the clause, and to have it amended so that the one authorized witness may be sufficient, both in respect of the application form and of the other. I have a more serious objection to raise in connection with clause 13, which deals with the important principle of absent voting. The proposed substitution of the word "" m a y "" for "" s h a l l "" is likely to have the effect of robbing certain electors who desire to exercise the right of absent voting of their opportunity to do so owing to the withholding of the necessary papers. Absentee voting comprises one of the advantages of our electoral .system, but much of the advantage will be withdrawn if the proposed amendment is adopted. afforded an experience of the refusal, or inability, .of electoral officials to provide electors with voting papers. It was the lack of provision for absent voting at one particular polling place which amongst other things caused the election to be upset. cated in clause 13 is agreed to, the effect will be to allow such an incident to occur again, but without any penalties accruing. No doubt, it was the Ballarat dispute which has occasioned the proposed amendment. Under the existing law any elector may enter any polling booth ana 1 cast his vote in respect of the division of which he is an elector. agreed to, an elector may attend a polling booth without any certainty whether he will be given a vote or not. ister ( Mr Groom) may ask how the Electoral Department can be expected to provide in every small polling booth throughout the land against the contingency of hundreds of electors demanding absent voting papers. always be made. No> contingency could be so unexpected as to catch a Returning Officer unprepared. I may relate the incident which occurred at the Duverney polling booth, in the Division of Ballarat. A number of men were employed as navvies on the construction of a railway fairly near to the booth. Naturally, upon ' leaving work, they went to the nearest polling place in order to cast their votes, but a majority of them were unable to secure papers because the Presiding Officer had not made the necessary provision. He should have foreseen, however, that in respect of ' this railway work, which had been going on for some time, there would be numbers of men who would be likely to call at the booth in order to vote as absentees. The inability of the officer at the' Duverney polling place to provide sufficient absent voting papers was one of the causes for the upsetting of the Ballarat election. The intention behind the amendment, I repeat, is to obviate the possibility of such a penalty in future. It is only right that such a cause should be deemed to be sufficient and ample for declaring an election void where the number is sufficient to affect the result. I cannot conceive of any emergency which should catch a Returning Officer unprepared for the attendance The last Ballarat election of at least a reasonable number of absent voters. I have only a few words to say upon the grouping proposals. I do not see much objection to them while, at' the same time, I am not greatly enamoured of them. The grouping system is claimed If the amendment indito be a recognition of parties. Under this measure, however, there will be not so much a recognition of parties as of individual candidates. I shall cite a hypothetical case to illustrate my point. I suggest that three candidates are selected to represent the Labour party. These are to be grouped. Our party nominates them as our group. There i9 1 nothing in this measure, however, which will prevent a dozen other candidates from describing themselves also as Labour nominees, and from being included in our group. dates whose names are in a group must agree to the inclusion of all those who desire to have their names placed in that group. Ample provision can provided for, I shall refrain from further criticism until the' measure is discussed in Committee. PAGE) adjourned. MEAT EXPORT BOUNTIES BILL .
