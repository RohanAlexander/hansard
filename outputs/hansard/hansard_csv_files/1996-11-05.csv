233,7291 & 7292 = 16 Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honCOOK 2 MITCHELL 1 EDEN-MONARO 6 NTH SYDNEY 2 (5) The size of the population in a given area is less significant in determining Medicare office location than claiming pattern data. Assumptions can be made to establish a possible raw catchment, but this will not necessarily reflect where or whether those people present cash claims. The population figures below have been derived from the 1991 census data. For the purpose of responding to this question, the catchment area used to calculate metropolitan population is a 5km radius from the Medicare office and for country is a 50km radius from the Medicare office. Where Medicare offices are located within close proximity to each other, persons may be included in more than one catchment area. The average population size for metropolitan areas serviced by Medicare offices (133) is approximately 107,000. The average population size for country areas serviced by Medicare offices (136) is approximately 54,000.
